## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postpartum mastitis antibiotic management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical spectrum and when antibiotics are actually indicated. Then, I should verify first-line antibiotic choices, dosing, and duration. Next, I will consider MRSA risk and second-line options. After that, I need to check supportive care and when to obtain cultures or imaging. Finally, I will review special scenarios like abscess, recurrent mastitis, and infant safety, and close with a concise, practical algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical spectrum and the threshold for antibiotics, because I need to ensure we are not over-treating inflammation as infection. Most cases of lactational mastitis are inflammatory rather than infectious, so antibiotics should be reserved for bacterial mastitis or when there is no improvement after 24–48 hours of conservative therapy, with the cornerstone being effective milk removal and supportive care rather than routine antibiotics [^54143b48] [^5789906c] [^dbf05a02].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line antibiotic choices and dosing so I don't misstate anything. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommends dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days, with cephalexin 500 mg four times daily as an alternative that also covers gram-negative rods and does not need to be taken separately from meals; cloxacillin can be used if the others are unavailable, though bioavailability is more variable, and all have low relative infant dose, supporting breastfeeding continuation [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce].

> Hold on, I should verify MRSA risk and second-line options because community MRSA is a real concern in some settings. If there is no improvement after 48 hours of first-line therapy, prior MRSA history, high local MRSA prevalence, or severe infection, clindamycin 300 mg four times daily or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength twice daily are appropriate alternatives; TMP-SMX should be avoided in infants with G6PD deficiency and used cautiously in premature infants or those with hyperbilirubinemia, and culture with susceptibilities should guide therapy when possible [^e49af5a8] [^59253dfc] [^b93cc21b].

> I need to ensure supportive care is explicit and evidence-aligned. Conservative management for 24–48 hours with NSAIDs, ice, and continued breastfeeding or milk expression is recommended; heat and aggressive massage are discouraged because they can worsen edema and tissue trauma, and addressing hyperlactation or oversupply reduces recurrence risk; rooming-in and physiologic breastfeeding are preferred over routine pumping when feasible [^e0639018] [^17a4a355] [^ff30e258] [^0eb61dc8].

> Let me consider when to escalate diagnostics, because I should confirm we are not missing abscess or resistant organisms. If there is no improvement after 48 hours of appropriate therapy, recurrent episodes, or immunocompromised hosts, obtain a milk culture and consider ultrasound to evaluate for abscess; early cultures are also reasonable in NICU mothers, healthcare workers in high-MRSA settings, or those with recurrent infections to tailor therapy and detect resistant pathogens [^59253dfc] [^e49af5a8] [^dbf05a02].

> Next, I should review abscess management, since source control changes outcomes. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration with culture is first-line for lactational abscess, often requiring serial aspirations; incision and drainage is reserved for refractory cases, and breastfeeding can continue from the affected breast unless the infant's mouth contacts purulent drainage; antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though shorter may suffice if cellulitis resolves quickly, and mothers should be counseled on the low risk of milk fistula with appropriate drainage [^3a8982a8] [^e2f53b21] [^9f4b940f] [^28d2bd21].

> But wait, what if the presentation is recurrent or atypical; I should double-check the approach. For recurrent mastitis, evaluate breastfeeding technique, pumping practices, and consider milk culture to distinguish true infection from inflammatory flares; avoid prophylactic antibiotics because they are ineffective and promote resistance; consider probiotics such as Lactobacillus salivarius or L. fermentum as adjuncts, recognizing emerging but still limited evidence; and if recurrences localize to the same quadrant, image to exclude mass or granulomatous disease and maintain vigilance for inflammatory breast cancer when the course is atypical [^770538f3] [^52467899] [^d49a02ba] [^3983cdf5].

> I should confirm infant safety and lactation compatibility so counseling is accurate. Breastfeeding is safe and encouraged during maternal mastitis, including from the affected breast, unless the infant's mouth would contact purulent drainage; antibiotics commonly used for mastitis have low relative infant dose and are compatible with continued nursing, and abrupt weaning can worsen milk stasis and symptoms [^207b2899] [^5e18e9a7] [^b4383507].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with conservative therapy and milk removal; if no improvement in 24–48 hours or if there is severe infection, start narrow-spectrum therapy with dicloxacillin or cephalexin for 10–14 days; if no response after 48 hours or MRSA risk is present, switch to clindamycin or TMP-SMX and obtain culture; if abscess is suspected, obtain ultrasound and perform needle aspiration with culture; if recurrent, evaluate technique and consider culture, probiotics, and imaging as indicated, avoiding routine prophylactic antibiotics [^54143b48] [^b93cc21b] [^59253dfc] [^3a8982a8] [^770538f3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics in all cases; I should emphasize the evidence gap. The Cochrane reviews conclude there is insufficient high-quality evidence to confirm or refute routine antibiotic use for lactational mastitis, reinforcing the principle to reserve antibiotics for bacterial disease or treatment failure after conservative care, which aligns with modern guideline-based practice [^a98b61b8] [^7f968fa7] [^54143b48].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that this aligns with the highest-quality sources: antibiotics are not first-line for lactational mastitis; reserve them for bacterial mastitis or when symptoms persist despite 24–48 hours of optimized milk removal and supportive care, choose narrow-spectrum agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin for 10–14 days, escalate to MRSA-active therapy when indicated, and prioritize source control for abscess while maintaining breastfeeding whenever possible [^54143b48] [^b93cc21b] [^3a8982a8] [^5e18e9a7].

Postpartum mastitis is best managed with **conservative care first** (frequent breastfeeding or milk removal, NSAIDs, ice, and rest) [^e0639018] [^17a4a355] [^dbf05a02]. Antibiotics are reserved for **bacterial mastitis** or if there is no improvement after 24–48 hours of conservative therapy [^54143b48] [^5789906c]. First-line antibiotics are **dicloxacillin or cephalexin** for 10–14 days; use clindamycin or TMP-SMX if MRSA is suspected or for penicillin allergy [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce]. Continue breastfeeding during treatment; **no evidence supports routine probiotics** for treatment or prevention [^207b2899] [^c4117a61]. If an abscess is present, obtain ultrasound and perform needle aspiration with culture; reserve incision and drainage for refractory cases [^3a8982a8] [^e2f53b21].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Postpartum mastitis typically presents with:

- **Localized breast pain**: Often accompanied by erythema, swelling, and warmth [^dbf05a02].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, malaise, and flu-like symptoms [^7f7a14d2].
- **Milk stasis**: Commonly associated with ineffective milk removal or blocked ducts [^1aea0a8b].

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, based on characteristic signs and symptoms. Laboratory tests or imaging are not routinely required but may be considered in severe, recurrent, or atypical cases [^dbf05a02].

---

## Initial management: conservative measures

Conservative management is the cornerstone of treatment and should be initiated promptly:

- **Frequent breastfeeding or milk removal**: Continue breastfeeding or express milk regularly to relieve milk stasis and prevent progression [^058566c1].
- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain and inflammation [^e0639018].
- **Ice application**: Apply ice packs to reduce swelling and discomfort [^e0639018].
- **Rest and hydration**: Encourage adequate rest and fluid intake [^notfound].

These measures are effective in **most cases** and should be continued for 24–48 hours before considering antibiotics [^dbf05a02].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Bacterial mastitis**: Suspected or confirmed bacterial infection, particularly with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or malaise [^54143b48].
- **Lack of improvement**: No clinical improvement after 24–48 hours of conservative therapy [^notfound].
- **Severe presentation**: Severe infection, immunocompromised patients, or suspected MRSA [^e49af5a8].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

First-line antibiotic therapy includes:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dicloxacillin | 500 mg orally four times daily | 10–14 days | First-line agent; effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce] |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally four times daily | 10–14 days | Alternative first-line agent; broader coverage including gram-negative rods [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce] |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg orally four times daily | 10–14 days | Second-line agent for MRSA or penicillin allergy [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | Double-strength tablets orally twice daily | 10–14 days | Second-line agent for MRSA; avoid in infants with G6PD deficiency or premature infants [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce] |

---

## Safety of breastfeeding during antibiotic therapy

Breastfeeding should be **continued during antibiotic treatment**, as most antibiotics used for mastitis are compatible with lactation and have minimal risk to the infant [^207b2899] [^5e18e9a7]. Only in rare cases — such as when the mother is severely ill or the antibiotic is contraindicated for the infant — should breastfeeding be temporarily suspended [^2fcbf996].

---

## Role of probiotics

Probiotics have been explored as an alternative or adjunctive therapy for mastitis. However, current evidence is **limited and inconsistent**, and routine use of probiotics for treatment or prevention of mastitis is not recommended [^c4117a61] [^dbf05a02].

---

## Management of complications

### Breast abscess

If a breast abscess is suspected or confirmed, obtain **ultrasound imaging** and perform **needle aspiration** with culture and sensitivity testing [^3a8982a8] [^e2f53b21]. Incision and drainage are reserved for refractory cases or when needle aspiration fails [^3a8982a8]. Continue breastfeeding or milk expression unless purulent drainage is present [^9f4b940f].

---

### Recurrent mastitis

For recurrent mastitis, evaluate breastfeeding technique, milk removal efficiency, and underlying risk factors such as hyperlactation or mammary dysbiosis [^770538f3]. Consider **milk culture** to identify resistant organisms or MRSA, and avoid prophylactic antibiotics due to lack of efficacy and risk of resistance [^52467899] [^770538f3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Conservative management**: Initiate frequent milk removal, NSAIDs, ice, and rest as first-line therapy [^e0639018] [^17a4a355].
- **Antibiotics**: Reserve for bacterial mastitis or lack of improvement after 24–48 hours of conservative therapy [^54143b48] [^5789906c].
- **First-line antibiotics**: Dicloxacillin or cephalexin for 10–14 days; use clindamycin or TMP-SMX for MRSA or penicillin allergy [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce].
- **Breastfeeding**: Continue during antibiotic therapy unless contraindicated [^207b2899] [^5e18e9a7].
- **Abscess management**: Use ultrasound and needle aspiration; reserve incision and drainage for refractory cases [^3a8982a8] [^e2f53b21].

Effective management of postpartum mastitis requires a **balanced approach**, prioritizing conservative measures and reserving antibiotics for confirmed bacterial infection or lack of improvement. This strategy minimizes unnecessary antibiotic use, supports continued breastfeeding, and reduces the risk of complications.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^a98b61b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Interventions for preventing mastitis after childbirth [^cb08af06]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding, initiation and duration rates continue to fall short of international guidelines. Many factors influence a woman's decision to wean; the main reason cited for weaning is associated with lactation complications, such as mastitis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of preventive strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2009), EMBASE (1974 to November 2009), CINAHL (1981 to November 2009), MIDIRS (1971 to November 2009), IPA (1970 to November 2009), AMED (1985 to November 2009) and LILACS (1982 to November 2009).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing mastitis in postpartum breastfeeding women.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently identified relevant studies and assessed the trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data and information as appropriate.

Main Results

We included five trials (involving 960 women). In three trials of 471 women, we found no significant differences in the incidence of mastitis between use of antibiotics and no antibiotics (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61; or in one trial of 99 women comparing two doses (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.02 to 9.18). We found no significant differences for mastitis in three trials of specialist breastfeeding education with usual care (one trial); anti-secretory factor cereal (one trial); and mupirocin, fusidic acid ointment or breastfeeding advice (one trial).Generally we found no differences in any of the trials for breastfeeding initiation or duration; or symptoms of mastitis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to show effectiveness of any of the interventions, including breastfeeding education, pharmacological treatments and alternative therapies, regarding the occurrence of mastitis or breastfeeding exclusivity and duration. While studies reported the incidence of mastitis, they all used different interventions. Caution needs to be applied when considering the findings of this review as the conclusion is based on studies, often with small sample sizes. An urgent need for further adequately powered research is needed into this area to conclusively determine the effectiveness of these interventions.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^4fe7fa51]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to use narrow-spectrum antibotics targeted to the most common associated bacteria (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) if antibiotic therapy is used for acute bacterial mastitis.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^dbf05a02]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

Bacterial mastitis management—antibiotic selection, dosage, and duration are outlined in Box 1, and it is safe for children to consume milk from a breast with bacterial mastitis; routine hospital admission and IV antibiotics are not necessary unless known multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) or clinical presentation mandates (e.g., severe sepsis or inability to take oral medication/fluids), noting some MDRO may be treatable using oral antibiotics and antibiotic choice should be driven by culture data or local antibiogram; if admission is necessary, mother and infant should be kept rooming in together and allowed to continue to breastfeed on demand; consider intravenous fluid administration if oral intake is suboptimal; if there is no symptomatic improvement after 48 hours of first-line therapy, consider a milk culture for resistant and/or less common pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), consider local susceptibility and resistance patterns and proceed to empiric therapy, and consider early milk culture for mothers expressing milk for an immunocompromised infant in the neonatal intensive care unit, health care workers in an area with a high prevalence of MRSA, and patients with recurrent infections; data regarding probiotics continue to emerge and probiotics have been shown not to alter composition of the human milk microbiome; levels of evidence: 2–3, strength of recommendations: C.

ABM Clinical Protocol #36—areas for future research in mastitis emphasize that clinical studies on mastitis and related disorders are limited by study design and confounding factors and that nipple trauma appearing to be a cause of mastitis likely represents an association rather than a causation. It adds that nipple trauma is a frequent sequela of hyperlactation, which is a risk factor for mastitis, and that higher quality studies are needed to determine precise recommendations regarding antibiotics and to clarify prevalence of bacterial mastitis versus engorgement and/or inflammatory mastitis given telephone triage prescribing practices. The protocol also states that even small quantities of antibiotics in human milk alters the diversity and resilience of the human milk microbiome, that the use of probiotics warrants further research, and that as women in the peripartum period are at their lifetime highest risk for developing an anxiety or mood disorder, the distinction between symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders versus mastitis should also be explored.

Breastfeeding during maternal infections and mastitis—breastfeeding is encouraged when mothers have infectious illnesses, and “Hand hygiene and covering the nose and mouth with a mask is recommended when the mother is breastfeeding directly.” Mastitis management notes that “Mastitis occurs in one third of women postpartum,” mothers are encouraged to continue breastfeeding, “Regular feeding or expression of milk is an adjunct to other treatment,” “Antibiotics may be indicated,” and “Approximately 10% of cases progress to breast abscesses, which require drainage,” with breastfeeding allowed on the affected side if “the infant’s mouth does not contact purulent drainage.” For infectious disease guidance, “A pediatric infectious disease specialist, the AAP Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, or the CDC Web site should be consulted.”

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^4c8735cd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis and accompanying pain have been associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast and may be a result of decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection. Mastitis affects up to one in five breastfeeding women with most episodes occurring in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum. Antibiotics are often used in the treatment of mastitis, but have not been popular or proven effective as a preventative agent. The WHO has highlighted significant concerns relating to adverse harms of antibiotic use with the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of disease organisms. Increasing research suggests that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. While animal studies have shown promising results in the use of probiotics for preventing mastitis, their use in human trials has had limited investigation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral probiotics for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women.

Methods

APProve (C A n P robiotics Im Prove Breastfeeding Outcomes?) is a double-blind randomised controlled trial designed to assess outcomes between breastfeeding women ingesting a probiotic versus a placebo daily for 8 weeks following birth. A total of 600 women (300 to each arm) who intend to breastfeed will be randomised after the birth of a term, healthy infant. Daily and weekly surveys for 8 weeks and follow-up surveys at 2, 6 and 12 months after birth will assess the primary outcome of mastitis in the first 8 weeks following birth as well as secondary maternal outcomes of breastfeeding duration (total/partial), antibiotic use, maternal health and well-being, and treatment compliance; and infant outcomes including gastroenteritis, infant health and well-being and growth and development. The acceptability and compliance using a novel mobile phone application system will also be evaluated.

Discussion

There is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing mastitis in breastfeeding women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may also increase breastfeeding duration, providing long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children. Decreased antibiotic usage also benefits the community and health system.

### Mastitis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the calm before the storm? [^828746b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Post-partum mastitis is a common infection in breastfeeding women, with an incidence of 9.5-16% in recent literature. Over the past decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a significant pathogen in soft-tissue infections presenting to the emergency department. The incidence of mastitis caused by MRSA is unknown at this time, but likely increasing.

Objectives

We review the data on prevention and treatment of mastitis and address recent literature demonstrating increases in MRSA infections in the post-partum population and how we should change our practices in light of this emerging pathogen.

Case Report

We present a case of simple mastitis in a health care worker who failed to improve until treated with antibiotics appropriate for a MRSA infection.

Conclusion

Recent evidence suggests that just as MRSA has become the prominent pathogen in other soft-tissue infections, mastitis is now increasingly caused by this pathogen. Physicians caring for patients with mastitis need to be aware of this bacteriologic shift to treat appropriately.

Mastitis and milk removal—Early recognition and treatment may prevent complications, such as breast abscess, sepsis, and early weaning, and milk stasis is often the initiating factor with the most important management step being frequent and effective milk removal during the treatment. A patient may experience a decrease in her milk supply that usually will improve once she begins to recover, as long as she continues to breastfeed or adequately express her breast milk. Women should be reassured that the antibiotics and antiinflammatory medications used to treat mastitis are safe for infants. Unless otherwise indicated, the patient should be encouraged to either continue breastfeeding her baby or to express her milk. If there is no clinical response to antibiotics, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or an abscess should be considered, and untreated abscess can result in maternal sepsis.

Mastitis—definition, outpatient antibiotics, and duration: The clinical definition of mastitis is a tender, hot, swollen, wedge-shaped area of the breast associated with a fever, chills, flu-like aching, and systemic illness, and most women diagnosed with mastitis can be treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Preferred antibiotics are usually penicillinase-resistant penicillin, such as dicloxacillin, 500 mg four times per day; alternatively, cephalexin 500 mg four times a day or clindamycin 300 mg four times a day may be used if the patient has a penicillin allergy. A patient should be asked about a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in herself or in members of her household, and a 10–14-day course of antibiotics usually is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence from suboptimally treated mastitis.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome will be defined as the incidence of mastitis up to 8 weeks following birth as measured by:
Clinical diagnosis of mastitis OR
At least two of the following breast symptoms: pain, redness/inflammation, lump/swelling AND at least one of the following systemic symptoms: flu-like symptoms (body aches, headaches and chills) or fever ≥38°C. These symptoms must be present for at least 24 h.

Secondary maternal outcomes will include breastfeeding duration (total/partial), recurrence of mastitis, development of breast abscess, cracked nipples, use of antibiotics, overall maternal health and well-being, breastfeeding support, number of doctor’s visits for probable mastitis, overall doctor’s visits, adverse effects of treatment, and incidence of primary mastitis between 2 and 6 months postpartum. Maternal lifestyle factors which may affect breastfeeding outcomes will also be assessed. Acceptability and compliance of the trial product and the APProve-Lite system will also be examined as well as preference for method of postnatal questionnaires.

Secondary infant outcomes will include growth (height and weight) and well-being in the first year of life (measured at 2, 6 and 12 months as assessed via self-report of health conditions including infections (gastrointestinal, respiratory), doctor’s visits, admission to hospital, allergic reactions and/or use of antibiotics.

Background

Breastfeeding has been consistently shown to be protective against a broad range of immediate and long term infant and maternal health outcomes. International guidelines recommend exclusive breastfeeding for all babies in the first 6 months of life as it provides the best nutritional start for infants and promotes their healthy growth and development. Given the positive benefits of breastfeeding, it is of concern that the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Health Survey reported less than 15% of women exclusively breastfeeding at 5 months of age, despite a 96% initiation rate at birth. These findings suggest that more resources and research are required to identify and treat the underlying causes of breastfeeding cessation in order to extend the overall duration and improve long term maternal and child health outcomes.

Mastitis and the pain associated with the condition have been shown to be associated with the cessation of breastfeeding. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mastitis as an inflammatory condition of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. It occurs in 15–21% of breastfeeding mothers in Australia. Most episodes occur in the first 6–8 weeks postpartum but can occur at any time during breastfeeding. Almost one-third of women experience a recurrent episode, and up to 3% of women with mastitis develop a breast abscess, often necessitating hospitalisation.

Little is known about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this common condition. Though not well described, the risk factors appear to be associated with milk stasis, nipple damage and maternal fatigue. Cracked nipples may facilitate entrance of microorganisms through the skin, and incomplete emptying of the breasts may result in milk stasis which provides a susceptible and receptive culture media for microorganisms. Decreased immunity and a lowered resistance to infection may be a result of maternal fatigue [,–]. Other risk factors include a history of mastitis with a previous child, using an antifungal nipple cream and using a manual breast pump.

Current management of mastitis generally centers on symptom management (i.e. applying hot/cold compresses, analgesics), encouragement of the continuation of breastfeeding (including fully emptying the affected breast, feeding more frequently, and changing feeding positions often), and antibiotic therapy. A Cochrane review examining the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in treating symptoms of mastitis in breastfeeding women showed a trend towards a benefit of treatment, but only 2 trials were included and were of limited quality, with one conducted over 30 years ago. As such, authors deduced there was insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the use of antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis.

The use of probiotic bacteria during pregnancy and postpartum has also been proposed as a means of modulating maternal infection or inflammatory processes and to support immune development in the infant. Breastfed infants of mothers who consumed specific probiotics in the early postpartum period reported fewer gastrointestinal symptoms, while risk of atopic eczema, allergy and asthma was shown to confer some benefit during the first 2 years of life by some studies, but not in others. Further studies with longer follow-up and amongst specific maternal populations most likely to benefit from probiotics, have been recommended. Reassuringly, the probiotic studies that have been performed in postpartum women did not report any major side effects to the mother or infant. Maternal side effects of mild gas or bloating were occasionally noted.

To date, evidence suggests that probiotics may provide an effective measure and alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of lactational mastitis and that postpartum use may also confer additional benefit to the infant. Thus, the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women should be evaluated.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^b5b91110]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A small, non-blinded, RCT (randomised controlled trial) had reported that oral antibiotics reduced the incidence of mastitis in lactating women with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- colonized cracked nipples. We aimed to replicate the study with a more rigorous design and adequate sample size.

Methods

Our intention was to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if an antibiotic (flucloxacillin) could prevent mastitis in lactating women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples. We planned to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus- colonized cracked nipples.

Results

We spent over twelve months submitting applications to five hospital ethics committees and seven funding bodies, before commencing the trial. Recruitment to the trial was very slow and only ten women were randomized to the trial after twelve months, and therefore the trial was stopped early.

Conclusions

In retrospect we should have conducted a feasibility study, which would have revealed the low number of women in these Melbourne hospitals (maternity wards and breastfeeding clinics) with damaged nipples. The appropriate use of antibiotics for breastfeeding women with cracked nipples still needs to be tested.

Lactational breast abscess—drain the abscess to achieve source control, with needle aspiration with fluid culture and sensitivity often recommended as the first-line intervention for lactational abscess; however, patients most often require recurrent aspirations and drain placement as the initial intervention should be considered for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction, and vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be strictly avoided. After aspiration or drain placement, mothers should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast, with milk fistula rate <2%, and antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though a shorter course may be appropriate if cellulitis resolves rapidly. Tissue inflammation and phlegmonous changes may persist for several weeks; patients should undergo interval examination and imaging to ensure resolution. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendations: C.

Discussion

Interventions that support prolonging breastfeeding duration have the potential to improve human health. Mastitis is a painful and debilitating complication of breastfeeding which affects 1 in 5 breastfeeding mothers. It is associated with early cessation of breastfeeding and, if severe, may lead to unwarranted hospital admissions for treatment of abscess often requiring treatment with antibiotics. At a time when we are experiencing the negative effects of antibiotic overuse, there is an urgent need to explore safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections such as mastitis in lactating women. This trial seeks to provide evidence for such an alternative in the form of probiotics, which may increase breastfeeding duration and potentially provide long-term health, cognitive and developmental benefits for children, as well as decrease antibiotic usage with benefits to the community and health system.

Pathophysiology of mastitis spectrum—mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland that most often presents in a segmental distribution of ducts, alveoli, and surrounding connective tissue, and ductal lumens can be narrowed by edema and hyperemia associated with hyperlactation as well as mammary dysbiosis. Mammary dysbiosis, or disruption of the milk microbiome, results from a complex interplay of factors including maternal genetics and medical conditions, exposure to antibiotics, use of probiotics, regular use of breast pumps, and Cesarean birth. Basic science research has demonstrated that multiple factors contribute to the development of mastitis and include host factors such as hyperlactation, microbial factors such as diversity of the milk microbiome, and medical factors such as antibiotic and probiotic use. Milk stasis has been postulated to be a potential initiating factor for mastitis, although scientific evidence has not proven a causation, and no evidence exists that specific foods cause mastitis. The lactating breast is a dynamic gland that responds to internal and external hormonal stimulation; the breast requires feedback inhibition to regulate milk production, and although reducing milk removal may transiently increase pain and erythema from alveolar distention and vascular congestion, it ultimately prevents future episodes as feedback inhibitor of lactation and other regulatory hormones decrease milk production. Mothers who experience persistent high milk production despite eliminating iatrogenic causes of excessive milk removal may require additional pharmacological treatment of hyperlactation.

Recurrent mastitis—Examine patients and obtain milk culture to establish a diagnosis of true recurrent mastitis rather than treating empirically, as breast milk culture can identify and provide sensitivities of uncommon pathogens and resistant bacteria; MRSA and resistant CoNS will not respond to typical antibiotics used for acute mastitis such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin. Ensure resolution of bacterial mastitis with follow-up examination, evaluate breastfeeding and/or pumping for risk factors, and consider daily probiotic use with L. fermentum or, preferably, L. salivarius for prevention. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to be effective in the prevention of mastitis and may select antibiotic-resistant strains. Multiple recurrences in the same location warrants radiology evaluation to rule out an underlying mass or other abnormality such as granulomatous mastitis; any concern for inflammatory breast cancer, which can present with progressive erythema, breast retraction, and peau d’orange appearance, warrants urgent referral to breast surgery and oncology. Levels of evidence: 1–3. Strength of recommendations: B–C.

The underlying biological pathogenesis of mastitis is important when considering management options. Mastitis is characterised by the presence of the main aetiological agents of infection, staphylococci and streptococcal organisms. The mastitis causing strains, mainly staphylococcus aureus and streptocococcus epidermidis usually display two common properties; resistance to antibiotics and a high ability to form biofilms, which may explain their resistance to a wide range of antibiotic therapies and resultant recurrence of disease. A recent WHO report outlines the growing public health concern related to antimicrobial resistance. The report stresses that resistance of common bacteria to antimicrobial drugs has reached alarming levels, with available options for treating infections becoming increasingly ineffective. Further, authors stress the importance of actively seeking safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics.

Probiotics, with their increasing recognition and use in recent years, may provide one such alternative. Probiotics are live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts are thought to confer a beneficial effect to the host. Research indicates that specific probiotic bacteria possess significant anti-inflammatory properties comparable to a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent and supports their potential use as immunomodulatory agents. Given the gut microbiota is a critical stimulus for the adequate maturation and function of the immune system, oral administration of probiotics to women during the early postnatal period to modulate microbiota composition is thought to provide an effective dietary strategy to reduce the risk of infection and disease.

Clinicians will learn to differentiate mastitis from other breast conditions and apply evidence-based guidelines for appropriate management. The activity will emphasize the importance of continuing breastfeeding during mastitis, early recognition of abscess formation, and educating patients on preventive measures to reduce mastitis incidence. An interprofessional approach will be highlighted to improve healthcare outcomes. Objectives:
- Identify risk factors for acute mastitis.
- Differentiate the clinical features of each type of mastitis.
- Implement evidence-based treatment strategies for each type of acute mastitis.
- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by acute mastitis. Introduction Acute mastitis is an inflammation of the breast, most commonly occurring in breastfeeding women as lactational mastitis, although it can also present in non-lactating individuals.

Lactational mastitis, typically arising from milk stasis and bacterial infection through damaged skin, usually manifests within the first 6 weeks postpartum. Symptoms include localized redness, pain, swelling, and sometimes systemic signs like fever. Management often involves self-care measures, though antibiotics are used when infections are more severe. . Evaluation of acute mastitis typically involves breast imaging, histopathological examination, and bacterial culture to help differentiate the underlying etiology and guide treatment. Acute mastitis management varies based on the cause of the inflammatory process. PDM is primarily treated with surgical excision of the infected tissue, while GLM management comprises observation, antibiotics, steroid therapy, and immunosuppressive drugs, as well as surgery in refractory cases. Lactational mastitis is typically treated with supportive therapies and antibiotics. .

Lactational and nonlactational mastitis can lead to breast abscesses if untreated. This complication, more frequent in lactating women but also seen in smokers and those with higher body weight, requires timely medical attention to prevent further infection and may involve antibiotic therapy or drainage procedures. Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "Breast Abscess, " for further information on the diagnosis and management of this condition. The underlying causes of lactational mastitis are multifactorial. One potential contributor is the disruption of the breast microbiome, known as mammary dysbiosis, which may involve an imbalance of bacteria rather than a straightforward infection. Pathogenic bacteria are more frequently isolated from women with mastitis, but these bacteria are also present in healthy milk microbiomes, making their role complex.

Nipple trauma can facilitate bacterial entry, but studies show that many women with mastitis do not have visible nipple damage. This evidence suggests that mastitis is not solely caused by retrograde bacterial spread through nipple cracks. Instead, a disrupted milk microbiome, influenced by factors like antibiotics, probiotics, hyperlactation, ductal narrowing, and the mechanical stress of breastfeeding, contributes to this inflammatory condition. . Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic organisms, others have reported sterile lesions, suggesting that immune responses following bacterial infiltration may play a more prominent role than the infection itself. Immune dysregulation, particularly mediated by T helper cells, likely amplifies the inflammation in PDM. . The development of mastitis involves both host and microbial factors. Milk stasis is widely regarded as a trigger, though not definitively proven as a causal factor.

Optimal management for the prevention of mastitis is not known. A Cochrane review specifically aimed to assess the effects of preventative strategies for mastitis and the subsequent effect on breastfeeding duration also showed insufficient evidence as to the effectiveness of a range of interventions. These interventions included education on breastfeeding, changes in breastfeeding habits, hot/cold packs, relaxation techniques, and use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrence. Only three trials examining the effect of antibiotics were included and although no significant difference in the incidence of mastitis was found, a trend towards a reduced effect was reported (risk ratio (RR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.61). When one of the trials amongst HIV infected women was excluded, the two remaining studies reported a 67% and 76% reduction in mastitis with antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively. However, all trials were inadequately powered or prematurely stopped due to concerns related to the adverse harms of antibiotic use, issues related to side effects, patient compliance, and attitudes. The review concluded that the use of antibiotics in the absence of clear indications resulted in no benefit and could lead to harm, not just for the participants, but in the production of antibiotic-resistant strains of the organisms. Authors of the Cochrane review recommended future studies should consider implementation of strategies to improve adherence such as extended consultation time with participants when recruiting participants to explain and reinforce instruction; designing interventions such as tailoring drug regimens to patient lifestyle; frequent follow up when initialising or changing treatment regimes; and the use of reminder calls and alerts to keep participants focused.

Nonlactational mastitis includes conditions like periductal mastitis and idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, both of which are chronic inflammatory diseases. PDM affects the ducts near the nipple and is often seen in younger women, while IGM, a rare form of inflammation resembling cancer, is characterized by granulomas primarily within lobular tissue, mainly in women within 5 years of childbirth. These nonlactational forms can be challenging to diagnose due to similar symptoms, yet they differ in treatment needs, making accurate diagnosis crucial to avoid complications. Evaluation of acute mastitis typically involves breast imaging, histopathological examination, and bacterial culture to help differentiate the underlying etiology and guide treatment. Acute mastitis management varies based on the cause of the inflammatory process.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^84e7afe5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this case–control investigation was to identify factors associated with mastitis, including potential risk or protective factors. Among them, the separation of the infant from his mother longer than 24 h after birth due to hospitalization or for any other reason increased the risk of mastitis. This highlights the crucial importance of the first postnatal hours for establishing mother-infant interaction. Among other aspects of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, Caesarean delivery and antibiotherapy during delivery as well as the use of epidural analgesia in labor were more frequently reported by mothers with mastitis, although these factors were not included in the final model obtained after the multivariable analysis. In this sense, a negative association between Caesarean delivery and breastfeeding exists because postoperative care routines delay the onset of lactation, disrupt mother-infant interaction and inhibit infant suckling. Peripartum antibiotherapy has emerged as a strong risk factor for human mastitis because it induces the selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the mammary gland and the elimination of potential competitors. Antibiotics also affect vaginal and intestinal microbiota of the mother and the development of intestinal microbiota in the infant. The link between epidural intrapartum analgesia and breastfeeding difficulties has also been debated [-], but there are not conclusive evidences and further studies are required.

6. Women who report the use of hydrogel dressings in the postpartum period are more likely to develop mastitis compared to women who do not use these dressings;

7. Women who report a greater time between feeds are more likely to develop mastitis;

8. Women reporting nipple damage on the tip of their nipple are more likely to develop mastitis than women reporting no damage, or reporting damage elsewhere on the nipple;

9. Women administered antibiotics in labour or postpartum are more likely to develop nipple and breast candidiasis than women not treated with antibiotics during these periods.

Pre-specified study hypotheses for the psychological components of CASTLE are:

1. Women reporting two or more physical symptoms on at least two occasions between one and four weeks postpartum will have measurably worse psychological outcomes on two standardised assessments of maternal mood at four and eight weeks postpartum after adjusting for known determinants of poor maternal mood (lower antenatal mood, insufficient partner support, prior history of mood disturbance, personality style, and infant factors);

2. Women reporting breastfeeding problems (including mastitis, nipple/breast pain, low milk supply) will have measurably worse psychological outcomes on two standardised assessments of maternal mood at four and eight weeks postpartum after adjusting for known determinants of poor maternal mood (lower antenatal mood, insufficient partner support, prior history of mood disturbance, personality style, and infant factors);

3. Women reporting nipple or breast pain (> 5/10 on the pain scale) on two or more occasions, will have more psychological symptoms at the time of the nipple/breast pain than those experiencing less pain (≤ 5/10), or those reporting pain at only one study interval;

4. Women with mastitis will have more psychological symptoms at the data collection point at the time of the episode/immediately following the episode than those reporting no mastitis;

5. Women who have had breastfeeding problems resolved will have better mood scores than those unresolved at eight weeks;

6. Women continuing to breastfeed at eight weeks will have better mood scores than women not breastfeeding.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^ddfddbb2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Another relevant factor associated with mastitis was the use of antibiotics during breastfeeding. In fact, widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics is leading to increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance among mastitis-causing agents [-]. On the other hand, biofilm formation is an important virulence factor of the strains implicated in mastitis, taking in account that the penetration capacity through bacterial biofilms depends on each antibiotic. Resistance to antibiotics and ability to form biofilms are common findings among mastitis-causing strains and may explain the often recurrent nature of this infectious condition. This fact emphasizes the need of a milk culture and antibiogram for a rational treatment of mastitis. Widespread antibiotic therapy used to treat throat infections could also affect the mammary gland microbiota and lead to mastitis. Conversely, broad range antibiotics to treat mastitis are linked to a variety of adverse effects, including urinary infections and vaginal candidiasis. Microbial habitats in the human body, including the skin, constitute a network of interrelated communities. This could explain why pathogens involved in throat and urinary infections may spread to the mammary gland and those implicated in mastitis development may spread to throat and urinary tract. In this work, the bivariate analysis revealed that urinary and skin infections were also more frequent among breastfeeding mothers with mastitis. Interestingly, anemia was also more common in the group of women with mastitis, since women suffering from anemia might be more vulnerable to infections. In addition, iron supplements enhance growth and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus and other mastitis-associated species ; as a consequence, women receiving them may also be more prone to mastitis. No clinical trials have evaluated the impact of iron supplementation on mastitis but the study of iron acquisition pathways seems to be a good target to define the underlying mechanisms of mastitis severity.

### Treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation: antibiotics versus oral administration of lactobacilli isolated from breast milk [^5f03b28d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis is a common infectious disease during lactation, and the main etiological agents are staphylococci, streptococci, and/or corynebacteria. The efficacy of oral administration of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 or Lactobacillus salivarius CECT5713, two lactobacilli strains isolated from breast milk, to treat lactational mastitis was evaluated and was compared with the efficacy of antibiotic therapy.

Methods

In this study, 352 women with infectious mastitis were randomly assigned to 3 groups. Women in groups A (n = 124) and B (n = 127]) ingested daily 9 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) of L. fermentum CECT5716 or L. salivarius CECT5713, respectively, for 3 weeks, whereas those in group C (n =101) received the antibiotic therapy prescribed in their respective primary care centers. Results. On day 0, the mean bacterial counts in milk samples of the 3 groups were similar (4.35-4.47 log(10) CFU/mL), and lactobacilli could not be detected. On day 21, the mean bacterial counts in the probiotic groups (2.61 and 2.33 log(10) CFU/mL) were lower than that of the control group (3.28 log(10) CFU/mL). L. fermentum CECT5716 and L. salivarius CECT5713 were isolated from the milk samples of women in the probiotic groups A and B, respectively. Women assigned to the probiotic groups improved more and had lower recurrence of mastitis than those assigned to the antibiotic group. Conclusions. The use of L. fermentum CECT5716 or L. salivarius CECT5713 appears to be an efficient alternative to the use of commonly prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of infectious mastitis during lactation.

### Case-control study of risk factors for infectious mastitis in Spanish breastfeeding women [^cba78de1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to identify potential predisposing factors associated with human infectious mastitis.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study among breastfeeding women, with 368 cases (women with mastitis) and 148 controls. Data were collected by a questionnaire designed to obtain retrospective information about several factors related to medical history of mother and infant, different aspects of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum, and breastfeeding practices that could be involved in mastitis. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression model were used to examine the relationship between mastitis and these factors.

Results

The variables significantly- and independently-associated with mastitis were cracked nipples (P<0.0001), oral antibiotics during breastfeeding (P<0.0001), breast pumps (P<0.0001), topical antifungal medication during breastfeeding (P=0.0009), mastitis in previous lactations (P=0.0014), breast milk coming in later than 24 h postpartum (P=0.0016), history of mastitis in the family (P=0.0028), mother-infant separation longer than 24 h (P=0.0027), cream on nipples (P=0.0228) and throat infection (P=0.0224).

Conclusions

Valuable factors related to an increased risk of infectious mastitis have been identified. This knowledge will allow practitioners to provide appropriate management advice about modifiable risk factors, such as the use of pumps or inappropriate medication. They also could identify before delivery those women at an increased risk of developing mastitis, such as those having a familial history of mastitis, and thus develop strategies to prevent this condition.

### Study protocol: evaluation of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 for the prevention of mastitis in breastfeeding women: a randomised controlled trial [^e608eecc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Data collection

To assess the comparability of the study groups, baseline demographic and medical information will be collected at the time of entry into the study. The baseline assessment will include maternal age, socio-demographic data, smoking and alcohol use, infections during pregnancy, allergies, use of vitamins/supplements/probiotics in the previous month, history of prior pregnancies and lactations including previous mastitis and breastfeeding duration, and recent use of antibiotics. This information will be obtained from the participant and/or her medical record.

At the time of discharge, data related to the birth and infant feeding will be collected to evaluate the impact of events and outcomes around the time of birth on infant feeding practices. This information will be ascertained from both the participant and medical records and will include site, gestation at birth, mode of birth, antibiotics during labour, birth or postpartum, complications of birth, length of hospital stay and initiation of infant feeding. Baseline infant data on general characteristics and well-being will also be collected. This will include information on infant sex, birthweight, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, resuscitation and any morbidity and will be obtained from the infant’s medical record.

Follow-up questionnaires will be used to evaluate long term maternal and infant secondary outcomes as detailed above with timing and method of collected data presented in Table 1.

Adverse event reporting

Adverse event

Side effects of the probiotic will be collected via the 2-month questionnaire. Mild gas and bloating are the only known reported side effects of Lactobacillus fermentum. Reported incidents will be reported to the DMC for review.

Serious adverse event

Any maternal or infant deaths will be reported to the ethics committee as required and reviewed by the DMC.

Suspected unsuspected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR)

We do not anticipate any SUSARs in relation to this trial.

Sample size

Given the lack of evidence related to the potential effect of probiotic use for the prevention of mastitis, we used the results from the comparable trials of antibiotics for the prevention of mastitis to determine effect sizes. Although the Cochrane review reported an overall 57% non-significant reduction in mastitis, with individual trials finding an up to 76% reduced risk, we chose a more conservative 50% reduction as a clinically meaningful treatment effect. Based on an expected rate of mastitis in the control group of 18%, two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, we estimated a total sample size of 452 would be required. However, given studies related to the duration of breastfeeding report a cessation rate in the first 8 weeks post-partum of up to 20%, and a potential loss-to follow-up of 5–10% may occur with withdrawals or non-compliance, we inflated the sample size by a further 30% to ensure complete data. Hence, we estimated a total sample size of approximately 600 women would be required (300 per group) for this trial, including all sites.

### Epidemiology of and surveillance for postpartum infections [^c53dba7f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We screened automated ambulatory medical records, hospital and emergency room claims, and pharmacy records of 2,826 health maintenance organization (HMO) members who gave birth over a 30-month period. Full-text ambulatory records were reviewed for the 30-day postpartum period to confirm infection status for a weighted sample of cases. The overall postpartum infection rate was 6.0%, with rates of 7.4% following cesarean section and 5.5% following vaginal delivery. Rehospitalization; cesarean delivery; antistaphylococcal antibiotics; diagnosis codes for mastitis, endometritis, and wound infection; and ambulatory blood or wound cultures were important predictors of infection. Use of automated information routinely collected by HMOs and insurers allows efficient identification of postpartum infections not detected by conventional surveillance.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^7673f846]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis is a common problem for breastfeeding women. Before planning a trial to reduce the number of lactating women who develop mastitis, we reviewed the literature to identify factors that may be associated with mastitis and to examine previous trials. A relatively small number of trials was identified which included mastitis as one of the outcome measures (see Table) [-]. Using historical controls, prophylactic topical penicillin ointment was found to be ineffective, while hand disinfectant at the mother's bedside appeared to reduce mastitis. A Finnish study examined "breast massage" (which appears to be a variation of "nipple toughening") and found no impact of this practice on mastitis.

Table 1 
Trials to prevent mastitis

The authors of one trial were convinced that their intervention was effective, despite methodological difficulties. Livingstone and Stringer conducted a randomised trial for women with cracked nipples with positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in Canada. They compared topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics and "optimal breastfeeding advice" and found better improvement in nipple healing in the women given oral antibiotics. In addition, they found 16 women out of 65 (25%) given non-systemic treatment developed mastitis within 7 days, compared to 1 of 19 women (5%) given systemic antibiotics (chi-square, p = 0.065) [not 0.005 as stated in their abstract]. The authors have concluded that cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus should be "treated aggressively with systemic antibiotics". However, the chi-square test used by the authors is inappropriate because one cell contains an expected value less than 5. Using Fisher's exact test, the p value is 0.10.

As the Livingstone and Stringer trial had been published in a major lactation journal and was likely to be very influential in practice, it needs to be replicated in a more rigorous manner in order to assess the usefulness and safety of the intervention. Our intention was to replicate that study with an adequate sample size, rigorous definitions of nipple damage and mastitis, and double blinding of the intervention.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^00376e50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious mastitis and abscess—organisms, empiric therapy, and cancer differential note that puerperal infectious mastitis most commonly is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with other causes including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and anaerobes. Skin-associated breast infections in nonlactating women can be treated empirically with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or, for penicillin allergy, erythromycin and metronidazole. If an abscess is suspected or symptoms do not resolve after empiric antibiotics, breast imaging should be performed and biopsy performed based on imaging; abscesses should be treated by aspiration or incision and drainage with culture to guide therapy. Because inflammatory breast cancer may overlap with infectious mastitis and can include thickening, edema, peau d’orange, and nipple retraction, diagnostic mammography and ultrasonography are appropriate first steps, and a punch biopsy should be performed when skin findings suggestive of malignancy are present and not responsive to antibiotic therapy.

### Treatments for breast abscesses in breastfeeding women [^9e1ce11a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of breastfeeding are well known, and the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continuing breastfeeding to age two. However, many women stop breastfeeding due to lactational breast abscesses. A breast abscess is a localised accumulation of infected fluid in breast tissue. Abscesses are commonly treated with antibiotics, incision and drainage (I&D) or ultrasound-guided needle aspiration, but there is no consensus on the optimal treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatments for the management of breast abscesses in breastfeeding women.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trial Register (27 February 2015). In addition we searched African Journals Online (27 February 2015), Google Scholar (27 February 2015), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Databases (27 February 2015) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (27 February 2015). We also checked reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted experts in the field as well as relevant pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating any intervention for treating lactational breast abscesses compared with any other intervention. Studies published in abstract form, quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs were not eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included six studies. Overall, trials had an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to poor reporting. Two studies did not stratify data for lactational and non-lactational breast abscesses, and these studies do not contribute to the results. This review is based on data from four studies involving 325 women. Needle aspiration (with and without ultrasound guidance) versus incision and drainage (I&D) Mean time (days) to complete resolution of breast abscess (three studies) - there was substantial heterogeneity among these data (Tau(2) = 47.63, I(2) = 97%) and a clear difference between subgroups (with or without ultrasound guidance; Chi(2) = 56.88, I(2) = 98.2%, P = < 0.00001). We did not pool these data in a meta-analysis. Two studies excluded women who had treatment failure when they calculated the mean time to complete resolution. One study found that the time to complete resolution of breast abscess favoured needle aspiration over I&D (mean difference (MD) -6.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.81 to -4.33; n = 36), but excluded 9/22 (41%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. Another study reported faster resolution in the needle aspiration group (MD -17.80; 95% CI -21.27 to -14.33; n = 64) but excluded 6/35 (17%) women in the needle aspiration group due to treatment failure. A third study also reported that needle aspiration was associated with a shorter time to complete resolution of breast abscess (MD -16.00; 95%CI -18.73 to -13.27; n = 60); however, the authors did not indicate the number of women who were lost to follow-up for either group, and it is unclear how many women contributed to this result. Considering the limitations of the available data, we do not consider the results to be informative. Continuation of breastfeeding, after treatment (success): results favoured the needle aspiration group, but we did not pool data from the two studies because of substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%). One study reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more likely to continue breastfeeding (risk ratio (RR) 2.89; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.08; n = 60), whereas the other study found no clear difference (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.22 n = 70). Treatment failure was more common among women treated with needle aspiration compared to those who underwent I&D (RR 16.12; 95% CI 2.21 to 117.73; two studies, n = 115, low quality evidence). In one study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 9/22 women who subsequently underwent I&D to treat their breast abscess. In another study, treatment with needle aspiration failed in 6/35 women, who subsequently underwent I&D. All abscesses in the I&D group were successfully treated.The included studies provided limited data for the review's secondary outcomes. No data were reported for adverse events. One study (60 women) reported that women in the needle aspiration group were more satisfied with their treatment than women who received I&D to treat their breast abscesses. Incision and drainage (I&D) with or without antibioticsOne study (150 women) compared the value of adding a broad-spectrum cephalosporin (single dose or a course of treatment) to women who underwent I&D for breast abscesses.The mean time to resolution of breast abscess was reported as being similar in all groups (although women with infection were excluded). Mean time to resolution for women who received a course of antibiotics was reported as 7.3 days, 6.9 days for women who received a single dose of antibiotics and 7.4 days for women who did not receive antibiotics. Standard deviations, P values and CIs were not reported and prevented further analysis. No data were reported for any continuation of breastfeeding after treatment (success). For treatment failure, there was no clear difference between the groups of women who received antibiotics (either a single dose or a course of antibiotics) and those who did not (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.76).Included studies rarely reported this review's secondary outcomes (including adverse events). For post-operative complications/morbidity, there was no difference in the risk of wound infections between the antibiotics and no antibiotics groups (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.17), irrespective of whether women received a single dose or a course of antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether needle aspiration is a more effective option to I&D for lactational breast abscesses, or whether an antibiotic should be routinely added to women undergoing I&D for lactational breast abscesses. We graded the evidence for the primary outcome of treatment failure as low quality, with downgrading based on including small studies with few events and unclear risk of bias.

### Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in human breast milk: influence of antibiotherapy and other host and clinical factors [^fff09b34]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Finally, the antibiotic-associated loss of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in milk may also have negative consequences for breast health because of the overgrowth of mastitis-causing agents. In fact, multiresistance to antibiotics is a common feature among clinical staphylococci involved in such conditions. This explains why this condition used to be elusive to antibiotic therapy, and why it constitutes one of the main reasons to cease breast-feeding. In this context, the development of new strategies based on selected probiotic lactobacilli isolated from human milk is an efficient alternative for mastitis treatment. This suggests that human milk lactobacilli may play important roles in mammary homeostasis.

In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are common members of the human milk microbiota of women who did not receive antibiotics during pregnancy or lactation. Therefore, the presence of such bacteria may be a marker of a healthy non–antibiotic-altered human milk microbiota, and this should be taken into account when defining a criterion standard of breast milk. As a consequence, administration of selected human milk lactobacilli or bifidobacteria to pregnant or lactating women receiving antibiotics, or to their infants, may constitute an attractive approach to restore the natural bacterial ecosystem existing in human milk.

### Puerperal mastitis requiring hospitalization during a nine-year period [^2d13041c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the clinical and microbiologic features of isolates among patients with puerperal mastitis requiring hospitalization.

Study Design

Between January 2000 and December 2008, postpartum patients who were hospitalized for mastitis were enrolled. The clinical characteristics, microbiologic results, management, and outcomes were reviewed.

Results

One hundred twenty-seven cases were enrolled. Seventy-six patients (59.9%) underwent incision and drainage for abscess drainage, all of whom discontinued breastfeeding. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates. Among 81 isolates of S aureus, 52 (64.2%) were resistant to oxacillin. Patients undergoing incision and drainage were more likely to discontinue breastfeeding, had a longer duration of symptoms, a longer hospitalization, a higher platelet count and higher rates of infection caused by S aureus and oxacillin-resistant S aureus.

Conclusion

Oxacillin-resistant S aureus has emerged in patients with puerperal mastitis during the past decade, and often necessitates incision and drainage, which results in discontinuation of breastfeeding.

### Postpartum mastitis and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^cf2f6abe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Ten (48%) MRSA and 11 (41%) MSSA patients required hospitalization. Although these inpatients did not differ in duration of symptoms before admission, length of stay, or leukocyte count, MRSA patients were more likely to have fever. One patient in each group required readmission for recurrent symptoms (Table).

Forty-six study patients had an abscess associated with mastitis; most (39 patients) underwent needle aspiration. Of these patients, 7 (41%) MRSA and 5 (23%) MSSA patients required repeat aspiration. Notably, 9 MSSA patients underwent incision and drainage a median of 4.5 days after aspiration (range 0–17 days), whereas only 1 MRSA patient required subsequent débridement (1 day later). Reasons for this difference are not clear; however, the more frequent use of serial ultrasound-guided aspiration in breast abscess management in recent years (when most MRSA cases occurred) may account for this finding.

In 17 of 21 MRSA cases, antibiotic use was documented. Twelve patients received antibiotics effective against MRSA, but only 2 received effective coverage at therapy onset (both received clindamycin). Patients initially received a penicillinase-resistant penicillin (patients), a first-generation cephalosporin (patients), a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (patient), or some combination of the above (patients). Median time to effective coverage for MRSA was 5 days (range 0–16 days); adequate antimicrobial agents included vancomycin (patients), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (patient), clindamycin (patients), rifampin (patients), or some combination of the above (patients). Median duration of therapy, documented in 8 of 12 effective regimens, was 19 days (range 14–62 days).

### Mastitis and mammary abscess management audit (MAMMA) in the UK and Ireland [^63d1362d]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Data collection proformas for both study phases can be found in the Supplementary Appendixes. Briefly, outcomes collected in phase 2 covered five areas, specifically: patient demographics, patient treatment pathway, diagnosis, risk factors, and treatment. Patient demographics included age (years), BMI, and number of weeks postpartum. Patient treatment pathway data included day and time of presentation, grade of admitting doctor, source of referral, use of antibiotics in the community before presentation, and involvement of the breast team. Data were collected on the subtype of mastitis (for example lactational, periductal, etc.) and delay in seeking help from onset of symptoms (days). Information was recorded on risk factors, including breastfeeding, use of breast pumps, previous history of breast infection, and factors not associated with lactation, such as smoking, diabetes, and breast trauma.

Data on treatment(s) included type, duration, route and justification of antibiotic choice, location of treatment (that is primary care outpatients or admitted for secondary care), and, if admitted, documented justification for admission, grade of decision maker, and the duration of hospital stay (days). Access to breastfeeding advice was recorded. Regarding radiological imaging, the use of diagnostic ultrasonography and rate of needle aspiration (with or without ultrasonography guidance, waiting time, and number of aspirations) were recorded. Justification for surgical incision and drainage was documented along with waiting times from decision to operate to surgery (days). Microbiology results were recorded, including specific details on microorganisms cultured.

Study size

There are 167 breast surgery units in the UK. The aim of this audit was to recruit at least one-third of breast surgery units across the UK and Ireland (56 hospitals). This level of participation was achieved by a number of other national breast surgery projects. The interim analysis of phase 1 audit data suggested that the mean number of patients presenting with mastitis or breast abscess per unit per month was around seven, which across 56 units over 3 months would be equivalent to 1176 patient records. To reduce selection bias, participating centres collected data on all consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria for an interval of 3 months or longer until the minimum number of 21 patients was reached. Where units were unable to reach the required minimum number of patients, despite continuing data collection for 6 months, their data were included in the audit under a proviso of being a small unit.

Statistical analyses

The analysis and reporting of the results will follow the CONSORT guidelines. Primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach, which includes all losses-to follow-up, non-compliances or withdrawals. Baseline characteristics will be compared between allocated treatment groups using frequencies and descriptive statistics. The principal analysis will use an unadjusted Chi-Square test to compare the incidence of mastitis between the two groups. The corresponding unadjusted relative risk with 95% confidence interval will also be calculated. Further analysis of the primary outcome will use multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of adjusting for any imbalances at baseline or important predictors of mastitis (e.g. previous history of mastitis, antibiotic use, cracked nipples, or duration of breastfeeding). Additional unadjusted and adjusted analyses of all secondary outcomes will be performed using measures and multivariable models appropriate for the outcome. An analysis of women compliant with treatment (per protocol) will also be performed to assess the robustness of the primary findings. For all analyses, the number of cases with complete data and those with missing values will be reported. If necessary, reason for and type of missing data will be assessed to determine whether multiple imputation, sensitivity analysis or other approaches (“best” and “worst” case scenario, last value carried forward) will be required. Analyses will be performed using SPSS Version 24 (IBM SPSS Statistics, 2016 IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL) by an analyst not involved in any data collection and blinded to treatment allocation.

To assess the impact of the APP, the rate of primary and secondary study outcomes will be compared between the main study group and small sub-sample. Compliance rates in the ingestion of the intervention, and completeness and acceptability of data collected during daily and weekly follow-up will also be examined between the two study groups.

This protocol has been formatted according to the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines (Additional file 1).

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^4b2d4e13]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Our definitions of nipple damage are as follows: mild 1 or 2 mm wide; moderate 3–9 mm wide; severe: greater than 10 mm wide and / or yellow colour visible in crack. In addition to a clinical assessment, a more permanent record of nipple damage was created using digital photography. It was planned for the photographs to be reviewed independently by three lactation consultants, in order to allow a thorough assessment of nipple damage and changes over time, rather than relying on the clinical assessment alone. (As the trial ended prematurely, this did not take place).

Furthermore, although the WHO defines mastitis as an inflammation of the breast, there is no generally agreed definition of mastitis for research purposes. The definition of mastitis used for this study was that a woman reported:

• at least two breast symptoms (pain, redness, lump) and

• at least one of fever or 'flu-like symptoms.

### Postpartum pyoderma gangrenosum following lactation-induced mastitis and abscess incision [^e1809904]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 32-year-old breastfeeding woman presented 7 weeks postpartum with right breast pain, swelling, and erythema. The clinical diagnosis of lactational mastitis was confirmed on ultrasound, and she was commenced on intravenous flucloxacillin. Aspirated milky fluid was cultured, which grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ; thus, clindamycin was added to her treatment regimen. Her symptoms failed to improve, and 6 days later, an abscess was incised and drained. A vacuum-assisted closure dressing was placed over the wound after surgery. Over the following 3 days, she deteriorated clinically with markedly increased pain, spiking temperatures, and malaise. Linezolid and metronidazole were added to her regimen. On exam, she had an 18-cm × 10-cm deep necrotic ulcer with purulent discharge, sparing the nipple. The breast surgeon’s concern was that of necrotizing fasciitis, and an immediate wider debridement was performed, removing all breast skin except for the nipple. Dermatology was then consulted. Upon examination, a large proportion of the right breast demonstrated necrotic ulceration, with rolled, inflamed, and violaceous borders (Fig 1). A diagnosis of PG was made. Scoring systems such as a PARACELSUS score of 15 supported this diagnosis.The patient was commenced on intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days. Her temperature normalized rapidly, and her C-reactive protein level decreased from 141 mg/L to 27 mg/L in 24 hours. The previously rolled, violaceous wound edges settled with no further progression. After 3 days, a decision was made to introduce a steroid-sparing agent to avoid potential side effects, and cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/d was commenced as a longer-term option. The right breast continued to lactate, and the very large defect now present was anticipated to pose several difficulties for the young mother. Five weeks after the initial presentation and after multidisciplinary discussion, a biodegradable temporizing matrix (NovoSorb BTM- Polynovo Biomaterials Ltd) was applied under continued dermatologist-supervised immunosuppression (Fig 2). The NovoSorb BTM is a synthetic wound dressing to assist in dermis regrowth. It is composed of 2 layers—a sealing membrane and an open-cell, porous, biodegradable foam—that are bound by an adhesive. The open matrix encourages cellular migration to the area with the aim of creating a vascularized dermal layer prior to grafting. The BTM was secured to the breast skin with skin clips under tension. A hole was cut in the BTM to exteriorize the nipple, and the areolar skin was everted and secured to the BTM with skin clips. The vacuum-assisted closure dressing was then reapplied. The BTM was applied with good effect. Two weeks later, a split-thickness skin graft was applied to the BTM. The skin grafting was performed successfully, with no reactivation of PG after surgery (Fig 3). Four months after grafting, the patient remains stable. Cyclosporine was weaned to stop, and the PG remained quiescent (Fig 4). A decision regarding right breast reconstruction will be considered in the coming months.

39172675. Abstract Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging.

However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora. Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence.

Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible. Publication types

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^7d7cf3ec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Multi-centred trial

As we intended to recruit over 500 women we planned a multi-centred trial, involving a number of public and private maternity hospitals in inner Melbourne. All hospitals provide a breastfeeding clinic staffed with International Board Certified Lactation Consultants for women having breastfeeding difficulties following hospital discharge. The public hospitals, where women tend to have shorter hospital stays, also provide home visits by domiciliary midwives post discharge. It was foreseen that there would be replication in the requirements of the hospital ethics committees and logistical difficulties for one researcher (LA) to conduct the study on multiple sites.

Each hospital had its own research ethics committee (or committees) and different forms to submit (at the time of this study). Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committees at La Trobe University (20/11/2000), Royal Women's Hospital (6/9/2000), Mercy Hospital for Women (12/2/2001), Frances Perry House (23/8/2001), Freemasons Maternity Hospital (15/3/2001) and Cabrini Private Hospital (24/04/02). One private hospital did not appear to have a procedure in place to deal with a research proposal. Negotiations continued with this hospital from late 2000 until mid-2002 when the hospital insisted that we sign a Sponsor Indemnity Form, which the university advised us against.

The researcher visited the postnatal wards and breastfeeding clinics of these hospitals each day or second day and asked a senior member of the nursing staff if there were any breastfeeding women with damaged nipples in the ward. The staff member introduced the researcher to the woman in order to inform the woman about the study and invite her to participate in the trial. Also, the researcher asked the domiciliary midwives to inform women at home with a cracked nipple about the trial. If the woman were interested in the study, the midwife gave the researcher the woman's name and phone number. After a telephone discussion, the researcher would visit her at home to assess her eligibility.

Thus, the researcher was visiting a number of hospitals on a daily basis and making home visits to potential participants and follow-up visits to participants one week after recruitment. Therefore, if the researcher was going to be unavailable one week, she could not recruit women the week prior (as she would not be able to follow them up).

### Premature termination of nursing secondary to Serratia marcescens breast pump contamination [^e09b95ae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serratia marcescens, a known pathogen associated with postpartum mastitis, may be identified by its characteristic pigmentation.

Case

A 36-year-old P0102 woman presented postpartum and said that her breast pump tubing had turned bright pink. S marcescens was isolated, indicating colonization. She was started on antibiotics. After viewing an Internet report in which a patient nearly died from a Serratia infection, she immediately stopped breastfeeding.

Conclusion

Serratia colonization may be noted before the development of overt infection. Because this pathogen can be associated with mastitis, physicians should be ready to treat and should encourage patients to continue nursing after clearance of the organism. Exposure to sensational Internet reports may make treatment recommendations difficult.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^cd4952fb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Methods

The aim of our study was to prevent mastitis in breastfeeding women with cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus. A randomised controlled trial was conducted: participating women were randomized to receive a seven day course of either an oral antibiotic (flucloxacillin) or identical placebo capsules. A follow-up visit was arranged one week after recruitment for women with positive nipple culture for S. aureus. Women with negative nipple culture were followed up by telephone at one week. All women received a final telephone interview at six weeks.

The primary outcome was the incidence of mastitis in each group in the week following recruitment. In the study by Livingstone and Stringer 30% of women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples who received only breastfeeding advice developed mastitis within one week. In order to detect a 50% decrease in incidence, ie mastitis occurring in 15% of women receiving oral antibiotics, a sample size of 133 women in each group is required, with 95% confidence and 80% power. Sample size was calculated using Epi-Info 6.

A previous study in Australia found that 62% (13/21) of cultures from breastfeeding women with cracked nipples were positive for S. aureus. An earlier study by Livingstone and colleagues found that 54% of cracked nipples of mothers with infants younger than one month were positive for S. aureus (27/50). Assuming that 50% of cracked nipples are positive for S. aureus, we would need 133 × 2 × 2 = 532 women with cracked nipples, to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples. To allow for loss to follow-up, it was planned to recruit 570 women.

A review of the literature on the topic of nipple damage found a lack of consistency in assessment of nipple damage. Many reports have not provided a clear description of the assessment process. Some of the more recent studies have provided a more detailed description, such as Brent et al's Nipple Attribute Score and Duffy et al's Nipple Trauma Index. The Nipple Trauma Index used by Duffy and colleagues in Western Australia appeared to be useful, however a request for more information about this instrument was not successful (E. Duffy, email 28 February 2001).

12824. Abstract Background: Mastitis is a common and distressing maternal postpartum condition, but the relationship between mastitis timing and antibiotic treatment and breastfeeding outcomes and postnatal mental health is unclear.

Objectives: To describe the incidence of mastitis and treatment with antibiotics in first 6 months postpartum, and to investigate the impact of mastitis timing and antibiotic treatment on breastfeeding practices and postnatal mental health. Methods: This study is based on 79, 985 mother-infant dyads in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Women were classified according to self-reported mastitis within first month or 1-6 months postpartum and antibiotic treatment. Breastfeeding outcomes included predominant or any breastfeeding and abrupt breastfeeding cessation until 6 months postpartum. Maternal mental health was assessed by self-report at 6 months postpartum. Results: The incidence of mastitis was 18. 8%, with
36. 8% reporting treatment with antibiotics. Women reporting early mastitis were less likely to report predominant breastfeeding and any breastfeeding for 6 months than women who did not report mastitis, and more likely to report abrupt breastfeeding cessation. Late-onset mastitis was not associated with poorer breastfeeding outcomes. Among women reporting mastitis, the risk of abrupt breastfeeding cessation was higher in those also reporting antibiotic use. Mastitis was associated with an increased risk of mental health problems postpartum which was highest among those reporting no antibiotic use, in contrast to those also reporting antibiotic use. Conclusions: Lactational mastitis and its associated treatment with antibiotics are common. Early mastitis appears to be a modest risk factor for suboptimal breastfeeding outcomes. In addition, mastitis is associated with poorer mental health.

### Factors associated with surgical treatment in postpartum women with mastitis or breast abscess: a retrospective cohort study [^43ffd36b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective: The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with requiring surgical treatment for mastitis or breast abscess in postpartum mothers. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study using the Japan Medical Data Center Claims Database. Information on pairs of infants born between April 2012 and December 2016 and their mothers were extracted. Data regarding the baseline characteristics, medical history, medical practice, and prescription drugs of mothers and their infants were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with undergoing surgical treatment. Results: The data of 69,363 eligible mothers were analyzed. The proportion of mothers who were diagnosed with mastitis or breast abscess within 1 year after childbirth was 10.8% (7,516/69,363). There were 114 mothers who underwent surgical treatment within 1 year after childbirth. This was 0.2% of all mothers and 1.5% of those diagnosed with mastitis or breast abscess. Surgical treatment was significantly associated with mothers having their first child (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-4.07) compared to those with a second or later child; it was also significantly associated with the diagnosis of breast abscess (AOR, 10.38; 95% CI, 5.28-20.40). Conclusions: This was the first report of the prevalence of mastitis or breast abscess and the requirement for surgical treatment among postpartum mothers in Japan. A first diagnosis of breast abscess and having a first child were associated with requiring surgical treatment. Health care professionals providing postpartum care should be aware of these factors.

### Postpartum mastitis and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^32f0e0e1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial agent use was documented for 18 of 27 MSSA cases; in all 18 cases, isolates were susceptible to the initial antibiotic of choice. Initial regimens included penicillinase-resistant penicillins (patients), first-generation cephalosporins (patients), macrolides (patients), tetracyclines (patients), β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (patient), vancomycin (patient), and clindamycin (patients). Duration of therapy for MSSA PPM, documented in 12 of 18 cases, was a median of 13.5 days (range 9–27 days).

Medical record review of affected patients did not show transmission of S. aureus to infants or other family members. In 1 MRSA patient, a perirectal abscess developed 5 months after the mastitis resolved. Intraoperative cultures of the abscess grew MRSA with identical susceptibilities, which suggests persistent colonization; however, typing of the isolates was not performed.

Of 21 MRSA isolates available for PCR analysis, 20 possessed SCC mec IV. The remaining isolate contained SCC mec II (Figure 2) and displayed resistance to clindamycin. In contrast, 95% of isolates with SCC mec IV were clindamycin susceptible.

### Treatment utility of postpartum antibiotics in chorioamnionitis study [^580bdc6f]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

ObjectiveTo determine if postpartum antibiotics are necessary for patients with chorioamnionitis after a cesarean delivery (CD). Study DesignMulticenter randomized controlled trial. Laboring patients with singleton gestations and chorioamnionitis who underwent CD were eligible. Patients were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin per standard protocol, then given clindamycin prior to skin incision. Patients were randomized to either postpartum antibiotic prophylaxis or no treatment following delivery. The primary outcome was the rate of endometritis. Assuming a 30% risk of endometritis in patients with chorioamnionitis who undergo CD, 119 patients per arm would be required to detect a 50% decrease in endometritis. ResultsThe trial was stopped for futility following a planned interim analysis after 80 patients were randomized. There was no difference in the rate of the primary outcome between the two groups (9.8 vs. 7.7%, relative risk [RR]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30, 5.31). A meta-analysis comparing post-CD antibiotics versus no treatment did not find a statistically significant difference between the groups (16.7 vs. 12.0%, pooled RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 0.72, 2.84). ConclusionAdditional postpartum antibiotics do not decrease the rate of endometritis in patients with chorioamnionitis who undergo CD. The current preoperative antibiotic regimen including clindamycin should remain the standard of care in these patients.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^36af61e3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Participation

Not all the women who were eligible for the trial were interested in taking part (see Figure 1, ROBIn Trial Profile). Some women expressed a reluctance to take antibiotics, others were overwhelmed with the difficulties they were experiencing and preferred not to participate in a trial. The researchers had previously conducted studies involving breastfeeding women which had high rates of participation and had expected women to be more interested in taking part in a trial that aimed to prevent mastitis. We should have expected a lower participation rate as this study involved the possibility of taking a medication, in particular an antibiotic.

Figure 1 
ROBIn Trial Profile

Less than anticipated incidence of cracked nipples

A total of approximately 17,000 women give birth in these hospitals each year. We estimated that 80% of women start breastfeeding, 5% develop cracked nipple(s), 80% would be eligible and 95% would agree to participate, thus there would be 537 eligible women per year. We anticipated that we would recruit approximately ten women with cracked nipples per week. It would therefore take 57 weeks (57 × 10) to recruit the total sample.

However, recruitment was slow, as very few women were identified with damaged nipples. Hospital staff made unsolicited remarks that nipple damage was seen much less frequently than in the past. Midwives have been trained to help women position the baby and attach the baby at the breast; women are reporting the presence of nipple pain and any nipple damage is usually identified at an early stage. In the past, women may have continued to breastfeed with poor attachment of the baby to the breast, resulting in more severe damage, whereas at the time of the study maternity staff were likely to suggest "resting" the damaged nipple and expressing the milk by hand or electric pump until the damage had healed.

### Mastitis and mammary abscess management audit (MAMMA) [^008f29c3]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

Benign breast inflammation and infection accounts for 5 per cent of all breast-related hospital admissions, costing €3584per admission. Mastitis, defined as inflammation of breast tissue, can be broadly classified as either lactational or non-lactational. Complications, such as severe sepsis resulting in hospital admission and/or the need for surgical incision and drainage, can occur when treatment is delayed, incorrect, or ineffective. Breast abscess, characterized by a localized collection of purulent material within the breast, is a known complication of mastitis and occurs in up to 11 per centof cases. The Mastitis and Mammary Abscess Management Audit (MAMMA) aims to review current practices and improve outcomes in the treatment of mastitis and breast abscesses in the UK and Ireland through national adoption of a best-practice protocol.

The accepted standard management of breast abscesses includes antibiotics and minimally invasive ultrasound-guided needle aspiration on an outpatient basis for patients who are well clinically,. Surgical incision and drainage represents an archetypal treatment that should be reserved for selected patients only, because it can lead to cosmetic disfigurement and, in lactational mastitis, involves an unnecessary hospital admission, separating the breastfeeding mother from her baby.

The acute nature of this presentation means that patients are more likely to present to the emergency department and/or general practitioners, and subsequently be managed by non-breast specialist general surgeons. This, alongside lack of a clear treatment protocol, is likely to contribute to wide variation in management, particularly in areas such as antibiotic prescribing (both class and duration), rates of surgical incision and drainage, and the duration of inpatient treatment. A recent retrospective studyin a multisite National Health Service Trust concluded that the implementation of a breast abscess pathway improved compliance with preferred antibiotic regimens, and reduced the rate of surgical incision and drainage, as well as hospital admissions. MAMMA aims to demonstrate similar improvements in practice at a national level.

### Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis diagnosed during pregnancy associated with successful breastfeeding experience [^8edd08a9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare benign breast condition with a course that is often rapidly progressive and slow to resolve. There is no consensus on management, especially during pregnancy and lactation. A 30-year-old at 33 weeks presented with mastalgia, induration and galactorrhoea in the left breast. There was no improvement with antibiotics. Initial workup was negative, and a core needle biopsy showed findings consistent with the diagnosis of IGM. She was treated with steroids antepartum. She was co-managed by rheumatology and her obstetrician/breastfeeding medicine specialist postpartum. She was treated with azathioprine, breastfed exclusively for 6 months and continued breastfeeding through the first year. A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in diagnosing, treating, and facilitating successful breastfeeding in patients with IGM.

### Mechanisms and therapeutic effectiveness of lactobacilli [^70f83587]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Mastitis

Mastitis is an infectious inflammation of one or more breast lobuleswith S. aureus and S. epidermidis being the most frequent aetiological agentsand with a prevalence of 3–33% among breastfeeding mothers.Multidrug resistance and biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria account for the lack of efficacy of antibiotics used for treatment of mastitis.In this context, new strategies based on probiotics, as alternatives or complements to antibiotic therapy for the management of mastitis, are gaining a prominent role. Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing efficacy for treatment of mastitis have been summarised in table 7.

Immunomodulatory activity

Lactobacilli are potential adjuvants triggering mucosal and systemic immune responses.The immunomodulatory effects of lactobacilli observed in various physiological systems include increased natural killer cell cytotoxicityand induction of interferon-γ productionand cytokine expression.In order to exert these immunomodulatory effects, lactobacilli must resist to digestive system processesand adhere to the host's intestinal epithelium.Lactobacilli (in particular L. acidophilus) can also be administered together with bifidobacteria in order to enhance the immune system.This effect is accomplished by enhancing systemic/local immunityand concurrently attenuating systemic stress response.Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing immunomodulatory activity in various pathologies have been summarised in table 8.

Gastrointestinal pathologies

Even if the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBD) remains unknown, the luminal microbiome plays a key role in triggering and maintaining a balanced environment within the GI tract.Dysbiosis may also play a key role in IBD.Evidence from animal modelsand clinical observationsoutlined the putative therapeutic role of probiotic strains for IBD treatment. Restoring microbiota-host symbiosis can represent a promising approach for treatment of the above mentioned conditions and can be applied to other GI pathologies, as summarised in table 9.

Gastrointestinal tract survival

Strains belonging to L. and B. genera are the most studied in clinical practice.The number of bacterial strains that reach the gut mucosa and colon, depends on several factors such as strain used, gastric transit survival,and acid and bile tolerance.Clinical studies of lactobacilli showing ability to survive in the GI tract have been summarised in table 10.

Pearl 5. Move fast during the golden hour to save lives: know your bugs, their origin, and that group A streptococcus kills quickly!

Causes of maternal sepsis differ from those of the nonobstetric population. Based on the National Readmissions Database from 2019, the most frequent sources of infection associated with episodes of sepsis during and after hospitalization for delivery were genitourinary and respiratory (Fig. 1).In comparison, the most common sources of infection for nonobstetric patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis were respiratory, abdominal, and bloodstream infections.

Causes of maternal sepsis vary based on timing of infection (eg, antenatal, intrapartum or postpartum). Genitourinary infections are the most common source of infection throughout pregnancy and postpartum, and are most commonly diagnosed antenatally. Pyelonephritis is one of the leading causes of nonobstetric antepartum hospitalization. Sepsis associated with chorioamnionitis is most likely to present intrapartum. Respiratory infections are equally distributed during pregnancy and postpartum.Sepsis from endomyometritis, mastitis, gastrointestinal, and soft tissue sources are more commonly encountered postpartum.

Knowledge of the potential pathogens associated with each sepsis etiology is critical to optimal management and antibiotic stewardship. The major pathogens causing sepsis in the puerperium are Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes.Similar to the general population, the most common pathogen identified in positive blood cultures from pregnant and postpartum patients is E coli, which occurs in up to one half of cases. E coli is also the predominant isolate in cases of urosepsis and chorioamnionitis or endometritis.

Breast abscess

Acute bacterial mastitis will either resolve with antibiotic therapy or evolve into an abscess if treatment is delayed or inadequate. Approximately 4.8–11 % of lactation-related mastitis is complicated by breast abscesses. Infection is most commonly due to S. aureus (with increasing cases of methicillin-resistant S. aureus MRSA) and Streptococcus. The patient presents with fever, chills, tenderness and breast erythema. Imaging with ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis, provide a means to drain the collection to tailor antibiotic therapy and can be safely used for regular follow-up of abscess. Ultrasound is the modality of choice and typically reveals a complex hypoechoic cystic mass of varied shape, commonly multiloculated with indistinct margins, peripheral vascularity and posterior acoustic enhancement (Fig. 9b); however, there should be no vascularity within the fluid collection. Mammography is performed only if unclear of diagnosis and may show signs such as mass, distortion, asymmetric density and skin thickening, which are not specific to cancer. Presence of suspicious calcifications is more specific for cancer. Percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy provides effective treatment. In some cases multiples drainages are required. Warm compresses and frequent breast feeding also help to shorten the duration of symptoms. The presence of mastitis and/or abscess poses no risk to the breast feeding infant. Cessation of breast-feeding is necessary only when treatment with an antibiotic contraindicated for the newborn is prescribed (e.g. tetracycline, ciprofloxacin or chloramphenicol) or if surgical drainage is performed. Due to overlap of radiological findings in infection and inflammatory breast cancer, if there is clinical suspicion, strong family history or atypical course breast biopsy or skin punch biopsy should be considered.

### Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among patients with puerperal mastitis requiring hospitalization [^346f8f11]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the incidence of puerperal mastitis requiring hospital admission and to describe demographic and obstetric risk factors for this condition. We also sought to identify trends in bacteriology among isolates obtained from breast abscesses and breast-milk aspirates, with a focus on treatment strategies used for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Methods

Patients with puerperal mastitis who were admitted to a county-based teaching hospital between January 1997 and December 2005 were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes (675.1, 675.2). Data collected included demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment, duration of admission, premorbid antibiotic exposure, and bacteriology. Demographic variables and obstetric outcomes were compared with all other pregnant women delivered at our hospital.

Results

One hundred twenty-seven of 136,459 women delivered at our teaching hospital were admitted for puerperal mastitis (9.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-11.1] per 10,000 deliveries). The incidence of mastitis only during the study period was 6.7 (95% CI 5.4-8.3) per 10,000 deliveries, and the incidence of mastitis with breast abscess was 2.6 (95% CI 1.8-3.6) per 10,000 deliveries. Puerperal mastitis was significantly associated with younger women (23.4 years compared with 25.1 years, P<.001) and decreased parity (P=.02). Clinically significant breast abscess (n=35, 28%) was seen most commonly with community-acquired MRSA (n=18, 67%) during the data-collection period. The majority (15 [56%]) of women with culture-proven MRSA did not receive antibiotic therapy to which this organism was sensitive. They were discharged without complication, and there were no treatment failures.

Conclusion

Community-acquired MRSA was most commonly associated with breast abscess. The empiric use of antibiotics ineffective against community-acquired MRSA did not adversely affect the outcomes in this study.

### Interventions for treating painful nipples among breastfeeding women [^9a4669af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Leading health authorities all recommend exclusive breastfeeding to six months' postpartum. While most women initiate breastfeeding, many discontinue due to difficulties encountered rather than maternal choice. One common breastfeeding difficulty is painful nipples. Research has identified poor infant positioning or latch as a common cause of painful nipples. While many different interventions designed to reduce nipple pain in breastfeeding women have been evaluated, it is unclear which intervention is the most effective treatment. An understanding of nipple pain and treatment options are needed to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates and to address systematically one of the most frequent difficulties encountered by breastfeeding women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of all interventions in the resolution or reduction of nipple pain and the impact of the interventions on other outcomes such as nipple trauma, nipple infections, breast mastitis, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, and maternal satisfaction.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2014) and scanned secondary references.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials designed to evaluate any intervention for treating nipple pain among breastfeeding women. Trials using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. The following interventions were eligible for inclusion compared with each other or usual care (i.e. education only): pharmacological (e.g. antifungal creams); non-pharmacological topical treatments (e.g. lanolin); dressings (e.g. hydrogel dressings); nipple protection devices (e.g. breast shells), phototherapy, and expressed breast milk. Nipple pain in women who are feeding with expressed breast milk (i.e. women of infants in neonatal units) is associated with other methods of removing milk from the mother's breast such as manual expression and various types of breast pumps. Nipple pain and subsequent treatment is different in this unique maternal population and thus we excluded women solely feeding with expressed breast milk from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, evaluated methodological quality, and checked data for accuracy. We sought additional information from several trial researchers.

Main Results

We included four trials of good methodological quality involving 656 women in the review. The four included trials evaluated five different interventions including glycerine pads, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, and an all-purpose nipple ointment. All studies included education to position the infant at the breast correctly as part of routine postpartum care to both treatment and control groups.Pooled data existed only for the comparison of lanolin versus usual care. We did not pool data for other outcomes due to either heterogeneity in outcome measures or differing interventions.There was no evidence that glycerine gel dressings or breast shells with lanolin significantly improved nipple pain. One trial found no clear differences in nipple pain (at one to three days, four to five days, or six to seven days' post-treatment) between women who applied lanolin or nothing to their nipples. In contrast, the same trial found that women who applied expressed breast milk had significantly lower perceptions of nipple pain following four to five days of treatment than women who applied lanolin. However, this beneficial effect was not maintained after six to seven days of treatment. There were no group differences in nipple pain perceptions at any assessment between women who applied expressed breast milk and women who applied nothing. Women who applied an "all-purpose nipple ointment", in comparison to women who applied lanolin, had no improvement in nipple pain after seven days of treatment. There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, lanolin with breast shells, lanolin alone, expressed breast milk, or all-purpose nipple ointment improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain.Overall, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for the treatment of nipple pain. However, one important finding was that regardless of the treatment used, for most women nipple pain reduced to mild levels after approximately seven to 10 days' postpartum. The provision of anticipatory guidance regarding usual time to pain reduction may be a useful strategy in assisting women to continue to breastfeed and to do so exclusively. The overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain as assessed using GRADE was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence that glycerine gel dressings, breast shells with lanolin, lanolin alone, or the all-purpose nipple ointment significantly improved maternal perceptions of nipple pain. The results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin.The quality of the evidence for this review did not lead to robust conclusions regarding the objectives assessed. We included only four trials, incorporating 656 women, in the review and all four trials compared varying interventions, participants, study outcome measures, and standards of usual care. The methodological quality of the included studies was good but the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of nipple pain was of low quality, mainly because single studies with few participants contributed data for analysis.

Inpatient treatment

Advice to continue breastfeeding was given to 296 (80.7 per cent) lactating women. Over three-quarters of patients were treated in the outpatient setting (1015 patients, 77.4 per cent); 295 patients (22.5 per cent) were admitted to hospital for a median of 2 (i.q.r. 2–4) days. The likelihood of being admitted depended on the diagnosis (Table 1). Reasons for admission are listed in Table 2. The decision to admit was made predominantly by specialist registrars (174 patients, 59.0 per cent) regardless of the time or day of presentation (Fig. S7). The odds of admission were significantly higher at the weekend compared with on Monday and Friday (OR 2.68, 95 per cent c.i. 1.89 to 3.80; χ 2 = 32.6; P < 0.001). There was a significant variation between individual centres regarding the rate of inpatient treatment (χ 2 = 291.8; P < 0.001). Certain regions admitted about one-third of presenting patients for inpatient treatment.

Admission and treatment-related statistics

Antibiotics

Before presenting to secondary care, 882 (67.2 per cent) patients were treated with antibiotics, of which the majority (679 patients, 77.0 per cent) had one antibiotic course (Table 3). Oral antibiotics administered in primary care significantly reduced the need for intravenous antibiotics in secondary care (OR = 0.71, 95 per cent c.i. 0.54 to 0.94; χ 2 = 5.6; P = 0.018). Of patients seen in secondary care, 1055 (80.4 per cent) were started on antibiotics, of which 767 (72.7 per cent) were started on oral antibiotics. Co-amoxiclav and flucloxacillin were the first-line antibiotics of choice (Fig. S8). Patients with abscesses were significantly more likely to be commenced on antibiotics compared with patients with mastitis both in primary care (OR 1.97, 95 per cent c.i. 1.55 to 2.48; χ 2 = 32.4; P < 0.001) and secondary care (OR 1.64, 95 per cent c.i. 1.25 to 2.16; χ 2 = 12.7; P < 0.001) (Table 1).

### Different classes of antibiotics given to women routinely for preventing infection at caesarean section [^6fee5e75]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Caesarean section increases the risk of postpartum infection for women and prophylactic antibiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence; however, there are adverse effects. It is important to identify the most effective class of antibiotics to use and those with the least adverse effects.  OBJECTIVES: To determine, from the best available evidence, the balance of benefits and harms between different classes of antibiotic given prophylactically to women undergoing caesarean section, considering their effectiveness in reducing infectious complications for women and adverse effects on both mother and infant.

Search Methods

For this 2020 update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (2 December 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different classes of prophylactic antibiotics given to women undergoing caesarean section.  RCTs published in abstract form were also included. We excluded trials that compared drugs with placebo or drugs within a specific class; these are assessed in other Cochrane Reviews. We excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over trials. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 39 studies, with 33 providing data (8073 women). Thirty-two studies (7690 women) contributing data administered antibiotics systemically, while one study (383 women) used lavage and was analysed separately. We identified three main comparisons that addressed clinically important questions on antibiotics at caesarean section (all systemic administration), but we only found studies for one comparison, 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors'.   We found no studies for the following comparisons: 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus lincosamides' and 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus lincosamides plus aminoglycosides'. Twenty-seven studies (22 provided data) included comparisons of cephalosporins (only) versus penicillins (only). However for this update, we only pooled data relating to different sub-classes of penicillins and cephalosporins where they are known to have similar spectra of action against agents likely to cause infection at caesarean section. Eight trials, providing data on 1540 women, reported on our main comparison, 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors'. We found data on four other comparisons of cephalosporins (only) versus penicillins (only) using systemic administration: antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus non-antistaphylococcal penicillins (natural and broad spectrum) (9 studies, 3093 women); minimally antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (3 rd generation) versus non-antistaphylococcal penicillins (natural and broad spectrum) (4 studies, 854 women); minimally antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (3 rd generation) versus broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors (2 studies, 865 women); and minimally antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (3rd generation) versus broad spectrum and antistaphylococcal penicillins (1 study, 200 women). For other comparisons of different classes of antibiotics, only a small number of trials provided data for each comparison, and in all but one case data were not pooled. For all comparisons, there was a lack of good quality data and important outcomes often included few women. Three of the studies that contributed data were undertaken with drug company funding, one was funded by the hospital, and for all other studies the funding source was not reported. Most of the studies were at unclear risk of selection bias, reporting bias and other biases, partly due to the inclusion of many older trials where trial reports did not provide sufficient methodological information. We undertook GRADE assessment on the only main comparison reported by the included studies, antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors, and the certainty ranged from low to very low, mostly due to concerns about risk of bias, wide confidence intervals (CI), and few events. In terms of the primary outcomes for our main comparison of 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins (1 st and 2 nd generation) versus broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors': only one small study reported sepsis, and there were too few events to identify clear differences between the drugs (risk ratio (RR) 2.37, 95% CI 0.10 to 56.41, 1 study, 75 women, very low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between these antibiotics in preventing endometritis (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.60, 7 studies, 1161 women; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on infant sepsis or infant oral thrush. For our secondary outcomes, we found there may be little or no difference between interventions for maternal fever (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.75, 3 studies, 678 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects on maternal: wound infection (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.90, 4 studies, 543 women), urinary tract infection (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.73, 4 studies, 496 women), composite adverse effects (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.09 to 10.50, 2 studies, 468 women), and skin rash (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.1, 3 studies, 591 women) (all very low certainty evidence). Although maternal allergic reactions were reported by two studies, there were no events. There were no infant outcomes reported in the included studies. For the other comparisons, the results for most outcomes had wide CIs, few studies and few women included. None of the included trials reported on longer-term maternal outcomes, or on any infant outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the best currently available evidence, 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins' and 'broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors' may have similar efficacy at caesarean section when considering immediate postoperative infection, although we did not have clear evidence for several important outcomes. Most trials administered antibiotics at or after cord clamping, or post-operatively, so results may have limited applicability to current practice which generally favours administration prior to skin incision. We have no data on any infant outcomes, nor on late infections (up to 30 days) in the mother; these are important gaps in the evidence that warrant further research. Antimicrobial resistance is very important but more appropriately investigated by other trial designs.
