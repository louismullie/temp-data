## Question

dose of spironolactone in renal failrue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about spironolactone dosing in renal failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "renal failure" by CKD stage and dialysis status. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for dosing in stage 3b CKD and reconcile it with guideline-directed dosing for heart failure. Next, I will examine data for eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², followed by eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and dialysis. After that, I need to check safety monitoring requirements and hyperkalemia management, including potassium binders. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, indication-specific dosing framework and highlight key caveats and alternatives like finerenone where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because "renal failure" spans stage 3b CKD through dialysis, and dosing and safety differ substantially across this spectrum. Stage 3b CKD corresponds to eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m², stage 4 to 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², and stage 5 to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis, and these strata carry different hyperkalemia risks and evidence bases for spironolactone use.

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence for stage 3b CKD, where the BARACK-D randomized trial tested spironolactone 25 mg daily versus usual care and found no cardiovascular benefit but frequent discontinuations due to safety events, including hyperkalemia and eGFR declines, with only about one-third remaining on therapy beyond 6 months; importantly, the trial excluded heart failure, so its applicability to HF populations is limited, and the authors concluded spironolactone should not be used in stage 3b CKD without a specific indication such as HF [^116ABNYM] [^1138uhNq] [^115dKGKX].

> Wait, let me verify the apparent eGFR decline signal in BARACK-D before I overinterpret it; the observed small eGFR decrease in the spironolactone arm was statistically significant but modest and likely reflects hemodynamic effects rather than structural kidney injury, and external critiques emphasize that short-term eGFR fluctuations can be within analytical variability and should be interpreted cautiously, especially when hard outcomes are neutral, as they were here [^115MNsMY] [^117SySqk].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed dosing for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, because that is the clearest scenario where benefits persist despite CKD. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HFSA guidance recommends initiating spironolactone at 25 mg daily if eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m² and reducing the starting dose by half to 25 mg every other day if eGFR is 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², with strict potassium and renal function monitoring; initiation is not recommended if eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, and therapy should be held or discontinued if potassium rises to 5.5 mEq/L or higher despite adjustments [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi] [^1144boag].

> Hold on, I should verify the FDA labeling nuances, because different formulations and updates can create confusion; the current FDA label provides dosing guidance for heart failure with eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² that aligns with guideline cautions, suggesting 25 mg every other day as a starting approach due to hyperkalemia risk, and it emphasizes close potassium and renal function monitoring, which reinforces the conservative stance in moderate CKD [^1144boag] [^112kryPo].

> Let me consider the eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² population, where evidence is sparse and guideline positions are restrictive; ACC/AHA/HFSA treat eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² as a contraindication to initiation, and the FDA labeling offers no specific dosing guidance for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reflecting insufficient safety and efficacy data in advanced CKD without dialysis, so routine use is not advised outside trials or exceptional circumstances [^111RKLXp] [^115ycMqJ].

> For dialysis-dependent patients, I should double-check the small randomized trials and meta-analyses; studies such as SPin-D and others suggest that low-dose spironolactone, typically 12.5–25 mg daily or 25 mg three times per week post-dialysis, can be used with careful monitoring, with no consistent signal for severe hyperkalemia at lower doses but a dose-related increase in potassium events at 50 mg daily, and no proven cardiovascular outcome benefit to date, so if used, it should be at conservative doses with close surveillance [^111aEACS] [^113dwyv5] [^114Xj9EG] [^112boqU3].

> I need to ensure the safety monitoring cadence is explicit and actionable; best practice is to check potassium and creatinine/eGFR about 3 days and 1 week after initiation, again at 4 weeks, and then periodically, with more frequent checks after dose changes or clinical instability; hold or reduce dose for potassium 5.5–5.9 mEq/L and discontinue for potassium ≥ 6.0–6.5 mEq/L depending on protocol, and be vigilant for hypotension and creatinine rises that meet predefined stop thresholds, as implemented in BARACK-D and echoed in guidelines [^1163x5ad] [^116HAUpi] [^117Y1Mmc].

> But wait, what if hyperkalemia emerges and the indication for MRA is strong, such as persistent HFrEF symptoms; in that case, potassium binders like patiromer can enable more persistent spironolactone use, with randomized data showing higher rates of remaining on spironolactone at 12 weeks when patiromer is coadministered in resistant hypertension with CKD, and expert commentary supporting binder use to maintain guideline-directed MRA therapy in appropriate HF patients [^112Quxte] [^112qMRjo].

> Let me synthesize a practical, indication-specific dosing framework while keeping the evidence caveats front and center. For stage 3b CKD without heart failure, avoid spironolactone given lack of benefit and high discontinuation rates in BARACK-D; for HFrEF with eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², start 25 mg every other day with close monitoring and uptitrate cautiously if tolerated; for eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², standard 25 mg daily initiation is reasonable with routine monitoring; for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² not on dialysis, avoid initiation; for hemodialysis, consider only 12.5–25 mg three times weekly or 12.5–25 mg daily with careful potassium surveillance and no proven outcome benefit yet [^116ABNYM] [^111RKLXp] [^1144boag] [^111aEACS] [^112boqU3] [^113dwyv5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about substituting finerenone indiscriminately; finerenone has robust cardiorenal benefits in diabetic CKD and a different hyperkalemia profile, but head-to-head data versus spironolactone are lacking and indications differ, so agent selection should be individualized to comorbidity profile, albuminuria, diabetes status, and access to monitoring and binders rather than assumed equivalence [^111JV4Pj] [^112VYsL6].

> Finally, I should confirm that my bottom line aligns with the totality of evidence and guidelines: in moderate CKD, spironolactone's risk–benefit is unfavorable for primary cardiovascular prevention, whereas in HFrEF with eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², cautious use at reduced dose with intensive lab monitoring is acceptable and can be life-saving; across all scenarios, meticulous potassium and renal function surveillance is non-negotiable, and potassium binders can be leveraged when MRA therapy is essential but hyperkalemia limits persistence [^116ABNYM] [^111RKLXp] [^112Quxte].

In renal failure, **start spironolactone at 12.5–25 mg every other day** for eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², and avoid initiation if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L [^111RKLXp] [^1144boag]. Monitor **potassium and renal function within 3 days, at 1 week, and monthly for the first 3 months**, then every 3–6 months; reduce dose or hold if potassium rises to 5.5–6.0 mEq/L, and stop if potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L or eGFR declines by > 25% [^116HAUpi] [^1163x5ad]. In dialysis, use 25 mg three times weekly post-dialysis with close potassium monitoring [^113dwyv5] [^112LCF1k]. These precautions minimize hyperkalemia and renal function decline while preserving cardiovascular benefit in appropriate patients [^1175aXgb].

## Recommended dosing in renal failure

### General principles

- **Start low and go slow**: Begin at the lowest effective dose and titrate cautiously based on response and safety labs [^116HAUpi].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function is essential to detect hyperkalemia and renal function decline early [^116HAUpi].
- **Adjust dose based on response**: Modify dose based on potassium levels, renal function, and clinical response [^116HAUpi].

---

### Specific dosing recommendations

| **Renal function (egfr)** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Dose adjustments** |
|-|-|-|
| > 50 mL/min/1.73 m² | 25 mg once daily | Increase to 50 mg daily if tolerated [^116HAUpi] |
| 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m² | 12.5–25 mg every other day | Adjust based on potassium and renal function [^116HAUpi] |
| < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Avoid initiation | Contraindicated due to high risk of hyperkalemia [^111RKLXp] |
| Dialysis patients | 25 mg three times weekly post-dialysis | Monitor potassium closely [^113dwyv5] |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

### Laboratory monitoring

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure serum potassium and renal function (eGFR) before initiation [^1163x5ad].
- **Early follow-up**: Recheck potassium and renal function within 3 days and again at 1 week after initiation or dose change [^1163x5ad].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monthly for the first 3 months, then every 3–6 months thereafter [^1163x5ad].
- **Hyperkalemia management**: Reduce dose or hold if potassium 5.5–6.0 mEq/L; discontinue if potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L [^116SSRJ7].

---

### Clinical monitoring

Watch for **symptoms of hyperkalemia** — muscle weakness, fatigue, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest — and monitor for **hypotension**, particularly in patients with low blood pressure or those on multiple antihypertensives [^1113pSGr].

---

## Risks and benefits

### Benefits

Cardiovascular benefits include **reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalizations** in HFrEF, even with impaired renal function [^1175aXgb]. Antiproteinuric effects include **reduced albuminuria**, though long-term renal outcome benefits are uncertain [^112ZAh8E].

---

### Risks

- **Hyperkalemia**: Increased risk, especially in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or baseline potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L [^111RKLXp].
- **Worsening renal function**: Risk of acute kidney injury, particularly at higher doses or with concomitant ACE inhibitors/ARBs [^115hwKXm].
- **Hypotension**: More common in patients with impaired renal function or those on multiple antihypertensives [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines**: Recommend MRAs for HFrEF if eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^111RKLXp].
- **ESC guidelines**: Recommend cautious use in CKD, with dose adjustments and close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^112PTqeS].
- **FDA labeling**: Emphasizes increased risk of hyperkalemia in renal impairment and recommends close monitoring [^112kryPo].

---

## Alternative therapies

- **Eplerenone**: A selective aldosterone antagonist with a lower risk of hyperkalemia, suitable for patients intolerant to spironolactone [^112Qh78D].
- **Finerenone**: A non-steroidal MRA with lower hyperkalemia risk, approved for diabetic kidney disease and showing cardiovascular and renal benefits [^111JV4Pj].
- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can help manage hyperkalemia, enabling continued MRA therapy [^112qMRjo].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Start 25 mg once daily, titrate to 50 mg if tolerated [^116HAUpi].
- **eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Start 12.5–25 mg every other day, adjust based on potassium and renal function [^117YJcLQ].
- **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²**: Avoid initiation due to high hyperkalemia risk [^111RKLXp].
- **Dialysis patients**: Use 25 mg three times weekly post-dialysis with close monitoring [^112boqU3].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent potassium and renal function checks, especially early in therapy [^116HAUpi].

---

Spironolactone can be used safely in patients with renal impairment when **started at low doses**, with **close monitoring** of potassium and renal function, and with dose adjustments based on lab results and clinical response.

In conclusion, among participants with stage 3b CKD, treatment with low-dose spironolactone was not associated with a reduction in mortality or cardiovascular events compared to usual care. Discontinuation from the study due to safety concerns was more common among participants randomized to spironolactone. This suggests that low-dose spironolactone should not generally be used in people with stage 3b CKD unless there is another explicit indication for the treatment.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

### Pharmacotherapy for heart failure in patients with renal insufficiency [^1161yzJX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and spironolactone improve survival in patients with heart failure. Because patients with heart failure and renal insufficiency have been underrepresented in these trials, little evidence is available to guide clinicians in the optimal management of patients with both conditions. Approximately one third to one half of patients with heart failure have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), and renal insufficiency is among the strongest predictors of mortality in patients with heart failure. Evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors to improve survival in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (GFR, 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), but there is little evidence with which to weigh the risks and benefits in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction. beta-Blockers improve survival in patients with heart failure, and their beneficial effect is unlikely to differ according to renal function. Spironolactone improves outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure, but renal insufficiency appears to increase risk for hyperkalemia and limits the use of the drug in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Future clinical trials in heart failure should include a representative number of patients with renal insufficiency to improve the evidence base and outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1138uhNq]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25 mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8 years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3 years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6 months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114Gzgri]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Power calculations

We determined that a sample size of 1,511 participants per group (3,022 total) would be required at 80% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in death or cardiovascular events over 3 years of follow-up, accounting for an anticipated treatment withdrawal rate of 13%. We chose to power the trial conservatively on a 20% risk reduction because this proposed treatment effect was around half the risk reduction observed in a trial of the aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, in patients with mild heart failure.

Statistical analysis

We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants who had undergone randomization except for those who were found to be ineligible for participation postrandomization. For the primary outcome, we report the HR and 95% CI for the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for randomized treatment allocation. The safety analysis included all participants who had actually received the treatment versus the total number of people receiving usual care.

We report the frequency and percentage of the proportion of participants that reached the primary endpoint, the time at risk in days and the incidence rate per 100 years at risk. A Kaplan–Meier curve is used to compare the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event between intervention groups. These analyses are repeated for each individual component of the primary endpoint (hospitalization, CVD and death).

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^1174zQFY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, recent evidence from the FIDELITY pooled analysis of finerenone trials demonstrates that cardiovascular and kidney benefits were maintained regardless of acute eGFR changes at month 1, with similar efficacy across patients experiencing > 10% eGFR decline, stable eGFR, or eGFR increases, confirming that early eGFR changes do not correlate with long‐term hard outcomes. We suggest focusing on clinically meaningful endpoints rather than over‐interpreting short‐term eGFR fluctuations.

We recommend the authors consider adopting more conservative language regarding renal function changes and acknowledge the limitations of short‐term eGFR monitoring. Future studies would benefit from incorporating confirmatory measurements, longer follow‐up periods and mechanistic assessments to better characterise true renal function changes with low‐dose spironolactone therapy.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^113PpUPA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether lower than target doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) were started at 15mg/day, and increased up to a maximum of 45mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 75years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2, and with potassium levels > 4.5mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median≈20mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death without significant heterogeneity between the study subgroups (P interaction > 0.1). Spironolactone discontinuation was associated with a two to fourfold higher risk of subsequent events.

Conclusion

Spironolactone (but not placebo) was used at lower doses among the elderly, those with renal dysfunction and with higher potassium levels. The effect of spironolactone was homogeneous across these subgroups. In patients unable to tolerate target doses, a low-dose strategy should be preferred to stopping treatment.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115dKGKX]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study BARACK-D was published by F D Richard Hobbs and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the BARACK-D study, the trial question was: what is the role of spironolactone in patients with stage 3b CKD? In the BARACK-D study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the BARACK-D study, the population was: 1372 patients (748 female, 624 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stage 3b CKD. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; T1DM; terminal disease; chronic HF or known LV systolic dysfunction; recent myocardial infarction; active cancer with < 1 year life expectancy or in palliative care; alcohol or drug abuse. In the BARACK-D study, the interventions were: n = 677 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg once daily plus usual care) n = 695 usual care (usual care alone). In the BARACK-D study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up (16.7% vs. 16%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.37). In the BARACK-D study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in CVD at 3 years (9.7% vs. 8.8%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.61) No significant difference in death at 3 years (6.2% vs. 5.5%; HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.7) Significant decrease in eGFR at 3 years (41.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 42 mL/min/1.73 m²; TE -1.14, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.37). In the BARACK-D study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant differences in hyperkalemia (24.7% vs. 13.4%), hypotension (7.4% vs. 4.7%), adverse events (83.0% vs. 50.7%). In the BARACK-D study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with stage 3b CKD, spironolactone was not superior to usual care with respect to first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, HF, TIA or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline at 3 year follow-up.

### Influence of baseline and worsening renal function on efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure: insights from RALES (randomized aldactone evaluation study) [^1175aXgb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the influence of baseline and worsening renal function (WRF) on the efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure (HF).

Background

Renal dysfunction or decline in renal function is a known predictor of adverse outcome in patients with HF, and treatment decisions are often on the basis of measures of renal function.

Methods

We used data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) in 1,658 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 35%. Participants were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg, which could be titrated to 50 mg, or placebo daily. Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Worsening renal function was defined as a 30% reduction in eGFR from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization.

Results

Individuals with reduced baseline eGFR exhibited similar relative risk reductions in all-cause death and the combined endpoint of death or hospital stays for HF as those with a baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and greater absolute risk reduction compared with those with a higher baseline eGFR (10.3% vs. 6.4%). Moreover, WRF (17% vs. 7% for spironolactone and placebo groups, p < 0.001) was associated with an increased adjusted risk of death in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.6) but not in those randomized to spironolactone (hazard ratio: 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.5, p interaction = 0.009). The risk of hyperkalemia and renal failure was higher in those with worse baseline renal function and those with WRF, particularly in the spironolactone arm, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained.

Conclusions

The absolute benefit of spironolactone was greatest in patients with reduced eGFR. Worsening renal function was associated with a negative prognosis, yet the mortality benefit of spironolactone was maintained.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^114DBddL]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of aldosterone antagonists — patient selection and renal function–based dosing — emphasizes that some who meet trial criteria "may need to be excluded" in practice for recent renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, particularly with insulin-requiring diabetes. In the elderly, "estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min should trigger a reduction of the initial dose of spironolactone to 12.5 mg daily or of eplerenone to 25 mg daily", and "aldosterone antagonists should not be given when creatinine is less than 30 mL per minute". Patients "chronically requiring high doses of diuretics without potassium replacement should be evaluated closely".

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia: a complication of spironolactone for heart failure in a patient with renal insufficiency [^111niG78]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Serum potassium concentration should be measured immediately before operation to detect hyperkalemia in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. Renal insufficiency, advanced age, potassium supplementation, decompensated congestive heart failure, and a spironolactone dose larger than 25 mg/d increase the risk of hyperkalemia as a consequence of spironolactone therapy.

Secondary clinical outcomes

There were no significant differences between groups for any of the individual components of the primary endpoint, including hospitalization (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.64–1.53, P = 0.970), CVD (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.80–1.61, P = 0.478) or death (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.70–1.70, P = 0.699; Table 2). In total, 6.0% of participants died, including 42 (6.2%) deaths among the intervention group and 38 (5.5%) among those randomized to usual care.

Among participants randomized to spironolactone compared to usual care, there was a small reduction in mean eGFR over follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, 95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37, P = 0.004; Table 3). A modest deterioration in mean eGFR was observed in the spironolactone arm at 6 months to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, which then remained stable at 1, 2 and 3 years. The mean eGFR in the control group was stable for up to 2 years and then a small decline to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 at year 3. Although small differences, these slightly lower mean eGFRs in the spironolactone participants were statistically significant at each follow-up time point (Table 3). Among those randomized to spironolactone, the adjusted treatment effects for eGFR at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, were −1.68 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −2.41 to −0.94), −2.33 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −3.08 to −1.58), −0.89 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.69 to −0.09) and −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37; Table 3).

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112RMVNt]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study TOPCAT was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the TOPCAT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF? In the TOPCAT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOPCAT study, the population was: 3445 patients (1775 female, 1670 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of < 3 years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events. In the TOPCAT study, the interventions were: n = 1722 spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) n = 1723 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOPCAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the TOPCAT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) No significant difference in aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5). In the TOPCAT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mmg/dL, or dialysis. significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%). In the TOPCAT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF.

### Spironolactone use in heart failure patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: is it safe? [^112u18aq]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but is contraindicated in renal dysfunction due to the risk of hyperkalemia. It is not known if patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis are at the same risk for hyperkalemia. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence evaluating the incidence of hyperkalemia with spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.

Hypothesis

Spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis may not lead to greater incidence of hyperkalemia.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PubMed databases up to January 2010 for English-language, human-subject clinical trials that evaluated the rate of hyperkalemia with spironolactone use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. Search terms included were "spironolactone", "eplerenone", "aldosterone antagonist", "heart failure", "kidney failure", "hemodialysis", "dialysis", and "renal replacement therapy".

Results

Six prospective trials demonstrated that spironolactone use was safe in ESRD patients on hemodialysis. The incidence of hyperkalemia with spironolactone treatment in these studies was similar to control groups. The studies involved a small population of compliant subjects who were at low risk for hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

Small pilot studies demonstrated that spironolactone treatment in ESRD patients on hemodialysis did not result in higher hyperkalemia rates. Larger studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results before spironolactone is routinely considered in hemodialysis patients.

Results

Participant disposition

In total, 1,985 participants attended a screening visit between 6 December 2013 and 31 August 2018, with 1,434 participants randomized into the study (Fig. 1). Of those randomized, 62 participants were identified as ineligible for the study by the supervising trials unit, including 33 participants who had been randomized to spironolactone and 29 randomized to usual care, leaving 1,372 participants who were included in the statistical analyses. The trial failed to recruit to the target, achieving 45% of the planned sample size. There were ten patients in the usual care arm who were initiated on spironolactone at some point during the study by their general practitioner (GP). At the time of randomization, the mean age of participants was 74.8 years (s.d. = 8.1) with 54.5% women (Table 1). There was a high burden of comorbid CVD among the population, including hypertension (76.7%), type 2 diabetes (24.3%), ischemic heart disease (17.4%) and atrial fibrillation (12.2%). The mean eGFR at baseline was 43.5 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2 (s.d. = 6.9) and ACR 1.5 mg mmol −1 (interquartile range (IQR) = 0.6–4.3). The majority of participants were prescribed either an ACEi (40.0%) or an ARB (36.6%). Only four participants were prescribed a sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. The study population was well-balanced between groups.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1113pSGr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Safety

In total, 455 participants randomized to spironolactone had treatment withdrawn because of safety concerns. The most common reason (n = 239, 35.4%) was a decrease in eGFR that met the prespecified stop criteria, followed by 128 (18.9%) participants being withdrawn due to potential treatment side effects.

The frequency of adverse events is shown in Table 4 (with classification by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes shown in Supplementary Table 1). An additional 33 participants who were randomized to spironolactone but who did not take any medication were included in the comparator usual care arm in this analysis. There were significantly more episodes of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing) experienced across all individuals in the spironolactone versus the control arm (49 versus 32, adjusted treatment effect 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04–2.46), P = 0.034), with 11 participants citing hypotension as a reason for withdrawal from treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Participants who received spironolactone experienced significantly more episodes of hyperkalemia (24.7%) overall versus 13.4% in the control arm, defined by a potassium of ≥ 5.5 mmol l −1. Most of these were mild (potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1) in both arms, but 11% of the raised potassium events that occurred were levels of ≥ 6 mmol l −1 and therefore required dose suspension or adjustment, and 8.0% (n = 54) of participants were withdrawn from spironolactone treatment for reasons related to hyperkalemia. Among patients who experienced hyperkalemia, the mean baseline eGFR was 41.9 mL min − 1 1.73 m −2 (s.d. 7.08) compared to a mean baseline eGFR of 43.9 mL min − 1 1.73 m −2 (s.d. 6.92) among those who did not experience hyperkalemia.

Monitoring of adverse events

For safety monitoring, adverse events were recorded at trial visits, and any adverse event that was considered related to the study medication as judged by a medically qualified member of the research team or the sponsor was followed up until resolution or until the event was considered stable. Serious adverse events were reported by participating sites to the Clinical Trials Unit within 24 h of discovery or notification of the event. The documentation was then reviewed by a medically qualified member of the trial team, who evaluated the report for causality and expectedness. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported to the competent authorities (MHRA in the UK), the Research Ethics Committee concerned and the host NHS trusts, within the timelines defined in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, 2004.

Specific 'stop rules' were set by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and took into consideration the established risks of spironolactone. We measured serum creatinine and potassium at every study visit. If a potassium result was between 5.5 and 5.9 mmol l −1, the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 25 mg on alternate days. If the result was between 6.0 and 6.4 mmol l −1, spironolactone was withheld for a week and then restarted on alternate days. Spironolactone was discontinued if there was a single potassium result ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Participants were also withdrawn from trial treatment if there was a reduction in eGFR of 20% or more between successive visits or 25% or more from baseline, a systolic blood pressure reading < 100 mm Hg or a symptomatic postural drop in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg. Physicians were strongly encouraged to manage participants' blood pressure according to the NICE guidelines on CKD and on hypertension, which recommended a target clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg.

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in acute heart failure: the ATHENA-HF randomized clinical trial [^112Rhmx3]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF.

Objective

To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction.

Interventions

High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function.

Results

A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36%) were women, 200 (55.5%) were white, 151 (42%) were black, 8 (2%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697–9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968–7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = 0.57). None of the secondary end point or day-30 all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization rate differed between the 2 groups. The changes in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. were similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adding treatment with high-dose spironolactone to usual care for patients with AHF for 96 hours was well tolerated but did not improve the primary or secondary efficacy end points.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II-IV symptoms if the eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L. Obtain careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and closely monitor thereafter to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency.

### Safety and cardiovascular efficacy of spironolactone in dialysis-dependent ESRD (SPin-D): a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial [^111aEACS]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of spironolactone is uncertain in end-stage renal disease. We randomized 129 maintenance hemodialysis patients to placebo (n = 51) or spironolactone 12.5 mg (n = 27), 25 mg (n = 26), or 50 mg (n = 25) daily for 36 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dosage trial to assess safety, tolerability and feasibility and to explore cardiovascular efficacy. The primary safety endpoints were hyperkalemia (potassium > 6.5 mEq/L) and hypotension requiring emergency department visit or hospitalization. Diastolic function was assessed by Doppler echocardiography. 125 participants (97%) completed dose escalation, with no significant difference in permanent study drug discontinuation between the groups (27.5% in placebo versus 16.7% in the combined spironolactone groups and 28% in the 50 mg group). Hyperkalemia frequency was similar between spironolactone and placebo (0.49 versus 0.50 events per patient-year) but demonstrated a significant linear trend due primarily to an increased event rate at the 50 mg dose (0.89 events per patient-year). The primary hypotension outcome was infrequent and similar with spironolactone and placebo (0.11 versus 0 events per patient-year). Gynecomastia was rare and did not differ significantly between groups. Change in diastolic function was similar with spironolactone and placebo. Spironolactone appears safe in carefully monitored maintenance hemodialysis patients, but did not affect cardiovascular parameters in this small study. Hyperkalemia occurs more frequently as dosage increases to 50 mg daily.

8.6	Use in Renal Impairment

ALDACTONE is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of hyperkalemia. Monitor potassium closely.

8.7	Use in Hepatic Impairment

ALDACTONE can cause sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance which may precipitate impaired neurological function, worsening hepatic encephalopathy and coma in patients with hepatic disease with cirrhosis and ascites. In these patients, initiate ALDACTONE in the hospital [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Clearance of spironolactone and its metabolites is reduced in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, start with lowest initial dose and titrate slowly [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

### Clinical benefit of spironolactone in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and severe renal dysfunction: data from the Korean heart failure registry [^117HCWrt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Backgrounds

We investigated the relationship between spironolactone use and all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients with severe renal dysfunction. The clinical benefit of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure (HF) has been described in several large randomized clinical trials. However, its clinical benefits have not been studied in hospitalized ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)).

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Korean Heart Failure Registry. We included 1,035 ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, all-cause mortality in the spironolactone-treated group was significantly lower than that in the nonspironolactone group (18.1% vs 24.9%, respectively, log rank P = 0.028). However, spironolactone use was not an independent predictor after adjusting other HF risk factors (hazard ratio 0.974, 95% CI 0.681–1.392, P = 0.884) and after propensity score matching (P = 0.115). In subgroup analysis, the clinical benefit of spironolactone use was preserved in women, prehospital spironolactone use, the chronic kidney disease stage 3b (eGFR 30–44 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), and the appropriate spironolactone use (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and K ≤ 5.0 mmol/L).

Conclusion

The spironolactone therapy was not beneficial in ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction after multivariable adjusting and propensity score matching. However, we reassured the current HF guidelines for spironolactone use and the clinical benefit in chronic kidney disease stage 3b should be assessed in future clinical trial.

### Spironolactone [^111NREs7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone oral suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Spironolactone oral suspension can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2, initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2, consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial daily dose is 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. In patients requiring titration above 100 mg, use another formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF and chronic kidney Disease [^115hwKXm]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the association between baseline renal function and the net benefit of spironolactone in patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Background

Guidelines recommend consideration of spironolactone to reduce HF hospitalization in HFpEF. However, spironolactone may increase risk for hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods

This investigation analyzed data from patients enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) Americas study (N = 1,767) to examine the association between the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest, as well as safety outcomes, including hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and permanent drug discontinuation for adverse events (AEs). Variations in the efficacy and safety of spironolactone according to eGFR were examined in Cox models using interaction terms.

Results

The incidence of both the primary outcome and drug-related AEs increased with declining eGFR. Compared with placebo, across all eGFR categories, spironolactone was associated with lower relative risk for the primary efficacy outcome and for hypokalemia, but higher relative risk for hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and drug discontinuation. During 4-year follow-up, the absolute risk for AEs that prompted drug discontinuation was amplified in the lower eGFR categories, which suggested heightened risk for drug intolerance with declining renal function.

Conclusions

Although consistent efficacy of spironolactone was observed across the range of eGFR, the risk of AEs was amplified in the lower eGFR categories. These data supported use of spironolactone to treat HFpEF patients with advanced chronic kidney disease only when close laboratory surveillance is possible.

### Tailoring mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy in heart failure patients: are we moving towards a personalized approach? [^116wrwwt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of personalized medicine is to offer a tailored approach to each patient in order to provide the most effective therapy, while reducing risks and side effects. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) has demonstrated major benefits in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), results with challenging inconsistencies in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and 'neutral' preliminary results in acute heart failure. Data derived from landmark trials are generally applied in a 'one size fits all' manner and the development and implementation of more personalized MRA management would offer the potential to improve outcomes and reduce side effects. However, the personalization of pharmacotherapy regimens remains poorly defined in the cardiovascular field (in light of current knowledge) and until further trials targeting specific subpopulations have been conducted, MRAs should be provided to the great majority of HFrEF patients in the absence of contraindication. Spironolactone should be considered for symptomatic HFpEF patients with elevated natriuretic peptides. In the near future, trials should target HFrEF patients using exclusion criteria sourced from landmark trials (e.g. severe renal impairment), select more homogeneous HFpEF populations (e.g. with elevated BNP and structural abnormalities on echocardiography), and determine which patients are likely to benefit from MRAs (e.g. according to prespecified biomarkers).

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^117SySqk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the study by Amini et al. on low‐dose spironolactone in diabetic kidney disease. While we appreciate the authors' investigation of safety at reduced dosing, we believe some aspects of their eGFR interpretation need clarification from a nephrology perspective.

The authors report a statistically significant increase in eGFR from 71.83 ± 19.09 to 74.25 ± 17.81 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (p = 0.042) and describe this as renal function improvement. This interpretation warrants careful consideration:

First, creatinine measurement has inherent analytical variability, and small changes in calculated eGFR may not reflect true kidney function changes. The magnitude of change (3.4%) falls within the expected coefficient of variation for creatinine‐based eGFR calculations. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 37 studies with 2770 participants demonstrate that eGFR fluctuations of 5.0%–5.2% likely represent analytical noise rather than clinically meaningful change. Such small variations should be interpreted cautiously without confirmatory measurements.

Second, we note that the concurrent decrease in serum creatinine (1.08 ± 0.23 to 1.01 ± 0.23 mg/dL) is difficult to explain mechanistically, as spironolactone does not enhance creatinine clearance or reduce creatinine generation. Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists characteristically reduce GFR through hemodynamic effects, including afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration pressure. An increase in eGFR contradicts established pharmacological mechanisms.

Third, previous studies with identical 12.5 mg spironolactone dosing have consistently shown stable or slightly decreased eGFR, not increases. For example, Oiwa et al.'s multicenter randomised controlled trial demonstrated that eGFR remained stable from 64.2 ± 17.6 to 60.2 ± 16.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the spironolactone group while achieving significant albuminuria reduction. This rigorous randomised controlled trial design with proper control group provides higher‐quality evidence than the current pre‐post intervention study. The present findings are inconsistent with this established pattern from controlled trials.

### Potassium binders for patients with heart failure? The real enlightenment of the DIAMOND trial [^111bwiFw]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The RALES and EMPHASIS-HF trials

The RALES trial studied patients with severe HFrEF not generally receiving beta-blockers, who were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg/day or placebo for a mean of 24 months. In a pilot trial, doses from 12.5 mg/day to 75 mg/day had produced meaningful decreases in natriuretic peptides, with minimal incremental effect but more hyperkalaemia at doses > 25 mg/day. Accordingly, 25 mg/day was designated as the target dose for spironolactone in RALES, and it is the target dose in clinical practice. In RALES, 50 mg/day could be prescribed if, after 8 weeks, patients experienced progression of heart failure without hyperkalaemia. However, up-titration did not occur in most patients; the mean dose was 26 mg/day. At this dose, spironolactone reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 35%. A serum potassium concentration ≥ 5.5 mmol/L was seen in 5.5% of the placebo group, in 13.5% taking 25 mg/day, and in 41% taking 50 mg daily. Serious hyperkalaemia was observed in 1–2% of patients.

The EMPHASIS-HF trial enrolled patients with mild HFrEF treated with beta-blockers, who received eplerenone 25 mg/day or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 50 mg/day for a mean of 21 months, if they had preserved renal function. The doses were halved in those with chronic kidney disease. There is a 2:1 to 4:1 ratio between pharmacodynamically equivalent doses of eplerenone and spironolactone. Eplerenone reduced all-cause mortality by 24% and hospitalizations for heart failure by 42%. A serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mmol/L was reported in 7.2% and 11.8% of the placebo and eplerenone groups, respectively. A serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L was noted in ∼2%.

### Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure [^114AAF12]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone.

Methods

We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) > 5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr ≥ 2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared.

Results

Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls.

Conclusions

Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115MU5Yp]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

In addition, the recruiting physician could discontinue a participant from the study treatment at any time if it was considered necessary for any reason, including the following general rules:
Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening).
Significant protocol deviation as judged by the trial physician.
Significant noncompliance with treatment regimen or study requirements.
An adverse event that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Lost to follow-up.

Each participant also had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of any of the following events: death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death or failed sudden death, defined as a cardiac arrest where the participant was successfully resuscitated), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or PAD, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, natriuretic peptides, ACR and eGFR recorded in the primary care record across follow-up, as well as rates of adverse events, including hyperkalemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia was considered serum potassium of 5.5 mmol l −1 or greater, subcategorized as 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1, 6.0–6.4 mmol l −1 and ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a ≥ 30% increase in creatinine from baseline, a drop of ≥ 25% in eGFR from baseline or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR from the previous result.

An independent panel of three senior clinicians adjudicated each of the endpoints, using all the available clinical information independently of each other, with discussion determining the endpoint where there was initial disagreement.

At 1-year follow-up, there was an initial relative reduction in systolic blood pressure among those randomized to spironolactone (adjusted treatment effect −2.66 mm Hg, 95% CI: −4.43 to −0.90, P = 0.003). However, there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between groups by the end of follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.69 mm Hg, 95% CI: −3.55 to 0.16, P = 0.074; Table 3).

At 3 years, mean ACR levels had worsened in both arms from means of 4.9–10.5 mg mmol −1 and 5.3–8.2 mg mmol −1 in the spironolactone versus control arms, respectively.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^112qMRjo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Potassium binding agents and RAS/MRA continuation — trial data indicate that in the 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled AMBER trial, 86% of patiromer versus 66% of placebo-treated participants were able to remain on spironolactone at week 12. The DIAMOND trial (randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled) evaluated continued patiromer to maintain target doses of RAS inhibitor versus stopping and was associated with a higher rate of achieving target dose while maintaining normokalemia; participants had stage G3 or G4 CKD before randomization. Additional reporting noted maintaining at least 50% of target mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist dose, but only 44% completed 12 weeks of therapy and only 17% completed 54 weeks of therapy.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^112Quxte]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

The AMBER trial demonstrated that concomitant use of patiromer enabled the more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with resistant hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease. We report herein the pre-specified subgroup analysis in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either placebo or patiromer (8.4 g once daily), in addition to open-label spironolactone (starting at 25mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Dose titrations were permitted after 1 week for patiromer/placebo and after 3weeks for spironolactone. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference at week 12 in the proportion of patients on spironolactone. Efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed in all randomized patients (intention to treat). A total of 295 patients were enrolled, of whom 132 (45%) had HF. In the HF subgroup, 68.1% of patients receiving placebo remained on spironolactone at week 12, compared with 84.1% of patients receiving patiromer (P = 0.0504). The reason for discontinuation from spironolactone use was hyperkalaemia in the majority of both groups. There was no significant interaction between the subgroups with HF and without HF (P = 0.8085) for the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

Consistent with the overall AMBER trial results, this pre-specified subgroup analysis in patients with HF, resistant hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease demonstrated that patiromer enabled more persistent use of spironolactone by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia.

### Impact of worsening renal function related to medication in heart failure [^114pbfJ5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Renal failure is a major challenge in treating heart failure (HF) patients. HF medication may deteriorate renal function, but the impact thereof on outcome is unknown. We investigated the effects of HF medication on worsening renal function (WRF) and the relationship to outcome.

Methods and Results

This post-hoc analysis of TIME-CHF (NT-proBNP-guided vs. symptom-guided management in chronic HF) included patients with LVEF ≤ 45% and ≥ 1 follow-up visit (n = 462). WRF III was defined as a rise in serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dL (i.e. 44.2 µmol/L) at any time during the first 6 months. Four classes of medication were considered: loop diuretics, beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockers, and spironolactone. Functional principal component analysis of daily doses was used to comprehend medication over time. All-cause mortality after 18 months was the primary outcome. Interactions between WRF, medication, and outcome were tested. Patients with WRF III received on average higher loop diuretic doses (P = 0.0002) and more spironolactone (P = 0.02), whereas beta-blockers (P = 0.69) did not differ and lower doses of RAS-blockers were given (P = 0.09). There were significant interactions between WRF III, medicationn and outcome. Thus, WRF III was associated with poor prognosis if high loop diuretic doses were given (P = 0.001), but not with low doses (P = 0.29). The opposite was found for spironolactone (poor prognosis in the case of WRF III with no spironolactone, P < 0.0001; but not with spironolactone, P = 0.31). Beta-blockers were protective in all patients (P < 0.001), but most in those with WRF III (P < 0.05 for interaction). RAS-blockade was associated with improved outcome (P = 0.006), irrespective of WRF III.

Conclusion

Based on this analysis, it may be hypothesized that high doses of loop diuretics might have detrimental effects, particularly in combination with significant WRF, whereas spironolactone and beta-blockers might be protective in patients with WRF.

Baseline visit

Potentially eligible patients were invited to attend a baseline clinic at a trial practice where the trial was explained. Following consent, a baseline assessment was performed to collect key data for the study, including demographics, self-reported gender, medication, comorbidities and quality of life scores. Blood tests were taken for hematology and biochemistry, including renal function and an ECG was performed if available at the study site. The baseline visit was also used to confirm the eligibility of participants.

Randomization

Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to usual care or usual care plus treatment with spironolactone 25 mg once daily by their usual doctor. Randomization was carried out using Sortition, a validated randomization system developed within our Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit. Participants were enrolled from 329 general practice sites across the UK. We stratified by GP practice to ensure a balance of the two arms within each practice.

Blinding

BARACK-D was a PROBE trial, in which neither the participants nor their treating healthcare professionals were blinded to their treatment allocation. Advantages of the PROBE design include lower costs and a closer similarity to usual medical care, which is thought to mean such studies provide results that are more directly applicable to routine medical care. The investigators and independent endpoint committee were blinded to the participants' treatment arm until the completion of the trial.

Trial procedures

Participants returned for the first study visit 7 days after randomization if they were in the usual care arm, or 7 days after starting spironolactone if not. Subsequent assessment continued for both treatment arms for a further 36 months with follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 12 and 26 and then every 13–156 weeks. The list of different measurements taken at each follow-up is described in the study protocol paper. All study visits were conducted at participants' own general practice sites.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113sQxRC]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — spironolactone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist): In TOPCAT, the composite of death, aborted cardiac death, and HF hospitalization showed a small, non-significant reduction (HR, 0.89), while HF hospitalization was reduced (HR, 0.83) and hyperkalemia and creatinine increases were more common; efficacy was observed in the Americas (HR 0.83) but not Russia-Georgia (HR 1.10). Analyses suggest potential benefit in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF patients meeting LVEF ≥ 45%, elevated BNP or HF admission within 1 year, eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and follow-up; post hoc analysis suggested greater efficacy at the lower end of the LVEF spectrum.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^113bPnR2]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinicians at participating practices were encouraged to manage all participants' blood pressure according to NICE guidelines, and the mean results suggested that most participants achieved a reduction in systolic blood pressure across follow-up regardless of the randomization group. Patients in both arms had adjustments made to their blood pressure treatment, and this may have diluted the treatment effect of spironolactone, where some potential reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality would be expected to be achieved through hypertension control.

Recruitment was challenging for several reasons. We found there were fewer eligible patients than anticipated at participating practices, a relatively low response rate to take part in the study among eligible patients and difficulty recruiting additional new practices to the study. The study was designed so that participants would attend 15 study visits across 3 years. People with CKD are typically older with a high burden of multiple long-term conditions and may have been put off volunteering for the study because of concerns around the number of study visits, their own medication burden, the interaction of spironolactone with their current treatment, potential side effects from the drug or issues with mobility and access to healthcare services for follow-up. Future trials could consider using more routinely collected health data to reduce the burden of appointments and demands on study participants in the future to improve recruitment.

Future research could seek to determine if there is a treatment effect from nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, among a broader population of patients with CKD, such as people without type 2 diabetes or significant albuminuria, to determine whether the positive findings reported in the FIDELITY study could be replicated more widely. Given the high incidence of hyperkalemia associated with spironolactone, other antihypertensive agents, such as ACEi or ARB, may continue to be considered as treatments for blood pressure in preference to MRA in people with CKD. However, one benefit of spironolactone compared to finerenone is its relative effectiveness in reducing blood pressure. A future trial could investigate whether spironolactone could prevent the progression of CKD or reduce vascular events if it were combined with a potassium-binding agent to reduce discontinuation rates due to hyperkalemia.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111RKLXp]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

### Safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients receiving hemodialysis [^112LCF1k]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature supporting the safe use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) in patients with end-stage renal disease who are receiving hemodialysis.

Data Sources

A review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE (1950 through week 2 of February 2012) using the key words and MeSH terms mineralocorticoid antagonists, aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone, or eplerenone combined with dialysis, renal disease, or kidney disease.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies eligible for inclusion evaluated the impact of MRAs on serum potassium levels in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis. Data related to the patient populations and outcomes of interest were extracted from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Ten studies were included in this review (spironolactone, 9; eplerenone, 1) and reported on the impact of MRAs on potassium levels in this population. In aggregate, the studies, with spironolactone doses ranging from 25 mg 3 times/week after dialysis to 300 mg/day and eplerenone doses of 25 mg twice daily, have shown little increases in serum potassium, particularly with the lower doses. The overall incidence of severe hyperkalemia was low. The literature base is limited by significant methodologic weaknesses of the studies, including low patient numbers, short follow-up periods, and lack of a blinded control group.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests that MRAs may be used safely in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis, although additional large controlled trials are needed before definitive treatment recommendations can be made.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^112ExzFr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although it is possible that our study failed to detect a treatment effect of spironolactone because of the comparatively small sample size, there is no suggestion of this from the data. Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone discontinued treatment within the first 6 months, largely due to them meeting prespecified 'stop' criteria, such as prespecified reductions in renal function. The high number of participants who discontinued spironolactone treatment at an early stage may be important in explaining our results and implies that poor tolerability of spironolactone is a barrier to its use in this population. The difference in results between the finerenone trials and the BARACK-D trial may be explained by the differences in tolerability and efficacy of spironolactone as a steroidal MRA compared to the nonsteroidal MRA, finerenone. Finerenone may have additional benefits compared to spironolactone, such as an antifibrotic effect in the heart and inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the kidney. Finerenone is also associated with a low risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension, meaning discontinuation rates are likely to be lower than for spironolactone, and more participants are able to continue on treatment.

The differences in trial results may also partly relate to differences in the study populations. The BARACK-D trial population were mainly older participants (mean age of 74.8 years versus median age of 64.8 years in the FIDELITY study), with CKD mainly defined by age-related kidney impairment. In contrast, the finerenone trial populations involved CKD participants mainly defined by kidney damage in the context of diabetes. The mean baseline eGFR in our study was lower than the FIDELITY study (43.5 versus 57.5 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2), but 98.2% of those in the FIDELITY study had moderate to significant proteinuria, compared to a mean baseline urinary ACR of just 1.5 mg mmol −1 (IQR = 0.6–4.3) in BARACK-D. Despite the encouraging results of finerenone, our study suggests that the results cannot be immediately applied to older populations with CKD without diabetes or albuminuria.

### Renal function stratified dose comparisons of eplerenone versus placebo in the EMPHASIS-HF trial [^114mtCuR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current heart failure guidelines recommend target eplerenone dose of 50mg/day. We have examined the effect of different eplerenone doses based on pre-specified renal function stratification in the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF).

Methods and Results

In EMPHASIS-HF, the target dose of eplerenone/placebo was stratified at randomization according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 50mg/day if eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2 and ≤ 25mg/day if eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2. Patients remained within these dose ranges during the trial (as per stratification). The primary outcome was a composite of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Eplerenone was superior to placebo within each respective eGFR stratum [eplerenone vs. placebo in the eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum: hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–0.74; and eplerenone vs. placebo in the eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum: HR0.62, 95% CI 0.49–0.78; P interaction = 0.89]. Despite receiving lower eplerenone doses, patients in the eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum more often had hyperkalaemia, renal failure events, and drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

In EMPHASIS-HF the eplerenone dose was stratified according to renal function and the treatment effect was not influenced by renal function: 25mg/day in patients with eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 was as effective as 50mg/day in patients with eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2. However, patients with impaired renal function experienced more adverse events, despite reveiving lower eplerenone doses. Current guidelines do not recommend tailoring the dose of eplereone according to renal function but the current data suggest they should.

### When to use spironolactone, eplerenone or finerenone in the spectrum of cardiorenal diseases [^112VYsL6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease frequently coexists with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, and this dual presence significantly amplifies the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and common CV risk factors contribute to the increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors, which in turn can drive the progression of chronic CV-kidney disorders. The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient outcomes in cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or after a myocardial infarction, but have limited value in patients with chronic kidney disease. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has now established itself as a foundational guideline-recommended therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. To date, these pharmacological agents have been developed in distinct patient populations. The consequences of their distinct pharmacological profiles necessitate further consideration. They have not undergone testing across the entire spectrum of cardiorenal scenarios, and the evidence base is currently being complemented with ongoing trials. In this review, we aim to synthesize the existing body of evidence and chart the future trajectory for the use of spironolactone, eplerenone and finerenone in improving clinical outcomes across the diverse spectrum of cardiorenal diseases. By consolidating the current state of knowledge, we seek to provide valuable insights for informed decision making in the management of patients with these complex and interconnected conditions.

### Efficacy and safety of a low-sodium diet and spironolactone in patients with stage 1–3a chronic kidney disease: a pilot study [^117VihTi]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Under low sodium intake conditions, ARB combined with SPL has no additional benefits on lowering urine protein compared with ARB alone. It is unnecessary to add on SPL for patients with satisfying sodium restriction, thus avoiding the adverse events of SPL. In patients with poor sodium restriction, supplementation of low-dose SPL might show a therapeutic benefit on lowering 24-h urine protein. The combination of short-term low-dose SPL and ARB is safe in patients with stage 1–3a CKD, but blood potassium must be carefully monitored.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114mcang]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Post hoc analyses

The slow rate of recruitment meant the follow-up of earlier recruits was longer than planned, which would have increased the chance of competing risks influencing the primary outcomes of interest. We, therefore, performed a post hoc per-protocol sensitivity analysis restricted to events observed in 3 years of follow-up of participants, as originally planned (Extended Data Fig. 4). This analysis showed no difference in rates of death, new-onset CVD or hospitalization in these participants with CKD stage 3b receiving spironolactone compared to usual care (Extended Data Fig. 4). Because of the late correction of PAD in the composite primary outcome (Methods), we also performed a post hoc sensitivity of the primary analysis with and without PAD, which showed no difference (Extended Data Fig. 5).

In the post hoc conditional power calculations, the average conditional probability power was 30.4% when event rates were simulated based on the previous data used to inform our sample size calculation, but only 11.8% when simulated based on the observed event rate within our study.

Finally, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of the primary outcome and safety analysis by participants' gender. The HR for the primary outcome among women was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.77–1.71) and among men was 0.97 (0.68–1.38; Extended Data Table 3). Safety events were similar between men and women (Extended Data Tables 4 and 5), although the trial was not powered to detect differences between genders.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114uSgjs]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

There was no significant difference in total healthcare resource use costs comparing between treatment groups at any follow-up time point nor a significant difference in the subcategories of primary care, secondary care or medication costs. Total mean healthcare resource use costs at 3-year follow-up for people randomized to spironolactone were £1,080 compared to £1,136 with usual care, a mean difference of −£56 (bootstrapped 95% CI: −£463 to £378, P = 0.796). There was no difference in mean EuroQol five-dimensions five-levels (EQ-5D-5L) scores between the two treatment arms at baseline, 6-month, 1-year or 2-year follow-up. However, by 3-year follow-up, spironolactone was associated with an increased mean score (0.751) compared to usual care (0.719) that was statistically significant (mean difference 0.032, 95% CI: 0.001–0.060, P = 0.037). There was no significant difference in Kidney Disease Quality of Life scores between groups across follow-up, although there was a statistically significant difference in favor of usual care for the burden of kidney disease component of the score at 1-year (spironolactone 91.0, usual care 93.2; P = 0.017) and a statistically significant difference in favor of spironolactone in the physical composite scale at 3-years in the complete case analysis (spironolactone 42.9, usual care 39.6; P = 0.008).

### How prevalent is hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction during treatment with spironolactone in patients with congestive heart failure? [^1126CiVs]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with spironolactone (SPL) is beneficial in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). In the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study SPL was well tolerated, particularly with regard to renal function and serum K(+) levels. Our aim was to investigate whether the reported low frequency of adverse effects during SPL treatment in a heart failure study population could be confirmed in an unselected heart failure outpatient cohort and to identify potential predictors of harmful effects.

Methods and Results

We investigated 125 consecutive patients with CHF recruited from our heart failure clinic. Inclusion criteria were LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) ≤ 45% and treatment with SPL. Blood tests were performed bimonthly or more frequently if necessary. Outcomes measures were (1) increases in serum K(+) to > 5,0, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 mmol/L, respectively, and (2) rise in serum creatinine to 120%, 150%, and 200% of baseline, respectively. Mean age was 72.9 years (range 46.5 to 90.6 years); 27% were women. The New York Heart Association class distribution was: I, 6%; II, 44%; III, 46%; and IV, 4%. Mean LVEF was 29 ± 5%. Other medication included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in 86% and beta-blockers in 39%. At baseline, serum creatinine levels were 117.6 ± 6.5 (mean ± standard deviation; micromol/L, normal < 130) and serum K(+) was 4.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L. The mean follow-up period was 11 months, and the cumulative observation period was 73 SPL treatment years. Mean peak serum-creatinine was 167.6 micromol/L ± 11.9 (45% increase from baseline) and mean peak serum K(+) was 5.0 ± 0.4 mmol/L (21% increase from baseline). Sixty patients were already on SPL when admitted to the CHF clinic. The remainder were initiated on SPL. During the follow-up period 36% of the patients developed hyperkalemia (> 5 mmol/L), with 10% having serum K(+) > 6 mmol/L. An increase in serum creatinine of > 20% was seen in 55%, and in 24% an increase of > 50% was found. These alterations in serum creatinine and serum K(+) were not significantly more frequent in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers or different doses of SPL.

Conclusion

SPL adverse effects (impaired renal function, increase in serum K(+)) are much more prevalent in our elderly CHF patient population than previously reported. The recommendations from our study are that (1) particular caution is mandated in elderly patients with an LVEF < 20%, (2) potassium supplementation should be discontinued, (3) changes in body weight should raise concern, and (4) a dose-adjustment of the concomitant conventional diuretic regime should be considered. Care should be given to the frequent monitoring of electrolytes and renal parameters.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^111ppEuw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

In the HF subgroup, one serious AE occurred in each of three patients receiving placebo [hypersensitivity, renal colic, and aortic rupture (the serious AE leading to death)]. In the subgroup without HF, one serious AE occurred in each of two patients; one receiving placebo (renal failure), and one receiving patiromer (humerus fracture).

In the HF subgroup, rates of AEs indicative of worsening kidney function were consistent with those in the overall AMBER population. These included AEs of renal failure (0.8% in HF and 1.7% in the overall population), renal impairment (6.8% in HF and 7.8% overall), CKD (0% in HF and 0.7% overall), and nephropathy (0% in HF and 0.3% overall). AEs indicative of worsening kidney function led to spironolactone withdrawal or dose reduction in 8% of HF patients (five patients in the placebo group and six patients in the patiromer group). In patients without HF, AEs indicative of worsening kidney function led to spironolactone withdrawal or dose reduction in 6% of patients (four patients in the placebo group and six patients in the patiromer group). Mean changes in eGFR and urine albumin/creatinine ratio are shown in online supplementary Table S6. In HF patients, post‐baseline declines in eGFR of more than 30% occurred in 16% and 24% of patients in the placebo and patiromer groups, respectively; one HF patient on placebo had an eGFR decline of more than 50%. As in the overall population, among the HF patients with baseline eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, none had declines in eGFR of more than 50% and none went on dialysis during the study.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^111vxo2a]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Schoenfeld residuals were conducted for the primary outcome and confirmed that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated.

Natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure were each analyzed by fitting a linear mixed effects model to the data, with the endpoint measure at all available postrandomization follow-up time points as the dependent variable. The model was adjusted for randomized treatment allocation, assessment time point, baseline measurement of the respective variable of interest and interaction between randomized treatment allocation and assessment time point to allow the treatment effect to be estimated at each time point as fixed effects and a random intercept for each participant to account for the repeated measures on the same participant.

The mixed effects model is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption; that is, the probability of a value being missing depends on the variables included in the model. The MAR assumption was tested for natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure at 3 years by analyzing each baseline covariate using a logistic regression model to determine which (if any) are associated with missingness. The respective baseline factors found to be associated with missingness were then included in the model as additional fixed effects.

The normality assumptions of the linear mixed effects model were assessed by plotting a histogram of the natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure at each time point split by randomized group, a histogram of the model residuals, an inverse normal plot of the standardized model residuals and a scatter plot of the fitted values versus the model residuals.

We performed a post hoc, on-treatment analysis given the high proportion of participants in the intervention arm who had stopped spironolactone by the end of follow-up and a post hoc analysis of the outcomes censored at 3 years to explore any competing risk effects given the longer than planned mean follow-up. These were intended as exploratory analyses only, to consider whether any benefit might be conferred for participants who are able to tolerate the treatment longer-term and determine any medium-term treatment effects.

The trial failed to recruit to target. We therefore also performed a post hoc conditional power calculation to inform the likelihood of finding a significant association between spironolactone treatment and our primary outcome had the trial achieved its recruitment goal. To calculate conditional power, the remaining data for the number of participants that we had planned to recruit were simulated first based on the predicted event rates used to inform the original power calculation and then using the observed event rates from our study.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^112PTqeS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite adherence to a combination of at least three optimally dosed antihypertensive medications, one of which is a diuretic. 1, 2 The prevalence of resistant hypertension is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Resistant hypertension worsens the cardiovascular prognosis of CKD 3 and is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of heart failure (HF). 4 Registry data in 1288 patients with HF showed that the percentage of resistant hypertension was 13.7%. 5

The latest European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines, based in part on the PATHWAY‐2 trial in resistant hypertension, 6 recommend that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone be the first drug added when a three‐drug combination has failed to control hypertension. 2 However, this recommendation is limited to patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a serum potassium < 4.5 mmol/L because of the concern of hyperkalaemia in patients with more advanced CKD. 2 Among patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), MRAs have been shown to reduce mortality, and as such have Level 1 evidence for use and are one of the cornerstones of therapeutics in HFrEF. 7, 8 In the US, guidelines also recommend consideration of spironolactone in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). 7, 9 Despite these strong recommendations, the concern of inducing hyperkalaemia is a major barrier to the implementation of these recommendations 9, 10 and more broadly for MRA use in patients with cardiorenal diseases, including those with resistant hypertension. 11, 12

The AMBER trial evaluated the use of the potassium binder patiromer to allow more persistent use of spironolactone in patients with advanced CKD and resistant hypertension. 13 Patiromer enabled more persistent use of spironolactone in the overall AMBER population by reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia. 13 We report herein the pre‐specified subgroup analysis in HF patients from AMBER.

American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Run-in phase

For those patients wanting to take part but not immediately eligible because they are either on existing diuretic therapy or not taking ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy or taking both of these agents, a 4- to 6-week run-in phase is used. For patients on existing loop or thiazide diuretic therapy who wish to take part in the trial, after obtaining consent, diuretic therapy is stopped, and the patient is reviewed after 4 weeks to ensure that he/she meets the eligibility criteria (Table I). For patients not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, an ACE inhibitor or ARB of the physician's choice is introduced and titrated to a well-tolerated therapeutic dose over a 4-week period. The patient is then reviewed to ensure eligibility. For patients on dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy, after obtaining consent, either the ACE inhibitor or the ARB is stopped. Patients are then reviewed to ensure eligibility. Those patients who fulfill all entry criteria are consented and randomized into the main SPIRO-CKD trial.

Randomization

Once informed consent is received and the baseline assessments completed, patients are entered into the main SPIRO-CKD trial. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either spironolactone (25 mg once a day) or chlorthalidone (half a 50-mg tablet once a day, as there are no 25-mg tablets available for use in the UK) for 40 weeks without blinding. A secure central randomization service was provided by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (University of Birmingham) using a computer-generated program, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to the important clinical variables of blood pressure, age, and gender. Compliance with treatment is monitored by study coordinators using tablet counting.

### Rationale and design of ARTS: a randomized, double-blind study of BAY 94–8862 in patients with chronic heart failure and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease [^1127q9bs]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

BAY 94–8862 is a novel, non-steroidal, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with greater selectivity than spironolactone and stronger mineralocorticoid receptor binding affinity than eplerenone. The aims of the MinerAlocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS; NCT01345656) are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAY 94–8862 in patients with heart failure associated with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to examine the effects on biomarkers of cardiac and renal function. Methods ARTS is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study divided into two parts. In part A, oral BAY 94–8862 [2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily (o.d.)] is compared with placebo in ∼60 patients with HFREF and mild CKD. Outcome measures include serum potassium concentration, biomarkers of renal injury, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and albuminuria. Part B compares BAY 94–8862 (2.5, 5, or 10 mg o.d., or 5 mg twice daily), placebo, and open-label spironolactone (25–50 mg o.d.) in ∼360 patients with HFREF and moderate CKD. Outcome measures include the change in serum potassium concentration with BAY 94–8862 vs. placebo (primary endpoint) and vs. spironolactone, safety and tolerability, biomarkers of cardiac and renal function or injury, eGFR, and albuminuria. BAY 94–8862 pharmacokinetics are also assessed. Perspectives ARTS is the first phase II clinical trial of BAY 94–8862 and is expected to provide a wealth of information on BAY 94–8862 in patients with HFREF and CKD, including the optimal dose range for further studies.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and beta-blocker initiation — refractory heart failure (HF): treatment with either type of drug should not be initiated in patients who have systolic blood pressures less than 80 mm Hg or who have signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, and patients should not be started on a beta-blocker if they have significant fluid retention or if they recently required treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Treatment with an ACEI or beta-blocker should be initiated in very low doses, and patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of intolerance, and clinical trials suggest that even low doses may provide important benefits. For patients who cannot tolerate ACEIs or beta-blockers, a combination of nitrates and hydralazine has been reported to have favorable effects on survival in mild to moderate symptoms not taking an ACEI or beta-blocker. Spironolactone has been reported to prolong life and reduce HF hospitalization in advanced disease, but the evidence was derived in patients with preserved renal function, and the drug can produce dangerous hyperkalemia in impaired renal function. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are frequently considered as alternatives to ACEIs because of the low incidence of cough and angioedema, it is not clear that ARBs are as effective as ACEIs, and they are as likely as ACEIs to produce hypotension or renal insufficiency.

### The spironolactone initiation registry randomized interventional trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (SPIRRIT-HFpEF): rationale and design [^112Qh78D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.

MRA dose and persistence in the MRA population

Patients in the MRA population were almost exclusively treated with spironolactone (≥ 96%); the median dose of spironolactone prescribed was 25 mg (Additional file 1: Table S4). Of those few patients (2.6–4.0%) who were prescribed eplerenone the median dose was 50 mg in the non-HF cohorts and 25 mg in the cohorts with HF. One-year persistence with spironolactone ranged from 36 to 43%. Only 1% of patients across all cohorts switched from spironolactone to eplerenone (Fig. 4).

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for hypertension management in advanced chronic kidney disease: BLOCK-CKD trial [^113qGJVW]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is recommended as add-on therapy for treatment-resistant/uncontrolled hypertension. However, caution is advised in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to an increased risk for hyperkalemia. KBP-5074 is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist under investigation for the treatment of treatment-resistant and uncontrolled hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. BLOCK-CKD is a phase 2, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KBP-5074, on top of current therapy, in patients with stage 3B/4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 and ≤ 44 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and resistant hypertension (trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 2 or more antihypertensive medicines with complementary mechanisms). Patients (n = 240) will be randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily treatment with KBP-5074 0.25 mg, KBP-5074 0.5 mg, or placebo, stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥ 30 versus < 30 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and systolic blood pressure (≥ 160 versus < 160 mmHg). Approximately 30% of enrolled patients should have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 29 mL/(min·1.73 m 2). The primary efficacy analysis is the change in trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to day 84 for the KBP-5074 doses compared with placebo. Changes in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio will be assessed along with changes in serum potassium/incidence of hyperkalemia and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine. BLOCK-CKD will determine whether the addition of KBP-5074 will effectively lower blood pressure without an increased risk of hyperkalemia in patients who are not candidates for steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists due to advanced CKD.

### Appropriateness of spironolactone prescribing in heart failure patients: a population-based study [^115jxk7d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) established the safety and benefit of spironolactone for heart failure (HF) patients with systolic dysfunction. However, recent data have raised concerns regarding hyperkalemia secondary to spironolactone use and suggest it occurs more commonly in routine practice.

Methods and Results

We explored factors potentially associated with hyperkalemia from spironolactone therapy in a population-based cohort of 9165 HF patients hospitalized in Ontario, Canada, between 1999 and 2001. Compared with patients enrolled in RALES, community-based patients were older (mean age 75 years versus 65 years, P < .001) and were more likely to be female (50% versus 27%, P < .001). Of the 1502 patients that were prescribed spironolactone at discharge, 18% had elevated serum potassium levels (> 5 mmol/L) during hospitalization and 23% were discharged on concurrent potassium supplements. Although only 8% of patients had serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL, many patients had stage III (53.1%), stage IV (12.8%), or stage V (3.9%) chronic renal insufficiency according to glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Spironolactone was often prescribed to inappropriate HF candidates because of the presence of relative or absolute contraindications. These findings highlight the need for more careful patient selection when prescribing spironolactone to minimize potential life-threatening hyperkalemia.

MRA

The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone has been shown to attenuate albuminuria in diabetic kidney disease without outcomes data but had numerous disadvantages including sexual side effects and significant hyperkalemia that can be prolonged for as long as 1 week after discontinuation as a result of long-acting metabolites such as canrenone. That noted, spironolactone is evidenced-based for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) based on the RALES trial and is also an excellent choice for resistant HTN in CKD. Lastly, spironolactone is generally used for patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Eplerenone is an additional steroidal MRA used for patients who cannot tolerate spironolactone. More recently, the selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone has been of interest given the activity of this receptor in diabetic kidney disease. In two large RCTs, finerenone has demonstrated significant cardiovascular and kidney protection for patients with proteinuric kidney disease due to type-2 diabetes mellitus when used with maximally tolerated ACEi or ARB. An additional benefit of finerenone, is that it exhibited lower hyperkalemic events in addition to no sexual side-effects observed with other less-selective MRAs. Importantly, finerenone should be avoided in those with decompensated cirrhosis There are no head-to-head trials comparing spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone. Thus, for patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease (T2DM only), finerenone is recommended for both eGFR preservation and cardiovascular protection. Because finerenone is used in CKD with maximally dosed ACEi or ARB, potassium monitoring is an important safety consideration and many patients with reduced eGFR will require concomitant potassium binder therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^114FnjGJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2is are glucose‐lowering drugs used to manage T2DM owing to their promising renal and cardiovascular protective effects. Recent studies have shown they reduce albuminuria and preserve eGFR in mild to moderate DKDs with eGFR 30–60. Recently, Vert et al. revealed that the combination of SGLT2i and RAAS blocker significantly improves prognosis in CKD patients without diabetes. However, the high cost of this drug, particularly in developing countries, is a major concern for patients. Spironolactone is inexpensive. Therefore, in the subgroup analyses, we compared a triple therapy consisting of an SGLT2i, a RAAS blocker, and low‐dose spironolactone against a combination of low‐dose spironolactone and a RAAS blocker.

In this study, at the beginning and before using spironolactone, there was no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between patients who were taking SGLT2i and those who were not. In addition, after adding spironolactone to the treatment regimen in both groups, there was still no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between these two groups. Nevertheless, the addition of 12.5 mg/day spironolactone significantly reduced albuminuria in both groups. It should be noted that this secondary analysis was exploratory and was neither designed nor powered to test interaction effects. Therefore, such findings must be viewed cautiously and are not meant to alter the study's main purpose, which is focused on low‐dose spironolactone's independent effect.

### A randomized, multicenter, open-label, blinded end point trial comparing the effects of spironolactone to chlorthalidone on left ventricular mass in patients with early-stage chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the SPIRO-CKD trial [^1111zZxq]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased left ventricular (LV) mass and arterial stiffness. In a previous trial, spironolactone improved these end points compared with placebo in subjects with early-stage CKD, but it is not known whether these effects were specific to the drug or secondary to blood pressure lowering.

Aim

The aim was to investigate the hypothesis that spironolactone is superior to chlorthalidone in the reduction of LV mass while exerting similar effects on blood pressure.

Design

This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point clinical trial initially designed to compare the effects of 40weeks of treatment with spironolactone 25mg once daily to chlorthalidone 25mg once daily on the co-primary end points of change in pulse wave velocity and change in LV mass in 350 patients with stages 2 and 3 CKD on established treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Because of slow recruitment rates, it became apparent that it would not be possible to recruit this sample size within the funded time period. The study design was therefore changed to one with a single primary end point of LV mass requiring 150 patients. Recruitment was completed on 31 December 2016, at which time 154 patients had been recruited. Investigations included cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, applanation tonometry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and laboratory tests. Subjects are assessed before and after 40weeks of randomly allocated drug therapy and at 46weeks after discontinuation of the study drug.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Effect of spironolactone on kidney function in kidney transplant recipients (the SPIREN trial): a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial [^111fAYii]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study SPIREN was published by Line A Mortensen and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. This study is related to the following diseases: Kidney transplantation. In the SPIREN study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with kidney transplantation? In the SPIREN study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SPIREN study, the population was: 180 patients (63 female, 117 male). The inclusion criteria were kidney transplant recipients. The key exclusion criteria were intolerance to spironolactone; CrCl < 30 mL/min; serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L; resin or digoxine treatment; pregnancy. In the SPIREN study, the interventions were: n = 90 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day for 3 months, then 50 mg/day for the rest of the study) n = 90 placebo (matching placebo plus standard therapy for 3 years). In the SPIREN study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in measured GFR at 1 year (6.2 mL/min vs. -1.4 mL/min; AD 7.6 mL/min, 95% CI -101.82 to 117.02). In the SPIREN study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in 24 hour proteinuria at 1 year (0.09 g/day vs. -0.07 g/day; AD 0.16 g/day, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29) No significant difference in reduction in fibrosis at 2 years (0.52% vs. 3.08%; AD -2.56%, 95% CI -9.36 to 4.24) Significant increase in reduction in SBP at 1 year (0.61 mmHg vs. -3.97 mmHg; AD 4.59 mmHg, 95% CI 1.08 to 8.1). In the SPIREN study, the conclusion was: in kidney transplant recipients, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to reduction in measured GFR at 1 year.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower dose (12.5 mg/day) of spironolactone in lowering albuminuria and improving renal function in Iranian adults with DN. Because of known risks of hyperkalaemia with higher doses, we specifically evaluated whether a reduced dose would preserve clinical benefit without increasing adverse effects. Since spironolactone is low‐cost and readily available, proof of its efficacy and safety with a lower dose might be a feasible, low‐cost option for enhancing renal outcomes in DKD. Additionally, we examined whether low‐dose add‐on therapy with spironolactone might have additive effects when combined with conventional RAAS blockers, with or without SGLT2is.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose spironolactone in management of diabetic kidney disease in a real-world setting [^112YjQ3F]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Although previous studies showed that adding 25–100 mg/day spironolactone to ACEI or ARB reduced albuminuria in DKD patients, hyperkalaemia and hypotension were reported as side effects.
The study showed that the addition of low‐dose (12.5 mg/day) spironolactone to ACEI or ARB in patients with DKD was an effective and safe treatment to significantly reduce albuminuria, increase eGFR, and improve renal outcomes without causing hyperkalaemia.
In addition, we showed that before and after 12 weeks of spironolactone use, there was no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between patients taking SGLT2i and those not taking it.

5 Conclusion

This study showed that low‐dose spironolactone (12.5 mg/day) is an effective and safe treatment for reducing albuminuria and improving renal outcomes in patients with DKD, without inducing hyperkalaemia. In addition, we showed that before and after 12 weeks of spironolactone use, there was no significant difference in the level of albuminuria between patients taking SGLT2i and those not taking them. However, adding spironolactone to the treatment regimen of both groups significantly decreased the level of albuminuria. Although the reduction in albuminuria was small, the absence of significant side effects supports using 12.5 mg/day spironolactone as a viable option for patients with DKD, especially those at risk of hyperkalaemia. Future multicentre studies with larger populations must confirm these findings and explore the long‐term benefits of low‐dose spironolactone.

### Rationale and design of the ATHENA-HF trial: aldosterone targeted neurohormonal combined with natriuresis therapy in heart failure [^1172G5hM]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Although therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is recommended for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction and in post-infarction HF, it has not been studied well in acute HF (AHF) despite being commonly used in this setting. At high doses, MRA therapy in AHF may relieve congestion through its natriuretic properties and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation associated with intravenous loop diuretics. The ATHENA-HF (Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy in Heart Failure) trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of 100 mg/day spironolactone versus placebo (or continued low-dose spironolactone use in participants who are already receiving spironolactone at baseline) in 360 patients hospitalized for AHF. Patients are randomized within 24 h of receiving the first dose of intravenous diuretics. The primary objective is to determine if high-dose spironolactone, compared with standard care, will lead to greater reductions in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels from randomization to 96 h. The secondary endpoints include changes in the clinical congestion score, dyspnea relief, urine output, weight change, loop diuretic dose, and in-hospital worsening HF. Index hospital length of stay and 30-day clinical outcomes will be assessed. Safety endpoints include risk of hyperkalemia and renal function. Differences among patients with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction will be determined.

### The adequacy of laboratory monitoring in patients treated with spironolactone for congestive heart failure [^1134Pu2R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the adequacy of monitoring patients receiving spironolactone as well as spironolactone's relationship to hyperkalemia.

Background

After the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) demonstrated a 30% mortality benefit for treating severe heart failure patients with spironolactone, acceptance of this drug was overwhelming. Hyperkalemia and worsening renal function were rare in RALES, but laboratory monitoring was frequent. In clinical practice, the incidence of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function and adequacy of follow-up is unknown.

Methods

We reviewed the monitoring of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with spironolactone initiation after publication of RALES. All potassium and creatinine determinations at baseline and within three months following therapy initiation were assessed. Increased potassium was defined as any [K] ≥ 5.5 mEq/l and severe hyperkalemia as any [K] ≥ 6.0.

Results

A total of 840 patients had new prescriptions for spironolactone. Of these, 91% had baseline laboratory values, and 34% did not have any serum potassium or creatinine determined within three months. Patients seen in the cardiology clinic were more likely to have appropriate follow-up (p ≤ 0.001). Of 551 patients with follow-up laboratory values determined, 15% developed hyperkalemia and 6% developed severe hyperkalemia. Fifty-one patients (9%) developed renal dysfunction, of whom 25 developed hyperkalemia within three months. Hyperkalemia developed in 48 of 138 (35%) patients with baseline creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl and 12 of 19 (63%) with baseline creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl.

Conclusions

Many patients treated with spironolactone for CHF do not receive needed follow-up of potassium or creatinine concentrations, although hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction are common. Elevated baseline creatinine predicts patients at high risk. Physician education of the risks of spironolactone and the need for follow-up is essential.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^111gCA2s]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

On the basis of large randomized studies showing a reduction in total mortality, β-blockers are also recommended as first-line therapy in parallel to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors to counteract sudden cardiac death and progression of HF in patients with HFrEF. – A meta-analysis of intervention studies with β-blockers in patients with CKD stage 3 to 5 clearly demonstrated that these patients benefit from this therapy, suggesting that β-blockers are equally effective in patients with CKD as in non-CKD patients. Recent data underline the benefits of a β-blocker therapy in patients with CKD (CKD stages 3–4) with HF, left ventricular EF < 50%, and sinus rhythm. If patients with HFrEF are still symptomatic despite treatment with ACE inhibitors and β-blockers, and if the left ventricular EF is ≤ 35%, administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is indicated, but with particular caution in patients with advanced CKD. Spironolactone and eplerenone improved the prognosis of patients with HFrEF, and this therapy is effective in patients with HF and CKD stages 1 to 3. In the DOHAS study (Dialysis Outcomes Heart Failure Aldactone Study), 309 patients with CKD stage 5D were randomized to either 25 mg spironolactone per day or to standard of care only. Compared with the control group, the combined primary end point of mortality and cardio- or cerebrovascular hospitalization was significantly reduced in the spironolactone group (hazard ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20–0.81]). However, cardiovascular efficacy and safety of spironolactone are still uncertain in CKD stage 5. In recent placebo-controlled trials, spironolactone appeared safe in carefully monitored maintenance CKD stage 5 patient cohorts but it did not affect cardiovascular parameters like diastolic functionor left ventricular mass, ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular EF, 6-minute walk test distance, or New York Heart Association class. Because spironolactone increased the frequency of moderate — albeit not severe — hyperkalemia in patients with CKD stage 4 to 5, MRAs formally are still contraindicated in advanced CKD. The ongoing ALCHEMIST trial (ALdosterone Antagonist Chronic HEModialysis Interventional Survival Trial) examines the effect of aldosterone on cardiovascular outcome (including HF) in chronic hemodialysis patients. Novel therapeutic strategies with potassium binders may provide an additional option for patients with hyperkalemia.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure: an update [^112LuJpH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), has been used to treat patients with heart failure (HF) for more than half a century. Spironolactone improved outcomes in patients with severely symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction, and later, eplerenone expanded the benefits to patients with mildly symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction and myocardial infarction complicated by HF. Spironolactone reduced HF events in some patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, but the results were not generalizable to all patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction. More recently, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone improved the HF outcomes of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction, expanding the benefits previously seen among patients with diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease. The use of MRAs has been limited due to excessive concern about hyperkalemia. Education about the limited true risk associated with hyperkalemia, and about how to predict, prevent, and manage hyperkalemia, may lead to wider acceptability and use of these agents. Several ongoing trials are testing steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs in HF populations. In this review, we perform a critical appraisal of MRA use in HF populations and point toward future directions.

### Spironolactone [^115H8uYT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1663 patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. 87% of patients were white, 7% black, and 2% Asian. 73% were male and median age was 67. The median ejection fraction was 26%. 70% were NYHA class III and 29% class IV. The etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 55%, and non-ischemic in 45%. There was a history of myocardial infarction in 28%, of hypertension in 24%, and of diabetes in 22%. The median baseline serum creatinine was 1.2 mg/dL and the median baseline creatinine clearance was 57 mL/min.

At baseline, 100% of patients were taking loop diuretic and 95% were taking an ACE inhibitor. Other medications used at any time during the study included digoxin (78%), anticoagulants (58%), aspirin (43%), and beta-blockers (15%).

The primary endpoint for RALES was time to all-cause mortality. RALES was terminated early because of significant mortality benefit demonstrated during a planned interim analysis. Compared to placebo, spironolactone reduced the risk of death by 30% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18% to 40%). Spironolactone also reduced the risk of hospitalization for cardiac causes (defined as worsening heart failure, angina, ventricular arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction) by 30% (p < 0.001 95% confidence interval 18% to 41%).

The survival curves by treatment group are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Survival by Treatment Group in RALES

Mortality hazard ratios for subgroups were studied. The favorable effect of spironolactone on mortality appeared similar for both genders and all age groups except patients younger than 55. There were too few non-whites in RALES to evaluate if the effects differ by race. Spironolactone's benefit appeared greater in patients with low baseline serum potassium levels and less in patients with ejection fractions < 0.2. These subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.

### Heart failure therapy in diabetic patients-comparison with the recent ESC / EASD guideline [^115AbWX8]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Role of comorbidities

The use of ACEi/ARB or spironolactone may cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function. A large population-based study from Ontario showed an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and subsequent mortality after the publication of the RALES trial and the rate of hyperkalemia in real-world is thought to be much higher than in clinical trials for various reasons (e.g. less frequent assessment of electrolytes and renal function, higher dosage of medication). In heart failure patients, diabetes has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of hyperkalemia and severe hyperkalemia (associated with hospitalization or death). Even with impaired renal function, however, heart failure patients with diabetes will benefit from ARB therapy and aldosterone receptor blockade, similarly to patients without diabetes. Our data from a clinical practice setting suggest that the presence of the heart failure comorbidity diabetes restrains doctors from prescribing evidence-based therapy in heart failure patients - possibly in fear of side-effects, although these side-effects can be easily monitored by simple blood tests. As a consequence, we suggest that diabetic heart failure patients should receive appropriate doses of ACEi/ARB and/or aldosterone receptor blockers under a tight control of potassium and renal function markers, rather than withholding these potentially life-saving drugs. Moreover, future heart failure trials should focus on common comorbidities in heart failure populations (diabetes, impaired renal function, high age).

### Efficacy and safety of a low-sodium diet and spironolactone in patients with stage 1–3a chronic kidney disease: a pilot study [^1154gyBr]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive salt intake is associated with the deterioration of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aldosterone is also known as an independent risk factor for kidney injury. Dietary sodium intake acts as a main stimulator in aldosterone-mediated kidney injury. Hence, this study aimed to further investigate the renal protective effects and safety of a low-sodium diet in combination with spironolactone (SPL) in stage 1–3a CKD.

Methods

This single-center, SPL-blinded randomized controlled trial recruited patients with stage 1–3a CKD, randomized into three groups, low-sodium (3g/d salt)+placebo, medium-sodium (5g/d salt)+SPL, and low-sodium (3g/d salt)+SPL. Patients received 12weeks of intervention. The primary and secondary endpoints were 24-h urine protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the end of the intervention, respectively.

Results

A total of 74 patients were analyzed eventually. Significantly decreased 24-h urine protein was found in all three groups, from 0.37 to 0.23g/d (P = 0.004) in the low-sodium+placebo group, from 0.44 to 0.29g/d (P = 0.020) in the medium-sodium+SPL group, and from 0.35 to 0.31g/d (P = 0.013) in the low-sodium +SPL group. There were no significant differences among the three groups in 24-h urine protein amount change after intervention from pre-treatment values (P = 0.760, ITT set). The results of the 24-h urine protein by using PP set analysis was similar to the ITT set. No significant differences in eGFR, nutritional, metabolic, inflammatory, and other biomarkers were observed across all three groups (P > 0.05). No safety signal was observed.

Conclusion

No additional benefit was observed when SPL was prescribed to patients already on a low-sodium diet (3.0g/d). Still, small doses of SPL may benefit patients with poor sodium restriction. A combination of short-term low-dose SPL and ARB is safe for patients with stage 1–3a CKD, but blood potassium must be regularly monitored.

However, the decrease in the spironolactone group was significantly greater than in all BAY 94–8862 groups (P = 0.0002–0.0133 at visit 7). A similar trend was observed in the subset of patients aged > 75 years. In all treatment groups except the group receiving BAY 94–8862 2.5 mg q.d. patients in NHYA class III showed a greater decrease in eGFR than those in NYHA class II; however, the greatest decrease was still observed in the spironolactone arm.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism for non-diabetic kidney disease [^115KEo77]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

A retrospective analysis from the Taiwan National Health Database evaluated the effectiveness and safety of off-label MRA use on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) who started dialysis. The use of MRAs for 2 years was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–0.94] and cardiovascular death (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.95) but had no effect on HF hospitalizations, myocardial infarction or stroke. In this retrospective analysis, the risk of hyperkalemia (> 6 mEq/L) was higher in the MRA group (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17–1.54), which could limit the use of steroidal MRAs by dialysis patients in the absence of adequate monitoring. A meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs that evaluated the effect of steroidal MRAs on patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) showed lower cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24–0.70) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30–0.66) for MRA users than those receiving a placebo. Similarly, no effect of MRAs on stroke or non-fatal cardiovascular events was observed. In contrast to the Taiwan study, this meta-analysis showed the use of MRAs to not be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.91–1.36). Thus, there is an urgent need for RCTs to confirm the safety and efficacy of MRAs for cardiovascular events in ESRD patients. Indeed, two randomized trials, the Spin-D (Safety and Cardiovascular Efficacy of Spironolactone in Dialysis-Dependent End-Stage Renal Disease) and MiREnDa (Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists in End-Stage Renal Disease) trials showed that up to 25 mg/day spironolactone is well tolerated and reasonably safe for hemodialysis patients under appropriate monitoring in which hyperkalemia management is performed per-protocol. The Spin-D trial was the first to evaluate the safety and efficacy of spironolactone (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/day for up to 36 weeks) in chronic hemodialysis patients. Among the 129 included patients, it was possible to escalate the dose for 125, while 27 permanently discontinued the drug, mainly (44%) due to hyperkalemia. There was no difference between the placebo and spironolactone groups in terms of the safety outcomes for potassium > 6.5 mEq/L or hypotension with hospitalization or an emergency visit. However, higher rates of hyperkalemia and hypotension were found, in particular, for the higher dose of spironolactone (50 mg/day). No changes were observed in terms of cardiovascular parameters, but it was not possible to conclude a lack of benefit due to the small size of the study. In the MiREnDa trial, 97 chronic hemodialysis patients were randomized to 50 mg/day spironolactone or placebo and the primary efficacy outcome was a change in the left ventricle mass index measured by magnetic resonance imaging after 40 weeks of treatment. Spironolactone did not improve the left ventricle mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, blood pressure, or New York Heart Association functional class. Spironolactone was associated with a higher incidence of hyperkalemia (K +, 6–6.5 mmol/L), whereas severe hyperkalemia > 6.6 mmol/L was similar between the two groups. Both trials showed that the use of MRAs is safe for ESRD patients. However, the short follow-up in these trials makes it difficult to draw any conclusions concerning whether MRAs could have a long-term cardiovascular benefit for these patients. Future trials are thus guaranteed. In the ongoing ACHIEVE trial (NCT03020303), which is expected to complete patient recruitment in December 2024, the effect of spironolactone (25 mg/day) on cardiac mortality and hospitalization for heart failure will be evaluated for patients undergoing dialysis. In the ALCHEMIST trial (NCT01848639), 794 patients with ESRD under dialysis and high cardiovascular risk were randomized to receive up to 25 mg/day spironolactone or placebo. After a 1-month run-in period, those patients with potassium > 5.5 mmol/L were excluded. The primary outcome was time to onset of non-fatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, hospitalization for heart failure or nonfatal stroke or cardiovascular death. The results announced during the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2023 showed that spironolactone failed to meet the primary outcome, with only hospitalization for heart failure being significantly reduced by spironolactone in patients on dialysis (HR 0.412, CI 0.171–0.995). Of note, for the serum samples from patients included in the MiREnDa trial, the propensity for serum calcification, determined by the time necessary to transform primary calciprotein particles to secondary calciprotein particles in vitro, was reduced by spironolactone for the hemodialysis patients, suggesting protection against vascular calcification, as observed in preclinical models of CKD and MRA use. This aspect thus requires further investigation.

### Safety of low-dose spironolactone administration in chronic haemodialysis patients [^112boqU3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention of cardiovascular diseases is essential in chronic haemodialysis patients. Recently, low-dose spironolactone has been shown to decrease cardiovascular mortality in patients with severe heart failure. However, since haemodialysis patients are prone to hyperkalaemia, a known side effect of spironolactone, this treatment is not used in this population. We performed a study to assess whether low-dose spironolactone (3 x 25 mg/week) could be administered without inducing hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients.

Methods

The study design included a 2-week baseline period, followed by a 4-week treatment period in which doses of spironolactone were started at 12.5 mg three times/week for 2 weeks, then increased to 25 mg three times/week, and followed by a 2-week wash-out period. Fourteen patients receiving low-dose spironolactone after each dialysis were compared with 21 haemodialysis patients (control group).

Results

Low-dose spironolactone did not change mean serum potassium (4.9 ± 0.7 vs 4.9 ± 0.3 mmol/l: control). The mean plasma canrenone level induced by administration of spironolactone 25 mg three times/week in the 14 treated patients was 13 ± 5.3 ng/ml. Serum aldosterone was not significantly modified by the administration of spironolactone in these patients [before, median 0.35; interquartile range (IQR) 0.11–2.83 nmol/l vs after, median 0.22; IQR 0.12–0.60 nmol/l, NS]. Dietary potassium intake and the use of ion-exchange resin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers were similar for the two groups throughout the study.

Conclusion

This non-randomized and non-blinded study shows that administration of 25 mg spironolactone thrice weekly is not associated with an increased frequency of hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients when they are carefully monitored. More studies are required, however, before concluding that spironolactone administration is safe in the chronic haemodialysis population.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^112R7guA]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Steroidal MRAs

Over the past decades, two MRAs with steroidal chemical structures were developed: spironolactone and eplerenone. Spironolactone and eplerenone are approved for increasing survival in persons with HF with reduced ejection fraction based on results from landmark trials. Studies of spironolactone and eplerenone in participants with HF with preserved ejection fraction have demonstrated a lack of efficacy in this setting. Consequently, neither have an indication in HF with preserved ejection fraction.

Despite hyperkalemia being relatively uncommon and not depriving participants with HF of survival benefit in clinical trials of spironolactone and eplerenone, data from real‐world studies have shown a high incidence of hyperkalemic events in individuals treated with these therapies. The higher rates of hyperkalemia with steroidal MRAs in observational studies compared with clinical trials may be associated with inappropriate use of high doses, use in persons with conditions that predisposed them to hyperkalemia, and limited serum potassium monitoring. In addition, spironolactone (but not eplerenone) is associated with increased gynecomastia.

Data from HF outcomes trials with spironolactone and eplerenone indicated that they did not delay the progression of CKD, even in high‐risk participants. Due to the lack of long‐term clinical trial data in individuals with CKD, neither spironolactone nor eplerenone is indicated for use in this population. Thus, nonsteroidal MRAs were developed to improve long‐term clinical outcomes in persons with CKD.

Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) reduce mortality and hospitalizations due to HF in patients with HFrEF, but in these trials, only patients with CKD stages 1 to 3 were enrolled. In the RALES trial (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), spironolactone exhibited similar risk reduction in all-cause mortality and the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and hospital stay for HF, compared with patients with higher baseline eGFR. However, these benefits went along with an increased risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained. Similarly, in a post hoc analysis in patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 of the EMPHASIS-HF trial (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure), eplerenone was equally effective to reduce cardiovascular death or HHF (hospitalization for heart failure), which was consistent across the different eGFR strata. Patients treated with eplerenone had an increased risk of potassium > 5.5 mmol/L but not of potassium > 6.0 mmol/L. Given these data, a close monitoring of renal function and potassium is warranted in patients with HF and CKD, especially if eGFR declines.

No data from large clinical trials exist in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, and these agents are formally contraindicated in advanced CKD. The DOHAS (Dialysis Outcomes Heart Failure Aldactone Study) trial, a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label trial in 5 Japanese centers, investigated the use of spironolactone in oligoanuric hemodialysis patients versus a control group. In this population, spironolactone reduced the primary outcome — a composite of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events or hospitalization for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Ongoing large-scale studies such as the ACHIEVE trial (Aldosterone Blockade for Health Improvement Evaluation in End-Stage Renal Disease; unique identifier: NCT03020303) and ALCHEMIST (Aldosterone Antagonist Chronic Hemodialysis Interventional Survival Trial; unique identifier: NCT01848639) will shed more light on this topic.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Rhs2M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — choice of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability. The recommendation is driven by the availability and low cost of spironolactone over other MRAs; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating primary aldosteronism, and MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred; when initiating an MRA, consider hypertension severity for dosing and potential discontinuation of other antihypertensive medications, and monitor potassium, renal function, renin (concentration or activity), and blood pressure response during follow-up to guide MRA dose titration.

Reno-protective effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in clinical trials

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

A meta-analysis of 14 studies, which included 1193 adults with eGFR > 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and proteinuria on ACEi/ARB, showed that spironolactone or eplerenone reduced proteinuria compared with placebo or standard care over a median of 3.5 months. In 130 patients with T2D and CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), spironolactone 12.5 mg/day vs control decreased UACR levels over 24 weeks. In 140 patients with T2D at high risk of or with CV diseases, eplerenone 100–200 mg/day vs placebo decreased UACR levels by 34% over 26 weeks. Similarly, in 1175 patients with HFpEF from the TOPCAT trial, after correcting for the placebo response, spironolactone reduced UACR levels by 39% at the 1-year visit compared with baseline in the overall population, and by 76% in those with severely increased albuminuria levels (UACR > 300 mg/day). In post hoc analyses of the EMPHASIS-HF and TOPCAT Americas trials, MRAs caused a decrease in eGFR within weeks of treatment initiation but did not alter the long-term trajectories of eGFR in both HFrEF and HFpEF populations (Table 3). Similar eGFR trajectories with MRAs were observed in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% after myocardial infarction (MI). Importantly, the acute eGFR decline is haemodynamically mediated and neither injures kidney itself nor negates clinical benefits of MRAs, as evidenced by clinical trials.

Effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on glomerular filtration rate slope and renal composite outcome

The efficacy and safety of spironolactone in chronic haemodialysis patients remain under investigation. In the ALCHEMIST trial (n = 644, NCT01848639), spironolactone did not reduce primary CV outcomes but lowered the risk of HF hospitalization compared with placebo and was well-tolerated (Rossignol, unpublished data). The ongoing larger Phase III trial, ACHIEVE (NCT03020303), aims to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in dialysis patients, with the goal of providing more clarity in this population.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116HAUpi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): results in the pre-specified subgroup with heart failure [^116SSRJ7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug treatments

Open‐label oral spironolactone was started at 25 mg once daily and increased to 50 mg once daily at week 3 in patients with serum K + ≤ 5.1 mmol/L if systolic AOBP remained ≥ 120 mmHg. Patients initiated study drug [two similarly unmarked packets of 4.2 g of patiromer (Relypsa, Inc. a Vifor Pharma Group Company, Redwood City, CA, USA) or microcrystalline cellulose placebo], taken once daily with food at least 3 h before or 3 h after other medications (including spironolactone). Study drug dosing adjustments were made at intervals of ≥ 1 week: upward adjustment for local laboratory serum K + > 5.1 mmol/L, and downward adjustment for serum K + < 4.0 mmol/L. The maximum daily dosage of patiromer/placebo was six packets (25.2 g in the patiromer group) and the minimum was no packets. The titration algorithm was designed to maximize spironolactone dose while avoiding hyperkalaemia, decreases in eGFR, and hypotension. 14 There were three protocol‐specified criteria for treatment withdrawal because of high serum K +: (i) K + ≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L, and on maximum dose of patiromer or placebo, and repeat K + within 1 day remained ≥ 5.5 mmol/L; (ii) K + ≥ 5.5 and < 6.0 mmol/L, not on maximum dose but after dose was increased by two packets, and repeat K + within 3 days remained ≥ 5.5 mmol/L; and (iii) K + ≥ 6.0 mmol/L and repeat K + within 1 day remained ≥ 6.0 mmol/L. Patients who discontinued patiromer or placebo were required to discontinue spironolactone at the same time. Patients who discontinued spironolactone and patiromer or placebo for any reason remained in the study and were treated with standard medical care based on the investigator's clinical judgment.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of RLY5016, a polymeric potassium binder, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chronic heart failure (the PEARL-HF) trial [^114nXpuB]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This first prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of RLY5016 to prevent hyperkalaemia in chronic HF patients receiving standard therapy, including an ACE-I or ARB and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in addition to spironolactone 25–50 mg/day, demonstrated that RLY5016 significantly decreased serum K +, reduced the incidence of hyperkalaemia, and increased the proportion of patients in whom the dose of spironolactone could be increased to 50 mg/day. These results were obtained in patients with HF and concomitant CKD, as well as in patients with HF and a history of hyperkalaemia requiring prior discontinuation of a RAAS blocking agent.

A 30 g/day dose of RLY5016 significantly reduced serum K + relative to placebo, with a difference between treatment groups of 0.45 mEq/L. Furthermore, RLY5016 prevented the development of hyperkalaemia (serum K + > 5.5 mEq/L), and allowed a significantly greater percentage of patients to be up-titrated from 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day of spironolactone compared with placebo (91 vs. 74%, Table 2). The significant reduction in serum K + in patients randomized to 30 g/day of RLY5016 was observed within 2 days of initiating treatment and persisted throughout the 4-week course of the study (Figure 2).

In the subgroup of patients with HF and a history of hyperkalaemia requiring prior discontinuation of a RAAS blocker, but without concomitant CKD, the mean increase in serum K + and the incidence of hyperkalaemia following administration of spironolactone 25–50 mg/day was relatively low in patients assigned to placebo (Table 5). The explanation for the relatively small increase in serum K + and low incidence of hyperkalaemia despite administration of 25–50 mg/day of spironolactone in these patients is uncertain. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with HF and concomitant CKD (baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min), the incidence of hyperkalaemia after receiving spironolactone was 39% among patients taking placebo compared with 7% among patients taking RLY5016 (Table 4).

### Long-term effects of spironolactone in peritoneal dialysis patients [^111LiqrA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

ESRD treated with dialysis is associated with increased left ventricular hypertrophy, which, in turn, is related to high mortality. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists improve survival in patients with chronic heart failure; however, the effects in patients undergoing dialysis remain uncertain. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized trial with 158 patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist and undergoing peritoneal dialysis with and without (control group) spironolactone for 2 years. As a primary endpoint, rate of change in left ventricular mass index assessed by echocardiography improved significantly at 6 (P = 0.03), 18 (P = 0.004), and 24 (P = 0.01) months in patients taking spironolactone compared with the control group. Rate of change in left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly at 24 weeks with spironolactone compared with nontreatment (P = 0.02). The benefits of spironolactone were clear in patients with reduced residual renal function. As secondary endpoints, renal Kt/V and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine ratio did not differ significantly between groups during the observation period. No serious adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia, occurred. In this trial, spironolactone prevented cardiac hypertrophy and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, without significant adverse effects. Further studies, including those to determine relative effectiveness in women and men and to evaluate additional secondary endpoints, should confirm these data in a larger cohort.
