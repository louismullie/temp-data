## Question

Chronic cellulitis treatment and plan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment and plan for chronic cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and scope, because "chronic" could mean persistent infection or recurrent episodes. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and how to distinguish true cellulitis from mimics. Next, I will review acute treatment principles, including empiric antibiotic choice, route, and duration. After that, I need to examine predisposing factors and prevention, including edema management, skin care, and prophylactic antibiotics. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm with strength of evidence and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't anchor on the wrong construct. "Chronic cellulitis" is not a standard diagnostic category; most authoritative sources address recurrent cellulitis rather than a single persistent infection, and recurrence rates are substantial, with approximately 14% at 1 year and up to 45% at 3 years, which frames the clinical problem as one of prevention and risk-factor modification rather than prolonged acute therapy alone [^1119mx9Q] [^111e2hiG].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic foundation before discussing treatment. Cellulitis remains a clinical diagnosis characterized by expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness, and edema; cultures have low yield in nonpurulent disease, so routine blood or skin cultures are not recommended in typical cases, and misdiagnosis is common, with up to about one-third of "cellulitis" cases turning out to be pseudocellulitis such as venous stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, or DVT, which argues for careful history, exam, and selective use of ultrasound or other tests when the diagnosis is uncertain [^116xwfdJ] [^114pSATx] [^116pcKEq].

> I will now examine acute treatment principles for an active episode, but hold on, I should confirm empiric coverage. For nonpurulent cellulitis, streptococci predominate, so first-line therapy should target streptococci with a beta-lactam such as penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, or dicloxacillin; MRSA coverage is generally unnecessary unless there are specific risk factors or treatment failure, and short courses are effective, with 5–6 days sufficient for most patients who are clinically improving, extending only if there is inadequate response [^116aZEV3] [^116QtZHg] [^111gsSaf] [^112JMiZb].

> Let me consider route of therapy and duration more carefully. Oral therapy is appropriate for stable outpatients without SIRS or hemodynamic instability, and randomized data show no advantage of intravenous over oral therapy for clinical response; similarly, shorter courses are as effective as longer courses when patients improve clinically, which supports a 5–6 day default with extension to 10–14 days only if response is suboptimal or if disease is severe or complicated [^112JMiZb] [^112gCWiy] [^116PoWQe].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition criteria so I don't miss patients who need inpatient care. Hospitalization is indicated for concern for deeper or necrotizing infection, poor adherence, severe immunocompromise, failure of outpatient therapy, or systemic instability such as SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability; observation units can be useful for selected patients to avoid full admission when close monitoring is needed [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL] [^111TaN2j].

> Next, I should review predisposing factors because recurrence is largely driven by modifiable risks. Chronic edema and lymphedema are major drivers, with lymphedema increasing cellulitis risk roughly sevenfold, and worse edema correlates with higher infection risk; venous insufficiency, obesity, diabetes, skin barrier disease such as eczema or tinea pedis, and prior cellulitis in the same area also elevate risk, so I need to ensure these are identified and treated concurrently during acute care and as part of routine follow-up [^113CAivE] [^1128Axfm] [^117MYykE] [^116anE5J].

> I should double-check the role of edema control because it is often underemphasized. Compression therapy reduces recurrence in patients with chronic leg edema; in a randomized trial, daily compression reduced recurrences by about 63% compared with education alone, and this nonpharmacologic strategy should be prioritized alongside skin care and weight management where feasible [^112bYhNj].

> Let me think about skin and foot care specifics, since portals of entry matter. Interdigital toe-web abnormalities, fissuring, scaling, and maceration should be treated aggressively, tinea pedis should be eradicated, and emollients can reduce barrier breakdown; patients should be counseled on hygiene and wound care, and in recurrent MRSA contexts, decolonization strategies may be considered selectively, though routine decolonization is not advised for all [^114NgcMq] [^1114UPEg] [^112bNNbj].

> But wait, what if recurrences continue despite optimal risk-factor management; I need to check the role of prophylactic antibiotics. For patients with 3–4 episodes per year despite addressing predisposing factors, IDSA suggests considering prophylactic penicillin V or erythromycin for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, continuing as long as risk factors persist; PATCH II suggested a 47% relative risk reduction with 6 months of penicillin V after an acute episode, though results were borderline and not universally adopted, so shared decision-making is essential [^116anE5J] [^115ssoEa] [^114pLZB3].

> I should confirm special populations and scenarios so I don't overgeneralize. In diabetics, I need to ensure prompt therapy and close follow-up given higher failure risk; in obesity, I should anticipate higher failure and consider longer courses if response is slow; in immunocompromised hosts, I should broaden empiric coverage and lower thresholds for admission; in pediatrics, streptococci predominate and MRSA is less common unless purulent or high risk; in pregnancy, beta-lactams are preferred and tetracyclines should be avoided [^116xwfdJ] [^1119mx9Q] [^112nmQ7K] [^112omJWH].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up, and I need to ensure I don't miss early nonresponse. Reassess at 48–72 hours for clinical improvement; if there is no improvement, I should verify adherence, consider resistant organisms including MRSA, reassess for abscess or deeper infection, and evaluate for mimics such as DVT or venous stasis; routine labs and imaging are not needed in uncomplicated cases, but ultrasound can help distinguish cellulitis from abscess when uncertain [^116xwfdJ] [^11689GoD] [^115z6nqP].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep checking each step against guidelines. For an acute episode, confirm the diagnosis clinically and exclude mimics; if stable, treat outpatient with a 5–6 day oral beta-lactam targeting streptococci, add MRSA coverage only with specific risks or if no improvement at 48–72 hours; if unstable or high risk, admit and give IV therapy with escalation as indicated; during treatment, elevate the limb, treat edema, and address skin barriers; for recurrence prevention, prioritize compression for edema, optimize skin care and tinea treatment, weight management, and consider prophylactic antibiotics after 3–4 annual episodes despite risk reduction efforts [^116QtZHg] [^111gsSaf] [^114NgcMq] [^112bYhNj] [^116anE5J].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence so I don't overstate claims. The 5–6 day duration is supported by high-quality guidance and meta-analyses showing noninferiority of shorter courses, compression therapy has randomized trial support for recurrence reduction, and prophylactic antibiotics have supportive but weaker evidence and should be individualized; conversely, routine cultures, broad-spectrum empiric therapy in nonpurulent disease, and prolonged courses without indication are not supported and may cause harm [^111gsSaf] [^112JMiZb] [^112bYhNj] [^116anE5J] [^114qTzei].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses patient education and shared decision-making, because adherence and risk-factor control drive outcomes. Patients should understand that recurrence is common but preventable, that compression and skin care are foundational, and that prophylactic antibiotics are optional and continued only as long as risk factors persist; this aligns with patient-prioritized outcomes such as preventing recurrence and minimizing antibiotic exposure, which should be explicitly discussed during counseling [^111e2hiG] [^113ZgDBb] [^116NB7ww].

Chronic cellulitis is best managed with a **5–6 day course of oral beta-lactam therapy** (e.g. cephalexin, dicloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate) for uncomplicated cases, extending to 10–14 days if slow response or severe disease [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe]. MRSA coverage is reserved for patients with specific risk factors or treatment failure [^112z7Dvu] [^114ZhUEW]. Address predisposing factors — especially chronic edema/lymphedema, tinea pedis, venous insufficiency, and skin barrier defects — using compression, elevation, and skin care to reduce recurrence [^112bYhNj] [^114NgcMq]. For patients with ≥ 3–4 annual recurrences despite risk-factor control, consider prophylactic penicillin V or benzathine penicillin G [^116anE5J] [^115ssoEa]. Routine labs or imaging are not needed unless the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected [^115z6nqP] [^116xwfdJ].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness, often with lymphangitic streaking [^116xwfdJ].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Common mimics include venous stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, deep vein thrombosis, and contact dermatitis. Careful history and examination are essential to differentiate these conditions [^116pcKEq] [^111ZKv3w].

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine blood cultures, CBC, or inflammatory markers are not recommended for uncomplicated cases due to low yield and limited impact on management [^114pSATx] [^115z6nqP].

- **Imaging**: Not routinely indicated unless there is suspicion of abscess, necrotizing infection, or osteomyelitis [^115z6nqP] [^114WtF2a].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

### First-line therapy

First-line therapy is **oral beta-lactam antibiotics** such as cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanate, which target streptococci and MSSA — the most common pathogens in uncomplicated cellulitis [^116QtZHg] [^116xwfdJ]. The **duration** is 5–6 days for uncomplicated cases, with extension to 10–14 days if the response is slow or the disease is severe [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].

---

### MRSA coverage

MRSA coverage is indicated for patients with **specific risk factors** — such as prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, or high local prevalence — or when there is treatment failure with beta-lactam therapy [^112z7Dvu] [^114ZhUEW]. Recommended **agents** include doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP-SMX, often combined with a beta-lactam to ensure streptococcal coverage [^112z7Dvu].

---

### Intravenous therapy

IV therapy is indicated for patients with **severe infection**, systemic toxicity, or failure of oral therapy. Options include cefazolin, nafcillin, or vancomycin if MRSA is suspected [^113PjKu3] [^114pSATx].

---

## Management of predisposing factors

Addressing predisposing factors is essential to prevent recurrence:

| **Predisposing factor** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|
| Chronic edema/lymphedema | - Compression therapy <br/> - Elevation <br/> - Manual lymphatic drainage [^112bYhNj] [^114NgcMq] |
| Tinea pedis | - Topical antifungals <br/> - Emollients <br/> - Foot hygiene [^114NgcMq] [^112omJWH] |
| Venous insufficiency | - Compression stockings <br/> - Leg elevation <br/> - Wound care [^114NgcMq] [^116n7g9e] |
| Skin barrier defects | - Emollients <br/> - Moisturizers <br/> - Avoidance of irritants [^114NgcMq] [^1166SdXy] |

---

## Prevention of recurrence

- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: Consider oral penicillin V or intramuscular benzathine penicillin G for patients with ≥ 3–4 annual recurrences despite optimal management of predisposing factors [^116anE5J] [^115ssoEa].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence to therapy, skin care, and early recognition of recurrence [^1114UPEg] [^112xe8tG].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve dermatology, vascular surgery, and infectious disease specialists for comprehensive management [^111mRUhZ] [^1128Axfm].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should occur within **48–72 hours** to assess response and adjust therapy if there is inadequate improvement [^notfound]. Monitoring should focus on clinical improvement — including erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain — while watching for complications such as abscess, necrotizing infection, or osteomyelitis [^116xwfdJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Empiric therapy**: Oral beta-lactam antibiotics for 5–6 days; extend if slow response [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].

- **MRSA coverage**: Add if risk factors present or treatment failure occurs [^112z7Dvu] [^114ZhUEW].

- **Predisposing factors**: Address edema, tinea pedis, venous insufficiency, and skin barrier defects [^114NgcMq] [^112bYhNj].

- **Recurrence prevention**: Prophylactic antibiotics for frequent recurrences despite optimal management [^116anE5J] [^115ssoEa].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess within 48–72 hours; monitor for complications [^notfound].

---

Effective management of chronic cellulitis requires **targeted antibiotic therapy**, rigorous attention to predisposing factors, and proactive prevention strategies to minimize recurrence and improve patient outcomes.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non–surgically acquired cellulitis. Data Sources.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event. Results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inform the production of evidence-based guidelines that cover antibiotic choice, route of administration, duration of treatment, the role of combinations of antibiotics, and gaps in research. We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished. The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy.

Quiz Ref IDWe identified 5 studies that compared a shorter with a longer duration of treatment. Only 1 study57 compared the duration for the same antibiotic. One study38 compared a single dose of oritavancin, a glycopeptide with a long half-life, with 7 to 10 days of vancomycin. The 2 studies by Daniel15 compared 5 days of azithromycin with 7 days of either cloxacillin or erythromycin. One study57 compared 5 days of oral levofloxacin with a 10-day regimen. Another study45 compared 6 days of tedizolid with 10 days of linezolid.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115z6nqP]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent cellulitis [^111e2hiG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent cellulitis is a challenging clinical condition affecting up to 47% of patients after the first episode, especially those with predisposing risk factors. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art of literature evidence and to highlight recent developments in its management.

Recent Findings

Recurrent cellulitis can occur after successful treatment of cellulitis. Conditions that commonly increase the risk of cellulitis include local and systemic modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. A rigorous approach to the management of risk factors and treatment of acute infection is important as the risk of recurrence rises with repeated episodes. Risk factors, if present, need to be targeted in association with antibiotic prophylaxis. Penicillin V is the preferred antibiotic for prevention but other antibiotics and new drugs can be considered in cases of β-lactam allergy, intolerance, or failure.

Summary

Recurrent cellulitis is associated with short term and long-term morbidity as well as significant healthcare costs. Management of underlying predisposing conditions is crucial to prevent recurrence in addition with evaluation of pharmacological measures, but specialized and multidisciplinary skills are needed. More efforts are needed to prevent and treat this underestimated problem.

### Cellulitis: a review [^116xwfdJ]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cellulitis is an infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting with expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness, and swelling. Cellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone.

Observations

In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria are unknown. In the 15% of cellulitis cases in which organisms are identified, most are due to β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. There are no effective diagnostic modalities, and many clinical conditions appear similar. Treatment of primary and recurrent cellulitis should initially cover Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, with expansion for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in cases of cellulitis associated with specific risk factors, such as athletes, children, men who have sex with men, prisoners, military recruits, residents of long-term care facilities, those with prior MRSA exposure, and intravenous drug users. Five days of treatment is sufficient with extension if symptoms are not improved. Addressing predisposing factors can minimize risk of recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The diagnosis of cellulitis is based primarily on history and physical examination. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis should be directed against Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Failure to improve with appropriate first-line antibiotics should prompt consideration for resistant organisms, secondary conditions that mimic cellulitis, or underlying complicating conditions such as immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, or chronic kidney disease.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

On clinical improvement in cases in which culture data were not available, transition to oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was recommended. 15 A total course of therapy of 7 days was suggested, with longer courses reserved for cases of severe or poorly responsive disease.

8, 15, 33 To promote knowledge of, and adherence to, the guideline, we performed a multifaceted implementation strategy consisting of 4 components. The median duration of therapy decreased by 3 days during the intervention period. Significantly more patients received less than 10 days of therapy, and fewer patients received more than 14 days. Similar trends were noted when stratified by cellulitis or cutaneous abscess. Antimicrobial exposure, as measured by days of antibiotic therapy, was reduced in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Implementation of the guideline promoting 7 days of therapy decreased the median duration of therapy by nearly 25%. Moreover, patients were less likely to receive prolonged durations of therapy and more likely to receive a short course of therapy.

Of importance, patients who received a short course of therapy were not more likely to experience clinical failure than those who received a long course of therapy. Our data suggest that short durations of therapy targeted to gram-positive pathogens decreases unnecessary antibiotic exposure without adversely affecting outcomes; however, clinical trials in this area are needed.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^112omJWH]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics, while intravenous antibiotics can be considered for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.
- Cephalosporins
- Clindamycin
- Dicloxacillin
- Penicillin
- Cefazolin
- Ceftriaxone
- Clindamycin
- Penicillin Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there has not been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and it should be treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### Cellulitis and soft tissue infections [^114WtF2a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis and soft tissue infections are a diverse group of diseases that range from uncomplicated cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis. Management of predisposing conditions is the primary means of prevention. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and thus is made on the basis of history and physical examination. Imaging may be helpful for characterizing purulent soft tissue infections and associated osteomyelitis. Treatment varies according to the type of infection. The foundations of treatment are drainage of purulence and antibiotics, the latter targeted at the infection's most likely cause.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115n4KRL]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Encouraging small changes in clinical practice can have significant impacts when effectively multiplied across many doctors and departments. Initiatives implemented need to be accessible, realistic and pragmatic, in order to maximise real-world on the ground effects and facilitate a sustained impact. Interventions need to be non-intrusive and tailored to ensure that no inadvertent adverse run-on effects negatively impact on pre-existing workflows and the experience of the end-users. This requires a thorough understanding of the underlying work processes of end-users, relevant physical and digital infrastructure and systems-based practices. Collaboration across clinical and non-clinical staff, at both junior and senior levels of seniority and across all the relevant clinical disciplines, is key to formulating this holistic understanding, to ensure the subsequent successful development and implementation of interventions and quality improvement policies. A well-chosen problem with carefully formulated interventions allows for significant direct and indirect benefits for patients, healthcare staff and healthcare systems as a whole.

This quality improvement initiative has demonstrated two interventions that may be potentially generalised for the rational management of other large volume and less clinically complex illnesses. Facilitating easy accessibility and clinicians' awareness of information is a necessary step that allows for existing management guidance to have a greater impact on clinical practice, and in particular, the incorporation of interventions directly into existing work processes without the need for additional steps is an effective and useful intervention for the busy clinician. Sustainability of interventions is key to ensure a continued long-term positive impact.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^1128Axfm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The novel findings from this publication are that one‐third of patients with chronic oedema are likely to develop cellulitis at some point. The worse the oedema, the more likely cellulitis is to occur; the better the oedema, the less likely cellulitis is to occur. The strengths of this publication are the large number of patients included for study and the international collaboration involving nine countries, indicating that chronic oedema predisposing to cellulitis is a global healthcare burden – at least in these countries. By targeting healthcare professionals with an interest in lymphoedema to identify patients, numbers may have been falsely elevated and more severe cases included compared with the population at large, but this does not undermine the value of the results. Unfortunately, data on recurrent cellulitis were not included and this is likely to be a common occurrence. As shown previously, cellulitis can be self‐perpetuating with past episodes making future episodes more likely. While prophylactic penicillin has been shown to be of value in preventing cellulitis, this study demonstrates the importance of controlling the chronic oedema in preventing cellulitis, a finding recently confirmed by the use of compression garments to prevent cellulitis. So often in healthcare, patients are treated for the acute episode of cellulitis and discharged without sufficient consideration being given to treatment of the risk factors, such as chronic oedema, skin disease and wounds. Dermatologists are well placed to manage such conditions and therefore should be more involved in cellulitis care. The Norwich model has shown the value of dermatological input for cellulitis, particularly as red legs do not always mean cellulitis and mismanagement frequently occurs.

### Management of patients with infectious diseases in an emergency department observation unit [^111TaN2j]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia, cellulitis, and pyelonephritis are discussed in this review because they are the most common infections requiring hospital care, and they all have significant death or complication rates and broad differential diagnoses. They also demonstrate many of the considerations that could be applied to other infections appropriate for OU care. Table 11 lists additional infections that are good candidates for OU care. A key to successful OU management of infection is early consultation with the primary care physicians and appropriate specialists when one is setting up the unit, designing its guidelines, and when treating specific patients. Because individual patient outcomes are not predictable, increasing the absolute numbers treated and successfully discharged from observation can necessarily increase the percentage of OU patients that are hospitalized. In essence, a group who would be hospitalized from the ED is transferred to observation status, where most avoid hospital admission. Because some patients fail to respond, develop complications, or demonstrate alternative diagnoses, many troubles can be avoided when the primary care and specialist physicians have collaborated in the observation treatment decisions. These guidelines have been presented as a starting point. It is clear that more research targeted at this group of patients is required to refine current practice. As for everything else in medicine, there is no doubt that many of the specific recommendations made here will become obsolete in no time.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect".

Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

### Distinguishing cellulitis from its noninfectious mimics: approach to the red leg [^116pcKEq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical diagnosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting; studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high misdiagnosis rate: nearly one-third of cases are other conditions (ie, pseudocellulitis). This high rate of misdiagnosis is thought to contribute to nearly $515 million in avoidable health care spending in the United States each year; leading to the delayed or missed diagnosis of pseudocellulitis and to delays in appropriate treatment. There is a broad differential diagnosis for pseudocellulitis, which includes inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions of the skin. Accurate diagnosis of the specific condition causing pseudocellulitis is crucial to management, which varies greatly.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens, duration of antibiotics, and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. 1 Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123 644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. 2 While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one‐third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. 3, 4 Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics. 5 This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side‐effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments. 6

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dryness. 7 Previous research also suggests that there is a high rate of fungal foot disease in patients with recurrent cellulitis as skin breaks caused by fungal infection provide a 'portal of entry' for bacteria. 8, 9 Although fungal foot infection is common, many patients undertreat this as it can be asymptomatic, 10, 11 so it is possible that more active treatment of fungal foot disease may prevent recurrent cellulitis. In a recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) for cellulitis, patients and health professionals identified the need to determine the best nonantibiotic intervention for the prevention of cellulitis (e.g. skin care; foot care; moisturizers; antiseptics; lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise; compression garments/bandages; treating athlete's foot; complementary and alternative therapy) as a priority area for future research. 12

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Cellulitis and erysipelas: prevention [^116LAGsJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around one quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 323 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 170 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two interventions based on information about to the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^11689GoD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qTzei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

Cellulitis is a common condition seen by physicians. Over the past decade, skin and soft tissue infections from community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have become increasingly common. In this article, the definition, etiology, and clinical features of cellulitis are reviewed, and the importance of differentiating cellulitis from necrotizing soft tissue infections is emphasized. Empiric antimicrobial recommendations are suggested, including the most recent recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent cellulitis (hygiene practices), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to offer preventive educational messages on personal hygiene and appropriate wound care in all patients with SSTIs. Counsel regarding the following:

- keep draining wounds covered with clean, dry bandages

- maintain good personal hygiene with regular bathing and cleaning of hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, particularly after touching infected skin or an item that has directly contacted a draining wound

- avoid reusing or sharing personal items (such as disposable razors, linens, and towels) that have contacted with infected skin.

### Which outcomes are reported in cellulitis trials? Results of a review of outcomes included in cellulitis trials and a patient priority setting survey [^113ZgDBb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is an emerging need to develop consistent outcomes in clinical trials to allow effective comparison of treatment effects. No systematic review has previously looked at the reporting of outcome measures used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment and prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas).

Objectives

The primary aim of this review was to describe the breadth of outcomes reported from RCTs on cellulitis treatment and prevention. The secondary aim was to identify outcome themes from patients' and healthcare professionals' feedback from a cellulitis Priority Setting Partnership (PSP).

Methods

We conducted a review of all outcome measures used in RCTs from two recent Cochrane reviews. Free-text responses from a cellulitis priority setting survey were used to understand the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals.

Results

Outcomes from 42 RCTs on treatment of cellulitis and six RCTs on prevention of cellulitis were reviewed. Only 28 trials stated their primary outcome. For trials assessing treatment of cellulitis, clinical response to treatment was categorized in 25 different ways. Five of these trials used an outcome that was in accordance with FDA guidance and only four trials incorporated either quality of life or patient satisfaction. For trials assessing prevention of cellulitis, recurrence was the key outcome measure. From the cellulitis PSP, prevention of recurrence, clinical features and long-term disease impact were the most important outcome themes for patients.

Conclusions

We have shown that in cellulitis treatment and prevention research, there is significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, inadequate focus on patient-reported outcomes, and a disparity between what is currently measured and what patients and healthcare professionals feel is important. We recommend that future cellulitis treatment trials consider the use of longer-term outcomes to capture recurrence and long-term morbidity, as well as short-term resolution of acute infection.

### Severe lower limb cellulitis is best diagnosed by dermatologists and managed with shared care between primary and secondary care [^111mRUhZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is responsible for over 400,000 bed days per year in the English National Health Service (NHS) at the cost of £96 million.

Objectives

An audit following transfer of care of lower limb cellulitis managed in secondary care from general physicians to dermatologists.

Methods

Review of patient details and work diaries from the first 40 months of implementation of the new model of care.

Results

Of 635 patients referred with lower limb cellulitis 33% had other diagnoses which did not require admission. Four hundred and seven of 425 patients with cellulitis were managed entirely as outpatients, many at home. Twenty-eight per cent of patients with cellulitis had an underlying skin disease identified and treated, which is likely to have reduced the risk of recurrent cellulitis, leg ulceration and lymphoedema. Only 18 of 635 patients referred with lower limb cellulitis required hospital admission for conventional treatment.

Conclusions

This new way of managing suspected lower limb cellulitis offered substantial savings for the NHS, and benefits of early and accurate diagnosis with correct home treatment for patients.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

RECURRENT CELLULITIS

The lack of gold standard criteria for the diagnosis of recurrent cellulitis can lead to frequent misdiagnosis with other conditions which usually coexist with and favour SSTIs, such as chronic lymphedema. IDSA guidelines define recurrent cellulitis as the occurrence of 3–4 episodes per year, whereas other international societies define it as the presence of two or more episodes per year, or even as "frequent infections" [7, 26]. On this premise, recurrent cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% within 1 year and 45% of cases within 3 years. Local conditions predisposing to recurrent cellulitis are previous infection in the same site, lower limbs localization, chronic oedema, dermatitis, dermatomycosis, peripheral vascular disease, venous insufficiency or thrombosis, trauma, previous surgery, chronic wounds ulcer, presence of foreign bodies. The most relevant systemic conditions are obesity, diabetes and cancer.

Predictive scores were developed to identify patients with highest risk of recurrence. The Cellulitis Recurrence Score (CRS), for recurring lower limb cellulitis, includes chronic venous insufficiency (1 point), ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis (1 point), lymphedema (2 points) and peripheral vascular disease (3 points). A CRS score higher than 2 was associated with a positive predictive value of 83.6% and negative predictive value of 67.5%.

The recently developed Baseline Recurrence Risk in Cellulitis score (BRRISC score) individuate patients at risk of recurrent cellulitis based on eight variables (age, heart rate, urea, platelets, albumin, previous cellulitis, venous insufficiency and liver disease). Categorizing as low (score 0–1), medium (2–5) and high (6–15) risk, recurrence increased fourfold: 3.2% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.3–4.4], 9.7% (8.7–10.8) and 16.6% (13.3–20.4). Patients at a high risk were further divided into four clinical phenotypes: young, acutely unwell with liver disease; comorbid with previous cellulitis and venous insufficiency; chronic renal disease with severe renal impairment; and acute severe illness, with substantial inflammatory responses.

These risk scores could be helpful in optimizing treatment and targeting preventive strategies for recurrent cellulitis.

### Cellulitis: a review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.
- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z7Dvu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^112aNEXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^112gCWiy]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Diagnosis and management of chronic infection [^115ZK1L7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

High-energy penetrating extremity injuries are often associated with severe open fractures that have varying degrees of soft-tissue contamination and tenuous soft-tissue coverage. The result is a relatively high prevalence of chronic osteomyelitis compared with that in civilian trauma patients. Diagnosing chronic osteomyelitis requires a careful history and thorough physical and radiographic examinations. Cross-sectional imaging can help delineate the extent of bony involvement, and scintigraphy can be used as a diagnostic tool and to gauge response to treatment. Clinical staging also directs surgical management. Adequacy of débridement remains the most important clinical predictor of success; thus, adopting an oncologic approach to complete (ie, wide) excision is important. Reconstruction can be safely performed by a variety of methods; however, proper staging and patient selection remain critical to a successful outcome. Although systemic and depot delivery of antibiotics plays a supporting role in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis, the ideal dosing regimens, and the duration of treatment, remain controversial.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^116yNvLU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections in both adults and children, both community and hospital acquired. Their incidence varies according with study population, region and definitions applied, but has been increasing in years. Incidence in paediatric patients raised from 23.2 to 62.7/100 000 person years from 2000 to 2006. For adult patients, incidence has been reported from 49.6 to 77.5/1000 person years.

Due to the wide variety of clinical entities included under the term of SSTIs, different classifications were proposed. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed the definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI), which includes cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous abscesses, in order to better distinguish complicated SSTIs (cSSTIs). The 2014 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines proposed a practical classification based on a clinical evaluation (mild/moderate/severe) and distinction between purulent (furuncles, carbuncles, abscesses) and nonpurulent (cellulitis, erysipelas, fasciitis) infections.

According with SSTIs severity, associated morbidity and mortality rates may vary. The rates of mortality in patients with SSTIs are generally low, except for necrotizing infections where they can reach up to 70%. As for morbidity, recurrent SSTIs (RSSTIs) are an increasing reported complication, with rates ranging from 7% up to 45%, probably favoured by ageing and comorbidity prevalence among population.

Definitions for RSSTIs are not fully identified. As defined for other types of infections, we consider a recurrent episode the presence of signs and symptoms of infection after an initial resolution or improvement and after a full course of antibiotic therapy. This entity represents a challenge for the clinicians, indeed, they imply multiple courses of antibiotic therapy with the risk of selecting for antimicrobial resistance, side effects related to chronic antibiotic exposure (i.e. Clostridioides difficile infection, invasive candidiasis, altered renal and/or liver functions), and prolonged in-hospital stay and/or use of healthcare resources with increased costs.

Our purpose is to summarize the most recent data on RSSTIs risk factors and management.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Improved risk prediction is essential for the early identification of patients at highest risk for progressing to chronic wounds. This may enable early intervention in clinical practice to both prevent disease progression and support targeted, personalized management of disease once progressed, accounting for an individual patient's unique set of risk factors.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111khPS9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.

### Pressure ulcers: prevention, evaluation, and management [^112dJvcZ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of unrelieved pressure. Predisposing factors are classified as intrinsic (e.g., limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g., pressure, friction, shear, moisture). Prevention includes identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures, such as following a patient repositioning schedule; keeping the head of the bed at the lowest safe elevation to prevent shear; using pressure-reducing surfaces; and assessing nutrition and providing supplementation, if needed. When an ulcer occurs, documentation of each ulcer (i.e., size, location, eschar and granulation tissue, exudate, odor, sinus tracts, undermining, and infection) and appropriate staging (I through IV) are essential to the wound assessment. Treatment involves management of local and distant infections, removal of necrotic tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery. Debridement is indicated when necrotic tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing cellulitis or sepsis occurs. Mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic debridement methods are nonurgent treatments. Wound cleansing, preferably with normal saline and appropriate dressings, is a mainstay of treatment for clean ulcers and after debridement. Bacterial load can be managed with cleansing. Topical antibiotics should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with advancing cellulitis, osteomyelitis, or systemic infection.

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^112f7YD2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Etiology

Because the microbiology of SSTIs remains elusive, arguably more so than in other common conditions such as bloodstream infections, clinicians must make many treatment decisions based on an educated guess with regards to which pathogens are causing infection. In cellulitis, in particular, it is challenging to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis. When a culture is obtained, the probability of isolating an organism is low. For example, needle aspiration of inflamed skin is positive in only 5%–40% of cases, while punch biopsy cultures yield results in 20%–30%, primarily due to Streptococcus spp. and S. aureus. Since yield from blood cultures is low (≤ 5%) in patients with cellulitis and erysipelas, cultures are not routinely recommended. Therefore, SSTIs with known pathogens are not necessarily representative of all SSTIs. This fact certainly makes the etiology of the vast majority of SSTIs uncertain.

As with uncomplicated cellulitis, the majority of SSTIs where purulent material can be obtained are caused by Gram-positive pathogens, mainly S. aureus and streptococci. Gram-positive pathogens are typically identified in more than 80% of culture-positive skin infections (such as abscess or surgical-site infections), and S. aureus is the most common cause of culture-confirmed SSTIs in the United States.

At the same time, because of the emergence and spread of resistance among both Gram-positive (in particular, MRSA) and Gram-negative organisms, treatment of SSTIs has become more challenging over the last 2 decades. In a large, retrospective, observational study, Ray and colleagues assessed the microbiology of SSTIs within a US health plan. Between 2009 and 2011 among 376 262 individual plan members, 471 550 episodes of SSTI occurred, more than half of which were coded as cellulitis or abscess. Only 23% of infections were cultured, 81% of which were S. aureus, and 46% of these were MRSA. Importantly, previous history of MRSA infection, advanced age, chronic open wounds, underlying chronic disease, and frequent contact with a healthcare facility were risk factors for MRSA SSTIs (Table 1). While MRSA accounted for 37% of overall culturable infections in this study, among purulent SSTIs presenting to EDs, the rate of MRSA infection is 59%.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^114pLZB3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This trial suggests that it is highly probable that a substantial reduction in the number of repeat episodes of cellulitis of the leg could be achieved by giving patients prophylactic antibiotics for a period of 6 months after treatment of the acute episode. The result was of borderline statistical significance (meaning that there is an 8% chance that the observed benefits could have occurred by chance), but has to be interpreted in the context of a virtual absence of similar data elsewhere, the large potential magnitude of effect, and the consistency of possible benefit for a range of outcomes. The study indicates that a possible treatment effect deserves further investigation, especially as the intervention is low cost, safe and well tolerated by patients.

Although the PATCH II trial suggested a large treatment effect (a 47% reduction in the risk of a repeat episode), prophylactic penicillin did not prevent all subsequent cases of cellulitis of the leg. This would suggest that other factors are also important in determining whether or not a patient will experience further episodes. This is consistent with other studies, which report that penicillin treatment may not achieve microbial clearanceand that even when prophylaxis is ongoing, some patients continue to experience further attacks.

The findings are particularly important as they challenge two commonly held beliefs about the management of cellulitis: (i) that prophylactic penicillin V is warranted only in people with recurrent cellulitis and/or those who have known risk factors for repeat attacks, such as lymphoedema; and (ii) that prophylactic antibiotics are required long-term (or indefinitely) for benefits to be sustained. If the findings of the PATCH II trial are replicated in other studies then it is possible that all patients could be routinely offered a 6-month course of low-dose penicillin V after an attack of cellulitis of the leg. The rationale for such a treatment option is sound. Previous researchers have demonstrated that lymph drainage is compromised following an attack of cellulitis. It is therefore possible that a typical 7–10-day course of antibiotics during the acute phase of the infection may not be sufficient to achieve complete microbial clearance from the lymph system. The traditional model of giving antibiotic prophylaxis only to patients with recurrent cellulitis, or to those who already have chronic lymphoedema may in fact be too late to prevent the permanent impairment to lymph drainage in the leg that ensues following repeated episodes of cellulitis.

### Compression therapy to prevent recurrent cellulitis of the leg [^112bYhNj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic edema of the leg is a risk factor for cellulitis. Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness.

Methods

In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments.

Results

A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy. A total of 3 participants (7%) in the compression group and 6 (14%) in the control group were hospitalized for cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.09 to 1.59). Most quality-of-life outcomes did not differ between the two groups. No adverse events occurred during the trial.

Conclusions

In this small, single-center, nonblinded trial involving patients with chronic edema of the leg and cellulitis, compression therapy resulted in a lower incidence of recurrence of cellulitis than conservative treatment.

### The critical role of phlebolymphedema in cellulitis associated with lymphedema: its incidence and economic impact in a large real-world population [^117WKatr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this study point to a significant area for improvement in patient care and reduction of health care expenditure. Given the greater risk of patients with PLED's cost of cellulitis, prevention, as well as early identification and treatment of PLED-associated cellulitis could significantly decrease health care costs and improve patient quality of life.

### Estimating the health care costs associated with recurrent cellulitis managed in the outpatient setting [^1142ntEz]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent cellulitis is diagnosed in 22% to 49% of all cellulitis cases, but little is known about the costs associated with these cases.

Objective

To characterize patients with recurrent cellulitis in the outpatient setting and estimate the associated costs.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted for adult patients who presented to the outpatient facilities at our institution from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011, with recurrent cellulitis. Data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were used.

Results

A total of 157 patients were identified; 56% were male, with a mean age of 62.7 years. The mean number of episodes of cellulitis per patient was 3. Antibiotics were prescribed for all patients with a diagnosis of recurrent cellulitis, with 93% treated with oral antibiotics and 17.6% treated with intravenous antibiotics. A total of 1081 laboratory and 175 radiologic imaging tests were ordered. The minimum average cost per cellulitis episode was $586.91; the average cost per visit was $292.50.

Limitations

Retrospective study; use of a single, large academic institution; and utilization of cost estimates that may not adequately reflect the variation of costs across closed-system sites or geographic regions. There was no accounting for the nonfinancial or opportunity costs associated with hospitalization, such as lost days of employment or child care and any long-term morbidities, among others.

Conclusions

Recurrent cellulitis in the outpatient setting costs about $586.91 per episode. Although there is no criterion standard for diagnosis or treatment of cellulitis, our analysis demonstrates the need for more evidence-based management to achieve better outcomes and reduce the significant health care costs.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### Recurrent periorbital cellulitis: an unusual clinical entity [^115ghecw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To discuss the cause and management of recurrent periorbital cellulitis (RPOC).

Study Design

Retrospective case series and review of literature.

Materials and Methods

In the past 11 years, we have treated 6 patients for recurrent periorbital cellulitis (RPOC). Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 3 episodes of periorbital cellulitis (POC) within a 1-year period, with interval convalescence lasting at least 1 month. All patients were followed for at least 1 year after resolution.

Results

The causes of RPOC were as follows: (1) 2 patients developed RPOC attributed to environmental allergies; (2) 1 was diagnosed with underlying recurrent sinusitis resistant to medical management with resolution attained through surgery; (3) 1 patient with vesicular RPOC was diagnosed with herpetic RPOC and treated medically with antiviral therapy; (4) 1 patient had allergic contact dermatitis from cosmetic make-up use; and (5) 1 patient was suspected of malingering via repeat subcutaneous self-injection of an irritant.

Conclusions

Although periorbital cellulitis is a commonly encountered and treatable condition, recurrent periorbital cellulitis is rare and may be challenging to manage. In our experience, the causes of recurrence varied, but resolution was achieved by identifying the underlying cause through continuous clinical reassessment and by appropriate medical or surgical management.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^112xe8tG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This is a novel study providing new insight into patients' understanding about causes of cellulitis and views about prevention of recurrence. A strength of our approach is that, by using both qualitative interviews and quantitative survey methods, we were able to examine experiences in detail, while also providing estimates that generalize the number of patients willing to adopt different cellulitis recurrence prevention strategies. Further, by using purposive sampling for the interviews we were able to examine experiences of people with single‐episode or recurrent cellulitis, who may differ in their views and experiences. A limitation is the relatively low response rate to invitation to participate, meaning that these views may not be representative of all people with a history of cellulitis. Furthermore, with no sample frame for the participants elicited from community advertising an overall response rate could not be calculated, which may further compromise the study's external validity. It is also known that cellulitis can be incorrectly diagnosed, so it is possible that some of our participants may not have had cellulitis. To mitigate against potentially including participants without cellulitis, we asked our interviewees to confirm they had cellulitis prior to interview and also considered the type of symptoms discussed during the interview, noting symptoms that were unlikely to be cellulitis (i.e. bilateral leg symptoms).

A recent Cochrane review of interventions to prevent recurrent cellulitis concluded that prophylactic antibiotics are probably an effective strategy but that further RCTs are needed to explore the effectiveness of other interventions. 6 Given that approximately one‐third of patients with cellulitis will experience recurrent episodes, more research is needed to find effective strategies for prevention, although emollients, or active treatment of fungal foot disease, for conditions known to cause breaks in the skin barrier are likely to be effective. For people with lymphoedema, strategies such as compression hosiery or exercise may be effective. It would seem important that clinicians advise people that the condition is likely to recur and inform them that there is strong evidence to support the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Our findings suggest that many patients are not currently informed of this, among those whose cellulitis has been managed in primary care and secondary care. The people we interviewed felt that they should have received more information. In pressured clinical environments this may mean directing patients towards evidence‐based information leaflets or online resources.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### The American Venous Forum, American Vein and Lymphatic Society and the Society for Vascular Medicine expert opinion consensus on lymphedema diagnosis and treatment [^113CAivE]. Phlebology (2022). High credibility.

Lymphedema — cellulitis burden and stage-specific infection rates: Infection is a common cause of severe illness and hospitalization in lymphedema patients, and lymphedema was strongly associated with cellulitis having an odds ratio of 6.8. In a 3-year review of 440 lymphedema patients, approximately one in three (35.7%) sustained one or more episodes of cellulitis, with higher soft tissue infection in stage 3 versus stage II disease (61.7% vs 31.8%, respectively; p < 0.001).

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^114We2eu]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

RSSTIs are common but challenging clinical entities, with an important burden in terms of morbidity and healthcare-related costs. Recognizing modifiable risk factors and applying both pharmacological and nonpharmacological preventive strategies, along with a tailored approach, are effective in reducing the incidence of these conditions. A growing amount of new therapeutic options, both oral and parenteral, and the chance of out-patients administration are probably meant to change RSSTIs management in the near future.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part II. conditions that simulate lower limb cellulitis [^111ZKv3w]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Several common conditions can mimic cellulitis, creating a potential for misdiagnosis and incorrect management. The most common disorders mistaken for lower limb cellulitis include venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, irritant dermatitis, and lymphedema. The dermatologist is often consulted when a patient has failed to respond to therapy, and a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis is essential. This article focuses on entities that can mimic cellulitis, with an emphasis of elements of the history and physical examination that can help to distinguish between lower limb cellulitis and its simulators.
