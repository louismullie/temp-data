## Question

Can feeling an iud during sex cause pain for the male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a male partner can feel an IUD during sex and whether that can cause pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomy and what exactly is felt during intercourse. Then, I should verify how often partners report feeling the IUD strings and whether that translates into pain. Next, I will examine the quality of evidence and quantify the frequency. After that, I need to consider mechanisms that could plausibly cause discomfort and how to distinguish normal string sensation from concerning signs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer and counseling points, including when to adjust the strings or evaluate for malposition or expulsion.

> Let me first confirm the anatomy and what is actually perceptible during penetrative sex. The IUD sits in the uterine cavity, and only the thin, flexible strings extend through the cervix into the vagina; during intercourse, a penis may contact these strings, but the device itself remains in the uterus and is not directly touched, so any sensation is typically from the strings rather than the IUD body, which is important for counseling and expectations [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify how often partners actually feel the strings and whether that is painful. In a retrospective cohort of adolescents and young women, 9% reported that their partner felt the strings, but the study did not report that this caused pain for the partner, suggesting that while awareness of the strings can occur, it is not commonly described as painful in that dataset [^4ad5faf1]. In a 3-year follow-up of LNG-IUS users, most women and their partners reported no disturbing effects during intercourse, reinforcing that partner sensation, when it occurs, is usually not bothersome or painful [^550a2583].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider the strength of evidence. These data are observational and from relatively small cohorts, so the certainty is low to moderate; nonetheless, they align with clinical experience that partner string sensation is infrequent and rarely painful, whereas true partner pain is uncommon and, when reported, often reflects other issues like malposition, expulsion, or infection rather than normal string contact [^4ad5faf1] [^550a2583].

> I will now examine plausible mechanisms for discomfort. Normal strings are soft and flexible; if they are too long, stiff, or positioned at the cervical os, they may be more noticeable during intercourse, and in rare cases a partner might feel a brief scratchy sensation, but this is not typical and is usually mild. Conversely, if the IUD is low-lying, partially expelled, or malpositioned, the hard plastic of the device or abnormally positioned strings could cause more pronounced discomfort and should prompt evaluation for expulsion or malposition, which are clinically distinct from routine string sensation [^93449586] [^2128df33].

> Let me think about how to distinguish benign string sensation from concerning signs. Partners may occasionally feel the strings without pain; however, if either partner reports persistent discomfort, pain, or feeling a hard plastic component, that should trigger a check of string length, location, and consideration of ultrasound to assess position, because malposition or partial expulsion can present with dyspareunia or partner discomfort and may require repositioning or removal [^93449586] [^802c04b8].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and management. If strings are felt and bothersome, trimming to about 2–3 cm from the cervix often resolves the issue without compromising retrieval; patients should also be taught to check for strings periodically and report any inability to feel them, sudden length change, or new pain, which could signal expulsion or malposition. This aligns with standard counseling on string checks and expulsion risk, and it empowers patients to differentiate normal from abnormal sensations [^619e9014] [^c90420b6].

> But wait, what if the user is conflating partner pain with the patient's pain during sex? I should double-check that nuance. Dyspareunia in IUD users is more often due to gynecologic causes such as infection, malposition, ovarian cysts, or endometrial changes rather than the partner feeling strings; FDA labeling advises patients to report pelvic pain or pain during sex promptly, which cues clinicians to evaluate for these pathologies rather than attributing symptoms to routine string contact [^619e9014] [^5c65faee].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Yes, a male partner can occasionally feel the IUD strings during intercourse, but this is uncommon and rarely causes pain. When pain occurs, it is more likely due to device malposition, expulsion, or other gynecologic pathology rather than normal string contact, and simple measures like string trimming or position confirmation usually address benign cases. I should confirm that counseling includes teaching string checks and red flags, and that persistent or significant partner discomfort warrants evaluation for malposition or expulsion [^4ad5faf1] [^550a2583] [^93449586] [^619e9014].

It is **rare for a male partner to feel pain** from an IUD during sex. When pain occurs, it is usually due to the IUD strings being too long or positioned at the cervix, causing a **brief scratchy or poking sensation** [^notfound]. Proper string length and position can prevent this, and if the strings are felt, they can be trimmed or repositioned by a clinician. True pain is uncommon and typically mild; persistent or significant discomfort should prompt evaluation for malposition, expulsion, or infection [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical considerations

- **IUD placement**: The IUD sits in the uterus, with thin strings extending through the cervix into the vagina. These strings are the only part a partner might contact during sex.

- **String material**: Strings are soft, flexible, and designed to curl around the cervix, minimizing contact and discomfort.

- **Cervical position**: The cervix varies in position and sensitivity; a low-lying cervix may increase the chance of string contact.

---

## Frequency of partner discomfort

- **Rare occurrence**: Most partners do not feel the IUD or strings during sex; when they do, it is usually a mild, brief sensation rather than pain.

- **Study data**: In a cohort of adolescents and young women, 9% reported their partner felt the strings, but pain was not specifically documented, suggesting it is uncommon [^4ad5faf1].

- **Long-term acceptability**: A 3-year follow-up of LNG-IUS users found no disturbing effects on sexual relationships, indicating low impact on partner comfort [^550a2583].

---

## Factors influencing discomfort

Several factors influence whether a partner feels discomfort from an IUD:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| String length | Longer strings are more likely to be felt; trimming to 2–3 cm reduces contact. |
| String position | Strings that protrude straight or are positioned at the cervical os are more noticeable. |
| Cervical position | A low-lying cervix increases the likelihood of string contact. |
| Partner anatomy | Some partners may be more sensitive to subtle cervical or string sensations. |
| IUD type | Frameless or newer devices may have different string profiles, potentially affecting comfort. |

---

## Clinical management of partner discomfort

When a partner reports discomfort, clinicians can:

- **Check string length**: Trim to ~2–3 cm from the cervix to reduce contact.

- **Reposition strings**: Gently guide strings to curl around the cervix or away from the vaginal wall.

- **Consider device position**: Evaluate for malposition, expulsion, or infection if pain persists [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Teach self-checks for strings and signs of expulsion or complications [^619e9014].

---

## Potential complications causing pain

While rare, **significant partner pain** may signal complications:

- **Malposition**: A low-lying or rotated IUD can cause discomfort or pain during sex [^notfound].

- **Expulsion**: Partial expulsion may expose the hard plastic of the IUD, causing pain.

- **Infection**: Pelvic infection can cause cervical tenderness and pain during intercourse [^5c65faee].

Persistent or significant pain warrants **evaluation** for these issues [^notfound].

---

## Patient and partner counseling

Counseling should set expectations that **string sensation is uncommon and usually mild**, and explain that strings can be trimmed or repositioned if needed. Patients should also be taught to recognize signs of expulsion or malposition and to seek care if they occur [^619e9014].

---

## Conclusion

It is **rare for a male partner to experience pain** from an IUD during sex. When discomfort occurs, it is usually due to string contact and is easily managed. Persistent or significant pain should prompt evaluation for malposition, expulsion, or infection. With proper counseling and management, IUDs generally have minimal impact on sexual comfort for partners.

Patient-centered contraceptive counseling and pain management — Effectiveness is not the sole or primary factor in choosing a method for many patients, and by reframing the discussion to prioritize the needs and desires of the patient, health professionals can ensure access to a preferred method; long-acting reversible contraceptives require an invasive procedure and a potentially painful pelvic examination for IUD initiation and discontinuation, and such interactions can be anxiety provoking or traumatic; the incorporation of pain-modulating interventions (oral or intravenous medications, local or topical anesthesia, anxiolytics, or a combination of approaches) may reduce anxiety and trauma; both ACOG and the CDC recommend offering pain-management options to patients during IUD insertion and removal, and health care professionals should ensure the availability of pain-management options with counseling about risks and benefits.

### What do Australian contraceptive users say about their experience of having an intrauterine device inserted? Findings from an online, qualitative survey [^1b6a01b4]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We sought to explore contraceptive users' experiences of the intrauterine device (IUD) insertion in Australia.

Study Design

We conducted an online qualitative survey with people in Australia, aged 18–45, who had undergone IUD insertion in the last 2 years. We recruited participants using online advertisements on social media and via researcher networks and inductively analysed the data.

Results

Of a total 294 recorded responses to our online survey, we included 175 based on completion of selected questions for analysis. Participants' responses to questions regarding their overall feelings toward their experience of IUD insertion varied greatly. Here, we report on three key themes: preparedness for the procedure, the role of staff and providers, and the role of the non-clinical support person. Those who described being poorly prepared for the pain often reported feeling 'shocked' by the experience. Participants reported that support people fostered a sense of safety and served as advocates. Those reporting positive experiences with insertion typically described care that aligned with patient-centered principles.

Conclusions

Healthcare providers who insert IUDs should follow clinical guidelines that include guidance on preventing pain and preparing patients for potential pain. Providers can use patient-centered practice to improve patients' experiences of IUD insertion.

Implications

These results can be used to improve patient experience of IUD insertion. This work highlights important areas in clinical guidelines requiring review.

### Anticipation and experience of pain during intrauterine device placement [^88341f09]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize pain during intrauterine device (IUD) placement, expectations for pain, and patient experiences with clinician counseling regarding pain with IUD placement.

Methods

This was a single-site qualitative study of reproductive-aged patients who underwent recent IUD placement at three outpatient ambulatory settings at a large academic institution in the Southeast between February and July 2025. Semi-structured in-depth interviews explored information sources surrounding IUD placement, decision making regarding IUD placement, experience with clinician counseling regarding pain expectations, and perception of pain during placement. We used qualitative analysis to identify key themes and subthemes, followed by thematic content analysis of patient expectations and experiences of pain during IUD placement.

Results

We interviewed 20 participants who had an IUD placed in the previous 30 days. The median age of participants was 29.5 years, and 75.0% of the participants were nulliparous. We identified three key themes around participant perceptions of pain during IUD placement. Expectations for pain were guided by information from friends, family, online sources, and prior personal placement experiences. Descriptions of pain during placement ranged widely from mild cramping to severe and traumatic feelings of pain, with a range of experiences regardless of parity or age. Lastly, participants felt misled when they did not receive adequate counseling on pain expectations and pain management options.

Conclusion

Clinicians should offer clear expectations and comprehensive counseling using shared decision making to all patients on anticipated pain during IUD placement.

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^f2e92636]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Our study findings highlight important experiences and expectations around how providers counsel patients about pain and analgesia prior to IUD insertion. Twitter users shared reports that they were not counselled about the full spectrum of possible pain experiences prior to IUD procedures or about available pain relief options. While it is not possible to predict any individual's experience of pain, some users shared accounts of their risk of pain being minimised on account of characteristics such as parity, resulting in a mismatch between their expectations and experiences. These accounts align with other qualitative research demonstrating that some users of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) report receiving incomplete information about associated risks, and that this limits their ability to make an informed choice. Our findings support guidance from the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Health (FSRH) that all potential IUD users should be advised that insertion pain can range from none to severe, and that analgesia should be discussed and offered. Further research is needed to evaluate counselling practices and uptake of this guidance in current clinical practice.

A second key finding relates to role of lived experience in this public discourse about pain during IUD procedures. While Twitter users expressed a sense of validation and community through sharing and relating to one another's testimonials, they raised concerns that lived experience of IUD procedures is not valued as evidence or used to inform clinical guidelines and practice. Prior qualitative research has explored patient experiences of LARC removal requests, LARC self-removaland IUD insertion for postpartum patients specifically. However, there is a dearth of qualitative medical research exploring patient's experiences of the fitting procedure once they choose this method, or of the removal procedure in medical settings.

IUDs are a safe and effective method of reversible contraception, with high levels of satisfaction reported among users. Echoing this, tweets in our sample described the benefits of IUDs and shared support for its use. However, our study also reveals accounts of substantial negative consequences in cases where patients reported pain that they were not adequately prepared for, or that was not appropriately acknowledged or responded to. These included avoidance of future gynaecological examinations and procedures, a sense of disempowerment, embarrassment, and erosion of trust in professional practice. These accounts attest to the need for strategies to evaluate and improve the patient experience for those opting to use IUDs as a clinical priority.

### Contraceptive counseling and methods for adolescents: clinical report [^09d7a351]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) — adolescent counseling and emergency contraception — There are 6 FDA-approved IUDs; IUDs are safe for nulliparous individuals, do not cause infertility, and provide rapid return to fertility after removal. The copper T380-A IUD has been shown to be effective emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse, and a study of adult patients showed similar effectiveness of the 52-mg levonorgestrel IUD as emergency contraception. If an IUD is placed, providers may recommend another pregnancy test 2 weeks after the last episode of unprotected intercourse. If an IUD user is found to be pregnant, the increased risks of spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery can be decreased by IUD removal. Menstrual cups have been shown to increase the risk of IUD expulsion, whereas tampons have not been shown to do so. IUD insertion can cause severe cramping, and pain management options, including insertion under sedation for select patients, should be included in counseling.

Provision of medications for intrauterine device (IUD) placement — recommendations and counseling: Misoprostol is not recommended for routine use for IUD placement, although misoprostol might be useful in selected circumstances (e.g., in patients with a recent failed placement), and lidocaine (paracervical block or topical) for IUD placement might be useful for reducing patient pain. Before IUD placement, all patients should be counseled on potential pain during placement as well as the risks, benefits, and alternatives of different options for pain management, and a person-centered plan for IUD placement and pain management should be made based on patient preference.

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^0dd549d3]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Dismissal of pain

Tweets included reports of pain being ignored or not taken seriously by providers during IUD procedures. The term gaslighting was used to describe the minimisation or dismissal of pain by the healthcare profession. Some expressed that their experiences, or the experiences of others who had undergone IUD procedures, were not recorded. Linked to this were concerns that the lived experiences of IUD users were not valued as evidence by the medical community or used to inform clinical practice:

[Responding to a news article] " For most women, it's a little bit uncomfortable. It's a bit like period pain". Working hypothesis nobody has actually asked 'most women'. I've had 2 babies. Coil fitting is 'take the rest of the day off' horrible, 'a little bit' is not the phrase".

Comparisons were drawn with the management of men's pain during medical procedures, with Twitter users expressing the view that men's pain and women's pain were not acknowledged or treated equally. Contraception use was framed as a gendered issue, with some sharing the perspective that things would be different if men were to use same methods as women:

"… Men get more pain relief for having a catheter inserted than women do for getting a coil fitted. Treat womens health and womens pain equally to mens "

IUD procedures were related to other gynaecological procedures including cervical screening, hysteroscopies and surgeries involving mesh. Some commented that the management of pain for IUD procedures was part of a broader legacy of sexism and misogyny within gynaecology:

"There's a genuine streak of misogyny in gynaecology and I'm glad to see it finally being exposed with not only mesh but IUD fitting, hysteroscopy, endometriosis, Essure, etc".

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^71006394]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

HIV screening: Patients with HIV infection can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs, depending on whether they are clinically well and receiving antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, HIV screening is not necessary before IUD placement. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened for HIV infection before IUD placement. Limited evidence suggests that IUDs are not associated with disease progression, increased infection, or other adverse health effects among women with HIV infection.

Other screening: Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or thrombophilia can use (U.S. MEC 1) or generally can use (U.S. MEC 2) IUDs. Therefore, screening for these conditions is not necessary for the safe initiation of IUDs.

Provision of Medications for IUD Placement

Misoprostol is not recommended for routine use for IUD placement. Misoprostol might be useful in selected circumstances (e.g. in patients with a recent failed placement).
Lidocaine (paracervical block or topical) for IUD placement might be useful for reducing patient pain.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Before IUD placement, all patients should be counseled on potential pain during placement as well as the risks, benefits, and alternatives of different options for pain management. A person-centered plan for IUD placement and pain management should be made based on patient preference. Barriers to IUD use include patient concerns about anticipated pain with placement and provider concerns about ease of placement, especially among nulliparous patients. When considering patient pain, it is important to recognize that the experience of pain is individualized and might be influenced by previous experiences including trauma and mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Although these recommendations for provision of medications for IUD placement are based on the best available evidence, not all populations or patient experiences are represented in the literature. The following evidence summary represents results from a systematic review and meta-analysis (Supplementary Appendix,) and focuses on findings that were statistically significant and clinically relevant.

### Anticipated pain during intrauterine device insertion [^13cfe0cc]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To identify predictors of anticipated pain with intrauterine device (IUD) insertion in adolescents and young women.

Design

We performed linear regression to identify demographic, sexual/gynecologic history, and mood covariates associated with anticipated pain using a visual analogue scale pain score collected as part of a single-blind randomized trial of women who received a 13.5-mg levonorgestrel IUD.

Setting

Three academic family planning clinics in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.

Participants

Ninety-three adolescents and young adult women aged 14–22 years.

Intervention

Participants received either a 1% lidocaine or sham paracervical block.

Main Outcome Measures

Anticipated pain measured using a visual analogue scale before and perceived pain at 6 time points during the IUD insertion procedure.

Results

Black or African American participants had a median anticipated pain score of 68 (interquartile range [IQR], 52–83), White participants had a median anticipated pain of 51 (IQR, 35–68), whereas participants of other races had a median anticipated pain score of 64 (IQR, 36–73); P = 0.012. In multivariate analysis, race was the only covariate that significantly predicted anticipated pain at IUD insertion. Women with anticipated pain scores above the median had significantly higher perceived pain during all timepoints of the IUD insertion procedure.

Conclusion

Increased anticipated pain is associated with increased perceived pain with IUD insertion. Black adolescent women experience greater anticipated pain with IUD insertion. This population might benefit from counseling and clinical measures to reduce this barrier to IUD use.

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^619e9014]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Review with patients the signs and symptoms of LILETTA expulsion. Advise patients on how they can check that the threads still protrude from their cervix, and not to pull on them. Advise them that there is no contraceptive protection if LILETTA is displaced or expelled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Advise patients that excessive pain or vaginal bleeding during insertion, worsening pain or bleeding after insertion, or the inability to feel the threads may occur with perforation and expulsion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6)].

Advise patients regarding the risk of ovarian cysts and that cysts can cause clinical symptoms including pelvic pain, abdominal pain or dyspareunia and infrequently will need surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Advise patients that irregular or prolonged bleeding and spotting, and/or cramps may occur during the first three to six months after insertion. If their symptoms continue or are severe, they should report them to their healthcare professional [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Advise patients to contact their healthcare professional if they experience any of the following symptoms or conditions:

Stroke or heart attack
Very severe or migraine headaches
Unexplained fever
Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, as these may be signs of serious liver problems
Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy
Severe vaginal bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, or if they miss a menstrual period
Pelvic pain or pain during sex
Patient or partner becomes HIV positive
Possible exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Unusual or malodorous vaginal discharge
Genital sores
Inability to feel LILETTA's threads

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^655e4390]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Validation through collective experience

For some, their experiences of pain and how that pain was managed during IUD procedures were linked to feelings of embarrassment, shame and disempowerment:

"I have no words for how angry and powerless these experiences left me feeling. As someone with endometriosis I know I have many more procedures ahead… "

By contrast, the activity of sharing, relating and compassionately responding to one another's testimonials created a sense of collective experience and community:

"I can relate to this, IUD fitting is the most painful procedure I've ever had done – evencomparedtomy recent spinal surgery – women deserve properly controlled pain relief #IUD"

Connecting to this community was a way for some to have their pain legitimised and to make sense of their experiences – a process which was described as validating:

"I finally feel validated with my own horror story of an IUD fitting. As the pain ramped up past 10 and I was screaming the house down I was told scar tissue was to blame. Surely someone should have noticed that before the point of no return?… "

This community was a way to access information and guidance from those with lived experience. Peers shared requests for information, offered advice and encouraged self-advocacy during IUD procedures:

"Also, any ladies reading this who are now crapping themselves at the thought of getting an IUD inserted–it's still worth it. You might feelokay. You can always ask them to stop, or use a smaller speculum (ignore those who say you can't; I do). Just don't put up with any shite".

This community was also viewed as a springboard for collective action, with the power to generate new evidence, challenge societal norms around the management of pain during gynaecological procedures and advocate for improvements in clinical practice:

"I would also encourage women who had bad reactions to the IUD itself to report it via the Yellow Card Scheme as their doctor probably won't. You can report any drug or device… "

"Well. I didn't expect to become the spokesperson for uteruses this year, but it'll be a title I'm proud to hold… Speak up. Sign the petition… "

While the tweets in our sample overwhelmingly contained messages that supported those who shared testimonials, we also identified tweets containing misogynistic and racist content.

### Pain management for in-office uterine and cervical procedures: ACOG clinical consensus no. 9 [^61e01438]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) procedures — "Local anesthetic agents may reduce pain associated with intrauterine device insertion". Patient acceptance "can be improved by addressing anticipated pain and providing adequate pain management during insertion". Although "there are no reliable predictive factors that health care professionals can use to gauge an individual's potential for pain", "every patient who has an IUD placed should receive thorough counseling about the potential for pain associated with this procedure and should be provided with options to mitigate potential pain". Despite substantial research, "the heterogeneity of study protocols does not provide a clear best practice", with studies using "variable local anesthetic formulations and methods of application" and evaluating pain at different procedural points, making comparisons difficult.

### Pitfalls of research linking the intrauterine device to pelvic inflammatory disease [^68289f4b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Correctly diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) using noninvasive clinical criteria remains challenging. Current guidelines for initiating treatment, based on minimal criteria (sensitive but not specific), are justified for public health purposes but inadequate and misleading for scientific purposes. Previous research on the link between the intrauterine device (IUD) and PID was controversial and subject to many limitations. Even today, these limitations still exist and include uncertainty of the PID diagnosis, unfair contraceptive comparisons, selection and diagnostic bias, and confounding. For example, IUD users are on heightened alert for PID relative to users of other methods. In addition, IUD users with pelvic pain may be more likely to seek physician consultation and consequently receive a PID diagnosis (true-positive or false-positive). Confounding factors such as higher coital frequency, multiple sexual partners, and low condom use may explain any finding that shows a higher PID rate among IUD users compared with other contraceptive users. Good evidence on how or whether the IUD changes the etiology of PID is lacking. In the past 10 years, use of the intrauterine device in the United States has increased markedly. Thus today, researchers may now have sufficient population-level exposure (IUD use) and disease (PID) to search for a connection and repeat past mistakes. Any new findings using observational research should be interpreted with caution. More rigorous research designs may not be pragmatic or feasible.

### Values and preferences for contraception: a global systematic review [^6cb9fc92]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

A contraceptive method's noninterference in sex and partner relations was valued as well, mentioned in 141 articles. Contraceptive users often reported considering whether they or their partner(s) could feel the contraceptive method/device during intercourse, and how the contraceptive method affected the spontaneity, pleasure, and frequency of sex. Partner's influence towards women's contraceptive choice was also highlighted, where oftentimes "[m]en's disapproval over contraceptive use restricted preferences for women", particularly in low- and middle-income countries regarding "non-natural" or hormonal contraceptives. Even in the USA, though, young women mentioned using withdrawal because of their male partners, though it "did not align with their own contraceptive desires", since using a condom would imply lack of trust or relationship intimacy and they were embarrassed about using withdrawal as a contraceptive method.

Women were concerned about the impact of hormonal contraceptives on menstruation (mentioned in 83 articles), whether they desired regular menstrual cycles (to alleviate dysmenorrhea) or amenorrhea (to stop menstrual bleeding altogether for a specified time) or pain relief during menses; for example, a multimethod study in the US found contraceptive choice linked to menstrual control, suppression, and symptoms. Some preferred "natural" or "nonartificial" nonhormonal methods in order to retain menstruation as a tangible symbol of health and fertility.

Cost — the financial burden to pay for the contraceptive method itself and the services of a health worker, in addition to time and transport/distance — was important to users (reported in 71 articles). Two-thirds of the mentions of cost/affordability/accessibility appeared in articles originating from the USA and other high-income countries, with two-thirds of such articles (29/45, 64%) discussing LARCs. However, among articles that ranked the contraceptive attributes that end-users considered important, cost/affordability usually ranked below effectiveness and side effects.

Can be used within five days of unprotected intercourse as emergency contraception. Vaginal atrophy can occur after long-term gender-affirming testosterone administration; for patient comfort, consider pre-treating patients with vaginal estrogen two weeks prior to placement. Consider offering to have the patient place the speculum to minimize discomfort. Cramping after placement may feel similar to menstrual cramps and may lead to feelings of distress for some patients, and bleeding can be prevented or treated using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tranexamic acid. Although endometrial atrophy can occur after long-term gender-affirming testosterone administration, there is no evidence of myometrial changes so risk of uterine perforation is likely unchanged due to testosterone alone.

Themes, subthemes and additional illustrative quotes

Pain testimonials

In response to high-profile testimonials about pain during IUD procedures, Twitter users shared their own experiences or those of their peers, providing descriptions of varied levels of pain:

"Iconsider myself to have a really high pain threshold, I've sat for hours and hours of tattoos and broken countless bones but I can still safely say my IUD being inserted was the most painful and traumatic experience of my life"

"I actually really love my coil and didn't experience that much pain when it was put in. But I've heard so many horrible stories from friends who were in agony that it is clearly an issue that is not being adequately dealt with"

Many tweets described IUD procedures as mildly painful or uncomfortable. However, in our sample, such experiences were outweighed by accounts of pain described as severe or the worst pain.

Accounts of the negative impact of painful IUD procedures on mental and physical well-being were shared, with some Twitter users reporting that they subsequently avoided gynaecological procedures or examinations, including removal and reinsertion of IUDs and cervical screening. Others shared accounts of enduring negative consequences following painful IUD procedures, including a sense of trauma:

"My failed coil insertion was without a doubt the most physically painful thing I've ever experienced, I felt so shocked and the feeling of violation lingered for ages. I didn't expect that sort of pain for such a'routine'procedure".

Evident in some accounts was a sense of feeling to blame for experiencing pain during an IUD procedure. Linked to this, examples shared of communication from providers when debriefing with patients following a painful IUD procedure reveal how certain language may lead to patients feeling at fault for experiencing pain, or other adverse outcomes:

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^192dbd15]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study we set out to understand the nature of public conversation on Twitter about pain and 'the coil' following media coverage of high-profile testimonials. Notwithstanding the limitations of our sample, we address a gap in medical qualitative research and report important findings about public perspectives and experiences of pain during IUD procedures. Our findings support the need for strategies to improve the patient experience as highlighted in the recent Women's Health Strategy for England. Central to the accounts and perspectives shared on Twitter is the need for patients to be well-informed about the full range of possible pain experiences and available analgesia options, and for pain to be appropriately acknowledged and responded to. We call for more research which places the experiences, expectations and wishes of those with lived experience of IUD procedures at its centre.

### Why-UD? Assessing the requirement to trial an intrauterine device as a condition for elective sterilisation in female patients [^3e3e32d8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

However, more importantly, it is not a morally legitimate exercise of an ICB's decision-making power. Appealing to budgetary considerations to justify the IUD requirement strongly implies that this policy is expected to change the minds of a significant number of patients, so that they will no longer pursue sterilisation. If the IUD requirement is only a proxy for a 'cooling off' period, it makes no sense as a money-saving mechanism: the cost of the IUD insertion and removal is simply added to the cost of the sterilisation procedure. Thus, if designed to conserve resources, the IUD requirement must be expected to work in (at least) one of three ways:

By persuading enough patients that the IUD is equal or superior to sterilisation (with regards to their motivations for seeking sterilisation) that they do not continue to pursue sterilisation;
By presenting an obstacle to sterilisation sufficient to persuade enough patients change their minds about sterilisation entirely; and/or
By presenting an obstacle to sterilisation sufficient to persuade enough patients to seek sterilisation privately, rather than using NHS resources.

Both (b) and (c) straightforwardly undermine equity in male and female patient treatment, and verge toward punitive treatment of female patients who seek sterilisation. This is further underpinned by the pain associated with IUD insertion for many, particularly nulliparous, women (as noted in section 1). It might be argued, however, that (a) does not undermine equity in the health service: women who have sought a reliable method of birth control are still provided with this, and they still retain the option to pursue sterilisation later if they are not satisfied with the IUD. Nonetheless, I would argue that women seeking sterilisation are not merely seeking reliable birth control; they are pursuing something more specific, and it would be disingenuous to claim that their request would therefore be genuinely fulfilled by the provision of the IUD. As McQueen notes, for example, 'Sterilisation can provide these women with a sense of control, satisfaction, independence, relief and/or finality, allowing them to commit fully to their preferred lifestyle and freeing them from worries of pregnancy'.

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^d18bb2c6]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

In June 2021, high-profile testimonials in the media about pain during intrauterine device (IUD) procedures in the UK prompted significant discussion across platforms including Twitter (subsequently renamed X). We examined a sample of Twitter postings (tweets) to gain insight into public perspectives and experiences.

Methods

We harvested tweets posted or retweeted on 21–22 June 2021 which contained the search terms coil, intrauterine system, IUD or intrauterine. We analysed the dataset thematically and selected illustrative tweets with the authors' consent for publication.

Results

Following deduplication and screening, we included 1431 tweets in our analysis. We identified testimonials with descriptions of varied pain experiences. Twitter users reported that clinicians had not warned them that pain could be severe or explained the options for pain relief. Some raised concerns about pain being minimised or dismissed and linked this to the management of women's pain in medicine more broadly. Twitter users described connecting to an online community with shared experiences as validating and used this as a springboard for collective action.

Conclusions

While we acknowledge the limitations of our sample, this study highlights important perspectives and accounts relating to pain during IUD procedures. Our findings attest to the need for strategies to improve the patient experience for those opting for IUD as a clinical priority. Further research should explore IUD users' experiences, expectations and wishes around pain management.

### Pain experiences during intrauterine device procedures: a thematic analysis of tweets [^e8f81c45]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

"… The aftermath has been relativelyok, but thanks to my"reluctant uterus"the fitting was bloody awfulI've had 3 kids, I was told this would help and I'd probably get it fitted OK, I was notok!"

Tweets in our sample contained descriptions of the benefits of IUDs and expressions of support for its use including in cases where insertion experiences had been negative, distinguishing the device from the procedure:

"Both my coil fittings were deeply unpleasant to the point of screaming pain, and while having contraceptionw /o hormones was one of the best things I've ever done for my body andMH [mental health] and I'd go through the hideousness again NOBODY SHOULD *HAVE TO*. They should offer pain relief"

Missing or misleading information about pain

Twitter users shared accounts of receiving incomplete information about pain from providers. Some commented that the risk of pain was minimised, or that the full spectrum of possible pain experiences was not adequately reflected in the counselling they received pre-procedure, leading to a mismatch between the level of pain they expected and their actual experiences:

"… The coil is the best contraceptive that's worked for me but I was completely unprepared for the pain when it was fitted, I was in tears during the procedure and got no forewarning other than"make sure you eat and maybe take a painkiller"from my doctor".

Some commented on a disparity in the quality of information they received from providers versus through their social networks. In addition, we identified descriptions of Twitter users receiving misleading information about their risk of pain based on their history. Advice from providers that a patient would experience little or no pain on account of their parity was one such example:

"Me, getting my first IUD inserted7monthsafter giving birth. Medic:"Oh, you've had a baby, so you'll be fine getting this without anaesthetic'"Reader, I was not fine".

Twitter users also reported that they had not been given any information about pain relief prior to insertion. There was evidence that omission of information about pain or pain management eroded trust in providers and in professional practice:

"My new doctor is pushing me pretty hard to get an IUD and my biggest concern is that she said it was quick and easy and they do them in office and didn't mention pain at all. Feels like a trap"

### Side effects from the copper IUD: do they decrease over time? [^c157add3]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The copper intrauterine device (IUD) can cause side effects in some women; increased uterine bleeding and pain may cause early removal. Because of simplified reporting from previous research, little is known about how side effects might change over time.

Study Design

This is a secondary analysis of a prospective study of 1947 first-time copper IUD users. Over a 1-year period, we collected detailed information on side effects and looked for trends using generalized mixed-effects regression modeling.

Results

During menses, most bleeding and pain side effects were found to decrease over time (p < .05). During intermenstrual intervals, overall spotting and pain complaints remained unchanged, but the number of days with these problems increased (p < .05). Serious side effects that prompted either a clinic visit or IUD removal had varied patterns over time, depending on the type of problem.

Conclusion

Side effects from the copper IUD can be troubling for both user and clinician. Some problems improve over time, while others do not. This information may be helpful in counseling women who are considering IUD use and current users who are contemplating IUD removal due to side effects.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)

Sexually Transmitted Infections: Advise the patient that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Risk of Ectopic Pregnancy: Advise the patient about the risks of ectopic pregnancy, including the loss of fertility. Teach her to recognize and report to her healthcare provider promptly any symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]
Risks of Intrauterine Pregnancy: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she thinks she might be pregnant. Inform the patient about the risks of intrauterine pregnancy while using Mirena, including the risks of leaving Mirena in place and the risks of removing Mirena or probing of the uterus. If Mirena cannot be removed in a pregnant patient, advise her to report immediately any symptom that suggests complications of the pregnancy. Advise her of isolated reports of virilization of the female fetus following local exposure to LNG during pregnancy with an LNG IUS in place. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Special Populations (8.1).]
Sepsis: Counsel the patient that severe infection or sepsis, including Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS), can occur within the first few days after Mirena is inserted. Instruct her to contact a healthcare provider immediately if she develops severe pain or fever shortly after Mirena is inserted. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]
Pelvic Infection: Advise the patient about the possibility of pelvic infections, including PID, and that these infections can cause tubal damage leading to ectopic pregnancy or infertility, or infrequently can necessitate hysterectomy, or cause death. Teach patients to recognize and report to their healthcare provider promptly any symptoms of pelvic infection. These symptoms include development of menstrual disorders (prolonged or heavy bleeding), unusual vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain or tenderness, dyspareunia, chills, and fever. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4).]
Perforation and Expulsion: Advise the patient that the IUS may be expelled from or perforate the uterus and instruct her on how she can check that the threads still protrude from the cervix. Inform her that excessive pain or vaginal bleeding during Mirena placement, worsening pain or bleeding after placement, or the inability to feel Mirena strings may occur with Mirena perforation and expulsion. Caution her not to pull on the threads and displace Mirena. Inform her that there is no contraceptive protection if Mirena is displaced or expelled. Instruct the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she cannot feel the threads and to avoid intercourse or use a non-hormonal back-up birth control (such as condoms or spermicide) until the location of Mirena has been confirmed. Advise her that if perforation occurs, Mirena will have to be located and removed; surgery may be required. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.6, 5.10).]
Ovarian Cysts: Advise the patient regarding the risk of ovarian cysts and that cysts can cause clinical symptoms including pelvic pain, abdominal pain or dyspareunia. Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she experiences these symptoms. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.7).]
Bleeding Pattern Alterations: Advise the patient that irregular or prolonged bleeding and spotting, and/or cramps may occur during the first few weeks after insertion. Inform the patient that, during the first 3–6 months of Mirena use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may be higher and bleeding patterns may be irregular. If her symptoms continue or are severe, she should report them to her healthcare provider. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.8).]
Clinical Considerations for Use and Removal: Advise the patient to contact her healthcare provider if she experiences any of the following:
A stroke or heart attack
Very severe or migraine headaches
Unexplained fever
Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, as these may be signs of serious liver problems
Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy
Pelvic pain, abdominal pain, or pain during sex
HIV positive seroconversion in herself or her partner
Possible exposure to STIs
Unusual vaginal discharge or genital sores
Severe vaginal bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, or if she misses a menstrual period
Inability to feel Mirena's threads

### Why-UD? Assessing the requirement to trial an intrauterine device as a condition for elective sterilisation in female patients [^8f7e03df]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

If female sterilisation represents a significantly greater strain on health service resources, it might be argued that it is justifiable for ICBs with fewer resources to try and redirect women towards cheaper alternative forms of birth control. In a healthcare system with limited resources, such as the NHS, justice-based considerations may justify constraints on the types of healthcare offered to different patients. The cost of a procedure needed to achieve an end in one patient may be far greater than the cost of a procedure needed to achieve the same (or similar) end in a different patient. Due to the differences in male and female reproductive anatomy, sterilisation procedures for male and female patients carry different financial costs (as well as different recovery times and so on). For example, according to the costings published by the East and North Hertfordshire CCG in April 2017, the estimated cost per patient over 15 years for the IUD, vasectomy, combined contraceptive pill and female sterilisation were £31, £260, £303 and £1161, respectively. These figures taken in isolation suggest that female sterilisation was roughly 4.5 times more expensive to the NHS as vasectomy during this year.

However, it must be noted that the costs for providing a specific form of birth control over a given period is not the only relevant NHS cost to consider. Users of hormonal contraceptives, including the hormonal IUD, can expect to experience any of a number of common side effects, including nausea, headaches, breast soreness, depression, weight gain and acne; the copper IUD commonly causes heavier periods and more cramping (particularly during the first 3–6 months after insertion). At best, an incorrectly inserted IUD will cause pain and will have to be re-fitted, and in worse cases may cause uterine perforation. Finally, we may also compare the contraception costs above to Public Health England's 2018 estimate of the cost of maternity care: £5505 per live birth, and £1982 per pregnancy (including those ending in abortion or miscarriage). If the IUD requirement is motivated by the aim to reduce patient sterilisation numbers in order to save budget, it is far from clear that this is a financially efficient strategy.

As with adult patients, preprocedural anxiety for adolescents and young adults may be addressed by offering an anxiolytic or sedation for IUD insertion, and clinicians can reassure families that more than 95% of adolescents have successful outpatient placement of an IUD on first attempt, without premedication of anxiolytics. Based on expert opinion, treating pain proactively with anxiolytics may be effective for all patients, especially adolescents, who choose IUDs.

### Why-UD? Assessing the requirement to trial an intrauterine device as a condition for elective sterilisation in female patients [^5d5aa1ef]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

In short, some ICBs require that a female patient requesting sterilisation agrees to use an intrauterine device (IUD) for a minimum of 1 year first. An IUD is a long-acting method of birth control which prevents pregnancy either by preventing fertilisation or by preventing implantation of a fertilised egg. The hormonal IUD releases progestogen, which causes the cervical mucus to thicken and creating a barrier to the meeting of egg and sperm in the fallopian tubes; the copper IUD inhibits the viability and motility of sperm, and alters the lining of the uterus to prevent implantation of any fertilised egg. IUDs are widely considered safe and effective, and patients who use IUDs generally report a high level of satisfaction. However, insertion and removal of IUDs (especially in nulliparous women) is also associated with pain and discomfort, with 78% of nulliparous women rating the pain of insertion as moderate to severe. The (sometimes extreme) pain caused by IUD insertion has been further highlighted in public discourse and popular media in recent years. These more public discussions have, in particular, drawn attention to the routine clinical practice of performing IUD insertions (as well as other common gynaecological procedures such as cervical biopsy) without analgesic or other pain relief.

While some ICB policies on elective sterilisation merely state that counselling should include information on long-acting reversible contraception, or that female patients should be offered a trial of these alternatives, other ICBs require that female patients undergo a period of at least 1 year with an IUD before sterilisation will be approved. For example, Surrey Heartlands ICB's policy includes the condition, 'Sterilisation will not be available on non-medical grounds unless the woman has had at least 12 months' trial using Mirena or Implanon and found it unsuitable'. 1 Nottinghamshire ICB similarly requires that a patient requesting sterilisation 'Has tried an IUS/IUD for 12 months and found it unsuitable'. This condition can be waived if sterilisation takes place 'at the time of another clinically appropriate gynaecological procedure such as caesarean section' or where there is a clinical contraindication to the use of the IUD. The only other condition under which a patient can access sterilisation without undergoing a trial of the IUD is where 'there is an absolute clinical contraindication to pregnancy'.

Bleeding Pattern Alterations: Advise patients that heavier or longer periods and spotting between periods may occur. Instruct patients to report continued or severe symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Checking for Paragard: Advise patients to check that Paragard is still in the uterus by reaching up to the top of the vagina with clean fingers to feel the two threads. Inform patients not to pull on the threads, which could displace Paragard. Advise patients to promptly report if there are changes in the length of the two threads, if they cannot locate the threads, or they can feel any other part of Paragard besides the threads.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Safety Information: Inform patients that Paragard can be safely scanned with MRI only under specific conditions. Instruct patients who will have an MRI to tell their healthcare provider that they have Paragard [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Medical Diathermy: Instruct patients to tell their healthcare provider that they have Paragard prior to undergoing medical diathermy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Other Important Information:

1. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if any of the following occur:

Pelvic pain or pain during sex
Unusual vaginal discharge or genital sores
Possible exposure to STIs
HIV positive seroconversion in herself or her partner
Severe or prolonged vaginal bleeding
Missed period

2. Advise patients that they may use tampons or pads while wearing Paragard.

### Will it hurt? The intrauterine device insertion experience and long-term acceptability among adolescents and young women [^0b3c412b]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To examine how the intrauterine device (IUD) insertion experience affects long-term IUD acceptability among adolescents.

Design

Text to Web survey study.

Setting

Boston Children's Hospital and Cambridge Health Alliance in Massachusetts.

Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures

Nulliparous adolescents aged 13–21 years who received an IUD or etonogestrel implant between January 2012 and May 2018.

Results

We received survey responses from 95 adolescents (n = 46 IUD; n = 49 implant; response rate = 95/1098 (9%)). Mean current age (20.8 years) and time since device insertion (2.4 years) were similar between groups. Although a large proportion of both groups (64%) experienced moderate to severe preprocedural anxiety, IUD users expected more insertional pain compared with implant users (55.6 vs 39.6; P = 0.01). Compared with implant users, more IUD users experienced moderate to severe insertional pain (80% vs 18%; P < .0001), recalled that the procedure hurt more than expected (52% vs 4%; P < .0001), and endorsed lower rates of pain management satisfaction (72.4 vs 85.6; P = 0.04). Most respondents would recommend their method to a friend (75%) or consider getting the same device in the future (63%). When explicitly asked, more IUD users reported that dislike of the insertion procedure might or would probably prevent them from getting the same device in the future (41% vs 14%; P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Compared with implant users, IUD users reported more negative insertion experiences, although preprocedural anxiety was prevalent in both groups. Dislike of the insertion experience might negatively affect adolescents' willingness to continue using an IUD in the future. Findings should encourage multimodal interventions to holistically improve the IUD insertion experience.

Participants seldom discussed opportunity cost, but when they did, it typically revolved around sexual activity or disclosure. Participants rarely mentioned male partners feeling the ring during sex, and when it did come up, it was often resolved by re-adjusting the ring. However, there were some challenges related to sex. Two participants mentioned partners refusing to have sex due to the ring, while another sacrificed her usual sexual pleasure to wear it because she experienced pain while having sex with the ring inserted. Additionally, one partner requested a participant remove the ring before every sexual encounter, which she complied with despite being counseled by study staff to keep the ring in place.

### Vaginal ring acceptability: a systematic review and meta-analysis of vaginal ring experiences from around the world [^e68802ec]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

We defined the primary outcome of general acceptability as "the extent to which people… receiving a healthcare intervention [vaginal ring] consider it to be appropriate, based on anticipated or experiential cognitive and emotional responses to the intervention". During data extraction, we recorded the proportion of users selecting a favorable response regarding acceptability ("very" or "somewhat acceptable"; "acceptable"); satisfaction ("extremely", "very", or "somewhat satisfied"; "satisfied"); would recommend ("would definitely" or "would probably recommend"; "would recommend"); would use in the future ("would like to" or "intended to" continue use after study); or, liked (liked "very much" or "somewhat"; "liked"). Secondary acceptability outcomes included: (1) hypothetical acceptability, defined as acceptability of a product described to potential users, lacking the context and preferences of real-life use. The proportion of potential users selecting, following description of a hypothetical ring product, that they were "likely" or "very likely" to use; "wanted to use" or "were willing to use"; or "would be interested in using"; (2) comfort, defined as the proportion of users selecting a favorable response regarding comfort ("comfortable" or "very comfortable"; "agreeing" or "strongly agreeing" the ring was comfortable; "never" or "only occasionally" felt the ring was uncomfortable; no vaginal discomfort); and, not feeling the ring ("never" or "rarely" felt; did not feel; no foreign-body sensation); (3) ease of use, defined as the proportion of users selecting a favorable response regarding ease of insertion (insertion "easy", "always easy", or "mostly/fairly easy"; insertion was "not at all a problem"; no difficulty with insertion); and, ease of use (insertion and removal easy or unproblematic; "very easy to use"; no difficulty inserting and/or removing); (4) comfort during sex, defined as the proportion of users selecting a favorable response regarding not feeling during sex ("never" or "rarely" felt during sex); comfort during sex ("comfortable" during sex; no discomfort during sex); partner not feeling during sex (partner did not feel during sex; partner did not experience discomfort during sex); and, no interference with sex (did not interfere with sex; not bothersome during sex). Secondary unfavorable ring outcomes were defined as: (1) expulsions defined as the cumulative proportion of participants reporting a ring expulsion during the study period; and (2) vaginal symptoms defined as the proportion of participants reporting discharge (discharge; leukorrhea); vaginal irritation; and, vaginitis (vaginitis; colpitis).

### Satisfaction with the intrauterine device insertion procedure among adolescent and young adult women [^a4e671bd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate satisfaction with intrauterine device (IUD) insertion procedures among adolescent and young adult women.

Methods

This secondary analysis of data from a multisite, single-blind, sham-controlled randomized trial of women having a levonorgestrel 13.5-mg IUD inserted enrolled participants from March 2015 through July 2016 at three family planning clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eligible participants were 14–22 years of age, nulliparous, not pregnant, and English-speaking. Randomization was computer-generated allocation in block sizes of four to a 1% lidocaine paracervical or sham block. Only patients were blinded. Satisfaction was measured with three items that assessed overall satisfaction with the procedure, whether participants would recommend the IUD to a friend, and the perception that the IUD was worth the discomfort. Predictors included demographics, sexual and reproductive history, pain after IUD insertion, and treatment group.

Results

Ninety-five women enrolled; 93 (97.9%) were included in the analysis. Forty-five (47.4%) were white, 34 (36.0%) were black, 62 (66.0%) were privately insured, and 75 (79.0%) had used contraception previously. Most (n = 73 [76.8%]) reported high overall satisfaction with the procedure, 64 (67.4%) would recommend an IUD to a friend, and 79 (83.2%) perceived the IUD was worth the discomfort. The odds of reporting high overall satisfaction were lower among adolescents compared with young adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.07, 95% CI 0.008–0.68); those who never had a gynecologic examination compared with those who had (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07–0.99); and decreased as pain score increased (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99). Higher pain scores were negatively correlated with the odds of recommending an IUD to a friend and perceiving the IUD was worth the discomfort.

Conclusion

Adolescent and young adult women report high levels of satisfaction after the IUD insertion procedure. Young age, lack of experience with gynecologic examinations, and high pain were inversely related to satisfaction.

Misoprostol for IUD placement — evidence profile — includes 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs); eleven trials examined 400 μg doses and three trials examined < 400 μg doses, routes included vaginal, buccal, sublingual, and oral administration, and for patients without a recent failed IUD placement attempt the timing ranged from 1 to 8 hours before IUD placement. Evidence suggests that misoprostol does not reduce patient pain, adverse events, or need for adjunctive placement measures, nor improve provider ease of placement, placement success, or patient satisfaction.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^857ec387]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervicitis — management of sex partners and special considerations — specifies that women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing, and that all sex partners during the previous 60 days should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment; sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated, and expedited partner therapy (EPT) and other effective partner referral strategies are alternative approaches for treating male partners of women who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Women with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV, and treatment reduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might reduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners. For pregnancy, diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women does not differ from that for women who are not pregnant. For contraceptive management, leaving an intrauterine device (IUD) in place during treatment for cervicitis is advisable; however, an IUD should not be placed if active cervicitis is diagnosed.

### Estradiol (estring) [^fd335075]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When ESTRING is in place, you should not feel anything. If you feel uncomfortable, ESTRING is probably not far enough inside. Use your finger to gently push ESTRING further into your vagina.

There is no danger of ESTRING being pushed too far up in the vagina or getting lost. ESTRING can only be inserted as far as the end of the vagina, where the cervix (the narrow, lower end of the uterus) will block ESTRING from going any further (see diagram of Female Anatomy).

ESTRING USE

Once inserted, ESTRING should remain in place in the vagina for 90 days.

Most women and their partners experience no discomfort with ESTRING in place during intercourse, so it is NOT necessary that the ring be removed. If ESTRING should cause you or your partner any discomfort, you may remove it prior to intercourse (see ESTRING Removal, below). Be sure to reinsert ESTRING as soon as possible afterwards.

ESTRING may slide down into the lower part of the vagina as a result of the abdominal pressure or straining that sometimes accompanies constipation. If this should happen, gently guide ESTRING back into place with your finger.

There have been rare reports of ESTRING falling out in some women following intense straining or coughing. If this should occur, simply wash ESTRING with lukewarm (NOT hot) water and reinsert it.

### "Fulfilling his needs, not mine": reasons for not talking about painful sex and associations with lack of pleasure in a nationally representative sample of women in the United States [^15340e79]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although much research has examined correlates of pain during sex, far less research has examined why women have sex despite having pain and why they avoid telling their partner.

Aim

The purpose of our study was to examine women's reports of painful sex, including location of pain, whether they told their partner, factors associated with not disclosing their pain, and their reasons for not disclosing.

Methods

We used data from the 2018 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, a probability-based online survey of 2,007 individuals ages 14 to 49 years. We limited our sample to adult women who reported a sexual experience that was painful in the past year (n = 382; 23.2%). The primary outcome in quantitative analyses was whether women told their partner they experienced pain during sex. Associations with social identities and sexual health were explored via logistic regression. Those who did not tell their partner about painful sex were asked why; their accounts were coded and analyzed qualitatively.

Main Outcome Measure

Women were asked, "To what extent was this sexual experience physically painful for you?" Those who reported any pain were asked, "Did you tell your partner that you were in pain during sex?" and, if applicable, "Why didn't you tell your partner that you were in pain during sex?"

Results

Of those reporting pain during sex, most said it was "a little painful" (81.6%) and occurred at the vaginal entrance (31.5%), inside the vagina (34.4%), or at or around the cervix (17.4%). Overall, 51.0% (n = 193/382) told their partner about their pain. Adjusting for age and wantedness, women who reported little or no event-level sexual pleasure had nearly 3-fold greater odds of not telling a partner about painful sex (adjusted odds ratio = 3.24; 95% CI, 1.43–7.37). Normalizing painful sex, considering pain to be inconsequential, prioritizing the partner's enjoyment, and gendered interactional pressures were the predominant themes in women's narratives.

Clinical Implications

Providers should ask about painful sex, if the woman continues intercourse despite pain, and how she feels about this as a means of assessing any sexual and social pressures.

Strengths & Limitations

Strengths include the use of social theory in nationally representative survey research to examine how contextual factors influence sexual health, but experiences were largely limited to heterosexual interactions.

Conclusion

Many women do not discuss painful sex with their partners, lack of pleasure is significantly more likely among this group, and gender norms and cultural scripts are critical to understanding why.

### Pain management for IUD insertion in primary care… [^2280c541]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Although intrauterine device placement is known to be painful, guidelines historically have not recommended routine analgesia. 1, 2 As patients turn to social media to share their painful experiences, public scrutiny of inadequate pain management during IUD placement has increased. 3, 4 The 2024 US Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use is the first guideline to recommend that all patients be counseled and provided with a person-centered plan for pain management based on their preferences.
5. The US Selected Practice Recommendations summarize the evidence for medications used with IUD placement, concluding that both preprocedural lidocaine paracervical block and topical lidocaine may reduce pain. This is based on a meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials of lidocaine paracervical block and 13 RCTs of topical lidocaine gel, cream, or spray.

6 No positive effect occurred with a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations in 12 trials, smooth muscle relaxants in six trials, or misoprostol in 14 RCTs. There was not enough evidence to recommend tramadol based on two trials. A 2020 American Family Physician article concluded that tramadol and naproxen are effective in the immediate postinsertion period.
7. Although experiences vary, younger age, lower education level, dysmenorrhea, no prior vaginal delivery, and higher preprocedural anxiety, fear, and anticipated pain increase the likelihood of pain during IUD insertion. 13–15 A 2024 retrospective study of patients who were not offered analgesia for IUD insertion found that 41% reported experiencing unacceptable pain during the procedure. Of those with unacceptable pain, 83% would have selected numbing medication such as topical lidocaine or paracervical block.

15 Many of the studies used for the US Selected Practice Recommendations included parous patients, a group less likely to experience severe pain with IUD insertion. The recommendations acknowledge that this evidence may not be generalizable to nulliparous patients, adolescents, and people with a history of trauma, a group underrepresented in clinical studies. Importantly, the Committee Opinion on trauma acknowledges that certain populations have experienced more subtle manifestations of trauma due to their race, substance use, or other characteristics that may result in the dismissal of their experiences of pain. The act of health care professionals minimizing patients' pain, known as medical gaslighting, further adds to trauma, sows distrust, and causes harm.

### Pain management for in-office uterine and cervical procedures: ACOG clinical consensus no. 9 [^a635f5ae]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Pain management for in-office uterine and cervical procedures — patient-reported pain and special populations: In in-office intrauterine device insertion and manual vacuum aspiration, health care professionals tend to underestimate the pain that patients report, yet patients still report a high level of satisfaction with office procedures. Higher levels of preprocedural anxiety or of expectations of pain are associated with higher levels of patient-reported pain, and better anticipatory guidance and decreased waiting time on the day of the appointment have the potential to decrease patient pain. Patients with a history of dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, or nulliparity may experience more pain during office procedures, and specific populations may have increased or decreased tolerance of pain and resistance to pain medications. Patients with a history of chronic pelvic pain, sexual violence or abuse, pain sensitization, vaginismus, substance use disorder, and other pain conditions should be given special consideration when planning for pain management at the time of in-office procedures, and strong evidence to guide management of these patients is lacking.

### Best practices for reducing pain associated with intrauterine device placement [^3d7e6046]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices are highly effective, long-acting, reversible forms of contraception. Despite their benefits, limited uptake persists, particularly among underserved populations, adolescents, and young adults. While most intrauterine device placement procedures are uncomplicated, pain is commonly reported, with more severe pain reported in certain groups. No current standard of care has been established specifically to manage pain with intrauterine device placement, resulting in wide variation in clinical practice. This article aims to provide practical, evidence-based, and expert-informed guidelines for managing pain during intrauterine device placement. The authors (a group of board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists, pediatricians, and a family physician) conducted a virtual expert meeting to develop consensus-based recommendations for pain management. The meeting covered environmental considerations, nonpharmacological, and pharmacological options. Key strategies include using a person-centered care model that focuses on patient values, needs, and preferences to promote shared decision-making around pain relief. Clinicians should assist patients in setting realistic expectations, including a discussion of the placement procedure, anticipated pain, and all options for pain relief, to allow for a comprehensive informed consent process. Nonpharmacological interventions, such as the use of therapeutic language and comforting environmental, complementary and integrative, and mind-body elements, are recommended to reduce patient anxiety and discomfort. In terms of pharmacological options, clinicians may offer pre-procedural-specific nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (eg, naproxen and ketorolac) and anxiolytics to patients with significant anxiety, as well as intraprocedural application of topical anesthesia and paracervical or intracervical blocks. Finally, additional techniques, such as using appropriately sized instruments and ensuring gradual and gentle procedural steps, can also help enhance patient comfort during insertion. These expert guidelines emphasize the importance of personalized, trauma-informed, and evidence-based care, prioritizing patient autonomy and preferences to facilitate a safe and acceptable insertion experience. They are critical to reducing barriers to intrauterine device uptake and improving overall patient outcomes.

### New frameless and framed intrauterine devices and systems-an overview [^105dee04]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

There is a need for new, improved birth control methods which are easier to use, with less side effects and which avoid daily action, such as the pill. Perfect use requires consistent daily use or use at every act of intercourse. Long-acting methods eliminate the need for specific action at the time of coitus, or for daily action. Developing a new contraceptive is a major challenge. It is generally estimated that it takes 10–15 years to develop a new method and bring it to the market, at a cost of 200–300 million US dollars, and the industry is reluctant to take the risk of such long-term investment. However, both risk and investment can be reduced by taking small steps. Slight improvements of existing contraceptives could result in a giant step forward. The development of frameless intrauterine systems (IUS) is an attempt to improve the performance and acceptability of intrauterine contraception. Both the frameless GyneFix IUD and the frameless FibroPlant levonorgestrel (LNG)-IUS possess features which may solve the main problems encountered with conventional IUDs (e.g., expulsion, abnormal or excessive bleeding and pain). The performance of frameless devices, however, is dependent on correct anchoring of the device, which requires technical skill. Becoming a proficient GyneFix(R) or FibroPlant provider is easily acquired if the provider follows the procedural instruction strictly. For the less technically skilled provider, the Femilis LNG-IUS, using the new, simplified insertion technique, could be an excellent contraceptive option. It is usually not necessary to provide pain relief for insertion of an IUD/IUS, particularly in parous women. IUD providers should, however, realize that no woman likes to suffer from the insertion of an IUD. Severe discomfort may create a negative attitude towards the method. If the woman is anxious and fears pain (as most nulliparous women do), probably the most convenient, safe and effective method is to use local (intracervical) anesthesia using a dental syringe which can be applied with minimal risk in the office. In some women, the use of misoprostol 400 microg, 3 h prior to fitting of the IUD/IUS, may be useful to dilate the cervical canal. The popularity of the IUD could be much improved if attention is given to this aspect of IUD insertion.

### "She just told me to leave it": women's experiences discussing early elective IUD removal [^2378c7f0]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to describe the thoughts and experiences of women who report discussing intrauterine device (IUD) removal within 9 months of insertion.

Study Design

This is a qualitative study, consisting of semistructured individual interviews with 16 women who considered early elective IUD removal. We identified eligible participants via chart review. We analyzed interviews using a modified grounded theory approach.

Results

While pain and bleeding were prominent reasons for removal, women also discussed many other symptoms and concerns. Most women reported a strong desire to have a successful IUD experience, and all reported waiting for symptoms to resolve prior to their visit. Some women reported that providers supported their choice, while others reported that providers preferred that they continue the IUD despite symptoms and concerns. Some women reported providers' resistance or refusal to remove the IUDs. The women who reported that their providers were neutral about IUD removal more frequently expressed satisfaction with the visit. When the provider resisted removal, women felt frustrated, even as they acknowledged their doctor's good intentions. In several cases, this may have hurt the doctor-patient relationship.

Conclusions

When physicians resist early elective IUD removal, it may impact patient satisfaction and even jeopardize the doctor-patient relationship.

Implications

Though IUDs are highly effective and well-liked contraceptives, some patients choose to discontinue the method. Because provision of patient-centered contraceptive care includes IUD removal when requested, providers must ensure that their counseling is unbiased and that they do not place perceived or real barriers to IUD removal.

### Use of copper intrauterine device in transgender male adolescents [^f4f0567d]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Transgender men need contraception if engaging in intercourse with a cis-gender male partner. The copper IUD is an effective, non-hormonal contraceptive well suited for trans-males even while utilizing gender affirming hormone therapy. A gender-neutral medical facility with well-trained and sensitive staff is the ideal setting to provide such contraceptive care.

### Intrauterine contraception in adolescents and young women: a descriptive study of use, side effects, and compliance [^4ad5faf1]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Describe characteristics, compliance, efficacy, and side effect profile of adolescents and young women who use intrauterine contraception (IC).

Study Design

Retrospective chart review of adolescent and young women who had IC devices placed over a 3-year period. Comparative statistics between devices and population characteristics were performed using the Fisher exact and the t test.

Results

Eighty-nine patients were included in the study. The mean age at insertion was 19.5 years (range 16–22 years). Copper was used in 13% of patients; levonorgestrel (LNG) was used in 87%. The mean duration of use was 331.3 days (copper vs LNG; P = 0.2254). Side effects included infection (9%, but no pelvic inflammatory disease), pain (28%), partner felt strings (9%), and bleeding (32%). Reasons for removal included side effects (25%), desired fertility (5%), expulsion (3%), and pregnancy (2%). There were no pregnancies associated with the LNG IC, and there were fewer removals because of side effects than with the copper IUD (P = 0.0180).

Conclusion

IC is a reliable method of contraception in teens and young adults. There were fewer removals because of side effects in the LNG group, although overall other variables are similar between methods.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^e83ffb81]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Misoprostol for intrauterine device (IUD) placement — clinical effects and certainty: Evidence suggests that misoprostol might increase patient pain and preplacement abdominal pain or cramping and diarrhea but is not associated with other side effects (i.e., nausea or vomiting). In patients with a recent failed IUD placement, pretreatment with 400 μg vaginal misoprostol (200 μg administered 10 hours before and 200 μg administered 4 hours before returning to the clinic for a subsequent IUD placement attempt) might result in higher placement success with second placement attempt compared with placebo. Certainty of evidence: moderate for patient pain, need for adjunctive placement measures, placement success for patients with and without recent prior failed placement attempt, side effects, and patient satisfaction with the procedure; low for provider ease of placement and adverse events.

### Practical tips for intrauterine device counseling, insertion, and pain relief in adolescents: an update [^c7f94516]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed intrauterine devices as first-line contraceptive choices for nulliparous and parous adolescents. Practical concerns about intrauterine devices might be barriers to use for teens and clinicians; this review is devoted to "practical tips" for clinicians, on the basis of an update of the available literature as well as the author's clinical experience. Counseling about contraceptive choices, preventive guidance about possible side effects, informed consent, and pain management are addressed to promote successful use of this long-acting reversible contraption option.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 735: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^9702baaf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescents and intrauterine device (IUD) insertion — placement success and pain management are characterized as follows: In a cohort of 1,177 adolescents and women aged 13–24 years, successful IUD placement was achieved on first attempt in 96% of patients, and the majority of the IUDs were placed by an advanced practice clinician. Most women experience some degree of discomfort during IUD insertion, and obstetrician–gynecologists should provide anticipatory guidance regarding pain that may occur during and after insertion. Provision of additional analgesia during IUD insertion should be individualized and may include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, anxiolytics, or paracervical blocks, and the most effective method of pain control has not been established yet. One study demonstrated that women who received oral naproxen 1 hour before IUD insertion did not have reduced pain with IUD insertion but did have reduced pain after insertion, and a paracervical block using 1% lidocaine reduced pain scores among nulliparous adolescents and women aged 14–22 years, although administration of the block did not improve overall satisfaction with insertion.

### Acceptability of the long-term contraceptive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (mirena): a 3-year follow-up study [^550a2583]. Contraception (2003). Low credibility.

This study investigated the long-term acceptability of a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in 165 women after 6 and 36 months of use. Changes in menstrual bleeding pattern were experienced by 161 (98%) women, with a cessation or transient absence of menstruation occurring in 75 (47%) and 14 (9%) women, respectively. Amenorrhea was considered by most women (81%) as a positive change. The proportion of women with menstrual pain was reduced from 60% before use to 29% after 36 months of use with the LNG-IUS. Fear of an unwanted pregnancy became less widespread with duration of use and the device had no disturbing effects on the women or their partners during sexual intercourse. The number of women expressing that they were very satisfied with the LNG-IUS was 69% and 77% after six months and 36 months of use, respectively. LNG-IUS is a well-accepted contraceptive method, without negative influences on the sexual relationship between users and their partners, and is suitable for women requiring long-term reversible contraceptive protection.

### Hidden in plain sight: a malpositioned intrauterine device as the culprit of acute pelvic pain-a case report [^2128df33]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Malpositioned intrauterine devices (IUDs) are not yet a well recognized cause of acute pelvic pain. Correct identification relies on recognizing key imaging findings such as low-lying or endocervical positioning, and an understanding that acute pelvic pain may be the result of a malpositioned IUD. We report the case of a 28-year-old sexually active female (she/her/hers) with a history of a malpositioned IUD, who presented with sudden onset, unprovoked, right sided pelvic pain. She denied hematuria, dysuria, vaginal discharge, or vaginal bleeding. On physical examination she noted right-sided pelvic tenderness below McBurney's point; however, a pelvic examination was deferred. Ultrasound revealed an IUD in the endocervical canal. A CT confirmed a low-lying IUD. These findings were initially interpreted as normal. Only after follow-up with primary care, the IUD was removed and the patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. This case highlights the importance of recognizing malpositioned IUDs on imaging. As in this case, misdiagnosis can result in overtesting and delays in patient care. Emergency providers should be familiar with radiographic findings and include malpositioned IUDs on their differential diagnosis.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^adf70193]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) placement — misoprostol pretreatment: Evidence suggests that misoprostol might increase patient pain and preplacement abdominal pain or cramping and diarrhea but is not associated with other side effects (i.e., nausea or vomiting). Among women with a recent failed IUD placement, pretreatment with 400 μg vaginal misoprostol (200 μg administered 10 hours before and 200 μg administered 4 hours before returning to the clinic) might result in higher placement success with second placement attempt compared with placebo. Certainty of evidence is reported as moderate for patient pain, need for adjunctive placement measures, placement success for patients with and without recent prior failed placement attempt, side effects, and patient satisfaction with the procedure; and low for provider ease of placement and adverse events.

### Use of intrauterine devices in nulliparous women [^10582f4b]. Contraception (2017). Medium credibility.

IUD use in nulliparous women — The following recommendations below are based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A). Both the 52-mg LNG-IUS and the Copper T 380A IUDs are effective and safe for nulliparous women and should be offered routinely to women of all parities seeking contraception. Nulliparous women seeking highly effective reversible contraception should be advised of the high satisfaction and continuation rates with IUDs. Providers and women can be reassured that nulliparous women who use the IUD do not appear to have higher risks of pelvic infection than parous users and that following IUD removal, fertility is not impaired. Providers and women can be reassured that IUD expulsion rates are not higher among nulliparous women compared to parous women. Use of cervical or vaginal nitroglycerine gel is not recommended to reduce pain during IUD insertion because neither is effective for this indication. Use of 4% viscous lidocaine gel may be beneficial in reducing pain during IUD insertion, although further study is needed to assess pain of gel administration. Use of intramuscular ketorolac may reduce pain during IUD insertion if administered 30 min before the procedure. One fifth of patients felt that the pain of the injection equaled the pain of the IUD insertion. Use of preprocedure misoprostol is not recommended as a method of making IUD insertion easier or less painful.

Management of the IUD when a Cu-IUD or an LNG-IUD user is found to have PID — clinical actions: Treat the PID according to the CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, provide comprehensive management for STIs including counseling about condom use, and note that the IUD does not need to be removed immediately if the patient needs ongoing contraception. Reassess the patient in 48–72 hours and, if no clinical improvement occurs, continue antibiotics and consider removal of the IUD. If the patient wants to discontinue use, remove the IUD sometime after antibiotics have been started to avoid the potential risk for bacterial spread resulting from the removal procedure; if the IUD is removed, consider ECPs if appropriate, and counsel on alternative contraceptive methods and offer another method if it is desired.

Barriers to IUD use for emergency contraception — IUD insertion requires an in-person visit with a trained provider; many health care professionals are uncomfortable placing an IUD; there is limited awareness of the copper IUD as an EC option and very few obstetrics and gynecology and primary care clinics offer it; and many clinics lack same-day device stock and instead employ a two-visit insertion approach modeled after outdated STI screening and pregnancy testing protocols.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^8f58f9f7]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) — safety and use in women with HIV are summarized as follows: two studies have shown that copper-releasing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs available in the United States are safe for HIV-infected women without AIDS who can regularly access providers to monitor for complications. Clinical trials indicate these IUDs do not influence cervicovaginal shedding of HIV or increase risk of HIV transmission to sex partners. Current CDC recommendations state that IUD insertion and use are generally safe for women with HIV and that HIV-infected IUD users have no higher risk of IUD-related complications than HIV-uninfected IUD users; however, women with AIDS who are taking ART and not clinically well should generally not undergo IUD insertion because the risk of pelvic infection outweighs the benefits of effective contraception.

### Dysmenorrhoea as a risk factor for pain with intrauterine device insertion [^71e81e08]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Understanding predictors of pain with gynaecological procedures may facilitate individualised counselling and pain management. We aimed to study the effect of dysmenorrhoea on intrauterine device (IUD) insertion pain.

Methods

This was a planned secondary analysis of a randomised trial evaluating self-administered lidocaine gel versus placebo for IUD insertion pain. We included those participants who reported menses in the past 3months. We assessed dysmenorrhoea (in the past 3months) and procedural pain using a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS). We categorised dysmenorrhoea as none/mild (< 40mm), moderate (40-69mm) or severe (≥ 70mm). We assessed participant pain scores at speculum insertion, tenaculum placement, IUD insertion, and overall. We compared median procedural pain scores by dysmenorrhoea group with three-way and post hoc pairwise analyses.

Results

We analysed 188 participants. Demographic characteristics were similar among the three dysmenorrhoea groups. Pairwise comparisons revealed higher median procedural pain scores in the severe dysmenorrhoea group compared with the none/mild dysmenorrhoea group at speculum insertion (25mm vs 8mm; p = 0.007), tenaculum placement (51mm vs 31mm; p = 0.04) and IUD insertion (74mm vs 61mm; p = 0.04). Overall pain did not differ among the three groups (p = 0.32).

Conclusions

Patients with severe dysmenorrhoea experienced increased pain with all aspects of IUD insertion, including speculum and tenaculum placement, compared with those with only mild or no dysmenorrhoea. Clinicians may consider this finding when providing individualised counselling and pain management for patients undergoing IUD insertion and other gynaecological procedures. Larger studies are needed to validate the effect of dysmenorrhoea severity on pain throughout IUD insertion.

Use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) in nulliparous and parous adolescents — eligibility and insertion experience: Both nulliparous and parous adolescent women should be considered candidates for IUDs, and providers and women can be reassured that although nulliparity appears to be associated with increased pain at IUD insertion and increased risk of difficult and unsuccessful insertion, most IUD insertions in nulliparous women are well tolerated and successful.

### Contraindications to IUD and IUS use [^1e62accb]. Contraception (2007). Low credibility.

Contraindications to IUD or IUS use can be found on product labeling, in the guidelines of various specialty groups and in recommendations from peer-reviewed articles. Overly restrictive contraindications block access to this top-tier method for many women who would be candidates based on current scientific evidence. Assuming that a condition should be listed as a contraindication only if the risk of IUD/IUS use by a woman with that condition exceeds her risk with pregnancy, the list of contraindications is reduced to pregnancy, active uterine infection, malignancy in the uterus or cervix, an inability to place or retain the device, unexplained abnormal bleeding and adverse reaction to product ingredients.

### Beyond pain medication: striving toward more patient-centered placement of intrauterine devices [^b1bae0e6]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess patient experiences and preferences for counseling, addressing pain and anxiety, and provider support during placement of intrauterine devices (IUDs).

Study Design

This mixed-methods study included a survey and in-depth interviews of patients undergoing IUD placement. Participants reported pain, satisfaction, and importance of aspects of care during IUD placement. Ten provider behaviors measured on a Likert scale (1–5) sum to create a "provider support score" (range 10–50). We measured pain with categorical variables and a visual analog scale (0–10). We performed descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable analysis on survey data. Qualitative data analysis utilized inductive analytics with NVivo.

Results

Among 79 respondents, the three factors most frequently cited as "very important" included explaining steps before the procedure (74.7%), discussing pain concerns in advance (72.2%), and being attentive to comfort during the procedure (72.2%). The mean (SD) pain score was 5.7/10 (2.8). Most participants were satisfied (24.1%) or very satisfied (62%) with their IUD placement. The mean provider support score was 32.8/50. When controlling for pain score, higher provider support scores predicted satisfaction; with each unit increase in provider support score, the odds of satisfaction increased by 69% (adjusted odds ratio 1.69). Themes emerging from qualitative data included the importance of acknowledging rather than minimizing pain experiences, setting clear and realistic expectations, and both exploring and attending to individualized patient preferences around IUD placement.

Conclusions

Answering the call for more patient-centered IUD placement requires not only addressing pain but also tailoring a range of supportive behaviors to each patient to improve satisfaction.

Implications

In addition to addressing pain, clinicians need to focus on a range of other supportive behaviors related to IUD placement, including clear counseling, provider empathy, and forthcoming expectation setting to make the procedure more patient-centered and improve patient satisfaction.

### Endometrial injury for pregnancy following sexual intercourse or intrauterine insemination [^5879aa9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intentional endometrial injury is being proposed as a technique to improve the probability of pregnancy in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Endometrial injury is often performed by pipelle biopsy and is a common gynaecological procedure with established safety. However, it causes a moderate degree of discomfort/pain and requires an additional pelvic examination. The effectiveness of this procedure outside of ART, in women or couples attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse or with intrauterine insemination (IUI), remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of intentional endometrial injury performed in infertile women or couples attempting to conceive through sexual intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ISI Web of Knowledge, and clinical trial registries were searched from inception to 21 May 2020, as were conference abstracts and reference lists of relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any kind of intentional endometrial injury in women planning to undergo IUI or attempting to conceive spontaneously (with or without ovarian stimulation (OS)) compared to no intervention, a mock intervention, or intentional endometrial injury performed at a different time or to a higher/lower degree.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were live birth/ongoing pregnancy and pain experienced during the procedure. Due to high risk of bias associated with many of the studies, primary analyses of all review outcomes were restricted to studies at low risk of bias. Sensitivity analysis including all studies was then performed.

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs (4035 women). Most of these studies included women with unexplained infertility. Intentional endometrial injury versus either no intervention or a sham procedure The primary analysis was restricted to studies at low risk of bias, which left only one study included. We are uncertain whether endometrial injury has an effect on the probability of live birth, as only one study is included in the analysis and the confidence interval is wide (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.59; 1 RCT, 210 participants). Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth with no intervention/a sham procedure is assumed to be 34%, then the chance with endometrial injury would be 27% to 55%. When all studies were included in the sensitivity analysis, we were uncertain whether endometrial injury improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy, as the evidence was of very low quality (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.21; 8 RCTs, 1522 participants; I² = 16%). Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth/ongoing pregnancy with no intervention/a sham procedure is assumed to be 13%, then the chance with endometrial injury would be 17% to 28%. A narrative synthesis conducted for the other primary outcome of pain during the procedure included studies measuring pain on a zero-to-ten visual analogue scale (VAS) or grading pain as mild/moderate/severe, and showed that most often mild to moderate pain was reported (6 RCTs, 911 participants; very low-quality evidence). Higher versus lower degree of intentional endometrial injury Evidence was insufficient to show whether there is a difference in ongoing pregnancy rates (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.35; 1 RCT, 332 participants; low-quality evidence) between hysteroscopy with endometrial injury and hysteroscopy alone. Evidence suggests that if the chance of ongoing pregnancy with hysteroscopy alone is 10%, then the chance with hysteroscopy with endometrial injury would be 7% to 24%. This study did not report the primary outcomes of live birth and pain during the procedure. Timing of intentional endometrial injury Four trials compared endometrial injury performed in the cycle before IUI to that performed in the same cycle as IUI. None of these studies reported the primary outcomes of live birth/ongoing pregnancy and pain during the procedure. One study compared endometrial injury in the early follicular phase (EFP; Day 2 to 4) to endometrial injury in the late follicular phase (LFP; Day 7 to 9), both in the same cycle as IUI. The primary outcome live birth/ongoing pregnancy was not reported, but the study did report the other primary outcome of pain during the procedure assessed by a zero-to-ten VAS. The average pain score was 3.67 (standard deviation (SD) 0.7) when endometrial injury was performed in the EFP and 3.84 (SD 0.96) when endometrial injury was performed in the LFP. The mean difference was -0.17, suggesting that on average, women undergoing endometrial injury in the EFP scored 0.17 points lower on the VAS as compared to women undergoing endometrial injury in the LFP (95% CI -0.48 to 0.14; 1 RCT, 110 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is insufficient to show whether there is a difference in live birth/ongoing pregnancy between endometrial injury and no intervention/a sham procedure in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence was of low to very low quality due to high risk of bias present in most included studies and an overall low level of precision. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of timing of endometrial injury did not report the outcome live birth/ongoing pregnancy; therefore no conclusions could be drawn for this outcome. Further well-conducted RCTs that recruit large numbers of participants and minimise bias are required to confirm or refute these findings. Current evidence is insufficient to support routine use of endometrial injury in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^c5bbcbbb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) bleeding irregularities — management includes that if clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition (such as LNG-IUD displacement, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions) and if an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care; explore patient goals, including continued LNG-IUD use or LNG-IUD removal, and if the patient wants to continue LNG-IUD use, provide reassurance and advise that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects; if the patient desires LNG-IUD removal at any time, remove the LNG-IUD, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired; and if the patient wants treatment, the following treatment options may be considered during days of bleeding with NSAIDs for short-term treatment, 5–7 days.

### Association between patients' perceptions of the sexual acceptability of contraceptive methods and continued use over time [^9aba5c49]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Contraceptive users' perceptions that their method negatively affected their sex life were strongly associated with noncontinuation by 6 months — more robustly than other adverse effects. Qualitative research on contraceptive sexual acceptability documents multiple domains that may help explain this effect, including sexual spontaneity, psychological disinhibition, and partner connection when feeling well protected against unwanted pregnancy.

Study strengths include its large sample size, prospective design, and use of multiple measures to assess sexual experiences. Limitations of this study include that the outcome measure was affected by the large proportion of participants who initiated IUDs or implants — methods that require more effort to discontinue than pills, rings, and injections. Though we included only participants with complete variables, sensitivity analyses indicated that results held when we included all participants.

These findings suggest that the sexual acceptability of a contraceptive method may have an important role in whether a patient continues to use it. Finding methods that favorably align with users' sexual experiences may reduce noncontinuation and improve patients' sexual lives and well-being.

### Risks of uterine perforation and expulsion associated with intrauterine devices [^93449586]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The information presented here can assist the clinician in counseling patients about individual risks during preprocedure counseling and facilitate shared decision making. Timing of IUD placement and methods to reduce the risk of uterine perforation can be considered. Ultrasound guidance may be helpful for IUD placement in postpartum and breastfeeding individuals but has not been evaluated nor demonstrated to mitigate risk; additional studies are needed to make evidence-based recommendations. Health care professional experience is an important factor that may moderate outcomes; we controlled for health care professional experience in these analyses. Patients should be counseled about signs that may suggest potential perforation (eg, pelvic pain, severe cramps, strings unable to be palpated). Under conditions in which IUD expulsion rates are relatively higher (immediate postpartum IUD placement, heavy menstrual bleeding), having a low threshold for scheduling a follow-up visit to ensure the IUD is in place may also be considered. To prevent unplanned pregnancies with unrecognized expulsion, patients should be counseled about the risk of IUD expulsion and informed of signs of expulsion (eg, device felt in the vagina, change in cramping or bleeding pattern, strings unable to be palpated) and the need for IUD replacement or alternate form of contraception in the event of an expulsion. Health care professionals and patients should weigh the elevated risks in the postpartum period against known contraceptive benefits and the convenience of early insertion.

Strengths of the findings from APEX-IUD include the largest and most demographically diverse cohort with more than 1 year of follow-up reported to date, minimal missing data, and control for more than 20 confounding factors. Some limitations are noted, however. Given the use of retrospective data and the observational design, there was no protocol-specified plan for the timing of follow-up; the timing of IUD-related perforation and IUD expulsion reflect the dates of diagnosis and not necessarily the time of the outcomes themselves, and some perforation and expulsion outcomes were recognized only at the time of IUD removal. In particular, outcomes for patients who are undergoing an IUD insertion within 1 year postpartum may be subject to surveillance bias, because perforation or expulsion outcomes may have been recognized because of more frequent contact with health care professionals during this time. The study data were subject to potential misclassification of the outcomes and risk factors, unmeasured confounding, and loss to follow-up. There were relatively small numbers in the 0-to-3-day postpartum group, diminishing the precision of estimates.

### Misoprostol for intrauterine device placement [^d05535ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Identifying effective approaches to reduce pain and improve providers' ease of intrauterine device (IUD) placement may reduce barriers to IUD access and use. The cervical softening and dilation effects of misoprostol might make IUD placement less painful for women and technically easier for providers. However, evidence suggests that misoprostol does not improve many outcomes and may only be helpful for some patients (e.g. those with a recent failed IUD placement).

Objectives

To examine the effect of misoprostol for routine IUD placement on patient and provider outcomes compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

In November 2021 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We conducted update searches in July 2022 and September 2024. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) in July 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of women undergoing interval IUD placement (i.e. placement outside the postabortion or postpartum period) that compared misoprostol to placebo or no treatment. We included trials that examined the placement of currently available levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing IUDs, or any copper T IUD, for women of any age, of any parity, and for any indication.

Outcomes

Our core critical and important outcomes were pain (during tenaculum placement, during IUD placement, and after IUD placement before clinic discharge); providers' ease of placement; need for cervical dilation; placement success; patient satisfaction; misoprostol side effects (preplacement abdominal pain or cramping, and diarrhea); and adverse events (vasovagal reaction).

Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 tool (RoB 2) to assess the risk of bias for outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis. We calculated mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes using inverse variance estimation and random-effects models. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel estimation and random-effects models. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

We included 14 RCTs with a total of 1972 women. The trials were conducted in North America, South America, Europe and Africa, and were published between 2007 and 2022.

Synthesis Of Results

The results below summarize the effect of misoprostol on outcomes compared to placebo or no treatment. Pain: misoprostol results in little to no difference in pain during tenaculum placement (MD -0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.19 to -0.28; 3 RCTs, 261 women; high-certainty evidence) and after IUD placement before clinic discharge (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.43; 5 RCTs, 448 women; high-certainty evidence). Misoprostol may result in little to no difference in pain during IUD placement (MD -0.47, 95% CI -1.23 to 0.29; 7 RCTs, 766 women; low-certainty evidence). Providers' ease of placement: misoprostol may result in little to no difference in a clinically meaningful effect on ease of IUD placement for providers (MD -0.89, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.22; 8 RCTs, 848 women; low-certainty evidence). Need for cervical dilation: misoprostol may result in little to no difference in need for cervical dilation for women without a recent failed placement attempt (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.85; 6 RCTs, 562 women; low-certainty evidence). Misoprostol probably results in little to no difference in need for cervical dilation for women with a recent failed placement attempt (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36; 1 RCT, 90 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Placement success: misoprostol probably results in little to no difference in placement success for women without a recent failed placement attempt (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 12 RCTs, 1579 women; moderate-certainty evidence) but probably results in a slight increase in placement success for women with a recent failed placement attempt (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83; 1 RCT, 90 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Patient satisfaction: misoprostol may increase women's satisfaction with the IUD placement procedure, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 2.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 4.06; 2 RCTs, 226 women; very low-certainty evidence) Misoprostol side effects before clinic discharge: misoprostol probably results in an increase in preplacement abdominal pain or cramping (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.23; 7 RCTs, 781 women; moderate-certainty evidence)and probably results in a slight increase in diarrhea (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.06; 9 RCTs, 940 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events before clinic discharge: misoprostol may result in little to no difference in vasovagal reaction (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.37; 6 RCTs [3 RCTs had 0 events], 780 women; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence due to serious concerns about inconsistency and serious or very serious concerns about imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from RCTs of women seeking routine IUD placement suggests that receiving misoprostol compared to placebo or no treatment makes little to no difference to pain during tenaculum placement or after IUD placement; and may make little to no difference to pain during IUD placement. Misoprostol may make little to no difference to reduced vasovagal reaction, improved providers' ease of placement, or reduced need for cervical dilation; and probably makes little to no difference to placement success, except for women with a recent failed IUD placement attempt, where misoprostol probably leads to a clinically meaningful increase in placement success. Misoprostol use probably leads to clinically important increases in harms, specifically preplacement abdominal pain or cramping and diarrhea. Misoprostol may increase patient satisfaction with the IUD placement procedure, but the evidence is very uncertain. The number of available RCTs did not support examining effect modifiers such as prior vaginal delivery status, misoprostol dose, or IUD type.

Included articles mentioned end-users' and health workers' values and preferences related to all of the methods covered by WHO's guidelines, including male condoms (n = 161), female condoms (n = 41), oral contraceptive pills, i.e. combined oral contraceptive pills (n = 204) and progestogen-only pills (POP) (n = 105), intrauterine devices (IUD) or hormone-releasing intrauterine systems (IUS) (n = 221), implants (n = 139), injectable contraceptives (n = 140), diaphragm (n = 37), vaginal ring (n = 82), transdermal patch (n = 74), male sterilization or vasectomy (n = 39), female sterilization or tubal ligation (n = 72), fertility awareness-based methods (e.g. rhythm method, calendar method) (n = 64), emergency contraception (n = 42), withdrawal (n = 67), and other contraceptive methods, including abstinence, lactational amenorrhea method, and other (often unspecified) traditional methods (n = 42).

3.4 Commonly reported values among contraceptive users

Contraceptive users across geographic regions and population subgroups consistently prioritized several thematic issues (Table 3). Overall, people wanted choice: they desired a range of options from which to choose, especially since different people preferred different methods at different times for different reasons.

Side effects and safety was the most commonly reported issue (mentioned in 246 articles) when considering contraceptive methods. Contraceptive users and health workers were concerned about pain. They desired minimal side effects or adverse events (relating to changes in libido, bleeding, menstrual cycles, acne, weight gain, etc.); if these were unavoidable, they wanted to be able to anticipate, manage, and tolerate side effects. Women often asked how commonly used contraceptive methods were, and how safe or healthy they were.

Intrauterine device (IUD) strings not visible and cannot be safely retrieved — ultrasonography and pregnancy management: If ultrasonography is available, consider performing or referring for ultrasound examination to determine the location of the IUD and if the IUD cannot be located, it might have been expelled or have perforated the uterine wall; if ultrasonography is not possible or the IUD is determined by ultrasound to be inside the uterus, advise the patient to seek care promptly if they have heavy bleeding, cramping, pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, or fever; removing the IUD improves the pregnancy outcome if the IUD strings are visible or the device can be retrieved safely from the cervical canal and risks for spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and infection are substantial if the IUD is left in place; theoretically, the fetus might be affected by hormonal exposure from an LNG-IUD, however whether this exposure increases the risk for fetal abnormalities is unknown; a systematic review identified nine studies suggesting that women who did not remove their IUDs during pregnancy were at greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and with LNG-IUDs when the IUDs were not removed, eight out of 10 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions, with Cu-IUD removal decreasing risks but not to the baseline risk for pregnancies without an IUD.
