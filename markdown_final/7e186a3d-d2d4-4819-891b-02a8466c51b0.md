## Question

Colchicine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about colchicine's evidence and role across gout, cardiovascular disease, pericarditis, COVID-19, safety, and special populations, culminating in practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about colchicine's mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics to anchor its clinical effects. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for gout, including acute flares and prophylaxis. Next, I will review cardiovascular secondary prevention data, being careful to separate strong from weak signals. After that, I need to check pericarditis guidance and whether primary prevention is supported. I will then examine COVID-19 evidence and guidelines. I should also confirm dosing principles, safety, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations and note evidence gaps that might change practice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation, because clinical effects and toxicity risks flow from mechanism and disposition. Colchicine binds β‑tubulin and disrupts microtubule polymerization, thereby impairing neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion and broadly attenuating inflammasome‑linked inflammatory signaling relevant to crystal and vascular inflammation, which helps explain efficacy in gout and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114uEXjk] [^1157GT33]. Wait, I should verify renal and hepatic handling and interaction liabilities; colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a P‑glycoprotein substrate, which explains important drug–drug interactions and the need for dose adjustments in renal and hepatic impairment and when co‑administered with strong CYP3A4/P‑gp inhibitors, reinforcing its narrow therapeutic index [^112SDtjz] [^114pbJCg].

> Next, I should review gout indications with an eye toward dose‑response and safety. For acute gout flares, randomized data show that low‑dose colchicine improves pain at 32–36 hours compared with placebo, whereas high‑dose regimens add gastrointestinal toxicity without improving efficacy, aligning with guideline preferences for low‑dose approaches and favoring 1.2 mg at onset followed by 0.6 mg one hour later rather than hourly dosing [^1132ms2q] [^1137Cqjh] [^111zAZ1i]. Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis. Both EULAR and ACR recommend daily low‑dose colchicine to prevent flares during urate‑lowering therapy initiation, with EULAR emphasizing 0.5–1 mg/day and reduced dosing in renal impairment, and BSR advising 500 mcg once or twice daily for up to 6 months during ULT uptitration [^112D3qBA] [^117QyWfG] [^114EdBSE].

> Now, cardiovascular secondary prevention — this is where the signal is strongest, but I need to be precise. Large, contemporary randomized trials and meta‑analyses consistently show that low‑dose colchicine reduces major adverse cardiovascular events as an add‑on to guideline‑directed therapy, with relative risk reductions of roughly 12–31% across pooled datasets and robust reductions in myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, without clear mortality benefit in most analyses [^112kKW4f] [^113bM91b] [^112YU4wS] [^113vEKo1]. Wait, let me verify guideline alignment; ESC 2024 recommends considering 0.5 mg/day to reduce MI, stroke, and revascularization in chronic coronary syndromes, and ACC/AHA 2023 supports adding colchicine for secondary prevention in chronic coronary disease, reflecting FDA recognition of colchicine as a targeted anti‑inflammatory cardiovascular therapy [^112ffo2D] [^115HNz7U] [^1153B61Z]. I should double‑check the mortality signal; pooled analyses generally show no significant effect on all‑cause or cardiovascular mortality, with some meta‑analytic models suggesting possible reductions in cardiovascular death that are not consistent across sensitivity analyses, so mortality benefit remains uncertain [^113bM91b] [^112kKW4f].

> But wait, what about primary prevention in the general population? I need to ensure I don't overstate this. The 2025 Cochrane review evaluating primary prevention found only very low‑certainty evidence from small, heterogeneous trials, with imprecise and potentially biased estimates, so colchicine should not be used for primary prevention outside of research settings at this time [^116MgsA6]. Hold on, I should verify that this conclusion aligns with earlier syntheses; yes, prior reviews similarly emphasized uncertainty and the need for larger, high‑quality trials in primary prevention populations [^112JKHaY].

> Turning to pericarditis, I should confirm both acute and recurrent disease guidance. Multiple randomized trials and meta‑analyses demonstrate that colchicine added to NSAIDs or aspirin reduces recurrences in acute and recurrent pericarditis, with hazard ratios around 0.37–0.40 and an NNT near 4, and contemporary ESC pericarditis guidelines endorse colchicine as first‑line adjunct therapy with dosing tailored to weight and renal function [^112bHCrx] [^111CiGQw]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized to primary prevention of post‑pericardiotomy syndrome; I should correct that — evidence for routine prophylaxis of post‑pericardiotomy syndrome remains limited and mixed, so colchicine is not routinely recommended for that indication pending stronger data [^111BpeTu].

> I will now examine COVID‑19, where the signal has fluctuated and guidelines are restrictive. Early small trials like GRECCO‑19 suggested improvements in clinical deterioration and inflammatory markers, but larger, definitive trials and guideline panels have not confirmed meaningful benefits, and IDSA recommends against colchicine for hospitalized patients and suggests against its use in ambulatory patients due to lack of benefit and potential harms, particularly gastrointestinal events [^1125YYbq] [^1116bpoF] [^117NFGxv]. Hold on, I should verify safety signals; pooled analyses in hospitalized cohorts show more adverse events with colchicine and no clear mortality or ventilation benefit, reinforcing the recommendation to avoid routine use outside trials [^113WqMw8] [^116o1C9L].

> Next, I should review safety, interactions, and monitoring, because the narrow therapeutic index demands vigilance. Common adverse effects are gastrointestinal — diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain — which are dose‑related and often lead to discontinuation; serious toxicity includes myopathy, neuropathy, bone marrow suppression, and multi‑organ failure in overdose, and there is no antidote, so supportive care is essential and prevention via education and safe storage is critical [^117PsGAs] [^116JRtaM] [^1128A8UX]. I need to ensure drug–drug interaction screening is routine; strong CYP3A4 and P‑gp inhibitors such as clarithromycin, ritonavir, and cyclosporine increase colchicine exposure and risk of toxicity, necessitating dose reduction or avoidance and heightened monitoring in renal or hepatic impairment [^114pbJCg] [^112SDtjz]. Let me reconsider long‑term safety; consensus statements suggest low‑dose regimens over years do not increase risks of cancer, sepsis, cytopenias, or myotoxicity in appropriately selected patients, though periodic liver enzymes and symptom checks remain prudent [^1124Yfcp].

> I should confirm dosing principles across indications and special populations. For gout flares, low‑dose regimens are preferred. For prophylaxis during ULT, 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily is typical, with dose reduction in moderate renal impairment and avoidance with strong CYP3A4/P‑gp inhibitors. For cardiovascular secondary prevention, 0.5 mg daily is standard, with avoidance in advanced renal disease and careful interaction screening [^1137Cqjh] [^112D3qBA] [^114pbJCg] [^112SDtjz]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric and pregnancy considerations. In children with FMF, colchicine is standard therapy with weight‑based dosing, and in pregnancy, particularly for FMF, available data do not show increased miscarriage or major malformations, supporting continuation when clinically indicated [^1156RC5c] [^113PF7V5].

> Let me synthesize practical, risk‑stratified recommendations. In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or recent ACS, adding low‑dose colchicine to guideline‑directed therapy is reasonable to reduce recurrent events, with counseling on gastrointestinal side effects and interaction screening, and with the understanding that mortality benefit is unproven. In contrast, colchicine should not be used for primary prevention in the general population outside of trials given very low‑certainty evidence [^112ffo2D] [^115HNz7U] [^116MgsA6]. For gout, use low‑dose colchicine for acute flares and for prophylaxis during ULT initiation, tailoring to renal function and comorbidities. For pericarditis, use colchicine as adjunct therapy to reduce recurrences. For COVID‑19, avoid routine use pending stronger evidence [^1137Cqjh] [^111CiGQw] [^1116bpoF].

> Finally, I need to ensure I flag evidence gaps and uncertainties that could alter future practice. Primary prevention of cardiovascular events remains unsettled and requires large, high‑quality RCTs. Optimal duration of colchicine therapy beyond 24–36 months and whether earlier initiation after MI changes outcomes are still being clarified. And the possibility of precision strategies using inflammatory biomarkers or pharmacogenomics to identify responders warrants investigation, as emphasized by recent umbrella reviews and translational commentaries [^116MgsA6] [^114PX7MT] [^114rED5G].

Colchicine is a **first-line anti-inflammatory** for acute gout flares [^1132ms2q] and for prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy [^112D3qBA], with low-dose regimens favored to minimize GI adverse effects [^1135h9gE]. It is also **FDA-approved for cardiovascular risk reduction** in stable coronary disease [^111oJPC8], reducing major adverse cardiovascular events when added to standard care [^112kKW4f] [^112ffo2D]. For pericarditis, colchicine is first-line to prevent recurrence [^111CiGQw] [^112bHCrx]. Key safety issues include dose-dependent GI toxicity, myelosuppression, and myopathy; risk rises with renal/hepatic impairment or CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors [^114pbJCg] [^114WSd67]. Dose adjust in renal/hepatic disease and avoid strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors [^114pbJCg] [^114WSd67].

---

## Pharmacological properties and mechanism of action

- **Mechanism**: Binds β-tubulin, inhibiting microtubule polymerization, disrupting neutrophil migration and activation, and reducing inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) [^113aEQwg] [^1157GT33].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Rapid oral absorption, hepatic CYP3A4 metabolism, P-gp transport; ~50% renal excretion; half-life ~20–30 hours, prolonged in renal impairment [^112SDtjz].

- **Drug interactions**: Strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ketoconazole) increase toxicity; dose adjust or avoid [^112SDtjz] [^114WSd67].

---

## Clinical indications and therapeutic uses

| **Indication** | **Clinical evidence** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute gout flares | First-line; low-dose as effective as high-dose with fewer GI adverse effects [^1132ms2q] [^111zAZ1i] | 1.2 mg at onset, then 0.6 mg 1 hour later; max 1.8 mg in 24 hours |
| Gout prophylaxis during ULT | Reduces flares; continue ≥ 6 months [^1135h9gE] | 0.6 mg once or twice daily |
| Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) | Prevents attacks and amyloidosis; lifelong therapy [^1156RC5c] | 1–2 mg/day (max 2.4 mg/day) |
| Acute and recurrent pericarditis | Reduces recurrence; first-line adjunct [^111CiGQw] [^112bHCrx] | 0.5–0.6 mg twice daily for 3–6 months |
| Stable coronary artery disease | Reduces MACE; FDA-approved [^111oJPC8] [^112kKW4f] | 0.5 mg once daily |

---

## Cardiovascular applications

- **Secondary prevention**: Reduces MACE (MI, stroke, urgent revascularization) in stable CAD; FDA-approved based on LoDoCo2 and COLCOT [^111oJPC8] [^112kKW4f].

- **Guidelines**: ESC 2024 and ACC/AHA 2023 recommend low-dose colchicine for secondary prevention in chronic coronary syndromes [^112ffo2D] [^115HNz7U].

- **Primary prevention**: Not recommended; evidence insufficient [^116MgsA6].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting; dose-dependent and usually mild [^113bM91b].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Myelosuppression, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ failure; risk higher with overdose, renal/hepatic impairment, or CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors [^114pbJCg] [^114WSd67].

- **Overdose**: Narrow therapeutic index; fatal toxicity possible; no antidote; supportive care only [^116JRtaM] [^1128A8UX].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **severe renal or hepatic impairment**, **blood dyscrasias**, and **hypersensitivity to colchicine**. Use with caution in **elderly patients**, those with **mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment**, and when coadministered with interacting drugs; adjust the dose as needed [^114pbJCg] [^114WSd67].

---

## Monitoring and patient counseling

- **Monitoring**: CBC, renal and hepatic function at baseline and periodically; monitor for GI intolerance, myopathy, and myelosuppression [^114rED5G].

- **Patient counseling**: Adhere to dosing, report GI symptoms, muscle weakness, or signs of infection; avoid grapefruit and interacting drugs; store safely to prevent overdose [^117PsGAs].

---

## Recent developments and ongoing research

Recent developments include **FDA approval for cardiovascular risk reduction** in stable CAD [^111oJPC8] and ongoing trials exploring roles in **primary cardiovascular prevention**, **post-operative atrial fibrillation**, and **COVID-19** (data insufficient for routine use) [^1116bpoF] [^117NFGxv].

---

Colchicine is a versatile anti-inflammatory with established roles in gout, FMF, and pericarditis, and **new cardiovascular indications** [^112ffo2D]. Its narrow therapeutic index requires careful dosing, interaction screening, and monitoring to balance efficacy with safety [^112SDtjz].

- **Gastrointestinal phase**: Nausea; loss of appetite; abdominal pain; vomiting; profuse, watery, and bloody diarrhea; joint pain; generalized weakness; fever; rashes; and hypovolemic shock.
- **Multiple system organ failure phase**: Hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the GI tract may result in death; kidney damage resulting in low urine output and bloody urine; swollen, tender liver with elevated liver enzymes; low white blood cell counts; other blood manifestations including bone marrow depression, low platelets, and anemia; muscular weakness; ascending paralysis that may result in respiratory failure; and loss of deep tendon reflexes. The patient/victim usually remains conscious but exhibits mental confusion or delirium and seizures. Pediatric patient/victims may experience hallucinations. First Aid Initial treatment is primarily supportive. It includes relief of abdominal pain, measures to combat shock, and establishment of adequate respiratory exchange by maintenance of an adequate airway, control of respiration, and oxygen administration. There is no antidote for colchicine toxicity.

Bone marrow depression with a condition marked by fever and other symptoms, persistent decrease in the number of blood platelets, reduced white blood cell count, and anemia characterized by defective function of the blood-forming organs may occur with prolonged colchicine administration. Loss of body and scalp hair, rashes, blister-like inflammation of the skin, degeneration of certain nerves, a break down of muscle tissue at the cellular level, the absences of urine excretion, kidney damage, blood in the urine, and one case of patches of purplish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes have also been reported with prolonged administration of colchicine.

### Colchicine for secondary prevention of vascular events: a meta-analysis of trials [^115bxwct]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Randomized trials of colchicine in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have shown mixed results.

Methods

A systematic review and study-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing colchicine vs no colchicine in a secondary-prevention atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease population. A fixed-effect inverse variance model was applied using the intention-to-treat population from the included trials. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

Results

Nine trials, including 30 659 patients (colchicine 15 255, no colchicine 15 404) with known coronary artery disease or stroke, were included. Compared with no colchicine, patients randomized to colchicine had a relative risk (RR) of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.95, P = 0.002] for the primary composite outcome, including a RR of 0.94 for cardiovascular death (95% CI 0.78–1.13, P = 0.5), a RR of 0.84 for myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.73–0.97, P = 0.016), and a RR of 0.90 for stroke (95% CI 0.80–1.02, P = 0.09). Colchicine was associated with a RR of 1.35 for hospitalization for gastrointestinal events (95% CI 1.10–1.66, P = 0.004) with no increase in hospitalization for pneumonia, newly diagnosed cancers, or non-cardiovascular death.

Conclusions

In patients with prior coronary disease or stroke, colchicine reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke by 12%.

### Antirheumatic drugs for cardiovascular disease prevention: the case for colchicine [^116QmVwZ]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Second, we also feel that national organisations of rheumatology should start forging bridges with national organisations of cardiology to help to implement the use of anti-inflammatory drugs for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis. The same applies to our larger organisations, such as EULAR, ACR and ILAR.

Third, the recent convincingly positive results lead to many follow-up questions on the research agenda: is the benefit seen with colchicine and canakinumab in secondary prevention also applicable in primary prevention? As rheumatologists, we would be inclining this first and foremost in patients with inflammatory rheumatological diseases.

Fourth, for the academic rheumatologist, these findings point to many important avenues for future research. Studies of these mechanisms have been boosted by the availability of successful treatments, and we anticipate that the demonstrated clinical benefit of IL-1 blockade will refine our understanding of the role of this cytokine in atherogenesis and that of future successful treatments in this arena.

In summary, we are convinced that the use of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory medications is now becoming a reality for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, with colchicine as the first drug in the clinic, but with the expectation that hopefully this is only the first in a future series of anti-inflammatory drugs. As rheumatologists, being experts on the use of these medications, we should embrace a new role in extending their potential benefits to millions of individuals.

### Gout [^111HAoku]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^1139UKZq]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate colchicine (within 12 hours of flare onset) at a loading dose of 1 mg followed 1 hour later by 0.5 mg on day 1 and/or an NSAID (plus PPIs if appropriate), oral corticosteroid (30–35 mg/day of equivalent prednisolone for 3–5 days) or performing articular aspiration and administering intra-articular corticosteroids as first-line options for the management of acute flares.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^116ot9sp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 — colchicine in hospitalized patients indicates that treatment rather than no colchicine failed to show or exclude a beneficial effect on mortality, and does not reduce need for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.90, 1.16; high CoE). Hospitalized patients receiving colchicine experienced a trend toward reduced hospital stay (MD: -1.77 days; 95% CI: -3.69, 0.15; very low CoE); however, there are concerns about risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision.

### Effect of colchicine vs standard care on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: the GRECCO-19 randomized clinical trial [^111BNpgi]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has evolved into a global pandemic. Low-dose colchicine combines anti-inflammatory action with a favorable safety profile.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of treatment with colchicine on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial (the Greek Study in the Effects of Colchicine in COVID-19 Complications Prevention), 105 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized in a 1:1 allocation from April 3 to April 27, 2020, to either standard medical treatment or colchicine with standard medical treatment. The study took place in 16 tertiary hospitals in Greece.

Intervention

Colchicine administration (1.5-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg twice daily) with standard medical treatment for as long as 3 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points were (1) maximum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level; (2) time for C-reactive protein to reach more than 3 times the upper reference limit; and (3) time to deterioration by 2 points on a 7-grade clinical status scale, ranging from able to resume normal activities to death. Secondary end points were (1) the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) all-cause mortality, and (3) number, type, severity, and seriousness of adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

A total of 105 patients were evaluated (61 [58.1%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54–76] years) with 50 (47.6%) randomized to the control group and 55 (52.4%) to the colchicine group. Median (interquartile range) peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin values were 0.0112 (0.0043–0.0093) ng/mL in the control group and 0.008 (0.004–0.0135) ng/mL in the colchicine group (P = 0.34). Median (interquartile range) maximum C-reactive protein levels were 4.5 (1.4–8.9) mg/dL vs 3.1 (0.8–9.8) mg/dL (P = 0.73), respectively. The clinical primary end point rate was 14.0% in the control group (7 of 50 patients) and 1.8% in the colchicine group (1 of 55 patients) (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01–0.96; p = 0.02). Mean (SD) event-free survival time was 18.6 (0.83) days the in the control group vs 20.7 (0.31) in the colchicine group (log rank P = 0.03). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups, except for diarrhea, which was more frequent with colchicine group than the control group (25 patients [45.5%] vs 9 patients [18.0%]; p = 0.003).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received colchicine had statistically significantly improved time to clinical deterioration. There were no significant differences in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or C-reactive protein levels. These findings should be interpreted with caution.

### Colchicine for the primary and secondary prevention of pericarditis: an update [^114tRP7S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of colchicine as primary and secondary prophylaxis for pericarditis.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for controlled studies from database inception date to July 2009. Search terms included colchicine, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials investigating the use of colchicine in preventing pericarditis were included. Data extracted included design, inclusion criteria, demographics, interventions, background therapy, and pericarditis-related clinical outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Data were synthesized qualitatively, given variable study designs. Three trials were identified. A single trial examining primary prevention evaluated the use of colchicine versus placebo for preventing PPS in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass grafting. No significant reduction in PPS was found. Two studies examined secondary prevention of pericarditis, comparing colchicine plus aspirin versus aspirin alone. One study examined using these comparators to treat a first episode of pericarditis. After 3 months, there was a significant reduction in recurrent pericarditis with colchicine plus aspirin (11.7% vs 33%; p = 0.009). Another study examined this same regimen in recurrent pericarditis, finding a significant reduction in recurrence after 6 months (21% vs 45%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Despite limitations in study designs, current evidence suggests a role for colchicine in the secondary prophylaxis for recurrent pericarditis. The evidence for use of colchicine as primary prophylaxis in PPS is indeterminate; therefore, colchicine cannot be recommended routinely. While colchicine should be recommended for the prevention of recurrent pericarditis, questions regarding the optimal regimen and long-term safety profile need to be further elucidated.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112SDtjz]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Colchicine for secondary prevention — In clinically stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colchicine 0.5 mg daily reduced recurrent cardiovascular events, with the composite primary endpoint occurring in 6.8% in the colchicine group compared with 9.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001), although the study showed a trend toward increased risk of death from noncardiovascular causes. In acute coronary syndrome, the COLCOT trial reported the primary endpoint occurred in 5.5% of patients treated with colchicine compared with 7.1% in the placebo group (P = 0.02), driven primarily by reductions in strokes and urgent hospitalizations for angina leading to coronary revascularization. Trials excluded patients with creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min and were limited to a duration of just over 2 years; use should be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease (eGFR, < 30 mL/min/m2). Colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, necessitating careful evaluation for drug–drug interactions.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation

The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ.

Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison to allopurinol in a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing ULT strategies and flare prophylaxis.

### Colchicine and cardiovascular events: an updated meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials [^114Dx539]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Colchicine shows promise in reducing cardiovascular risk, but a recent study raised the question whether this is really the case. We conducted a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess its impact on cardiovascular outcomes in secondary prevention.

Methods

We systematically searched major databases up to March 2025 for RCTs comparing colchicine to placebo over a treatment duration of ≥ 12 months, reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Both fixed‐ and random‐effects models were used to compute pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Six RCTs comprising 21,774 patients were included. Colchicine significantly reduced the risk of MACEs (RR 0.74 [0.60–0.92]) and specific components of primary outcome (myocardial infarction, RR 0.85 [0.73–0.98]; stroke, RR 0.79 [0.65–0.95]), with no significant effect on cardiac death and revascularization.

Conclusion

These results support the efficacy of low‐dose colchicine in reducing MACEs when added to standard care for at least 12 months.

### Colchicine's role in cardiovascular disease management [^114rED5G]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colchicine-an anti-inflammatory alkaloid-has assumed an important role in the management of cardiovascular inflammation ≈3500 years after its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt. Primarily used in high doses for the treatment of acute gout flares during the 20th century, research in the early 21st century demonstrated that low-dose colchicine effectively treats acute gout attacks, lowers the risk of recurrent pericarditis, and can add to secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events. As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted anti-inflammatory cardiovascular therapy, colchicine currently has a unique role in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The safe use of colchicine requires careful monitoring for drug-drug interactions, changes in kidney and liver function, and counseling regarding gastrointestinal upset. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine relevant to atherosclerosis, the potential role of colchicine in primary prevention, in other cardiometabolic conditions, colchicine's safety in cardiovascular patients, and opportunities for individualizing colchicine therapy using clinical and molecular diagnostics.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^112bHCrx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium, the membranous sac surrounding the heart. Recurrent pericarditis is the most common complication of acute pericarditis, causing severe and disabling chest pains. Recurrent pericarditis affects one in three patients with acute pericarditis within the first 18 months. Colchicine has been suggested to be beneficial in preventing recurrent pericarditis.

Objectives

To review all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effects of colchicine alone or combined, compared to any other intervention to prevent further recurrences of pericarditis, in people with acute or recurrent pericarditis.

Search Methods

We searched the following bibliographic databases on 4 August 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 2014 on The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to July week 4, 2014), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 2014 week 31), and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) 1990 to 1 Aug 2014. We did not apply any language or time restrictions.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of people with acute or recurrent pericarditis who are receiving colchicine compared to any other treatment, in order to prevent recurrences.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The first primary outcome was the time to recurrence, measured by calculating the hazard ratios (HRs). The second primary outcome was the adverse effects of colchicine. Secondary outcomes were the rate of recurrences at 6, 12 and 18 months, and symptom relief.

Main Results

We included four RCTs, involving 564 participants in this review. We compared the effects of colchicine in addition to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, aspirin or indomethacin to the effects of the NSAID alone. Two comparable trials studied the effects of colchicine in 204 participants with recurrent pericarditis and two trials studied 360 people with acute pericarditis. All trials had a moderate quality for the primary outcomes. We identified two on-going trials; one of these trials examines acute pericarditis and the other assesses recurrent pericarditis. There was moderate quality evidence that colchicine reduces episodes of pericarditis in people with recurrent pericarditis over 18 months follow-up (HR 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.58). It is expected that at 18 months, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 4. In people with acute pericarditis, there was moderate quality evidence that colchicine reduces recurrence (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.61) at 18 months follow-up. Colchicine led to a greater chance of symptom relief at 72 hours (risk ratio (RR) 1.4; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.56; low quality evidence). Adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal and included abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The pooled RR for adverse events was 1.26 (95% CI 0.75 to 2.12). While the number of people experiencing adverse effects was higher in the colchicine than the control groups (9% versus 7%), the quality of evidence was low owing to imprecision, and there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (P = 0.42). There was moderate quality evidence that treatment with colchicine led to more people stopping treatment due to adverse events (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.41).

Authors' Conclusions

Colchicine, as adjunctive therapy to NSAIDs, is effective in reducing the number of pericarditis recurrences in patients with recurrent pericarditis or acute pericarditis. However, evidence is based on a limited number of small trials. Patients with multiple resistant recurrences were not represented in any published or on-going trials, and it is these patients that are in the most need for treatment.

### The role of colchicine in the management of COVID-19: a meta-analysis [^1124V5nU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates that colchicine administration leads to a notable reduction in mortality rates and a decrease in the necessity for oxygen therapy among individuals with COVID-19. Although its impact on broader outcomes like hospitalization rates, ICU admissions, and discharge rates remains minimal, there's a significant finding regarding its efficacy in lowering hospitalizations specifically among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. This detailed understanding highlights the potential of colchicine as a therapeutic intervention for COVID-19, particularly in mitigating mortality risks and oxygen therapy requirements. These results offer valuable insights for clinicians, highlighting the need to consider colchicine as a viable treatment option for COVID-19 patients, while also emphasizing the necessity for further exploration to optimize its clinical utility.

The daily application of colchicine is the standard therapy for prophylaxis of attacks and amyloid deposition in familial Mediterranean fever. However, because of many issues (eg, dosage, time of introduction, etc), no standardized treatment recommendations have been established. In this work we review the available literature on colchicine use with respect to its indication, efficacy, mode of application, and safety in children and adolescents with familial Mediterranean fever. On the basis of this analysis, a consensus statement on the application of colchicine in children and adolescents with familial Mediterranean fever was developed by caregivers from Germany, Austria, and Turkey.

### Colchicine: the good, the bad, the ugly and how to minimize the risks [^112DN1g7]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Colchicine has an important role in managing various conditions, including gout, familial Mediterranean fever, amyloidosis, Behçet's syndrome, recurrent pericarditis and calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease. The adverse effect profile of colchicine is well understood. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, colchicine has been associated with overdose and fatalities. When ingested in toxic amounts, the mainstay of management is supportive care. Strategies to minimize the risk of colchicine poisoning can focus on three broad causes: unauthorized access, intentional overdose and inappropriate dosing. Culturally safe and appropriate education about storage and appropriate use of colchicine is essential to minimize the risk of overdose.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^1119asre]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Moreover, beyond the debated efficacy of colchicine across diverse clinical scenarios, its relatively narrow therapeutic window often results in frequent side effects and toxicity. As such, this underscores the necessity for a highly individualised treatment approach. The effects of colchicine are dose-dependent, with most adverse reactions being reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation. Currently, most clinically recommended low-dose regimens (0.5–0.6 mg), exhibit significant variability in treatment duration, often extending beyond one month. Additionally, dosage formulations differ by geographic region, with 0.6-mg tablets available in the United States and 0.5-mg tablets in Australia. The absence of comparative data on the efficacy and toxicity profiles of these formulations suggests that the differences in preparation strength are likely driven by commercial manufacturing considerations. Age-related prescribing disparities exist, with evidence favoring use in patients > 65 years old. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the disease suffered by patients has its own exploratory value, especially the impact of surgery on medication needs to be discussed in depth. We therefore analysed dosage, duration, geography, age, and disease of patients to refine clinical applicability.

Umbrella review, a useful tool, aimed at providing a relatively comprehensive understanding of published systematic reviews with meta-analyses on a specific topic recently. Considering the great controversy of the evidence, we conducted a umbrella review. Our primary aim was to comprehensively summarise the risks and benefits of colchicine use among patients with ASCVD based on meta-analyses of RCTs. The secondary aim was to identify the population that would benefit the most from colchicine use, thus supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making.

### Effect of colchicine vs standard care on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019: the GRECCO-19 randomized clinical trial [^1125YYbq]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The study GRECCO-19 was published by Spyridon G Deftereos and colleagues in 2020 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the GRECCO-19 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of colchicine in patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the GRECCO-19 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the GRECCO-19 study, the population was: 105 patients (44 female, 61 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation, known hypersensitivity to colchicine, known hepatic failure, eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², corrected QT interval > 450 milliseconds. In the GRECCO-19 study, the interventions were: n = 55 colchicine (1.5-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg BID with standard medical treatment for as long as 3 weeks) n = 50 control (standard medical treatment). In the GRECCO-19 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in time to clinical deterioration rate (1.8% vs. 14%; OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.96). In the GRECCO-19 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median maximum CRP levels (3.1 mg/dL vs. 4.5 mg/dL; AD -4.75 mg/dL, 95% CI -19.1 to -9.6) Significant decrease in median peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin values (0.008 ng/mL vs. 0.011 ng/mL; AD -0.0017 ng/mL, 95% CI 0 to 0) Significant increase in the rate of cumulative event-free 10 day survival (97% vs. 83%; AD 14%, 95% CI 1.34 to 26.66). In the GRECCO-19 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, vomiting, diarrhea requiring study discontinuation, nausea, muscle spasm, headache. significant difference in diarrhea (45.5% vs. 18.0%). In the GRECCO-19 study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, colchicine was superior to control with respect to time to clinical deterioration rate.

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### Consensus statement regarding the efficacy and safety of long-term low-dose colchicine in gout and cardiovascular disease [^1124Yfcp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, evidence has demonstrated that long-term, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) is effective for preventing gout flare and cardiovascular (CV) events in a wide range of patients. Given the potentially expanding use of colchicine in CV disease, we here review and update the biologic effects and safety of colchicine based on recent data gathered from bench and pharmacodynamic studies, clinical reports, controlled clinical trials, and meta-analyses, integrated with important studies over the last 50 years, to offer a consensus perspective by experts from multiple specialties familiar with colchicine's long-term use. We conclude that the clinical benefits of colchicine in gout and CV disease achieved at low dose do not sustain serum levels above the upper limit of safety when used in patients without advanced renal or liver disease or when used concomitantly with most medications. Further, data accrued over the last 50 years strongly suggest that the biologic effects of long-term colchicine do not increase the risk of cancer, sepsis, cytopenia, or myotoxicity.

### Long-term trials of colchicine for secondary prevention of vascular events: a meta-analysis [^112YU4wS]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background and Aims

Colchicine has emerged as a safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory medication to target the residual risk of cardiovascular events in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Two recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating colchicine in the post-stroke and post-myocardial infarction (MI) populations warrant a re-evaluation of colchicine. New evidence was synthesized in a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of colchicine for the secondary prevention of vascular disease.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the incidence of cardiovascular events between patients with clinically manifest vascular disease randomized to colchicine vs. placebo and ≥ 12-month follow-up were included. The primary efficacy endpoint is major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and includes cardiovascular mortality, MI, ischaemic stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization. The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to calculate pooled effect estimates.

Results

Six RCTs, with a pooled sample size of 21 800 patients, were included (colchicine n = 10 871; placebo n = 10 929). Over a follow-up of 12–34 months, colchicine reduced the incidence of MACE compared with placebo [pooled hazard ratio.75, 95% confidence interval (CI).56–.93]. The reduction in cardiovascular events among colchicine patients was driven by reductions in MIs, ischaemic strokes, and urgent coronary revascularizations (P < .05 for all). No differences were detected for safety outcomes (P > .05 for all), including non-cardiovascular deaths (risk ratio 1.08, 95% CI.76–1.54).

Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated a substantial reduction in MACE, MI, ischaemic stroke, and recurrent coronary revascularization with colchicine compared with placebo. Therefore, the results support the use of colchicine to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Cardiovascular benefit of colchicine in relation to baseline risk: a secondary analysis of the LoDoCo2 trial [^112d2Jnd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The LoDoCo2 (Low-Dose Colchicine 2) trial showed that colchicine reduced the risk for cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. Current guidelines recommend colchicine use in selected high-risk patients. The aim of this secondary analysis was to explore the relative and absolute benefits of colchicine according to baseline risk.

Methods

The LoDoCo2 trial randomized 5522 patients to colchicine 0.5mg or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization. First, a LoDoCo2 risk score was developed by Cox regression to identify high-risk features for the primary end point. Second, the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score for Secondary Prevention was applied to explore robustness of findings.

Results

In the LoDoCo2 risk score, high-risk features were age ≥ 75, diabetes, and current smoker. In high-risk (≥ 1 high-risk feature), compared with low-risk (0 high-risk features) patients, colchicine was associated with consistent relative (high risk: hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.56–0.94] versus low risk: HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.52–0.88]; P for interaction = 0.73) and absolute benefits (high risk: HR, -1.33 [95% CI, -2.38 to -0.27] versus low risk: HR, -0.93 [95% CI -1.57 to -0.30] events per 100 person-years). Using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, consistent relative and absolute benefits were found in high-, intermediate-, and low-risk patients.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic coronary syndrome, the relative and absolute benefits of colchicine were consistent in those at high, intermediate, and low risk for cardiovascular events. These findings support the use of colchicine across the spectrum of baseline risk.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Colchicine for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events [^113bM91b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

People with cardiovascular disease are at risk of recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events, and chronic low-grade inflammation may be a major underlying factor. Treatment with low-dose colchicine has been proposed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. A previous Cochrane review showed considerable uncertainty regarding the benefits and harms of this approach.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with a history of stable CVD or following myocardial infarction or stroke.

Search Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature until February 2025 using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the drugs@FDA database, references of key papers, and references of included studies.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of low-dose colchicine for a minimum of six months versus any control intervention in patients of any age with cardiovascular disease (i.e. history of stable cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction or stroke).

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, stroke, all-cause hospitalisations, coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)), quality of life, and gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting).

Risk Of Bias

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We generated forest plots to facilitate visualisation of the data. We did not perform any subgroup analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes and for cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and coronary revascularisation. This was carried out by two review authors working independently.

Included Studies

We included 12 studies involving 22,983 randomised participants. The follow-up in the studies ranged from 6 to 80 months. Overall, 11,524 participants were assigned to low-dose colchicine treatment and 11,459 were assigned to a control intervention, which constituted either usual care plus placebo or usual care only. The doses of colchicine used were 0.5 mg once or twice daily. At baseline, the mean age of participants ranged from 57 to 74 years. Most participants (79.4%) were male.

Synthesis Of Results

There is high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine treatment reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.96; 22,153 participants, 8 studies; I² = 51%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 9 fewer events (95% CI 16 fewer to 2 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the myocardial infarction rate is about 4% (36 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is also high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine reduces the risk of stroke with a RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.95; 22,483 participants, 10 studies; I² = 40%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 8 fewer events (95% CI 12 fewer to 1 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the stroke rate is about 2% (22 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is high-certainty evidence that the use of low-dose colchicine does not increase the rate of serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02; 15,677 participants, 4 studies; I² = 0%). However, gastrointestinal adverse events were more common under treatment with colchicine (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.57; 22,185 participants, 10 studies; I² = 91%). For all other outcomes assessed, the evidence is of moderate certainty. Colchicine probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.21; 22,747 participants, 10 studies; I² = 1%; moderate-certainty evidence), in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22; 22,271 participants; 8 studies; I² = 13%; moderate-certainty evidence), and coronary revascularisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.08; 13,705 participants, 5 studies; I² = 40%; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence about the benefits or harms of colchicine on quality-of-life or on the risk of all-cause hospitalisation.

Authors' Conclusions

People with cardiovascular disease using low-dose colchicine as secondary prevention for at least six months benefit from reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke, without an increase in serious adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence did not show a benefit from low-dose colchicine for the risk of mortality (i.e. all-cause and cardiovascular mortality) or coronary revascularisation rates. Colchicine use was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, which were typically described as mild and transient in nature. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in relevant subgroups and in specific indications, such as long-term use in individuals with stable coronary artery disease versus limited-time use following acute coronary syndrome.

ACMT, AACT and AAPCC joint statement — colchicine for COVID-19 emphasizes restricted, supervised use. The statement says "we recommend caution in the use of colchicine to treat COVID-19", "This drug should only be used under medical supervision", and "For the management of COVID-19, at the present time, colchicine should only be used as part of clinical research". It notes potential severe toxicity — "symptoms ranging from nausea and vomiting to kidney failure, pancytopenia (decrease in blood cells), and death" — and reports that "In 2019, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported several hundred exposures, with more than 10% resulting in moderate toxicity, major toxicity, or death [2]", with "About half of these cases were unintentional". Additional cautions include that "People with kidney failure or other illnesses can accumulate toxic levels of the drug even if they take a standard dose" and "In children, small doses can be life-threatening". For COVID-19 use, the statement adds, "At this time, we recommend that colchicine only be administered for COVID-19 under close medical supervision, preferably as part of clinical research" and "There is no role for this drug as a preventative medication for COVID-19".

### Colchicine: old and new [^114uEXjk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although colchicine has been a focus of research, debate, and controversy for thousands of years, the US Food and Drug Administration just approved it in 2009. Over the past decade, advances in the knowledge of colchicine pharmacology, drug safety, and mechanisms of action have led to changes in colchicine dosing and to potential new uses for this very old drug. In this review, we discuss the pharmacologic properties of colchicine and summarize what is currently known about its mechanisms of action. We then discuss and update the use of colchicine in a variety of illnesses, including rheumatic and, most recently, cardiovascular diseases.

### Colchicine in acute myocardial infarction [^111xJzxn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study CLEAR (colchicine) was published by Sanjit S Jolly and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the trial question was: what is the role of colchicine in patients with myocardial infarction? In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the population was: 7062 patients (1438 female, 5624 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with myocardial infarction. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation; SBP < 90 mmHg; active diarrhea; known allergy or contraindication to everolimus; unable to receive dual antiplatelet therapy; contraindication to colchicine; cirrhosis or current severe hepatic disease. In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the interventions were: n = 3528 colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily) n = 3534 placebo (matching placebo). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned ischemia-driven coronary revascularization (9.1% vs. 9.3%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.85 to 1.16). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, or stroke (6.8% vs. 7.1%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (3.3% vs. 3.2%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.34) No significant difference in recurrent myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.1%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. significant difference in diarrhea (10.2% vs. 6.6%). In the CLEAR (colchicine) study, the conclusion was: in patients with myocardial infarction, colchicine was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, or unplanned ischemia-driven coronary revascularization.

### Long-term trials of colchicine for secondary prevention of vascular events: a meta-analysis [^113vEKo1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Colchicine has emerged as a safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory medication to target the residual risk of cardiovascular events in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Two recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating colchicine in the post-stroke and post-myocardial infarction (MI) populations warrant a re-evaluation of colchicine. New evidence was synthesized in a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of colchicine for the secondary prevention of vascular disease.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials comparing the incidence of cardiovascular events between patients with clinically manifest vascular disease randomized to colchicine vs. placebo and ≥ 12-month follow-up were included. The primary efficacy endpoint is major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and includes cardiovascular mortality, MI, ischaemic stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization. The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was used to calculate pooled effect estimates.

Results

Six RCTs, with a pooled sample size of 21 800 patients, were included (colchicine n = 10 871; placebo n = 10 929). Over a follow-up of 12–34 months, colchicine reduced the incidence of MACE compared with placebo [pooled hazard ratio .75, 95% confidence interval (CI) .56-.93]. The reduction in cardiovascular events among colchicine patients was driven by reductions in MIs, ischaemic strokes, and urgent coronary revascularizations (P < .05 for all). No differences were detected for safety outcomes (P > .05 for all), including non-cardiovascular deaths (risk ratio 1.08, 95% CI .76–1.54).

Conclusions

This updated meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated a substantial reduction in MACE, MI, ischaemic stroke, and recurrent coronary revascularization with colchicine compared with placebo. Therefore, the results support the use of colchicine to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114PX7MT]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The risks and benefits of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have been widely reported. Our umbrella review aimed to systematically analyse and synthesise the available causal evidence on the therapeutic effects and safety profile of colchicine in patients with ASCVD.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from database inception to December 4, 2024, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating colchicine use among patients with ASCVD. The primary endpoints were physical adverse events, MACEs, and CV disorder. The quality of systematic reviews was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Risk of bias was evaluated using Cochrane Systematic Review criteria. Inconsistency was flagged if heterogeneity (I 2) exceeded 50%, or 75% without explanation. Publication bias was detected via funnel plot asymmetry or Egger's test. Subgroup analyses were done according to colchicine dose, treatment duration, geographical region, participant age and disease of patients. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42025631311).

Findings

This review analysed 47 unique outcomes from 48 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs. Among 271 associations, 95 were supported by high-certainty evidence. For primary outcomes, compared with placebo treatment, colchicine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in coronary heart disease [relative risk (RR): 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64–0.83, I 2: 0%] and acute coronary syndromes (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58–0.89, I 2: 0%), demonstrating secondary prevention benefits in major adverse cardiovascular events (RR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47–0.67, I 2: 0%). Common adverse effects included gastrointestinal reactions and hepatic toxicity, with dose-dependent associations of drug discontinuation (RR: 4.63, 95% CI: 2.06–10.38, I 2: 36%). Evidence of publication bias was identified in 18 of 271 tested associations. Subgroup analyses indicated that optimal clinical application required consideration of patient age, geographic variance in pharmacogenomics, and protocol adjustments (recommended dose ≤ 0.5 mg/day for more than a month) to balance efficacy-risk profiles.

Interpretation

High-certainty evidence supported the therapeutic and secondary preventive benefits of colchicine in patients with ASCVD when dose and duration were appropriately controlled. Future studies could focus on identifying ASCVD subgroups with pharmacogenomic and ethnographic predictors of colchicine response heterogeneity to guide precision therapy.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications such as colchicine may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Use of colchicine in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PF7V5]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent used in the treatment of several rheumatological conditions. The use of colchicine in pregnancy is controversial. The current study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse the existing data in the literature regarding the safety of colchicine in pregnancy.

Methods

A systematic review was carried out using six electronic databases, identifying all relevant studies where colchicine was administered to pregnant women, and where pregnancy-related outcomes were measured. The primary endpoints were miscarriage and major foetal malformation. Secondary endpoints included birthweight and gestational age at birth.

Results

Four studies were included for meta-analysis. Use of colchicine throughout pregnancy was not associated with an increased incidence of miscarriage or major foetal malformations. The incidence of miscarriage was significantly lower in women who took colchicine compared with those that did not. In women with FMF who took colchicine throughout the pregnancy, there was no significant difference in birthweight or gestational age compared with those who did not take colchicine. When not limited to FMF, colchicine use was associated with a significantly lower birthweight and gestational age compared with a control group including healthy women who did not take colchicine.

Conclusions

Colchicine therapy did not significantly increase the incidence of foetal malformations or miscarriage when taken during pregnancy. Colchicine therapy for FMF should not be withheld on this basis during pregnancy.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Colchicine and the heart [^112V5Xih]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Colchicine is a sophisticated anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for centuries for the treatment and prevention of gout, and for over 50 years for the prevention of acute inflammatory flares in patients with FMF. Almost 35 years ago, the observed benefits of colchicine in the prevention and treatment of polyserositis in patients with FMF led to its introduction into CV medicine for the treatment and prevention of pericarditis. Subsequent randomized trials in over 1600 patients confirming its safety and efficacy have resulted in it being adopted in the European guidelinesand registered in some countries (e.g. Italy, Austria) as first-line therapy for this indication. Over the last 15 years, clinical trials in > 11 000 patients with coronary disease have shown that long-term low-dose colchicine can be safely used on top of lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy in the absence of advanced renal or liver disease to improve disease-free survival. Over the next 3–5 years, ongoing trials will add information about the benefits of colchicine in CV disease in a further 9000 patients.

### Colchicine in cardiovascular disease: an ancient drug with modern tricks [^113aEQwg]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

From the dark history of being a poison and purgative, colchicine has risen to become one of the few irrefutable positives in the history of pharmacology in the management of myriad inflammatory conditions. Colchicine exerts its action through binding to tubulin, which in turn affects several cellular processes and pathways modulating the inflammatory response. Despite narrow therapeutic-toxicity window and the most common complaint of gastrointestinal upset, its list of medicinal use is expanding in recent years as we continue to unravel the mystery of this ancient remedy. In this review, we summarise the history of colchicine use, discuss its pharmacokinetics and mechanism of actions, and examine the most up-to-date evidence of colchicine in the treatment of various cardiac conditions with a focus on cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Search strategy

The meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (checklist in Supplementary data online, Table S1). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing colchicine to placebo or no colchicine for secondary cardiovascular prevention were searched and selected in Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central (from inception to 5 November 2024). Citation chasing was conducted in Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science to maximize the sensitivity of the search. Secondary prevention was defined as patients with clinically manifest or established vascular disease, including MI, stable CAD, and stroke. Query terms included 'colchicine', 'coronary artery disease', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'myocardial infarction', 'cardiovascular disease', 'atherosclerosis', 'stroke', and 'secondary prevention', either separately or in combination (detailed list provided in Supplementary data online, Methods).

Eligible RCTs included in the present meta-analysis: (i) compared daily use of primarily low-dose colchicine (.5 mg daily) to placebo or no colchicine for secondary cardiovascular prevention; (ii) reported at least one of the following outcomes: cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, cardiac arrest, or urgent coronary revascularization; (iii) treated all patients with guideline-directed medical therapy in addition to the randomized treatment; (iv) had a minimum follow-up of at least 12 months; and (v) were published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Similar to statin therapy, the benefits of colchicine are time-dependent, with anti-inflammatory effects on atherosclerotic plaques likely requiring at least 12 months. Therefore, the present meta-analysis focused on the long-term effects of colchicine, and trials such as CHANCE-3 with a short follow-up period of 3 months, were not included. Review articles, editorials, meta-analyses, observational studies, and published abstracts were excluded.

Two independent reviewers screened eligible trials and included an initial screening of titles and abstracts, followed by full-text reviews. The reviewers were not blinded to the titles of the journals, authors, or affiliated institutions. The reviewers reached a consensus on the included studies.

Study characteristics, patient characteristics, and outcomes were extracted from the intent-to-treat population for each included study. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114LaWox]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extractions

Two trained investigators (J-L and L-DK) worked in pairs to independently collect information from each eligible study. All disagreements were resolved through consultation with a third investigator (Q-JW). We collected information on the first author, publication year, journal, number of included RCTs, heterogeneity I 2, P -values, pooled effect (relative risk [RR], odds ratio [OR], hazard ratio [HR], mean difference [MD], and standard mean difference [SMD]), corresponding 95% CIs, and outcomes for each eligible meta-analysis. For primary studies in each eligible meta-analysis, we further extracted the first author, publication year, baseline health status of participants, number of cases, controls, and total participants, median age of the experimental group, the region where the study was conducted, intervention (duration and dose), the treatment in control groups, study-specific risk estimates, and 95% CIs.

Quality assessment

Two investigators (J-L and L-DK) independently evaluated the methodological quality of included meta-analyses by using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews). Any disagreement was resolved by a third investigator (Q-JW). AMSTAR, a reliable and valid assessment tool, comprises 11 items, including the provision of a study list, characteristics of the included studies, and the disclosure of conflicts of interest, among others. It demonstrates strong face and content validity for evaluating the methodological quality of systematic reviews, which are categorised as high (8–11), moderate (4–7), or low (0–3) quality.

Assessment of evidence credibility

Two investigators (J-L and N-Z) assessed the credibility of evidence from eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework, grading evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality. Meta-analyses of RCTs with initially high-certainty evidence could be downgraded due to risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias. Risk of bias was evaluated using Cochrane Systematic Review criteria. Inconsistency was flagged if heterogeneity (I 2) exceeded 50%, or 75% without explanation. Indirectness was identified for discrepancies in PICOS between original studies and meta-analyses. Imprecision was assigned if experimental or control group sizes were below 200. Publication bias was detected via funnel plot asymmetry or Egger's test P < 0.05.

### Long-term trials of colchicine for secondary prevention of vascular events: a meta-analysis [^116MhhEe]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this updated meta-analysis of RCTs comparing colchicine to placebo (or no colchicine) for secondary cardiovascular prevention, we demonstrated that: (i) treatment with colchicine reduced the incidence of MACE by 25%; (ii) colchicine was primarily associated with fewer MIs, ischaemic strokes, and urgent coronary revascularizations; (iii) no heterogeneity in treatment effect was detected by age, sex, or diabetes, and (iv) colchicine was relatively safe, including no difference in all-cause and non-cardiovascular deaths (Structured Graphical Abstract). Although the addition of newer trials attenuated the magnitude of the pooled protective effect of colchicine, reductions in cardiovascular events remained substantial, further supporting the use of colchicine in combination with guideline-directed medical therapy to decrease cardiovascular events in the atherosclerotic vascular disease population.

### Colchicine and cardiovascular events: an updated meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials [^114nqf84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our meta‐analysis offers a comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis of randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of low‐dose colchicine in cardiovascular prevention. A key strength is the rigorous methodology, and the inclusion of the largest and most recent trials, enhancing the generalizability and applicability of the findings to real‐world practice. Importantly, in all included trials, MACEs were defined as primary outcomes, ensuring a high level of methodological consistency and clinical relevance across studies. However, heterogeneity among the few available studies — particularly regarding population characteristics, treatment duration and specific MACE definitions — may affect result consistency. This limitation is further amplified by the small number of trials, and our findings will need to be confirmed as more studies become available and more robust subgroup analyses can be conducted.

The evidence from this study further supports the use of colchicine in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease as an add‐on to standard therapies, as already highlighted by FDA recommendations and the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Limited data on long‐term safety and optimal inflammatory modulation with colchicine warrant further investigation, and future studies should explore more targeted anti‐inflammatory therapies that could potentially offer greater efficacy and improved tolerability.

### Colchicine for the primary prevention of the postpericardiotomy syndrome [^111BpeTu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature regarding the safety and efficacy of colchicine for the primary prevention of the postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS).

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-April 2011) and Cochrane Database (1993-April 2011) were conducted. Key search terms included postpericardiotomy syndrome, postcardiac injury syndrome, and colchicine. Limits were set for articles written in English with human subjects. Additional data were identified through bibliographic reviews.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. All primary data were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the safety and/or efficacy of colchicine for the primary prevention of PPS. Two prospective trials were identified and included for review.

Data Synthesis

PPS occurs in 10–40% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery and is associated with significant morbidity. Effective medications used for the treatment of PPS include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. Unfortunately, effective drug therapy for the primary prevention of PPS does not exist. Colchicine, an antiinflammatory agent with possible immunopathic antifibroblast properties, has shown benefit in the treatment and secondary prevention of pericarditis; thus, its use for primary prevention of PPS has been investigated. Limited data evaluating colchicine for the primary prevention of PPS have been published. However, results of the largest, well-designed trial showed positive efficacy outcomes for colchicine reducing the incidence of PPS with minimal adverse effects.

Conclusions

At this time, there are not sufficient data to recommend colchicine as routine therapy for the primary prevention of PPS in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Large clinical trials need to be conducted.

### Colchicine and plaque: a focus on atherosclerosis imaging [^116tr19o]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication, classically used to treat a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases. More recently, colchicine has proven itself a key pharmacotherapy in cardiovascular disease (CVD) management, atherosclerotic plaque modification, and coronary artery disease (CAD) treatment. Colchicine acts on many anti-inflammatory pathways, which translates to cardiovascular event reduction, plaque transformation, and plaque reduction. With the FDA's 2023 approval of colchicine for reducing cardiovascular events, a novel clinical pathway opens. This advancement paves the route for CVD management that synergistically merges lipid lowering approaches with inflammation inhibition modalities. This pioneering moment spurs the need for this manuscript's comprehensive review. Hence, this paper synthesizes and surveys colchicine's new role as an atherosclerotic plaque modifier, to provide a framework for physicians in the clinical setting. We aim to improve understanding (and thereby application) of colchicine alongside existing mechanisms for CVD event reduction. This paper examines colchicine's anti-inflammatory mechanism, and reviews large cohort studies that evidence colchicine's blossoming role within CAD management. This paper also outlines imaging modalities for atherosclerotic analysis, reviews colchicine's mechanistic effect upon plaque transformation itself, and synthesizes trials which assess colchicine's nuanced effect upon atherosclerotic transformation.

### Efficacy and safety of colchicine for pericarditis prevention. systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WDfmA]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of colchicine for pericarditis prevention.

Background

Recurrent pericarditis prevention is a major management goal that may reduce morbidity and management costs. Although empiric anti-inflammatory therapy is considered the mainstay of treatment, no specific drug has been proven to be efficacious for prevention but colchicine.

Methods

Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on the pharmacologic primary or secondary prevention of pericarditis. We performed a meta-analysis including studies primary outcome, adverse events, and drug withdrawal.

Results

From the initial sample of 127 citations, five controlled clinical trials were finally included (795 patients): three studies were double-blind randomised controlled trials, and two studies were open-label randomised controlled trials. Trials followed patients for a mean of 13 months. Meta-analytic pooling showed that colchicine use was associated with a reduced risk of pericarditis during follow-up (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, p for effect < 0.001, p for heterogeneity = 0.95, I(2) = 0%) either for primary or secondary prevention without a significant higher risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.10, p for effect 0.48, p for heterogeneity = 0.44, I(2) = 0%), but more cases of drug withdrawals (RR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.29, p for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity = 0.42, I(2) = 0%). Gastrointestinal intolerance is the most frequent side effect (mean incidence 8%), but no severe adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that colchicine is safe and efficacious for the primary and secondary prevention of pericarditis.

### Emerging insights into the role of IL-1 inhibitors and colchicine for inflammation control in type 2 diabetes [^114cfnu2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Large-scale trials involving colchicine for CVD began in 2013. Nidorf et al. conducted the low-dose colchicine trial (LoDoCo trial), revealing that low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg/day) effectively reduces the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease. In 2017, the CANTOS trial, using the IL-1β monoclonal antibody canakinumab, also demonstrated the efficacy of IL-1β inhibitor treatment in decreasing the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), indicating that anti-inflammatory therapy is an effective strategy in CVD. However, it did not reduce blood lipid levels. Additionally, The COLCOT trial at the end of 2019 revealed that the use of low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg/day) for just 30 days initiated after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can reduce the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. The subsequent LoDoCo2 trial in 2020, involving 5522 patients with chronic coronary artery disease, demonstrated a significant reduction in spontaneous myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular deaths in the colchicine group after a 2.4 year follow-up. Colchicine is found safe, with no statistically significant differences in serious adverse events compared to the placebo. However, non-cardiovascular deaths were more common in the colchicine group. The COPS trial (the Australian COPS randomized clinical trial) did not show significant differences in the primary outcomes but was associated with higher mortality. Despite unsatisfactory results for the one-year primary endpoint, a 24 month follow-up of patients who were only on standard medical therapy after discontinuing colchicine at the end of 12 months, revealed a significant decrease in the all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ischemia-related unplanned urgent revascularization, and non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis by Samuel et al. of randomized controlled trials demonstrated that adding low-dose colchicine to standard medical therapy can lower the incidence of major cardiovascular events, with the exception of cardiovascular mortality. Regarding mortality, Opstal et al. conducted a detailed analysis and concluded that colchicine usage in the LoDoCo2 trial had no negative impact on the total number of fatalities or specific causes of death. Cancer and infection related deaths were found to be equivalent for colchicine and placebo, emphasizing the role of comorbidities as a driver of all-cause mortality in patients included in LoDoCo2 trial. Finally, the most recent American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on chronic coronary disease recommend low-dose (0.6 mg/day) colchicine as a secondary preventive agent to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Colchicine, along with anti-platelet and statin therapy, may be the third pillar of secondary prevention in patients with chronic coronary disease. Colchicine appears to have even greater benefits when initiated within the first three days following myocardial infarction, indicating a realistic therapy strategy.

### Colchicine for prevention of cardiovascular events [^112JKHaY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is used for a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Cardiovascular disease also has an inflammatory component but the effects of colchicine on cardiovascular outcomes remain unclear. Previous safety analyses were restricted to specific patient populations.

Objectives

To evaluate potential cardiovascular benefits and harms of a continuous long-term treatment with colchicine in any population, and specifically in people with high cardiovascular risk.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, citations of key papers, and study references in January 2015. We also contacted investigators to gain unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (parallel-group or cluster design or first phases of cross-over studies) comparing colchicine over at least six months versus any control in any adult population.

Data Collection and Analysis

Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, stroke, heart failure, non-scheduled hospitalisations, and non-scheduled cardiovascular interventions. We conducted predefined subgroup analyses, in particular for participants with high cardiovascular risk.

Main Results

We included 39 randomised parallel-group trials with 4992 participants. Colchicine had no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09; participants = 4174; studies = 30; I² = 27%; moderate quality of evidence). There is uncertainty surrounding the effect of colchicine in reducing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.21, I² = 9%; participants = 1132; studies = 7; moderate quality of evidence). Colchicine reduced the risk for total myocardial infarction (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57; participants = 652; studies = 2; moderate quality of evidence). There was no effect on total adverse events (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.46; participants = 1313; studies = 11; I² = 45%; very low quality of evidence) but gastrointestinal intolerance was increased (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.26; participants = 1258; studies = 11; I² = 74%; low quality of evidence). Colchicine showed no effect on heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.88; participants = 462; studies = 3; I² = 45%; low quality of evidence) and no effect on stroke (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.70; participants = 874; studies = 3; I² = 45%; low quality of evidence). Reporting of serious adverse events was inconsistent; no event occurred over 824 patient-years (4 trials). Effects on other outcomes were very uncertain. Summary effects of RCTs specifically focusing on participants with high cardiovascular risk were similar (4 trials; 1230 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

There is much uncertainty surrounding the benefits and harms of colchicine treatment. Colchicine may have substantial benefits in reducing myocardial infarction in selected high-risk populations but uncertainty about the size of the effect on survival and other cardiovascular outcomes is high, especially in the general population from which most of the studies in our review were drawn. Colchicine is associated with gastrointestinal side effects based on low-quality evidence. More evidence from large-scale randomised trials is needed.

### Colchicine and the heart: pushing the envelope [^1157GT33]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Colchicine, a natural and ancient drug still used today, is traditionally considered the staple therapy for gout and a second-line treatment for pericarditis, as well as a basic part of familial Mediterranean fever and Behcet's disease management. It is commonly classified as an anti-inflammatory agent, although its mechanism of action does not involve the arachidonic acid pathway affected by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids. Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, thus affecting any process that requires cytoskeletal changes, including cell mitosis and neutrophil motility. Recent studies suggest that colchicine may prove to be useful in a much wider spectrum of cardiovascular diseases than previously suspected, rekindling the interest in this old drug. In this review we briefly present the biochemical characteristics, mechanism of action and side-effects of colchicine, as well as examine what is currently known about the promising role of colchicine in cardiovascular medicine beyond pericardial disease.

14. CLINICAL STUDIES

The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with cardiovascular events is derived from published literature (LoDoCo2) along with other supportive studies.

The LoDoCo2 trial was an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, event-driven trial conducted to assess the efficacy of colchicine 0.5mg once daily orally in patients with stable coronary artery disease. The study included 5522 patients, in which 2762 were assigned to the colchicine group and 2760 to placebo. The baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced between the trial groups. Patients were treated for chronic coronary disease, with 99.7% taking an antiplatelet agent or an anticoagulant, 96.6% a lipid-lowering agent, 97.3% of which were statins, 62.1% a beta-blocker, and 71.7% an inhibitor of the renin–angiotensin system.

LoDoCo2 assessed the efficacy of colchicine 0.5 mg once daily in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Patients between 35–85 years were eligible for participation in the LoDoCo2 trial if they had proven coronary artery disease, were clinically stable for at least 6 months, without comorbidities that would preclude follow-up, or contraindication to colchicine use. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 66 ± 8.6 years, and 846 (15.3%) were female. The median time on study medication was 28.6 months. The primary end point of LoDoCo2 trial was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous (nonprocedural) myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization.

In the LoDoCo2 trial, 0.5 mg of colchicine once daily resulted in a 31% lower relative risk (RRR) of the primary composite endpoint events compared to placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% [CI] 0.57 to 0.83; p < 0.001) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was 36.

The results of the primary endpoint are summarized in Table 4.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to hs-CRP screening in secondary prevention, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that low-dose colchicine reduces cardiovascular events in patients with chronic stable atherosclerosis and is the first FDA-approved anti-inflammatory agent for this purpose. Low-dose colchicine is intended to be used as an adjunct to lipid lowering; however, colchicine has not proven effective when initiated at the time of acute ischemia and should be avoided among individuals with significant liver or renal disease.

### Cardiovascular effects and safety of long-term colchicine treatment: cochrane review and meta-analysis [^117PNvTu]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Colchicine is an old anti-inflammatory drug that has shown substantial cardiovascular benefits in recent trials. We systematically reviewed cardiovascular benefits and harms of colchicine in any population and specifically in patients with high cardiovascular risk. We evaluated randomised controlled trials comparing colchicine over at least 6months versus any control in any adult population. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and adverse events. Cardiovascular mortality was a secondary outcome. We included 39 trials with 4992 patients. The quality of evidence for mortality outcomes and myocardial infarction was moderate but lower for adverse events. Colchicine had no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09; I(2) = 27%; 30 trials). Cardiovascular mortality was reduced in some but not all meta-analytical models (random-effects RR 0.34, 0.09 to 1.21, I(2) = 9%; Peto's OR 0.24, 0.09 to 0.64, I(2) = 15%; Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect RR 0.20, 0.06 to 0.68, I(2) = 0%; 7 trials). The risk for myocardial infarction was reduced (RR 0.20, 0.07 to 0.57; 2 trials). There was no effect on total adverse events (RR 1.52, 0.93 to 2.46, I(2) = 45%; 11 trials) but gastrointestinal intolerance was increased (RR 1.83, 1.03 to 3.26, I(2) = 74%; 11 trials). Reporting of serious adverse events was inconsistent; no event occurred over 824 patient-years (4 trials). Effects in high cardiovascular risk populations were similar (4 trials; 1230 patients). We found no evidence supporting colchicine doses above 1mg/day. Colchicine may have substantial cardiovascular benefits; however, there is sufficient uncertainty about its benefit and harm to indicate the need for large-scale trials to further evaluate this inexpensive, promising treatment in cardiovascular disease.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of colchicine use among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114RYJ4a]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Colchicine demonstrated therapeutic benefits in CHD and ACS, serving as an effective agent for secondary prevention of MACEs including AMI, UA, and cerebrovascular incidents. Its mechanism of action involves modulation of inflammatory pathways and enhancement of vascular repair processes, which collectively contribute to reduced hospitalisation requirements and improved revascularisation outcomes. While generally well-tolerated, treatment-emergent gastrointestinal disturbances and hepatic enzyme abnormalities represent the most frequently reported adverse effects, with dose-dependent correlations to therapy discontinuation and non-CV mortality risks. Clinical deployment requires careful consideration of patient-specific factors such as age-related pharmacokinetic variations, regional pharmacogenomic profiles, and physical changes of patients after surgery. Current evidence supports the adoption of conservative dosing regimens with extended treatment duration to optimise the risk–benefit ratio, though therapeutic protocols should remain adaptable to evolving clinical contexts.

Methods

The study protocol was reported previously and compliant with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials research reporting guidelines (online supplemental file 1).

In summary, we included 192 adults with a first STEMI referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, from 20 July 2018, to 28 July 2020 in a multicentre, double-blinded placebo-controlled academic funded, prospective study. An institutional review committee approved the study (CPP: 17/084), and all patients gave written informed consent (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03156816).

The patients in the colchicine group received a 2 mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg two times a day for 5 days. Colchicine treatment was stopped after the fifth day. The patients in the placebo group received a 2 mg loading dose of placebo followed by 0.5 mg two times a day for 5 days. Colchicine or placebo treatment was stopped after the fifth day.

At day 5, patients got a CMR scan to evaluate the infarct size (primary outcome of COVERT-MI trial).

All the patients were followed up by phone, and trained research coordinators reviewed medical records to collect the 1 year occurrence of MACEs, medical prescriptions (ie, antiplatelet drug, anticoagulation drug, antihypertensive drug, diuretics, statin oral antidiabetic drug and insulin therapy). The QOL was also assessed at 1 year using the EQ-5D score.

If the patient did not take the call, the reason was specified (ie, withdrawal, lost to follow-up, death since last contact)

Patients or the public were not involved in our research's design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans.

MACEs were defined as all-cause death, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure events (new hospitalisation for heart failure), ischaemic strokes, sustained ventricular arrhythmias and acute kidney injury following the international definitions for each type of adverse event. The unexpected increased intraventricular thrombus incidence in the colchicine group compared with the control group was notified by our authorities as a serious adverse finding and was also considered as a MACE for the statistical analyses.

The primary prespecified endpoint for this follow-up study was the rate of MACEs at 1 year of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were the rate of each individual component of the primary endpoint and also the quality-of-life scores at 1 year compared between each study group.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### Colchicine and cardiovascular events: an updated meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials [^113ksBBp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colchicine shows promise in reducing cardiovascular risk, but a recent study raised the question whether this is really the case. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess its impact on cardiovascular outcomes in secondary prevention.

Methods

We systematically searched major databases up to March 2025 for RCTs comparing colchicine to placebo over a treatment duration of ≥ 12 months, reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Both fixed- and random-effects models were used to compute pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Six RCTs comprising 21,774 patients were included. Colchicine significantly reduced the risk of MACEs (RR 0.74 [0.60–0.92]) and specific components of primary outcome (myocardial infarction, RR 0.85 [0.73–0.98]; stroke, RR 0.79 [0.65–0.95]), with no significant effect on cardiac death and revascularization.

Conclusion

These results support the efficacy of low-dose colchicine in reducing MACEs when added to standard care for at least 12 months.

### Low-dose colchicine for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^111Kk9V7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The study LoDoCo was published by Nidorf SM and colleagues in 2013 in the journal J Am Coll Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the LoDoCo study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose colchicine in patients with clinically stable coronary disease? In the LoDoCo study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LoDoCo study, the population was: 532 patients (59 female, 473 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with stable coronary disease receiving aspirin and/or clopidogrel and statins. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to colchicine, history of bypass surgery < 10 years ago, unwilling to provide consent, or major competing comorbidities. In the LoDoCo study, the interventions were: n = 282 colchicine (0.5 mg/day) n = 250 control (no colchicine). In the LoDoCo study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (5.3% vs. 16%; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.59). In the LoDoCo study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in acute coronary syndrome (4.6% vs. 13.6%; HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63) Significant decrease in Acute coronary syndrome nonstent-related (3.2% vs. 12%; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) Significant decrease in nonstent-related acute myocardial infarction (1.6% vs. 5.6%; HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76). In the LoDoCo study, the conclusion was: in patients with stable coronary disease receiving aspirin and/or clopidogrel and statins, colchicine was superior to control with respect to acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.

### Colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events [^116MgsA6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ACVDs), a condition characterised by lipid accumulation in arterial walls, which is often exacerbated by chronic inflammation disorders, is the major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Colchicine, with its first medicinal use in ancient Egypt, is an inexpensive drug with anti-inflammatory properties. However, its role in primary prevention of ACVDs in the general population remains unknown.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of colchicine as primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Heart Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, Web of Science, and LILACS. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP for ongoing and unpublished studies. We also scanned the reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no limitations on language, date of publication, or study setting. The search results were updated on 31 May 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting, recruiting adults without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. We included trials that compared colchicine versus placebo, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and performed risk of bias and GRADE assessments.

Main Results

We identified 15 RCTs (1721 participants randomised; 1412 participants analysed) with follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 728 weeks. The intervention was oral colchicine compared with placebo, immunomodulating drugs, or usual care or no treatment. Due to biases and imprecision, the evidence was very uncertain for all outcomes. All trials but one had a high risk of bias. Five out of seven meta-analyses included fewer than six trials (71.4%). The objectives of the review were to assess cardiovascular outcomes in the general population, but many of the included trials focused on liver disease. Colchicine compared to placebo Colchicine may reduce all-cause mortality compared to placebo in primary prevention, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.91; 6 studies, 463 participants; very low-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 11, 95% CI 6 to 67). Colchicine may result in little to no difference in non-fatal myocardial infarction, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.82; 1 study, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Colchicine may not reduce the incidence of stroke, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.86; 1 study, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding adverse events, colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.06; 8 studies, 605 participants; very low-certainty evidence; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 10, 95% CI 6 to 17), and may have little to no effect on neurological outcomes such as seizure or mental confusion (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.66; 2 studies, 155 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The effect of colchicine on cardiovascular mortality is also very uncertain (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 62.43; 2 studies, 160 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Colchicine may not reduce post-cardiac procedure atrial fibrillation, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.19; 1 study, 100 participants). We found no trials reporting on pericardial effusion, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, or unstable angina. Colchicine compared to methotrexate (immunomodulating drug) Colchicine may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality compared to methotrexate, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.51; 1 study, 85 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no trials reporting other cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events for this comparison. Colchicine compared to usual care or no treatment The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of colchicine compared with usual care on all-cause mortality in primary prevention (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.27; 2 studies, 729 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding adverse events, colchicine may increase the incidence of diarrhoea compared to usual care, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.56 to 7.03; 2 studies, 729 participants; very low-certainty evidence; NNTH 18, 95% CI 12 to 42). No trials reported other cardiovascular outcomes for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane review evaluated the clinical benefits and harms of using colchicine for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in the general population. Comparisons were made against placebo, immunomodulating medications, or usual care or no treatment. However, the certainty of the evidence for the predefined outcomes was very low, highlighting the pressing need for high-quality, rigorous studies to ascertain colchicine's clinical impact definitively. We identified numerous biases and inaccuracies in the included studies, limiting their generalisability and precluding a conclusive determination of colchicine's efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events. The existing evidence regarding colchicine's potential cardiovascular benefits or harms for primary prevention is inconclusive owing to the limitations inherent in the current studies. More robust clinical trials are needed to bridge this evidence gap effectively.

### Colchicine and SARS-CoV-2: management of the hyperinflammatory state [^116AMSo7]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is currently underway. In December 2020, the European Agency of Medicine (EMA) licensed the first Sars-CoV-2 vaccine. Therapeutic management of the COVID-19 positive patient should primarily aim to avoid the severe complications and organ injury caused by generalized inflammation caused by a cytokine storm and occurring in the most severe stages of viral infection. Current knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SARS- CoV-2 suggests a central role for exaggerated activation of the innate immune system as an important contributor to the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Several studies have shown that blocking the cytokine storm or acting early with prevention of it can be effective; studies are underway to evaluate agents that may be able to reduce this hyperinflammatory state. The search for effective management strategies for COVID-19 continues to evolve. The actions of colchicine, one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapies, target multiple targets associated with excessive COVID-19 inflammation. Colchicine is easily administered, generally well tolerated, and inexpensive. This article reports the scientific and molecular rationale for the use of colchicine as monotherapy or in combination in the various stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection to modulate and control the inflammatory state. Low-dose colchicine may be considered safe and effective for the treatment and prevention of cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as an adjunctive remedy to other therapeutic agents. Well-organized clinical studies are needed in this direction.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose colchicine in patients with coronary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^112kKW4f]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent randomized trials demonstrated a benefit of low-dose colchicine added to guideline-based treatment in patients with recent myocardial infarction or chronic coronary disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to obtain best estimates of the effects of colchicine on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

Methods and Results

We searched the literature for randomized clinical trials of long-term colchicine in patients with atherosclerosis published up to 1 September 2020. The primary efficacy endpoint was MACE, the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. We combined the results of five trials that included 11 816 patients. The primary endpoint occurred in 578 patients. Colchicine reduced the risk for the primary endpoint by 25% [relative risk (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.92; P = 0.005], myocardial infarction by 22% (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64–0.94; P = 0.010), stroke by 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.86; P = 0.009), and coronary revascularization by 23% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66–0.90; P < 0.001). We observed no difference in all-cause death (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.71–1.62; P = 0.73), with a lower incidence of cardiovascular death (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55–1.23; P = 0.34) counterbalanced by a higher incidence of non-cardiovascular death (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.99–1.92; P = 0.060).

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis indicates that low-dose colchicine reduced the risk of MACE as well as that of myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for coronary revascularization in a broad spectrum of patients with coronary disease. There was no difference in all-cause mortality and fewer cardiovascular deaths were counterbalanced by more non-cardiovascular deaths.
