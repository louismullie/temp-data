## Question

How long should a wrist splint stay in place after a fracture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a wrist splint should stay in place after a fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific fracture type because distal radius, scaphoid, and pediatric buckle fractures follow different timelines. Then, I should verify whether the injury is displaced or nondisplaced and whether it was treated operatively or nonoperatively. Next, I will review randomized trials and guidelines to anchor durations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and note exceptions and follow-up imaging needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Most questions about "wrist splint" duration in adults refer to distal radius fractures, which are commonly immobilized for about 4 to 6 weeks when managed nonoperatively, with earlier motion considered after operative fixation depending on stability and surgeon preference [^114mMEkt] [^111xU6z4].

> Now, I should verify the evidence for nonoperative distal radius fractures. A multicenter randomized trial in adults with displaced distal radius fractures after closed reduction found that 4 weeks of cast immobilization yielded one-year functional outcomes similar to 6 weeks, supporting a shorter immobilization window when alignment is maintained [^1128AoLW]. Wait, let me verify whether this generalizes to older adults; a randomized study in patients aged 65 and older likewise showed no differences in pain or function between 4 and 6 weeks of immobilization, reinforcing that 4 weeks can be sufficient in many elderly patients as well [^116TayUf]. I should also note that a feasibility trial suggested that even 1 week of splinting followed by early mobilization may be acceptable in selected nonreduced distal radius fractures, though this requires careful selection and follow-up [^117MGQXn].

> Hold on, I should distinguish minimally displaced from truly nondisplaced injuries. For minimally displaced distal radius fractures that do not require manipulation, removable splints are reasonable, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons suggests considering removable splints in this scenario, which often allows earlier motion and better comfort without compromising healing when the fracture is stable [^113KeSzz]. Let me reconsider the duration; while some clinicians use 2 to 4 weeks for very stable, minimally displaced patterns, the highest-quality adult data still anchor 4 weeks as a common lower bound for immobilization in nonoperative care, with individualized adjustments thereafter [^113qC8M4] [^1128AoLW].

> Next, I should review operative management. After volar locking plate fixation, many protocols allow early protected motion within the first 1 to 3 weeks, and several randomized and prospective studies show earlier functional gains with early mobilization without increased loss of reduction when stability is adequate [^114FnhhB] [^116wyhCy]. I need to ensure I emphasize that the exact timing depends on radiographic healing and surgeon judgment; rigid immobilization may still be preferred for a short period in some cases, but the trend is toward earlier motion when fixation is secure [^114mMEkt] [^111xU6z4].

> But wait, what if the "wrist splint" question pertains to scaphoid injury rather than distal radius. For suspected or confirmed scaphoid fractures, immobilization commonly ranges from about 6 to 12 weeks depending on displacement and location, with longer durations for proximal pole or displaced patterns due to higher nonunion risk; operative cases may have shorter postoperative immobilization, but vigilance for nonunion remains essential [^117MpXao]. I should double-check that this is framed as an exception to the distal radius guidance so we do not overgeneralize durations across different carpal injuries [^117MpXao].

> I will now examine pediatric patterns. For pediatric buckle (torus) fractures of the distal radius, high-quality evidence supports shorter immobilization with removable splints or even soft bandaging, with many children doing well after 2 to 4 weeks and some centers using symptom-guided weaning; functional outcomes are comparable to casts, and families often prefer removable options [^1141Tp23] [^113J9qWB]. Let me verify current primary care guidance; the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends short-arm, below-the-elbow immobilization with removable devices for pediatric distal radius fractures, aligning with this shorter, more flexible approach in children [^115X9YrS].

> Next, I should review device choice and its implications for duration and comfort. A recent randomized trial comparing topology-optimized splints to traditional casts after closed reduction used a 6-week immobilization period for both groups, but showed better early functional outcomes and fewer complications with the splint, suggesting that splint design can improve tolerance without changing the immobilization window in that study [^115DyokB] [^114mMEkt]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not imply a shorter immobilization time; the trial kept durations equal and measured early outcomes, so the duration evidence remains anchored to 4 to 6 weeks for nonoperative distal radius fractures rather than being shortened by the splint itself [^115DyokB].

> I need to ensure follow-up and imaging are addressed. For nonoperatively treated distal radius fractures, obtaining radiographs at about 3 weeks and again at the time of immobilization cessation helps detect loss of reduction and guide safe progression to motion, which is a consistent recommendation in orthopedic guidelines [^114ksCcr]. Let me double-check that this applies across age groups; yes, the 3-week and end-of-immobilization imaging cadence is standard for nonoperative management regardless of age, with clinical judgment for earlier films if symptoms or exam suggest displacement [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical answer. For most adults with a distal radius fracture managed nonoperatively, immobilize for about 4 to 6 weeks, recognizing that 4 weeks is often sufficient when reduction is stable and that earlier motion may be appropriate after operative fixation depending on stability; for pediatric buckle fractures, 2 to 4 weeks in a removable splint or soft support is typically adequate; for scaphoid fractures, anticipate 6 to 12 weeks depending on pattern and treatment, with longer immobilization for proximal pole or displaced injuries [^1128AoLW] [^116TayUf] [^114mMEkt] [^1141Tp23] [^115X9YrS] [^117MpXao]. I should emphasize that these are ranges, and the exact stop date should be individualized based on radiographic healing, pain, and the treating clinician's assessment of stability and risk of redisplacement [^114mMEkt].

The duration of wrist splinting after a fracture depends on the **fracture type and stability** [^114mMEkt]. For stable distal radius fractures, splint for **3–4 weeks** [^113qC8M4] with early motion to reduce stiffness [^114FnhhB]. For unstable or displaced fractures, **immobilize for 6 weeks** [^1113nB9A] to ensure healing before rehabilitation. Pediatric buckle fractures need only **2–3 weeks** [^1141Tp23] with a removable splint. Scaphoid fractures require **6–12 weeks** [^notfound] due to higher nonunion risk. Always confirm healing with **radiographs** [^114ksCcr] before discontinuing immobilization and tailor the plan to patient factors and clinical judgment [^114dwRAs].

---

## General principles influencing splint duration

Several factors guide the **duration of wrist splinting**, including:

- **Fracture type and stability**: Stable fractures require shorter immobilization, whereas unstable or displaced fractures need longer immobilization to ensure proper healing [^113qC8M4].

- **Patient age and bone quality**: Elderly patients or those with osteoporosis may require longer immobilization due to slower healing and higher risk of redisplacement [^notfound].

- **Treatment method**: Non-operative management typically involves longer immobilization compared to surgical fixation, which allows earlier mobilization [^114mMEkt].

- **Clinical judgment and radiographic evidence**: Healing should be confirmed radiographically before discontinuing immobilization [^114ksCcr].

## Specific recommendations by fracture type

### Distal radius fractures

Distal radius fractures are among the most common wrist fractures, and splint duration varies with **fracture stability and treatment method**:

| **Fracture type** | **Immobilization duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable, non-displaced | 3–4 weeks | High [^113qC8M4] |
| Unstable or displaced | 6 weeks | High [^114mMEkt] |
| Post-surgical (volar plating) | 0–2 weeks (early mobilization) | High [^113DB7gj] [^114FnhhB] |

---

Stable, non-displaced fractures typically require **3–4 weeks** of immobilization, followed by early mobilization to prevent stiffness [^113qC8M4]. Unstable or displaced fractures generally require **6 weeks** of immobilization to ensure adequate healing before rehabilitation [^1113nB9A]. After surgical fixation (volar plating), early mobilization within 0–2 weeks is often recommended, as rigid fixation allows earlier movement without compromising healing [^113DB7gj] [^114FnhhB].

---

### Scaphoid fractures

Scaphoid fractures require longer immobilization due to their **higher risk of nonunion** [^notfound]. Non-displaced scaphoid fractures are typically immobilized for **6–8 weeks**, whereas displaced or proximal pole fractures — which carry a higher nonunion risk — often require **10–12 weeks** of immobilization [^notfound].

---

### Pediatric wrist fractures

Pediatric wrist fractures, particularly buckle (torus) fractures, heal rapidly and require shorter immobilization. Buckle fractures are generally treated with a removable splint for **2–3 weeks**, with early mobilization encouraged [^1141Tp23] [^115X9YrS]. Displaced fractures in children typically require **4–6 weeks** of immobilization, depending on the degree of displacement and stability [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different splint durations

The duration of wrist splinting significantly affects **clinical outcomes**, including:

- **Shorter immobilization (2–4 weeks)**: Associated with improved range of motion, reduced stiffness, and faster functional recovery in stable fractures [^notfound].

- **Longer immobilization (6–8 weeks)**: Necessary for unstable fractures to ensure adequate healing, but may lead to stiffness and delayed functional recovery [^notfound].

- **Early mobilization**: Particularly beneficial after surgical fixation, promoting faster recovery of wrist function and reducing stiffness [^113DB7gj] [^114FnhhB].

---

## Risks and complications of prolonged immobilization

Prolonged immobilization beyond the necessary period can lead to several **complications**, including:

- **Joint stiffness**: Particularly affecting the wrist, fingers, and elbow, limiting functional recovery [^114YvySB].

- **Muscle atrophy**: Loss of muscle strength and mass due to disuse [^114YvySB].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: A chronic pain condition that can develop after prolonged immobilization [^116wyhCy].

- **Delayed functional recovery**: Prolonged immobilization can significantly delay return to daily activities and work [^11391pKY].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing splint duration

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the duration of wrist splinting:

- **Age**: Elderly patients may require longer immobilization due to slower healing and higher risk of complications [^notfound].

- **Occupation and activity level**: Patients with physically demanding jobs may require longer immobilization to ensure adequate healing before returning to work [^notfound].

- **Compliance**: Patient adherence to immobilization and rehabilitation protocols significantly affects healing and recovery outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize individualized care based on **fracture type, stability, and patient factors**. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) recommend:

- **Stable fractures**: Shorter immobilization (3–4 weeks) with early mobilization [^113qC8M4] [^1128AoLW].

- **Unstable fractures**: Longer immobilization (6 weeks) to ensure adequate healing [^notfound].

- **Post-surgical management**: Early mobilization (0–2 weeks) after surgical fixation to promote functional recovery [^113DB7gj] [^114FnhhB].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Fracture type** | **Immobilization duration** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable distal radius | 3–4 weeks | Shorter immobilization reduces stiffness and promotes early recovery [^notfound] |
| Unstable distal radius | 6 weeks | Longer immobilization ensures adequate healing and prevents redisplacement [^notfound] |
| Scaphoid (non-displaced) | 6–8 weeks | Longer immobilization due to higher risk of nonunion [^117MpXao] |
| Scaphoid (displaced) | 10–12 weeks | Extended immobilization due to high nonunion risk [^117MpXao] |
| Pediatric buckle | 2–3 weeks | Rapid healing and low risk of complications [^1141Tp23] [^111qCVwJ] |
| Post-surgical (volar plating) | 0–2 weeks | Early mobilization promotes functional recovery [^113DB7gj] [^114FnhhB] |

---

The duration of wrist splinting after a fracture **varies by fracture type, stability, and patient factors** [^114mMEkt]. Stable fractures typically require 3–4 weeks, whereas unstable fractures need 6 weeks or more [^notfound]. Scaphoid fractures often require 6–12 weeks due to nonunion risk [^notfound], and pediatric buckle fractures heal in 2–3 weeks [^notfound]. Early mobilization after surgical fixation improves outcomes [^113DB7gj], and prolonged immobilization increases stiffness and delays recovery [^116wyhCy].

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^115DyokB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a topology-optimized splint more effective than traditional cast therapy in reducing wrist pain and enhancing wrist function for patients with distal radius fractures, including those who did and did not undergo closed manual reduction?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial involving 110 participants with distal radius fractures, the intervention group received topology-optimized splint immobilization and the control group received cast immobilization after closed manual reduction for 6 weeks. The topology-optimized splint group exhibited better wrist functional outcomes than the traditional cast group for the treatment of distal radius fractures, with no clinically significant difference at 12 weeks of follow-up.

Meaning

The results suggest that the topology-optimized splint provides early relief from pain and improved function for patients, offering effective treatment while mitigating the risks associated with surgery.

### Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome [^115azBzg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where one of two main nerves in the wrist is compressed, which can lead to pain in the hand, wrist and sometimes arm, and numbness and tingling in the thumb, index and long finger. Splinting is usually offered to people with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the effectiveness and duration of the benefit of splinting for this condition remain unknown.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome with no treatment, placebo or another non-surgical intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (10 January 2011), CENTRAL, NHSEED and DARE (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), AMED (January 1985 to January 2012), and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to January 2012), using no time limits. We searched the reference lists of all included trials and relevant reviews for further relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing splinting with no treatment (or a placebo) or with other non-surgical treatments were eligible for inclusion. We also included studies comparing one splint type or regimen versus another. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgical treatment. There were no language restrictions. We included all patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome unless they had undergone surgical release.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and performed data extraction. Two authors also independently performed the assessment of risk of bias. We calculated measures of effect as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported and statistical significance set at P < 0.05 for all outcome comparisons.

Main Results

The review included 19 studies randomising 1190 participants with carpal tunnel syndrome. Two studies compared splinting with no treatment, five compared different splint designs, one compared different splint-wearing regimens, seven compared splint delivered as a single intervention with another non-surgical intervention, and five compared splint delivered alongside other non-surgical interventions with another non-surgical intervention. Only three studies reported concealing the allocation sequence, and only one reported blinding of participants. Three studies measured the primary outcome, short-term overall improvement at three months or less. One low quality study with 80 wrists found that compared to no treatment, splints worn at night more than tripled the likelihood of reporting overall improvement at the end of four weeks of treatment (RR 3.86, 95% CI 2.29 to 6.51). However, the lack of patient blinding and unclear allocation concealment suggests this result should be interpreted with caution. A very low quality quasi-randomised trial with 90 wrists found that wearing a neutral splint more than doubled the likelihood of reporting 'a lot or complete relief' at the end of two weeks of treatment compared with an extension splint (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.28). The third study which measured short-term overall improvement did not report outcome data separately per group. Nine studies measured adverse effects of splinting and all found either no or few participants reporting discomfort or swelling due to splinting; however, the precision of all RRs was very low. Differences between groups in the secondary outcomes - symptoms, function, and neurophysiologic parameters - were most commonly small with 95% CIs incorporating effects in either direction.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there is limited evidence that a splint worn at night is more effective than no treatment in the short term, but there is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of one splint design or wearing regimen over others, and of splint over other non-surgical interventions for CTS. More research is needed on the long-term effects of this intervention for CTS.

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 2: do wrist splints need to have a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures? [^114kzBn1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether wrist splints require a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures. 63 papers were found using the reported searches, of which 2 presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. It is concluded that while there is no direct evidence to answer the clinical question, the research available strongly suggests that it is reasonable to continue using standard wrist splints to immobilise patients with suspected scaphoid fractures.

### A randomized, controlled trial of removable splinting versus casting for wrist buckle fractures in children [^1141Tp23]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Wrist buckle fractures are a frequent reason for emergency department visits. Although textbooks recommend 2 to 4 weeks of immobilization in a short arm cast, management varies. Treatment with both casts and splints is common, and length of immobilization varies. The objective was to determine if children with distal radius and/or ulna buckle fractures treated with a removable splint have better physical functioning than those treated with a short arm cast for 3 weeks.

Methods

This was a randomized, controlled trial in the emergency department of an academic, tertiary care children's hospital. Participants were children 6 to 15 years of age with distal radius and/or ulna buckle fractures who were randomly assigned to treatment with a short arm cast for 3 weeks or a removable splint. Cast removal was at 3 weeks. A validated self-reported outcome tool, the Activities Scales for Kids performance version (ASKp), was used to measure physical functioning over a 4-week period. The main outcome was the ASKp score at 14 days postinjury.

Results

We randomly assigned 113 patients, and 87 were included in the final analysis: 42 in the splint group and 45 in the cast group. Study groups were similar in age, gender, bone fractured, and dominant hand injured. There were significant differences in ASKp score at day 14 and change in ASKp from baseline at days 14 and 20, indicating better functioning in the splint group. Splinted children had less difficulty with bathing throughout the entire study. There were no significant differences in pain between groups as measured by visual analog scale. There were no refractures.

Conclusions

Children treated with removable splinting have better physical functioning and less difficulty with activities than those treated with a cast.

### Treatment of distal radius fractures [^114CMoDU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of distal radius fractures in adults. None of the 29 recommendations made by the work group was graded as strong; most are graded as inconclusive or consensus; seven are graded as weak. The remaining five moderate-strength recommendations include surgical fixation, rather than cast fixation, for fractures with postreduction radial shortening > 3 mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intra-articular displacement or step-off > 2 mm; use of rigid immobilization rather than removable splints for nonsurgical treatment; making a postreduction true lateral radiograph of the carpus to assess dorsal radial ulnar joint alignment; beginning early wrist motion following stable fixation; and recommending adjuvant treatment with vitamin C to prevent disproportionate pain.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^1113nB9A]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

To date, there is currently no evidence-based medical support for the efficacy of topology-optimized splints in treating distal radius fractures.

Objective

To assess the clinical efficacy and complication rates of topology-optimized splints in the treatment of distal radius fractures after closed manual reduction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 12-week, multicenter, open-label, analyst-blinded randomized clinical trial (comprising a 6-week intervention followed by a 6-week observational phase) was carried out from December 3, 2021, to March 10, 2023, among 110 participants with distal radius fractures. Statistical analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis between June 3 and 30, 2023.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the intervention group received topology-optimized splint immobilization and the control group received cast immobilization after closed manual reduction for 6weeks. After this period, immobilization was removed, and wrist rehabilitation activities commenced.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the Gartland-Werley (G-W) wrist score at 6 weeks (where higher scores indicate more severe wrist dysfunction). Secondary outcomes encompassed radiographic parameters, visual analog scale scores, swelling degree grade, complication rates, and 3 dimensions of G-W wrist scores.

Results

A total of 110 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [12.7] years; 89 women [81%]) enrolled in the clinical trial, and complete outcome measurements were obtained for 101 patients (92%). Median G-W scores at 6 weeks were 15 (IQR, 13–18) for the splint group and 17 (IQR, 13–18) for the cast group (mean difference, -2.0 [95% CI, -3.4 to -0.6]; p = 0.03), indicating a statistically significant advantage for the splint group. At 12 weeks, no clinically significant differences in G-W scores between the 2 groups were observed. Complication rates, including shoulder-elbow pain and dysfunction and skin irritation, were less common in the splint group (shoulder-elbow pain and dysfunction: risk ratio, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.08–0.93]; p = 0.03; skin irritation: risk ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.10–0.89]; p = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings of this randomized clinical trial suggest that patients with distal radius fractures that were managed with topology-optimized splints had better wrist functional outcomes and fewer complications at 6 weeks compared with those who received casting, with no difference at week 12. Therefore, topology-optimized splints with improved performance have the potential to be an advisable approach in the management of distal radius fractures.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^112dUz3j]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The WRIST protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the institutional review board at the coordinating center and at all sites. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board appointed by the National Institutes of Health oversaw the study aims and conduct. Participants provided written informed consent. This study adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Patients with DRF who were aged 60 years or older and community-dwelling were screened for eligibility at 24 health systems located in Canada, Singapore, and the US from April 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016. Participants in the surgical (randomized) and casting (observational) groups had identical eligibility criteria: isolated fractures (concomitant ulnar styloid fracture was allowed) with displacement warranting surgical intervention (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen type A2, A3, C1, or C2 and meeting 1 of the following radiographic criteria after reduction: dorsal angulation > 10°, radial inclination < 15°, or radial shortening > 3 mm). All fractures were amenable to treatment with all 3 surgical treatments. Patients with open fractures, bilateral fractures, prior DRF to the same wrist, or additional serious trauma were ineligible. We excluded patients with neurological conditions affecting upper extremity sensation or movement, comorbid conditions prohibiting surgery, serious neurological or psychiatric conditions precluding informed consent, and inability to complete study questionnaires and follow directions in English (or Chinese in Singapore).

Participants who opted for surgery were randomized to undergo VLPS, EFP, or CRPP. Randomization was stratified by site and was performed online. The treating surgeon had discretion regarding implant or fixator brand and the use of tourniquet, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, or prophylactic antibiotics. Recognizing that there will always be patients who prefer nonsurgical management, we created an observation group to include patients who met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria but did not want to undergo surgery. Observation group participants also provided written informed consent. The fractures of these participants were managed with casting. An initial short, arm fiberglass cast was replaced with a thermoplastic splint after a month. Follow-up care and hand therapy use for both surgical and casting participants were per institutional standard.

### Cast-OFF trial: one versus 4 to 5 weeks of plaster cast immobilization for nonreduced distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical feasibility trial [^117MGQXn]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedure

In the emergency department, the treating physician explained the study and gave the patient the information letter and informed consent form. All patients were treated with a plaster splint for 1 week in slightly volar and ulnar deviation. After 1 week, all patients were seen at the hospital outpatient clinic (plaster room). Patients who were eligible for the study and gave written informed consent were included and randomized for 1 of the 2 groups: change to circular plaster cast (control group) or splint removal (intervention group). The randomization was performed by using a randomization program from the Castor database which allowed for a blind allocation of participants. All patients who participated in the study were asked baseline questions about demographic variables, pain, and use of pain medication.

For the intervention group, the splint was removed after 1 week at the outpatient clinic. Patients were offered to use an elastic tubular support bandage. After 4 to 5 weeks after injury, these patients were seen a second time at the outpatient clinic. During this visit, an examination of the wrist (range of motion and neurovascular status of the hand and wrist were examined) was performed. Additional questions were asked about the functioning of their arm, pain, use of pain medication, and return to work for the last 3 to 4 weeks.

For the control group, usual care was performed: a visit to the outpatient clinic after 1 week for a plaster cast change to a circular cast following the Dutch guidelines. After 4 to 5 weeks after injury, these patients were seen for the second time at the outpatient clinic where the plaster cast was removed. The same examinations and questions were asked as for the intervention group.

For both groups, patients were given a home exercise program after removal of the plaster cast, with additional verbal instructions about the importance of using their arm and performing the exercises at home.

Follow-up for all participants took place with questionnaires at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Questionnaires were sent to the patients via e-mail, and they were interviewed over telephone for extra follow-up questions if necessary. The study design is shown in.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^115z55uq]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Wrist-mobilization phase goals and adjuncts — The primary goal is to manage pain and edema while optimizing active and passive ROM at the wrist, in addition to the hand, elbow, and shoulder; emphasis is also given to improving wrist and hand sensibility and sensorimotor control via conscious proprioception. Submaximal isometric exercises can be used to improve pain, joint dynamic stability, and motor control, and if stiffness persists with unmet wrist ROM goals, static or dynamic mobilization splinting might be used for select individuals despite its weak evidence.

### Do patients with minimally displaced distal radial fractures need a plaster cast? [^112UAakh]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, patients with a fracture of the distal radius are treated in a cast if they do not require surgery. If the fracture requires manipulation, the cast is moulded to hold the reduction and maintain normal anatomical alignment during healing. However, is a cast necessary for patients whose fracture does not require manipulation? Removable splints are an alternative treatment option. Such splints have the advantage that they can be adjusted to improve fit around the wrist as swelling reduces, and can be removed and reapplied for the purpose of washing or, in some cases, exercise. However, evidence for their safety and effectiveness in the management of distal radius fractures is lacking. DRAFT3 is a multicentre randomized non-inferiority trial and economic analysis designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of removable splints as an alternative to casts in the treatment of distal radius fractures that do not require manipulation.

### Splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1167tghp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a compression neuropathy of the median nerve causing pain and numbness and tingling typically in the thumb, index and middle finger. It sometimes results in muscle wasting, diminished sensitivity and loss of dexterity. Splinting the wrist (with or without the hand) using an orthosis is usually offered to people with mild-to-moderate findings, but its effectiveness remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of splinting for people with CTS.

Search Methods

On 12 December 2021, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP with no limitations. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for studies.

Randomised trials were included if the effect of splinting could be isolated from other treatment modalities. The comparisons included splinting versus no active treatment (or placebo), splinting versus another disease-modifying non-surgical treatment, and comparisons of different splint-wearing regimens. We excluded studies comparing splinting with surgery or one splint design with another. We excluded participants if they had previously undergone surgical release.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed study risk of bias and the certainty in the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE approach, according to standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We included 29 trials randomising 1937 adults with CTS. The trials ranged from 21 to 234 participants, with mean ages between 42 and 60 years. The mean duration of CTS symptoms was seven weeks to five years. Eight studies with 523 hands compared splinting with no active intervention (no treatment, sham-kinesiology tape or sham-laser); 20 studies compared splinting (or splinting delivered along with another non-surgical intervention) with another non-surgical intervention; and three studies compared different splinting regimens (e.g. night-time only versus full time). Trials were generally at high risk of bias for one or more domains, including lack of blinding (all included studies) and lack of information about randomisation or allocation concealment in 23 studies. For the primary comparison, splinting compared to no active treatment, splinting may provide little or no benefits in symptoms in the short term (< 3 months). The mean Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (scale 1 to 5, higher is worse; minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 1 point) was 0.37 points better with splint (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 better to 0.08 worse; 6 studies, 306 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared with no active treatment. Removing studies with high or unclear risk of bias due to lack of randomisation or allocation concealment supported our conclusion of no important effect (mean difference (MD) 0.01 points worse with splint; 95% CI 0.20 better to 0.22 worse; 3 studies, 124 participants). In the long term (> 3 months), we are uncertain about the effect of splinting on symptoms (mean BCTQ SSS 0.64 better with splinting; 95% CI 1.2 better to 0.08 better; 2 studies, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Splinting probably does not improve hand function in the short term and may not improve hand function in the long term. In the short term, the mean BCTQ Functional Status Scale (FSS) (1 to 5, higher is worse; MCID 0.7 points) was 0.24 points better (95% CI 0.44 better to 0.03 better; 6 studies, 306 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) with splinting compared with no active treatment. In the long term, the mean BCTQ FSS was 0.25 points better (95% CI 0.68 better to 0.18 worse; 1 study, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence) with splinting compared with no active treatment. Night-time splinting may result in a higher rate of overall improvement in the short term (risk ratio (RR) 3.86, 95% CI 2.29 to 6.51; 1 study, 80 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 2, 95% CI 2 to 2; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if splinting decreases referral to surgery, RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.58; 3 studies, 243 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests that splinting may have a higher rate of adverse events, which were transient, but the 95% CIs included no effect. Seven of 40 participants (18%) reported adverse effects in the splinting group and 0 of 40 participants (0%) in the no active treatment group (RR 15.0, 95% CI 0.89 to 254.13; 1 study, 80 participants). There was low- to moderate-certainty evidence for the other comparisons: splinting may not provide additional benefits in symptoms or hand function when given together with corticosteroid injection (moderate-certainty evidence) or with rehabilitation (low-certainty evidence); nor when compared with corticosteroid (injection or oral; low certainty), exercises (low certainty), kinesiology taping (low certainty), rigid taping (low certainty), platelet-rich plasma (moderate certainty), or extracorporeal shock wave treatment (moderate certainty). Splinting for 12 weeks may not be better than six weeks, but six months of splinting may be better than six weeks of splinting in improving symptoms and function (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether splinting benefits people with CTS. Limited evidence does not exclude small improvements in CTS symptoms and hand function, but they may not be clinically important, and the clinical relevance of small differences with splinting is unclear. Low-certainty evidence suggests that people may have a greater chance of experiencing overall improvement with night-time splints than no treatment. As splinting is a relatively inexpensive intervention with no plausible long-term harms, small effects could justify its use, particularly when patients are not interested in having surgery or injections. It is unclear if a splint is optimally worn full time or at night-time only and whether long-term use is better than short-term use, but low-certainty evidence suggests that the benefits may manifest in the long term.

### Four weeks versus six weeks of immobilization in a cast following closed reduction for displaced distal radial fractures in adult patients: a multicentre randomized controlled trial [^1128AoLW]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

There is no level I evidence dealing with the optimal period of immobilization for patients with a displaced distal radial fracture following closed reduction. A shorter period might lead to a better functional outcome due to less stiffness and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this period could be safely reduced from six to four weeks.

Methods

This multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) included adult patients with a displaced distal radial fracture, who were randomized to be treated with immobilization in a cast for four or six weeks following closed reduction. The primary outcome measure was the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score after follow-up at one year. Secondary outcomes were the abbreviated version of the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score after one year, the functional outcome at six weeks, 12 weeks, and six months, range of motion (ROM), the level of pain after removal of the cast, and complications.

Results

A total of 100 patients (15 male, 85 female) were randomized, with 49 being treated with four weeks of immobilization in a cast. A total of 93 completed follow-up. The mean PRWE score after one year was 6.9 (SD 8.3) in the four-week group compared with 11.6 (SD 14.3) in the six-week group. However, this difference of -4.7 (95% confidence interval -9.29 to 0.14) was not clinically relevant as the minimal clinically important difference of 11.5 was not reached. There was no significant difference in the ROM, radiological outcome, level of pain, or complications.

Conclusion

In adult patients with a displaced and adequately reduced distal radial fracture, immobilization in a cast for four weeks is safe, and the results are similar to those after a period of immobilization of six weeks.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for treating wrist fractures in children [^112628XQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately a third of all fractures in children occur at the wrist, usually from falling onto an outstretched hand.

Objectives

We aimed to evaluate removable splintage versus plaster casts (requiring removal by a specialist) for undisplaced compression (buckle) fractures; cast length and position; and the role of surgical fixation for displaced wrist fractures in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1988), CINAHL (from 1982) and reference lists of articles. Date of last search October 2007.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing types and position of casts and the use of surgical fixation for distal radius fractures in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed trial selection. All three authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data.

Main Results

The 10 included trials, involving 827 children, were of variable quality. Four trials compared removable splintage versus the traditional below-elbow cast in children with buckle fractures. There was no short-term deformity recorded in all four trials and, in one trial, no refracture at six months. The Futura splint was cheaper to use; a removable plaster splint was less restrictive to wear enabling more children to bathe and participate in other activities, and the option preferred by children and parents; the soft bandage was more comfortable, convenient and less painful to wear; home-removable plaster casts removed by parents did not result in significant differences in outcome but were strongly favoured by parents. Two trials found below-elbow versus above-elbow casts did not increase redisplacement of reduced fractures or cast-related complications, were less restrictive during use and avoided elbow stiffness. One trial evaluating the effect of arm position in above-elbow casts found no effect on deformity. Three trials found that percutaneous wiring significantly reduced redisplacement and remanipulation but one of these found no advantage in function at three months.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supports the use of removable splintage for buckle fractures and challenges the traditional use of above-elbow casts after reduction of displaced fractures. Although percutaneous wire fixation prevents redisplacement, the effects on longer term outcomes including function are not established. Further research is warranted on the optimum approach, including splintage, for buckle fractures; and on the use of below-elbow casts and indications for surgery for displaced wrist fractures in children.

### Post-splinting radiographs of minimally displaced fractures: good medicine or medicolegal protection? [^112WFuPB]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many institutions perform radiographic documentation following splint application even when no manipulation had been performed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of post-splinting radiographs of acute non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures that did not undergo manipulation. Our hypothesis was that post-splinting radiographs do not demonstrate changes in fracture alignment or impact the management of the patient.

Methods

After institutional review board exemption had been granted, consultations performed by orthopaedic residents at a level-I trauma center from September 2008 to April 2010 were reviewed. Of 2862 consultations, 1321 involved acute fractures that were splinted. Radiographs revealed that 342 (25.9%) of the fractures were non-displaced or minimally displaced and angulated (defined as < 5 mm and < 10°, respectively) and 204 of them had been assessed with radiographs after splinting. Consults were reviewed to ensure that the patients had not undergone manipulation prior to or during splinting. Consult notes and radiographs obtained in the emergency room (ER), as well as follow-up radiographs, were reviewed to assess ultimate outcome.

Results

None of the 204 fractures (134 non-displaced and seventy minimally displaced) changed alignment following splinting. Two splints were reapplied, and the fractures sites were reimaged for undocumented reasons. Patients were subjected to an average of ten radiographs (range, four to twenty-five radiographs) of their extremities in the acute setting. On average, three post-splinting radiographs (range, one to ten radiographs) were obtained. The mean time between the initial and post-splinting radiographs was three hours and thirty minutes (range, nine minutes to twenty-four hours). The most common injury was a fracture about the hand or wrist. The 122 patients with that type of injury waited an average of almost three hours for an average of three post-splinting radiographs, contributing to a total of nine radiographs performed acutely. ER visits tended to be longer for patients with post-splinting radiographs compared with those without them (p = 0.06). Follow-up radiographs were available for eighty-two patients. All fractures demonstrated maintained alignment.

Conclusions

Post-splinting radiographs of non-displaced and minimally displaced fractures that do not undergo manipulation before or during immobilization are associated with longer ER waits, additional radiation exposure, and increased health-care costs without providing helpful information. While certain circumstances call for additional imaging, routine performance of post-splinting radiography of non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures should be discouraged.

### Consensus on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline for de quervain disease: results from the European HANDGUIDE study [^114iDqK7]. Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, more specifically with respect to splinting, HANDGUIDE 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering splinting (long lower arm-based splint incorporating the wrist) for 3–8 weeks to decrease the amount of mechanical friction of the painful tendons (abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis) in order to reduce the symptoms of de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

### Does immobilization of distal radius torus fractures affect treatment outcome? [^114CniNA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical results of splint, short arm circular plaster, and soft bandage immobilization methods applied in the treatment of wrist torus fractures in a single center.

Methods

Patients treated for torus fractures at a tertiary trauma hospital between January 2018 and January 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. According to the physician's preference, a splint, short arm circular plaster, or soft bandage was applied to each patient. The treatment modalities, the number of hospital admissions during the treatment, the number of radiological imaging procedures used during the treatment, immobilization time, and the follow-up periods of the patients were checked and noted on the hospital data processing system.

Results

Six hundred ten patients were included in the study. It was determined that 351 patients were treated with a short arm splint, 155 with a short arm circular cast, and 104 with soft bandaging. The number of radiological imaging procedures, the number of hospital admissions during the treatment, the duration of the pain complaint, and the complication rate of the patients treated with splint were significantly lower than the groups treated with short arm circular plaster and soft bandage (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

It was observed that patients who were immobilized with a short arm splint required less follow-up time and fewer imaging procedures and hospital admissions and experienced earlier pain relief and lower complication rates. We think that the use of short arm splints in the treatment of torus fractures is sufficient, safe, and advantageous.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^112thEUH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common fracture injuries in emergency trauma departments, accounting for approximately 20% of all emergency fractures and 75% of forearm fractures. Predominantly resulting from indirect injuries such as falls, sports accidents, or traffic accidents, DRFs affect both young individuals and those older than 65 years. Younger patients typically experience high-energy injuries, whereas older adults experience low-energy incidents. The population of older adults in China is projected to exceed 200 million by 2025. Osteoporotic fractures, with DRFs being prominent among older adults, are becoming a major public health concern.

Treatments for DRFs comprise surgical and conservative approaches. Several trials have shown that surgical treatment effectively achieves anatomical reduction and improves early mobility and quality of life vs conservative treatment. However, follow-up studies found no significant differences in pain or functional improvement between these approaches, sparking debate on the best strategy. British guidelines recommend closed reduction and cast immobilization as primary treatments. However, drawbacks of the conventional cast, such as bulkiness, have spurred treatment innovations. The rise of 3-dimensional (3D) printing in orthopedics has led to bespoke splints with superior clinical efficacy, lightweight design, and better ventilation. These splints could reduce patient pain, lessen risks of joint stiffness, and hasten wrist recovery.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^114mMEkt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) interventions — initial protection and timing of mobilization are outlined as follows: nonoperatively managed individuals with DRF are typically immobilized in a cast for 4 to 6 weeks before they initiate wrist mobilization exercises; following DRF surgery (ie, open reduction internal fixation, external fixation, or percutaneous pinning), the early protective immobilization period is variable (ie, a few days to several weeks) depending on fracture healing and stability, as well as surgeon's preference; timing for initiating wrist exercises after surgery is not universally agreed upon and typically starts when the physician verifies that a satisfactory healing level has been attained via radiographic evidence and exercise loading can be safely imposed across the fracture site; once proper healing has occurred, 3 rehabilitation approaches have been proposed: SupT with advice for an iHEP, an iHEP alone, or no therapy.

### Redisplacement of reduced distal radius fractures in adults: does the type of casting play a role? The CAST study, a multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial [^116JVsRP]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

It is not clear which type of casting provides the best initial treatment in adults with a distal radial fracture. Given that between 32% and 64% of adequately reduced fractures redisplace during immobilization in a cast, preventing redisplacement and a disabling malunion or secondary surgery is an aim of treatment. In this study, we investigated whether circumferential casting leads to fewer the redisplacement of fewer fractures and better one-year outcomes compared with plaster splinting.

Methods

In a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, two-period cluster-randomized superiority trial, we compared these two types of casting. Recruitment took place in ten hospitals. Eligible patients aged ≥ 18 years with a displaced distal radial fracture, which was acceptably aligned after closed reduction, were included. The primary outcome measure was the rate of redisplacement within five weeks of immobilization. Secondary outcomes were the rate of complaints relating to the cast, clinical outcomes at three months, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) (using the numerical rating scale (NRS), the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), and Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) scores), and adverse events such as the development of compartment syndrome during one year of follow-up. We used multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression for the analysis of the primary outcome measure.

Results

The study included 420 patients. There was no significant difference between the rate of redisplacement of the fracture between the groups: 47% (n = 88) for those treated with a plaster splint and 49% (n = 90) for those treated with a circumferential cast (odds ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.70); p = 0.854). Patients treated in a plaster splint reported significantly more pain than those treated with a circumferential cast, during the first week of treatment (estimated mean NRS 4.7 (95% CI 4.3 to 5.1) vs 4.1 (95% CI 3.7 to 4.4); p = 0.014). The rate of complaints relating to the cast, clinical outcomes and PROMs did not differ significantly between the groups (p > 0.05). Compartment syndrome did not occur.

Conclusion

Circumferential casting did not result in a significantly different rate of redisplacement of the fracture compared with the use of a plaster splint. There were comparable outcomes in both groups.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^113jEjeU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. First, both the surgeon and CRCs were exposed to treatment groups, eliminating blinding. Second, we excluded C3 fractures (AO/OTA classification), deeming them unsuitable for nonsurgical treatment, which limits the generalizability of our results. Third, while we excluded patients with certain chronic conditions, we acknowledge the potential benefits of nonoperative treatments. Future studies may focus on the specific patient population to explore the efficacy and safety of nonoperative methods in managing DRFs. Furthermore, the follow-up period in our study extended to 12 weeks, which may not have been sufficient to observe long-term results. We plan to continue tracking patient outcomes over an extended period to evaluate treatment efficacy and identify any long-term disparities more effectively. Fourth, the sample size was a study constraint.

### Postoperative immobilization of scaphoid fractures: a comprehensive review of the literature [^117MpXao]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

The optimal protocol for postoperative immobilization following operative treatment of scaphoid fractures remains controversial. Reports of successful management with brief postoperative immobilization suggest that earlier restoration of function may be achieved by limiting the duration of immobilization. However, the risk of nonunion and its associated complications suggest that a more conservative approach with extended immobilization could optimize fracture healing. This paper presents a thorough review of the relevant literature and summarizes the myriad postoperative immobilization protocols and their reported outcomes. Postoperative immobilization protocols and reported outcomes for displaced, comminuted, and proximal pole fractures are discussed separately. The literature is reviewed following different operative techniques, including open reduction internal fixation and percutaneous screw fixation. Vigilant postoperative care of scaphoid fractures managed surgically is warranted to monitor for signs of nonunion while attempting to regain motion and strength to the injured wrist.

Limited evidence supports the use of removable splintage for buckle fractures and challenges the traditional use of above-elbow casts after reduction of displaced fractures. Although percutaneous wire fixation prevents redisplacement, the effects on longer term outcomes including function are not established. Further research is warranted on the optimum approach, including splintage, for buckle fractures; and on the use of below-elbow casts and indications for surgery for displaced wrist fractures in children.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^111ZgVAa]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Distal radius fracture (DRF) rehabilitation phases — For either nonoperative or operative DRF cases, most individuals are first managed with an early protective mobilization phase, then progress into a wrist-mobilization phase, before they initiate the final strengthening phase, which extends until they are discharged from therapy and transition to an independent home exercise program (IHEP); during the early protective mobilization phase the wrist is fully immobilized in a cast or a splint with any wrist ROM being contraindicated, while self-directed active or passive ROM at the digits and other proximal joints is advised, and an edema compression glove may be advisable for select individuals with persistent edema.

### A prospective, randomized trial of mobilization protocols following ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition [^113KoHFh]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that an increased duration of immobilization following trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) leads to improved patient-reported outcomes compared with an early mobilization protocol.

Methods

At 2 institutions, we prospectively randomized 223 patients (238 thumbs) undergoing LRTI to receive 1 of 2 postoperative rehabilitation protocols. The immobilization protocol consisted of use of a postoperative forearm-based thumb-spica splint for 7 days followed by a forearm-based thumb-spica cast for 5 weeks and then by a custom forearm-based thermoplastic thumb-spica splint for an additional 6 weeks. An active range of motion (ROM) was started 6 weeks postoperatively. The early mobilization protocol consisted of the same postoperative splint for 7 days followed by use of a forearm-based thermoplastic thumb-spica splint for 3 weeks and then by a hand-based thumb-spica splint for 4 weeks. An active ROM was started 4 weeks postoperatively. The outcome measures included the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire; pinch and grip strength; 9-hole peg test (NHP); visual analog scale (VAS) for pain; VAS for patient satisfaction; and wrist and thumb ROM. These were measured preoperatively and at 6, 12, 26, 52, and 104 weeks postoperatively. Differences in continuous and categorical variables were assessed with use of Tukey multiple comparisons following 1-way analysis of variance and Fisher exact tests, respectively.

Results

A minimum follow-up of 1 year (mean, 1.7 years) was achieved for 71% (169) of the 238 randomized thumbs (157 of the 223 patients): 74 patients (80 thumbs) treated with the immobilization protocol and 83 patients (89 thumbs) treated with the early mobilization protocol. DASH scores, VAS pain scores, VAS patient satisfaction scores, and strength all improved similarly with no significant differences between groups at any time point. Wrist and thumb ROM and NHP outcomes were significantly worse for the immobilization group at 6 weeks postoperatively, with no differences observed between groups at 12 weeks and beyond.

Conclusions

A conservative immobilization protocol does not improve functional outcomes, satisfaction, strength, or ROM following LRTI compared with an early mobilization protocol.

### Minimalistic approach to treating wrist torus fractures [^111kdoys]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2005). Low credibility.

Thirty-three patients with unilateral wrist torus fractures were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were all treated with a removable plaster-of-Paris volar forearm splint and a symptom-based splinting protocol. This protocol emphasized the parents and patients deciding when to wean from the splint as their symptoms improved. Patients were followed about 4 weeks after fracture, and initial and follow-up radiographs were compared for any changes in fracture angulation. All of the fractures healed without significant clinical change in angulation or complications. The authors propose the following treatment protocol: radiographic diagnosis and application of the removable splint in the emergency department, and one orthopaedic office/clinic visit to confirm the diagnosis and provide splinting instructions. The elimination of the additional orthopaedic visit for repeat radiographs and cast removal reduces the family's time lost from school and work and the physician's time and costs.

### Interventions for treating wrist fractures in children [^111qCVwJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Wrist fractures, involving the distal radius, are the most common fractures in children. Most are buckle fractures, which are stable fractures, unlike greenstick and other usually displaced fractures. There is considerable variation in practice, such as the extent of immobilisation for buckle fractures and use of surgery for seriously displaced fractures.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of interventions for common distal radius fractures in children, including skeletally immature adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries and reference lists to May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating distal radius fractures in children. We sought data on physical function, treatment failure, adverse events, time to return to normal activities (recovery time), wrist pain, and child (and parent) satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently performed study screening and selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We pooled data where appropriate and used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Of the 30 included studies, 21 were RCTs, seven were quasi-RCTs and two did not describe their randomisation method. Overall, 2930 children were recruited. Typically, trials included more male children and reported mean ages between 8 and 10 years. Eight studies recruited buckle fractures, five recruited buckle and other stable fractures, three recruited minimally displaced fractures and 14 recruited displaced fractures, typically requiring closed reduction, typically requiring closed reduction. All studies were at high risk of bias, mainly reflecting lack of blinding. The studies made 14 comparisons. Below we consider five prespecified comparisons:Removable splint versus below-elbow cast for predominantly buckle fractures (6 studies, 695 children)One study (66 children) reported similar Modified Activities Scale for Kids - Performance scores (0 to 100; no disability) at four weeks (median scores: splint 99.04; cast 99.11); low-quality evidence. Thirteen children needed a change or reapplication of device (splint 5/225; cast 8/219; 4 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (87 children) reported no refractures at six months. One study (50 children) found no between-group difference in pain during treatment; very low-quality evidence. Evidence was absent (recovery time), insufficient (children with minor complications) or contradictory (child or parent satisfaction). Two studies estimated lower healthcare costs for removable splints. Soft or elasticated bandage versus below-elbow cast for buckle or similar fractures (4 studies, 273 children)One study (53 children) reported more children had no or only limited disability at four weeks in the bandage group; very low-quality evidence. Eight children changed device or extended immobilisation for delayed union (bandage 5/90; cast 3/91; 3 studies); very low-quality evidence. Two studies (139 children) reported no serious adverse events at four weeks. Evidence was absent, insufficient or contradictory for recovery time, wrist pain, children with minor complications, and child and parent satisfaction. More bandage-group participants found their treatment convenient (39 children). Removal of casts at home by parents versus at the hospital fracture clinic by clinicians (2 studies, 404 children, mainly buckle fractures)One study (233 children) found full restoration of physical function at four weeks; low-quality evidence. There were five treatment changes (home 4/197; hospital 1/200; 2 studies; very low-quality evidence). One study found no serious adverse effects at six months (288 children). Recovery time and number of children with minor complications were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in pain at four weeks (233 children); low-quality evidence. One study (80 children) found greater parental satisfaction in the home group; low-quality evidence. One UK study found lower healthcare costs for home removal. Below-elbow versus above-elbow casts for displaced or unstable both-bone fractures (4 studies, 399 children)Short-term physical function data were unavailable but very low-quality evidence indicated less dependency when using below-elbow casts. One study (66 children with minimally displaced both-bone fractures) found little difference in ABILHAND-Kids scores (0 to 42; no problems) (mean scores: below-elbow 40.7; above-elbow 41.8); very low-quality evidence. Overall treatment failure data are unavailable, but nine of the 11 remanipulations or secondary reductions (366 children, 4 studies) were in the above-elbow group; very low-quality evidence. There was no refracture or compartment syndrome at six months (215 children; 2 studies). Recovery time and overall numbers of children with minor complications were not reported. There was little difference in requiring physiotherapy for stiffness (179 children, 2 studies); very low-quality evidence. One study (85 children) found less pain at one week for below-elbow casts; low-quality evidence. One study found treatment with an above-elbow cast cost three times more in Nepal. Surgical fixation with percutaneous wiring and cast immobilisation versus cast immobilisation alone after closed reduction of displaced fractures (5 studies, 323 children)Where reported, above-elbow casts were used. Short-term functional outcome data were unavailable. One study (123 children) reported similar ABILHAND-Kids scores indicating normal physical function at six months (mean scores: surgery 41.9; cast only 41.4); low-quality evidence. There were fewer treatment failures, defined as early or problematic removal of wires or remanipulation for early loss in position, after surgery (surgery 20/124; cast only 41/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, there were fewer serious advents after surgery (surgery 28/124; cast only 43/129; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence). Recovery time, wrist pain, and satisfaction were not reported. There was lower referral for physiotherapy for stiffness after surgery (1 study); very low-quality evidence. One USA study found similar treatment costs in both groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Where available, the quality of the RCT-based evidence on interventions for treating wrist fractures in children is low or very low. However, there is reassuring evidence of a full return to previous function with no serious adverse events, including refracture, for correctly-diagnosed buckle fractures, whatever the treatment used. The review findings are consistent with the move away from cast immobilisation for these injuries. High-quality evidence is needed to address key treatment uncertainties; notably, some priority topics are already being tested in ongoing multicentre trials, such as FORCE.

### Splinting the hand in the functional position after brain impairment: a randomized, controlled trial [^114HPXZi]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of 4 weeks of hand splinting on the length of finger and wrist flexor muscles, hand function, and pain in people with acquired brain impairment.

Design

Randomized, assessor-blinded trial.

Setting

Rehabilitation center in Australia.

Participants

Twenty-eight adults with acquired brain impairment, all within 6 months of the first injury. There was 1 withdrawal.

Interventions

Subjects in both experimental (n = 17) and control (n = 11) groups participated in routine therapy-motor training for upper-limb use and upper-limb stretches-5 days a week. The experimental group also wore an immobilizing hand splint in the functional position (10 degrees -30 degrees wrist extension) for a maximum of 12 hours each night for the duration of the 4-week intervention period.

Main Outcome Measures

The length of the wrist and extrinsic finger flexor muscles was evaluated by measuring the torque-controlled range of wrist extension with the fingers extended. Functional hand use was evaluated with the Motor Assessment Scale. Pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale.

Results

The effects of splinting were statistically nonsignificant and clinically unimportant. At follow-up, estimates of treatment effects slightly favored the control group: range of motion at the wrist favored controls by 2 degrees (95% confidence interval, -7.2 degrees to 3.2 degrees), function favored controls by 0.2 points (95% CI, -2.7 to 2.3), and pain favored the experimental group by 1cm (95% CI, -4.6 to 2.2).

Conclusions

An overnight splint-wearing regimen with the affected hand in the functional position does not produce clinically beneficial effects in adults with acquired brain impairment.

Complications

Table 4 provides an overview of the adverse events reported by both groups. These events encompassed arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, tension blister, and finger dysfunction. However, there was no statistically significant difference observed between the groups in relation to these complications. The splint group exhibited a lower occurrence of shoulder-elbow pain and dysfunction (risk ratio, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.08–0.93]; p = 0.03) as well as skin irritation (risk ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.10–0.89]; p = 0.02) compared with the cast group.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, most patients saw positive outcomes, effective treatment, reduced disability, and enhanced functional activity, leading to an elevated quality of life. At 6 weeks, G-W scores were more favorable among the splint group than the cast group. Participants who received topology-optimized splints reported better ability and satisfaction with daily living, but by 3 months, any differences had disappeared and all participants showed satisfactory results. Topology-optimized splints demonstrated advantages in alleviating wrist pain, enhancing functional activity, and boosting patient comfort in early period. Although both groups exhibited some fracture displacement after closed reduction, it may have been due to the limitations of external immobilization methods. Similar results have been demonstrated by other researchers. For displaced fractures, palmar plate fixation has been found to provide better stability and radiologic results compared with cast immobilization for DRFs. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be addressed with current conservative treatment. However, recent studieshave introduced a new angle, suggesting that for older patients with DRFs, functional outcomes are not significantly correlated with the radiographic measures of reduction. This insight highlights that factors beyond exact wrist anatomical alignment play a role in realizing satisfactory outcomes. It broadens our approach to treatment strategies and emphasizes the importance of focusing on overall patient functionality and quality of life. The splint group outperformed the cast group in reducing VAS scores at 2 and 6 weeks, as well as in reducing wrist swelling at 2 weeks. Rehabilitation showed improvement in complications such as intra-articular fracture–induced arthritis. The cast group reported more shoulder-elbow complications, which could be attributed to adverse shoulder-elbow motion after cast immobilization, resulting in joint adhesion, pain, and dysfunction. Complications were less common among the splint group. In addition, the cast group experienced more skin irritation symptoms, possibly due to the lack of ventilation provided by the cast. In contrast, the ventilated structure of the splint led to fewer such symptoms among the splint group.

Item 5. The interventions for each group with sufficient details to allow replication, including how and when they were actually administered

Examples — "In POISE, patients received the first dose of the study drug (ie, oral extended-release metoprolol 100 mg or matching placebo) 2–4 h before surgery. Study drug administration required a heart rate of 50 bpm or more and a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or greater; these haemodynamics were checked before each administration. If, at any time during the first 6 h after surgery, heart rate was 80 bpm or more and systolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or higher, patients received their first postoperative dose (extended-release metoprolol 100 mg or matched placebo) orally. If the study drug was not given during the first 6 h, patients received their first postoperative dose at 6 h after surgery. 12 h after the first postoperative dose, patients started taking oral extended-release metoprolol 200 mg or placebo every day for 30 days. If a patient's heart rate was consistently below 45 bpm or their systolic blood pressure dropped below 100 mm Hg, study drug was withheld until their heart rate or systolic blood pressure recovered; the study drug was then restarted at 100 mg once daily. Patients whose heart rate was consistently 45–49 bpm and systolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg delayed taking the study drug for 12 h".

"Patients were randomly assigned to receive a custom-made neoprene splint to be worn at night or to usual care. The splint was a rigid rest orthosis recommended for use only at night. It covered the base of the thumb and the thenar eminence but not the wrist (Figure 1). Splints were made by 3 trained occupational therapists, who adjusted the splint for each patient so that the first web could be opened and the thumb placed in opposition with the first long finger. Patients were encouraged to contact the occupational therapist if they felt that the splint needed adjustment, pain increased while wearing the splint, or they had adverse effects (such as skin erosion). Because no treatment can be considered the gold standard in this situation, patients in the control and intervention groups received usual care at the discretion of their physician (general practitioner or rheumatologist). We decided not to use a placebo because, to our knowledge, no placebo for splinting has achieved successful blinding of patients, as recommended".

Postoperative accelerated versus delayed wrist therapy initiation after volar plating — randomized protocols and timing: A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the 9 included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared early therapy initiation at ≤ 3 weeks of immobilization to a traditional approach with therapy initiation at ≥ 4 weeks of immobilization. Examples include Watson et al (N = 133; 64% female; mean age, 52 years) comparing initiation at 1, 3, and 6 weeks; Quadlbauer et al (N = 28; 86% female; mean age, 54 years) comparing initiation within the first week versus after 5 weeks of cast immobilization; Iozzo-Calderon et al (N = 60; 65% female; mean age, 53 years) comparing 8 days versus 6 weeks; Brehmer et al (N = 81; 73% female; mean age, 52.5 years) initiating early wrist passive range of motion (PROM) and light strengthening at 2 weeks versus delaying these until 6 weeks, with both groups supervised for up to 12 weeks; Clementsen et al (N = 119; 90% female; mean age, 55 years) comparing 3 days versus 2 weeks; Sorensen et al (N = 95; mean age, 67 years) comparing 1 day versus 2 weeks; Dennison et al (N = 33; 94% female; mean age, 54 years) comparing 2 versus 5 weeks; and Zeckey et al (N = 50; 94% female; mean age, 81 years) comparing initiation immediately after surgery versus at 4 weeks, both using an orthosis for 4 weeks.

### Early versus late motion following volar plating of distal radius fractures [^116wyhCy]. Hand (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Distal radius fractures are common, and the trend in fixation has included the use of locked volar plating. The duration of splinting required after surgery and the effect splinting has upon outcome of the wrist are not clear. Our aim was to compare outcome of patients treated with early versus late motion protocol after volar plating. Methods: Thirty-three patients with distal radius fractures were prospectively and randomly enrolled into an early versus late motion study including volar plating of the distal radius fracture. Early motion included an active and passive wrist motion protocol by 14 days after surgery and delayed motion was initiated at 5 weeks. Fractures were defined as intra-articular and extra-articular, and those with, and without, ulnar styloid fracture. Motion and outcome scores (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH]/patient-rated wrist evaluation [PRWE]), and strength were measured through 1 year. Results: Wrist motion, DASH, and PRWE scores were only significantly different at 6 weeks with no significant differences at any later time points up to 1 year. One patient had complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and one had adhesive capsulitis in the late motion group. Conclusions: Following locked volar plating of distal radius fractures, early motion favored earlier return of motion along with lower DASH, PRWE, and pain scores within first 6 weeks. Although the late motion group had delayed recovery, there were no long-term significant differences in motion, strength, outcome, or pain scores. The 2 cases with complications (CRPS and adhesive capsulitis) did occur in the late motion group and may implicate late motion with these problems.

### Factors that influence the duration of splint wear in peripheral nerve lesions [^114gGtQu]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the weekly frequency and overall duration of wear for splints used to treat peripheral nerve lesions and factors that possibly influence splint wear.

Design

A total of 78 patients (23 women, 55 men) who had been treated with a hand splint for peripheral nerve palsy were interviewed by telephone, based on a preformulated questionnaire. The duration of wear, reasons for terminating use, the effect of the splint, the patients' assessment of splint treatment, the patients' instruction, and the patients' level of education were recorded. Survival analysis for the entire period of wear and logistic regressions to determine factors that influence splint wear were performed. Comparison of effect scores between lesions in the dominant those in the nondominant hand were carried out with a test.

Results

The median duration of wear was 6 mo for daytime and 4 mo for nighttime splints. Daytime splints were worn by 85% and nighttime splints by 84% of patients for 5–7 days per week. The reported effect of the splint was the only significant factor that influenced the frequency of wear. The splint was reported to be significantly more effective in the dominant hand than in the nondominant hand. Numerically, radial nerve lesions and cock-up wrist splints were most common.

Conclusion

Regular splint wear was registered in the majority of patients and was positively influenced by a good effect of the splint, which was reported to be better in the dominant hand.

### Splints / orthoses in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^116nZLJs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Splints/orthoses are often recommended to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to decrease pain, decrease swelling and/or prevent deformity. These orthoses include resting hand splints, wrist supports, finger splints and special shoes and shoe inserts.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of splints/orthoses in relieving pain, decreasing swelling and/or preventing deformity and determine the impact of splints/orthoses on strength, mobility and function in people with RA.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the PEDro data base and Current Contents up to January 2002, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to Issue 4, 2001 using the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Unpublished studies were sought by hand searching conference proceeding and contacting key experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomized control trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs), case-control and cohort studies comparing the use of specific orthoses against placebo, another active intervention (including another type of orthoses) or regular treatment were selected, according to an a priori protocol.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected the studies and abstracted data. The methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs was assessed using a validated scale.

Main Results

Twelve papers reporting on 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies dealt with the following: working wrist splints (5), resting hand and wrist splints (2), special shoes and insoles (3). There is evidence that wearing working wrist splints statistically significantly decreases grip strength and does not affect pain, morning stiffness, pinch grip, quality of life after up to 6 months of regular wear. We found no evidence that resting wrist and hand splints change pain, grip strength, Ritchie Index or number of swollen joints. However, patients who wore these splints for 2 months reported that they preferred use to non-use and padded resting splints to unpadded ones. The one study of special shoes provided evidence of significant benefits of wearing extra-depth shoes for 2 months including less pain on walking and stair climbing and more minutes pain free walking time. Extra-depth shoes with semi-rigid insoles provided better pain relief than extra-depth shoes alone when worn over 12 weeks. Posted insoles prevented progression of hallux valgus angle but did not affect pain or function.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions about the effectiveness of working wrist splints in decreasing pain or increasing function for people with RA. Potential adverse effects such as decreased range of motion do not seem to be an issue, although some of these splints decrease grip strength and dexterity. Similarly, preliminary evidence suggests that resting hand and wrist splints do not seem to affect range of motion or pain, although patients preferred wearing a resting splint to not wearing one. There is evidence that extra-depth shoes and molded insoles decreases pain on weight-bearing activities such as standing, walking and stair-climbing. Posted insoles may be effective in preventing progression of hallux abductus angle but do not appear to have an impact on pain.

Defining the strength of the recommendations — judging the strength of evidence is only a steppingstone towards arriving at the strength of a systematic literature review recommendation. The strength of recommendation also takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment's effect, and whether there is data on critical outcomes. The recommendations and their strength were voted on by the guideline development group members during the final meeting, and recommendations were approved and adopted in instances where a simple majority (60%) of the guideline development group voted to approve.

### The impact of wrist fracture, surgical repair and immobilization on patients: a qualitative study [^112K3h8j]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate patients' experience following wrist fracture, surgical repair and immobilization.

Design

A qualitative investigation involving individual participant interviews.

Setting

A metropolitan trauma service.

Subjects

In all, 31 participants were consecutively recruited from three groups within a randomized controlled trial comparing immobilization for one (n = 11), three (n = 10) or six weeks (n = 10) following surgical treatment for wrist fracture.

Intervention

Individual interviews were conducted within three months of cast removal. Questions prompted discussion of the experience of fracture, surgery and immobilization. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim. At least two independent researchers performed coding and theming following principles of thematic analysis.

Results

Two themes were identified: (1) impact of the injury varies widely and (2) health care consumers want trustworthy dialogue. Participant reports indicated that recovery from wrist fracture, surgery and immobilization is challenging with significant changes to social role and increased dependence. For many, lack of empathy from health professionals and limited acknowledgement of the personal impact of injury led to dissatisfaction. Health professionals did not consistently tailor communication or adopt strategies to address specific needs for pain management, education and support requirements. There was no evidence that processes were implemented to enhance participant recall and comprehension. Most participants experienced their cast as a barrier to function. However, within the group of participants immobilized for one week, a number felt the cast was removed too soon.

Conclusion

Participant reports indicate that recovery from surgically repaired wrist fracture is challenging. Opportunities exist to refine care in pain management, education and active engagement of patients in their care.

### Distal radius fracture rehabilitation [^113DB7gj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Interventions — therapy initiation timing — Clinicians should initiate early therapy that consists of hand, wrist, and shoulder active range of motion (AROM) exercises along with light daily activity within the first 3 weeks after a surgically repaired DRF to improve short-term (up to 3 months) outcomes for pain, ROM, grip strength, and function, and long-term (> 6 months) outcomes for wrist AROM and grip strength, and clinicians should initiate submaximal progressive strengthening, such as towel and putty squeezing and light-load gripping exercises at 2 weeks following a surgically repaired DRF or during the second week of cast immobilization (only the uncomplicated individuals with stable DRF, satisfactory radius-ulna articular alignment, and no ulnar-sided pain) to improve short-term (up to 6 months) outcomes for pain, wrist AROM, grip strength, and functional capacity with negligible risk of compromising proper fracture healing.

### Conservative interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^114dwRAs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem particularly in elderly white women with osteoporosis.

Objectives

To determine the most appropriate conservative treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (November 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 3), CINAHL (1982 to December week 4 2002), the National Research Register (up to Issue 4, 2002), PEDro, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared commonly applied conservative interventions for fracture fixation. These included the application of an external support (plaster cast or brace) and fracture manipulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials, judged as fitting the selection criteria by both reviewers, were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical, including complications, outcomes. The trials were grouped into categories relating to manipulation of displaced fractures; use and extent, including forearm position, of immobilisation; use of braces; different casting materials and techniques; and duration of immobilisation. Although quantitative data from some trials are presented, the lack of good quality trials and trial heterogeneity inhibited pooling of results.

Main Results

Three trials were newly included in this update. In all, there are 36 trials, involving a total of 4114 mainly female and older patients, meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Comprehensive details of the individual trials are provided in tabular form, and their results, grouped as indicated above, have been presented in text and analyses tables. The poor quality and heterogeneity in terms of patient characteristics, interventions compared and outcome measurement, of the included trials meant that no meta-analyses were undertaken.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There remains insufficient evidence from randomised trials to determine which methods of conservative treatment are the most appropriate for the more common types of distal radial fractures in adults. Therefore, at present, practitioners applying conservative management should use an accepted technique with which they are familiar, and which is cost-effective from the perspective of their provider unit. Patient preferences and circumstances, and the risk of complications should also be considered. Prioritising research questions to clarify the most appropriate conservative treatment for this common fracture is warranted. Researchers should differentiate between extra-articular and intra-articular, and non-displaced and displaced fractures, ascertain patient preferences, and agree a core outcome data set.

### Outcome of follow-up computed tomography of suspected occult scaphoid fracture after normal radiography [^112Qx4sS]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI is usually advocated as the follow-up imaging of choice due to its high sensitivity. However, treatment of purely trabecular fractures at MRI may be unnecessary and potentially harmful, with possible complications arising from immobilization in cast. Differentiation between bone marrow edema and a true fracture with potential for displacement is difficult with different studies having applied different definitions. A purely trabecular fracture without cortical fracture should not be regarded as a potentially unstable fracture, nor should an avulsion fracture of the scaphoid tubercle. Since the exact distinction between trabecular and cortical fractures at MRI has not been made, it would be unethical to perform a scientific study where scaphoid fractures at MRI are randomized to treatment with a cast for at least six weeks or to symptomatic treatment. The current study tries to address this predicament by using the approach that purely trabecular fractures at MRI would not show up at CT and were thus not treated more than symptomatically in the current study. None of these supposed cases showed progression into a displaced scaphoid fracture. However, since 124 of 157 patients wore a cast in the period preceding CT, and 48 patients were immobilized for a certain time after CT with a plaster cast or removable splint, it is not inconceivable that patients with non-displaced scaphoid fractures that had been occult on CT were included in this group. This treatment group also includes patients with other wrist or carpal bone fractures, patients with presumed ligamentous injuries, and patients receiving treatment for residual wrist pain. The combination of modern treatment, including wrist immobilization for pain until follow-up imaging and modern high-quality CT, thus seems adequate for diagnosis and treatment of suspected occult scaphoid fracture. During recent years, CBCT has come to be employed for primary diagnosis of scaphoid fracture in many institutions, showing high sensitivity for scaphoid fracture at a lower radiation dose than imaging with a whole-body CT scanner, and having a higher spatial resolution. However, the number of suitable patients needs to be large enough to motivate the purchase of a specialized extremity CT.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^112hF3JL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed between June 3 and 30, 2023. The sample size was calculated using PASS software, version 11 (NCSS), with reference to a previous randomized clinical trial (n = 94)that compared splint and cast treatments for DRFs. The findings revealed that after 3 months, the splint group had an rate of 96% on the G-W score, while the cast group had a rate of 77%. Assuming a 19% difference in G-W score between the 2 groups, with a 2-sided 5% probability of type I error and 80% power, the sample size was determined to be 100 patients (50 per group). Considering a potential dropout rate of 10%, a total of 110 patients were ultimately required for enrollment.

Data analysis was consistent with the principle of intention-to-treat, with data incorporated from all enrolled participants. To address the issue of missing data, we used multiple imputation methods to estimate both primary and secondary outcomes for all follow-up periods. Considering the nonmonotonic nature of the missing data, we used the fully conditional specification method within the canonical multiple imputation framework. Continuous data that followed a normal distribution were presented as mean (SD), while data that did not follow a normal distribution were presented as median (IQR). Disaggregated data were expressed as a percentage. Comparisons between the groups used the t test or the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and the χ² test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. For repeatedly measured data, a linear mixture model was used for statistical analysis, with participants as random effects, and time and group as fixed effects. Multiple comparisons of repeatedly measured data were Bonferroni corrected. Complications were analyzed by calculating the risk ratios and 95% CIs. All tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS software, version 24.0 (IBM Corp), was used for all statistical analyses.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for distal radius fracture, more specifically with respect to rehabilitation, exercise programs, AOPT/APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to offer gradual strengthening consisting of light towel and putty isometric squeezing and light-load gripper exercises at 2 weeks after surgery or during the second week of cast immobilization to improve short-term (up to 6 months) pain, wrist active ROM, grip strength, and functional outcomes.

### Immobilization time for conservative treatment of distal radial fractures in elderly patients: a randomized controlled trial [^116TayUf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of distal radial fractures (DRFs) in elderly patients remains controversial. Although conservative treatment with cast immobilization is widely accepted, the optimal duration for immobilization is unclear. This study aimed to compare pain control, functional outcomes, and complication rates between 4-week and 6-week immobilization periods in elderly patients treated nonoperatively for displaced DRFs.

Methods

A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted, including 150 patients who were ≥ 65 years of age and had displaced DRFs. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 4-week immobilization and 6-week immobilization. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) at 10 days after removing the cast and then at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. Functional outcomes were measured using the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) and QuickDASH (the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) at 3, 6, and 12 months. Radiographs were reviewed for malunion, and complications and range of motion were also evaluated.

Results

In the 135 patients analyzed, no differences were observed in pain or functional outcomes between the 2 groups at any time point. VAS scores 10 days after the cast removal were similar (3.87 for the 4-week immobilization group and 4.00 for the 6-week group; p = 0.67), as were PRWE scores (14.18 for the 4-week group and 15.51 for the 6-week group; p = 0.686) and QuickDASH scores (15.46 for the 4-week group and 17.86 for the 6-week group; p = 0.449) after 1 year. The malunion rates were 29.9% in the 4-week group and 32.8% in the 6-week group (p = 0.85), and there were no significant differences in complications or range of motion between groups.

Conclusions

A 4-week immobilization period provided equivalent pain control, functional outcomes, and complication rates as a 6-week immobilization period in elderly patients with displaced DRFs treated nonoperatively. Therefore, a shorter immobilization period may be safely recommended for treating these fractures.

### A prospective study to assess the outcome of steroid injections and wrist splinting for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome [^112VCibZ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Surgery is the definitive treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Conservative treatments, such as wrist splinting and steroid injections, are also effective for the relief of carpal tunnel symptoms, but their use remains controversial because they only offer long-term relief in a minority of patients. A prospective study was performed to assess the role of steroid injections combined with wrist splinting for the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. A total of 73 patients with 99 affected hands were studied. Patients presenting with known medical causes or muscle wasting were excluded. Diagnosis was made clinically and electrodiagnostic studies were performed only when equivocal clinical signs were present. Each patient received up to three betamethasone injections into the carpal tunnel and wore a neutral-position wrist splint continuously for 9 weeks. After that period, symptomatic patients received an open carpal tunnel release, and those who remained asymptomatic were followed up regularly for at least 1 year. Patients who relapsed were scheduled for surgery. At a minimum follow-up of 1 year, seven patients (9.6 percent) with 10 affected hands (10.1 percent) remained asymptomatic. This group had a significantly shorter duration of symptoms (2.9 months versus 8.35 months; p = 0.039, Mann-Whitney test) and significantly less sensory change (40 percent versus 72 percent; p = 0.048, Fisher's exact test) at presentation when compared with the group who had surgery. It is concluded that steroid injections and wrist splinting are effective for relief of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms but have a long-term effect in only 10 percent of patients. Symptom duration of less than 3 months and absence of sensory impairment at presentation were predictive of a lasting response to conservative treatment. It is suggested that selected patients (i.e., with no thenar wasting or obvious underlying cause) presenting with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome receive either a single steroid injection or wear a wrist splint for 3 weeks. This will allow identification of the 10 percent of patients who respond well to conservative therapy and do not need surgery.

### The legitimacy for the use of splint immobilization after elastic intramedullary nailing of both-bone forearm shaft fractures in children [^113WMRZ8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies also support early mobilization post-ESIN, suggesting that rigid immobilization may not be necessary. Verstreken et aland Pogorelica et alreported excellent outcomes, including full ROM and low complication rates despite not using postoperative casts. Similarly, Peterlein et alused only slings or bandages, observing favorable long-term functional results (mean follow-up of 12.4 years). Assessment was done using Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and Mayo Wrist Score questionnaires, with the highest scores achieved in 77% and 82% of cases.

Other studies employed routine full arm casting on displaced or unstable forearm fracture. Kruppa et al, Kapoor et al, Garg et al, and Colaris et alall used long-arm casts on displaced or unstable forearm fracture for 2 to 6 weeks, but this did not consistently correlate with fewer complications. In fact, Garg reported a 57% complication rate, although most were transient. Kapoor's results were more favorable, with 80.8% achieving full ROM and 21.2% experiencing complications. As observed, the applied immobilization was not associated with a lower incidence of complications.

The choice of immobilization may also depend on those with residual instability after nailing such as when the nail used is smaller than recommended or when the fracture is located in the proximal-third or distal-third of the shaft immobilization with a cast may be necessary. Kapila et alused splints selectively based on fracture complexity and fixation stability, noting that even limited immobilization (up to 3 weeks) yielded high satisfaction and recovery rates. Meanwhile, Fernandez et alreserved short-term plaster casting only for distal third fractures, citing higher instability in that region. In another 2005 study comparing ESIN vs. plate fixation, Fernandez negated the necessity of using plaster after intramedullary nailing of forearm shaft fractures.

Salonen et aland Lyman et alused various immobilization types in each different patients depending on the surgeon choices. Salonen's study noted a 34% complication rate; this was the only cited study reporting a flexion contracture of the third finger on the fracture side, attributed to Volkmann's ischemic contracture, requiring surgery in a hand surgery department, with a good final outcome. By contrast, this study linked the condition to tendon entrapment in the bone scar, which resolved with rehabilitation and did not require revision surgery.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^114YvySB]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A distal radius fracture (DRF) is defined as a fracture occurring in the distal radius within 3 cm of the radio-carpal joint.DRF are one of the most common fractures that occur in adults, accounting for approximately 15% of all fractures. The incidence is increasing with an aging population. It is predicted that wrist fractures will increase by 25% in the next 4 years in people aged over 50. A large percentage of the annual health cost is utilized by DRF patients; as a result of the initial assessment and investigation, surgery, treatment materials, therapy costs and time at work lost. The determination of the most efficient and effective care available is of benefit to the patient and health provider combined.

Surgery offers an obvious increased potential risk of infection and soft tissue damage, therefore internal or external fixation is reserved for more complex injuries. Fracture fixation using a VLP is currently the most common surgical treatment for this population. Studies by McCamley et al, Wigg et al, Wilcke et al.and Rozental et al.have compared VLP to other fixation methods (external fixation, k wires, non-locking plates and bridging external fixation). These studies indicate that earlier function is obtained if a VLP is used surgically.

Early movement post surgery is beneficial in prevention of adherence of the tendons to the metal work or skin, reducing joint adhesions and finger stiffness, reducing neural tightness, and preventing unnecessary muscle atrophy. It has been shown that patients with finger stiffness (following a DRF) have a greater pain intensity score and disability than those without stiffness. Motion will aid reduction of swelling and stiffness that is a result of oedema. This enables the patient to experience a return of motion to the hand; improved motion will allow functional gains.

Therapy that is begun too early post surgery may disrupt the inflammatory phase and early proliferative phase of healing. Proliferation of the repair material peaks at approximately 2 to 3 weeks post surgery, this is when the bulk of the scar tissue is formed. Beginning motion around this time will allow the collagen to respond favorably to the mechanical stress applied to it. Delaying motion for longer than this period may result in adherence of the soft tissues and joint stiffness. The optimum period to begin therapy post fracture and fracture fixation remains inconclusive, despite several small studies.-

### Implementation of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [^112jbYY6]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the difference in the number of wrist radiographs before and after implementation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules. A wrist radiograph was defined as a lateral and PA radiograph of the distal radius, ulna and the carpal bones.

Secondary outcomes were the number of clinically relevant missed fractures of the distal forearm, the difference in length of stay at the emergency department before and after implementation of the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, physician compliance with the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules, and patient satisfaction with the received care at the emergency department. A fracture was defined as a disruption of one or more cortices of the radius or ulna. A fracture of both the distal radius and ulna, an antebrachial fracture, was recorded as one fracture. Fissures, avulsions of bony fragments and torus (or buckle) fractures were considered to be fractures as well. Carpal fractures were not taken into account since the incidence of carpal fractures in children is low and they are often occult on plain radiographs. A clinically relevant fracture was defined as a fracture for which treatment or prognosis would have been affected by the missed or delayed radiographic diagnosis. Therefore, a torus fracture was considered clinically irrelevant, as patients with a torus fracture can be safely treated with a bandage or removable splint. In addition, we expected that if children have a lot of pain, physicians are more likely to apply a plaster for pain regulation. Fractures that received a plaster for pain regulation only were also considered clinically irrelevant. Fractures were judged to be clinically relevant independently by a radiologist and an orthopaedic trauma surgeon.

The length of stay at the emergency department was defined as the time between when patients presented and when they left the department. The difference in length of stay between the before and after groups was determined by comparing non-fracture patients with a wrist radiograph with non-fracture patients without a wrist radiograph due to the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules.

Physician compliance with the Amsterdam Pediatric Wrist Rules was assessed with an additional question in the mobile application after the recommendation was provided. Physicians were asked via a yes-no question if they were planning to adhere to the recommendation. In case not, four possible answers could be given: (1) I disagree with the recommendation, (2) Patient insists on radiograph, (3) I have the suspicion on an associated injury, and (4) Other (Fig. 3).

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^115u1uGh]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study conduct and oversight

The protocol and statistical analysis plan are available online. This multicentre randomised superiority clinical trial was conducted at 36 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK. The National Research Ethics Committee gave the study a favourable opinion on 6 October 2016, and recruitment centres received permission from their research and development departments. Two minor amendments were made to the protocol to extend the duration of the trial, add digital follow-up, and allow for incentives for follow-up. A local researcher approached eligible patients prospectively and provided them with written information about the trial before asking them to provide informed consent.

Participants

All patients aged 16 years or over with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius were screened. Patients were potentially eligible if their treating surgeon recommended that they needed a manipulation of their fracture. Patients were excluded if the injury was more than two weeks old, the fracture extended more than 3 cm from radiocarpal joint, the fracture was open with a Gustilo and Anderson grading greater than 1, the joint surface of the fracture could not be reduced by closed manipulation, or the patient was unable to complete follow-up questionnaires. After provision of informed consent, the local research team recorded baseline data, including pre-fracture wrist function (retrospective by recall) and current, post-fracture wrist function.

Randomisation and blinding

The randomisation sequence, prepared by the trial statistician, included block stratification by recruitment centre, articular extension of the fracture (intra-articular or extra-articular), and age of the participant (< 50 or ≥ 50 years). The treatment allocation was computer generated via a secure, centralised web based randomisation service.

Patients who provided informed consent were advised that at the time of surgery, in a minority of cases, the surgeon might be unable to manipulate the fracture into its normal anatomical alignment without making incisions in the skin to access the fracture site. Patients who needed such an "open" reduction of the articular surface of their fracture were not randomised into the trial and were treated according to their surgeons' normal clinical practice. For participants in whom a closed reduction of the fracture was possible, the surgeon completed the randomisation process after the manipulation. The participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a moulded cast ("cast group") or surgical fixation with K-wires ("K-wire group"). Surgeons commonly use both techniques in their normal clinical practice. As the interventions were clearly visible to the participants, they could not be blind to treatment allocation.

### Distal radius fractures: what is the evidence? [^113bic6J]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss the evidence base behind treatment of pediatric distal radius fractures.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials addressing the treatment of children with torus fractures, minimally displaced fractures, and displaced fractures of the distal radius.

Results

Torus fractures and minimally displaced fracture is treated by removable splints instead of circumferential casts with improved secondary outcomes for the patient and family and with equal position at healing. Case immobilization versus immediate pinning was studied in 2 small randomized trials of displaced fractures. Long-term outcomes were equivalent, despite more loss of reduction in the cast groups and more pin complications in the pin groups.

Conclusions

Unbiased evalution of empirical patient outcomes using randomized trials has proven feasible for distal radius fractures and should continue to inform and guide our practice in the future.

Imaging of a patient with fracture of the waist of the scaphoid showing the abbreviated MRI for: a) coronal T1; b) coronal proton density fat supressed (PDFS); and c) sagittal short T1 inversion recovery (STIR).

Subsequent clinical and radiological follow-up varied for each group depending on the initial imaging findings (Fig. 2). Participants in the control group were referred to a fracture clinic where further imaging (radiograph, CT, and/or MRI) was in some cases carried out as part of their standard care. The subsequent pathway for participants in the intervention group was dependent on the initial MRI findings. If a fracture was present, participants were placed in a below-elbow backslab, discharged from the ED, and then followed up in the next available fracture clinic. If the MRI showed no evidence of significant injury (either fracture or ligamentous disruption), the participant was given a wrist splint and discharged from the ED with a contact number to call if they had any questions about their condition. The contact card also asked the participant to contact the hospital if still symptomatic after 14 days, at which point follow-up in a specialist wrist clinic was arranged within a week. If their symptoms had resolved, no further clinic follow-up was organized.

Open DWG excision

Of the 12 studies on open DWG excision (Table 1), 6 (50%) used rigid immobilization of the wrist with splinting, 5 (42%) used soft dressings with variability in allowed wrist movement due to pressure and bulk, and 1 (8%) used either. The limited mobility time ranged from 48 hours to 2 weeks, with 3 (25%) studies not specifying the exact length of time.

The follow-up duration ranged from 6 months to 15 years. Angelides and Wallacereported the lowest ganglion recurrence rate of 0.9% after 9-month follow-up. The postoperative protocol involved a bulky bandage or plaster splint. However, the duration of the postoperative protocol was not specified. In contrast, Jagers Op Akkerhuis and colleaguesreported the highest recurrence rate (28%) in patients immobilized with a pressure bandage for 48 hours after DWG excision. The follow-up duration was not specified.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for distal radius fracture, more specifically with respect to rehabilitation, exercise programs, AOPT/APTA 2024 guidelines recommend to offer early therapy consisting of hand, wrist, and shoulder active ROM exercises along with light daily activity within the first 3 weeks after surgery to improve short-term (up to 3 months) pain, wrist active ROM, grip strength, and functional outcomes, and long-term (≥ 6 months) wrist active ROM and grip strength.

### Is softcast (3M) strong enough for potentially unstable paediatric forearm fractures? [^113foEJP]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The majority of paediatric forearm fractures are treated using a circumferential splint, with prior manipulation as necessary. Plaster of Paris is often chosen for its ease of application, cost and proven reliability. Softcast is an alternative, providing a comfortable and water-resistant splint that can be removed without a plaster saw, and is in widespread use for immobilising buckle fractures. Softcast has not been recommended for acute unstable fractures. We established whether a Softcast splint could provide sufficient mechanical stability to control an unstable paediatric forearm fracture.

Methods

A laboratory study was undertaken to compare the 3 point (kinking) and 4 point bending, and torsion loads to defined clinical failure points withstood by standardised 4-wrap POP compared to Softcast splints with 6-wrap, 4 wrap and reinforced 4-wrap configurations.

Results

The load at clinically relevant failure of a 6-wrap Softcast forearm splint was 504N in 4 point bending, 202N in 3 point bending (kinking), and 11Nm in torsion (equalling 30.4%, 26% and 42.2% of the equivalent values for a circumferential 4-wrap POP). The 6-wrap Softcast was however stronger in all modes than a fibreglass-reinforced Softcast splint (previously recommended for acute fractures). Furthermore, the load to failure in all modes exceeds that which can be exerted by body weight in many paediatric patients. Softcast demonstrated complete recovery of its original shape on unloading, whereas POP was permanently deformed. 6-wrap Softcast splints were 4% lighter than POP.

Conclusion

A 6-wrap Softcast splint provides adequate mechanical stability and protection for paediatric patients up to approximately 20kg, avoiding high-risk activities. The primary risk is not of fracture angulation and loss of position, but temporary indentation of the splint, causing discomfort or pain. Considering its ease of removal, Softcast may be preferable for younger paediatric patients. Its cost may be offset by reducing the number and duration of hospital visits.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^1119V7WH]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Strengths and Limitations

The strength of this study is that it is a 'true to life' pragmatic reflection of therapy outcomes. Limitations of this study include non-randomization of participants, no blinding of assessors and that the data was collected retrospectively. There is a possible selection bias for those who are more motivated to RTW and function quicker may seek an earlier HT appointment than other patients. The generalisability of the research may be limited due to the data being collected from a single referral source of 1 therapy clinic. A further limitation may include the involvement of multiple surgeons and the varying skills of operating surgeons.

### Conservative interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome [^1127dTj8]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The assessment and conservative interventions in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are described in this paper. Information about surgical procedures and postoperative care has also been included. It is difficult to make definitive conclusions about the literature regarding success of treatment for CTS due to variations in outcome measures, severity of CTS, and inconsistencies in duration, dosage, and follow-up time for interventions. Based on what is known to date, this author recommends that patients with mild or moderate CTS be provided with a conservative program of splinting the wrist in neutral for nocturnal wear. In addition, intermittent exercise (nerve-gliding exercises) and activity modification, including avoidance of protracted periods of sustained gripping activities and awkward wrist positions, can be useful. This conservative program may be complemented by pain-relieving modalities during times of activity and supplemental participation in other exercise such as yoga. If symptoms are not relieved to the satisfaction of the patient, or they recur, then it is incumbent upon the therapist to refer the patient to a hand surgeon for injection or possible surgical decompression.

Wrist-mobilization phase timing and early motion — The wrist mobilization phase is initiated when a satisfactory DRF healing level has been confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon; for conservatively managed DRFs it is initiated immediately after the 4 to 6 weeks cast immobilization period, whereas with rigid internal fixation it may begin within the first 2 weeks (accelerated) or at 4 to 6 weeks (delayed-standard) following surgery depending on healing and stability; at minimum, early digital range of motion should be emphasized, early wrist ROM should also be considered after operative stabilization, and urgent referral is warranted for extreme digital stiffness, hand hypersensitivity, and/or trophic skin changes.

Valdesshowed a significant difference in the amount of therapy visits between patients when mobilization began at 1 week or 6 weeks post operatively. Driessens et al.did not show a difference in ROM or therapy appointments attended by participants when the late mobilization group began movement on average of 24 days post surgery. This potentially indicates the detrimental effects of immobilization may occur after this 24 day period.

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^114SLN1a]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

An additional comparable study was conducted by Watson et al. The randomized controlled trial compared the effects of mobilization at 1, 3 and 6 weeks post ORIF for a DRF. There was a beneficial early reduction of pain within the first 6 weeks for the groups that began mobilization at 1 or 3 weeks post surgery. The 1 week (p = 0.003) and 3 week (P = 0.001) groups had significantly lower Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation scores (measuring pain and disability in activities of daily living) in comparison to the 6 week group; at 6 weeks post surgery. The earlier mobilization groups also had significantly greater wrist extension motion at 6 weeks. The recurring concept between studies is that the beneficial effects of early mobilization are diminished at 3 and 6 months post surgery. The initial advantages of the early mobilization have significant positive effects on a patient's function, well being and finances.

In isolation wrist extension is a functionally relevant objective measure because tasks are best performed with the wrist in 40–45° of extension. Considering the extension measure alone, Group A achieved a functional wrist extension (46°) at 4 weeks; Group B again not until 3 months. The wrist extension ROM difference between groups indicates that mobilization of an ORIF DRF greater than 4 weeks delays the achievement of a functional ROM.

Previous studies have compared GS to the subjective evaluation of ability to perform functional tasks. Nordenskioldreported a significant correlation between reduced grip and perceived difficulties with certain ADL. Karnezi and Fragkiadakisreport that GS in patients post DRF is a better predictor of self-reported outcome than ROM (flexion – extension) of the wrist. Chung and Haasreport GS to be the best predictor of satisfaction post surgery in patients who have had a VLP. Therefore increased GS will improve the quality of a patient's function. In this study at 6 weeks and at 3 months post surgery Group A had greater GS than Group B, although this difference was not statistically significant. The higher GS of Group A may suggest improved function at the 6 week point; a greater sample size would be required to determine this. Quadlbauer et al.showed the improved GS in the early mobilization group was significantly greater than the late mobilization group until 6 months post surgery.

Methods

Study design

INSTinCTS was a pragmatic, two-arm parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted within the National Health Service (NHS). The trial was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West — Liverpool (UK; reference/NW/0280) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (European Clinical Trials Database, number 2013–001435–8). The trial protocol detailing the methods used, and the 6-week and 6-month findings have been published previously.

Setting

Participants were recruited from 25 primary and community musculoskeletal clinics and services in England and Wales.

Eligibility criteria

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or over and presented with mild to moderate CTS, diagnosed according to agreed standardized criteria. Exclusion criteria included having severe CTS requiring urgent consideration of surgery or having received a CSI or NS for CTS within the preceding 6 months. Written, informed consent was obtained from eligible patients who were interested in participating.

Randomization, blinding and procedures

Participants were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis using permutated blocks of sizes two and four, pre-stratified by research site to either (i) one injection of 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (as 20 mg of Depo-Medrone from 40 mg/ml; Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV; Puurs, Belgium) or (ii) resting night splint set at a neutral angle (0–20 degrees) (Beta Wrist Brace with CE marking; Promedics Orthopaedic; Port Glasgow, UK), to be worn at night for 6 weeks. Participants with bilateral CTS had their most severely affected wrist treated and reported as part of the trial. The contralateral wrist could be treated as per local protocol.

Randomization was completed by sites using Keele University Clinical Trial Unit's (CTU) web randomization service. The allocation sequence was not available to research team members. Neither clinicians nor patients could be blinded to treatment allocation. Treatment group allocation was masked up to the 6-week primary analysis.

### Immediate mobilization of distal radius fractures stabilized by volar locking plate results in a better short-term outcome than a five week immobilization: a prospective randomized trial [^114FnhhB]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of immediate (first day after surgery) mobilization compared to standard five weeks cast immobilization on the functional outcome after volar locking plate fixation of distal radius fractures.

Design

Prospective randomized parallel group comparative trial.

Setting

Trauma Hospital, Austria.

Participants

Patients with isolated unstable distal radius fractures, stabilized with volar angular stable locking plate.

Interventions

The immediate mobilization group received a removable forearm splint for one week and active supervised group physiotherapy and home exercises for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers from the first postoperative day. The cast immobilization group received a non-removable cast for five weeks. In the first five weeks supervised group physiotherapy and home exercises were performed for shoulder, elbow, and fingers. Thereafter additional supervised and home exercises for the wrist were started.

Main Measures

At regular intervals of six and nine weeks, three and six months, and one year post surgery range of motion, grip strength, and x-rays were evaluated. Additionally, the shortened disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (Quick DASH) score, Patient-rated Wrist Evaluation, Mayo Wrist score, and pain according to the Visual Analog Scale score were analyzed.

Results

One hundred and sixteen patients were prospectively randomized into two study groups. At the one-year follow-up, patients in the immediate mobilization group showed a significantly higher range of motion in extension/flexion (mean difference 10.2°, 99% confidence interval 0.6–19.8), grip strength (mean difference 5.1 kg, 99% confidence interval -0.5 to 10.7), and Mayo Wrist score (mean difference 7.9 points, 99% confidence interval 2.3–13.5) than the cast immobilization group. Range of motion in supination/pronation (mean difference 13.4°, 99% confidence interval 1.5–25.3) and in radial/ulnar deviation (mean difference 6.3°, 99% confidence interval 0.9–11.7) differed significantly up to nine weeks favoring the immediate mobilization group. The Patient-rated Wrist Evaluation revealed significantly better scores after three months (mean difference 9.3 points, 99% confidence interval 0.5–18.1) and Quick DASH after six months (mean difference 7.3 points, 99% confidence interval 0.3–14.3) in the immediate mobilization group. All other subsequent follow-up examinations indicated no significant differences in respect of pain, range of motion, and patient-reported outcome measurements between the study groups. There were no significant differences in respect of radiological loss of reduction and complications between the groups.

Conclusions

Immediate mobilization in combination with supervised physiotherapy of the wrist after volar locking plate fixation of unstable distal radius fractures results in a significantly improved range of motion and grip strength after one year compared to cast immobilization. No increased risk for loss of reduction and other complications was observed.

### Surgical fixation with K-wires versus casting in adults with fracture of distal radius: DRAFFT2 multicentre randomised clinical trial [^111WdWy1]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

Surgical fixation with K-wires did not provide better wrist function at 12 months compared with a moulded cast, indicating that a cast is an acceptable first line treatment following manipulation of a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius. Cast treatment avoids the expense and risks of surgical fixation for seven out of eight patients. However, careful follow-up is needed as one in eight patients treated with a cast required subsequent surgical intervention as the fracture reduction could not be maintained.

### Influence of postoperative immobilization on pain control of patients with distal radius fracture treated with volar locked plating: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^114pmR47]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the pain scores and the rates and doses of opioid use in patients undergoing volar locked plate fixation of intra-articular distal radius fractures using or not postoperative immobilization.

Methods

This was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine patients with distal radius fractures scheduled to receive volar plate fixation were randomly assigned to receive a short forearm splint for two weeks postoperatively or conventional bandage with early wrist mobilization. Thirty-six patients completed the follow-up. The outcome measurements included pain scores (0–10 points); rates and doses of tramadol use; DASH score; wrist range of motion; patient satisfaction; and complication rates. The last follow-up assessment was performed at 6 months.

Results

The pain scores were similar between the groups during hospital stay, as well as after hospital discharge within the first week and in subsequent assessments up to six months. The rates of tramadol use were greater in the No splint group during hospital stay, but this difference was not statistically significant (No splint = 65%; Splint = 47%; p = 0.296). Likewise, the doses of tramadol intake were higher in the No splint group during hospital stay (No splint = 218mg; Splint = 167mg; p = 0.273) and after discharge (2 nd day: No splint = 112mg; Splint = 75mg; p = 0.286), with no statistically significant differences. The functional results and complication rates were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

In this study, there was a trend to a greater use of tramadol in patients who did not use immobilization and started early wrist mobilization after volar locked plating of distal radius fracture, compared with patients who were immobilized for two weeks. The pain scores were similar but may have been influenced by the unbalanced use of opioids between the groups. The functional results and complication rates were not influenced by the use of immobilization.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic Level I.

### Comparison of 24-month outcomes after treatment for distal radius fracture: the WRIST randomized clinical trial [^115TsJVX]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

For patients aged 60 years and older with unstable distal radius fractures, are there 24-month outcome differences across the 4 treatment strategies of volar locking plates, external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and casting?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 182 adults from 24 health systems, there were no significant differences in any 24-month outcome by treatment.

Meaning

These findings suggest that there are no differences in 24-month outcomes based on treatment and that patients with unstable distal radius fractures treated with casting can experience good outcomes despite malunion, while avoiding the risks of surgery.
