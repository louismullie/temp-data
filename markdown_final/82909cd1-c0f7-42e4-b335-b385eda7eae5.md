## Question

What should be the next medication for a patient on the maximum dose of lisinopril and amlodipine who developed renal dysfunction on HCTZ?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication to add next for apparent resistant hypertension in a patient on the maximum dose of lisinopril and amlodipine who developed renal dysfunction on hydrochlorothiazide. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this truly meets the definition of resistant hypertension and confirm the current background therapy. Then, I should verify contraindicated add-on options, especially dual RAS blockade and aliskiren. Next, I will evaluate evidence-based fourth-line choices, particularly mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and consider CKD-specific diuretic strategies. After that, I need to outline safety monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal function and mitigation strategies. Finally, I will consider alternatives if MRAs are not tolerated, reinforce lifestyle and adherence, and specify a follow-up plan with targets and escalation thresholds [^113ehTpj] [^114bnyEQ].

> Let me first confirm whether this is truly resistant hypertension and whether the current regimen is guideline-concordant for CKD. Initially, I thought resistant hypertension could be defined as persistent elevation despite two drugs, an ACE inhibitor and a CCB, but wait, I should correct myself: the standard definition requires uncontrolled BP on three agents of different classes at optimal or maximally tolerated doses, typically including a diuretic, or controlled BP requiring four or more agents, so this case is best framed as apparent treatment-resistant hypertension given prior thiazide use complicated by renal dysfunction and current dual therapy with ACEi and CCB, which is otherwise appropriate in CKD [^113ehTpj] [^116VhNKh] [^112GvUmE].

> I need to identify what not to add next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB is specifically discouraged due to higher risks of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal impairment without added benefit, so I should not add an ARB to lisinopril, and I should also avoid adding aliskiren to an ACE inhibitor, particularly in CKD or diabetes, given similar safety concerns and explicit labeling warnings [^114bnyEQ] [^115zZzeq] [^113b78nV]. I should also confirm that continuing hydrochlorothiazide after renal dysfunction is inappropriate, especially if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², which aligns with avoidance in product labeling, so HCTZ should remain discontinued in this patient [^111YfX3u].

> Next, I should review the best evidence-based fourth agent for apparent resistant hypertension in CKD. The 2023 ESH guidelines prioritize spironolactone or other MRAs as the preferred fourth-line therapy in resistant hypertension because of robust BP-lowering efficacy and pathophysiologic targeting of aldosterone excess, and this strategy is commonly applied in CKD with careful potassium monitoring, with data from AMBER suggesting feasibility using potassium binders when needed to enable therapy continuation [^113ehTpj] [^114mZvNb]. Let me consider the dose — starting low at 12.5 to 25 mg daily and titrating cautiously is prudent to balance efficacy with safety in the context of ACE inhibitor use and CKD [^113ehTpj].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring steps before committing. Hyperkalemia and a creatinine rise are the key risks when layering an MRA on top of ACE inhibition in CKD, so I need to check baseline potassium and eGFR, then recheck potassium and creatinine about one week after initiation, again at four weeks, and then at reasonable intervals thereafter, with tighter intervals if potassium trends up or renal function declines; this cadence aligns with resistant HTN monitoring guidance and the known electrolyte risks with RAS-modulating regimens in CKD, and patiromer can be used to mitigate hyperkalemia to preserve spironolactone if needed, as supported by AMBER [^117Jg3oM] [^111ZpKtH] [^114mZvNb]. If hyperkalemia emerges at or above about 5.5 mEq/L, I should first address reversible factors, consider a potassium binder, and reassess whether MRA dose reduction or temporary hold is necessary rather than abandoning the class outright, especially if BP response is strong [^114mZvNb].

> Let me think about diuretic strategy in this CKD context because I initially assumed thiazides are uniformly ineffective with low eGFR, but wait, I should verify and refine that view. Thiazide-like agents such as chlorthalidone may retain some BP-lowering effect at lower eGFR, yet ESH guidance recommends initiating loop diuretics as kidney function declines, with clear initiation when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and consideration below 45 mL/min/1.73 m²; given this patient developed renal dysfunction on HCTZ, it is more appropriate to avoid HCTZ and, if additional natriuresis is needed, pivot to a loop diuretic according to eGFR thresholds and clinical volume status rather than retrying a thiazide [^111Wg5Xp] [^113ehTpj]. I should double-check volume status and dietary sodium because unrecognized excess sodium intake or volume expansion can undermine BP control and increase the need for diuretics in CKD [^113ehTpj].

> I need to ensure I have viable alternatives if spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated. In that case, acceptable next-line options per ESH include a beta-blocker such as metoprolol or carvedilol, particularly if there is concomitant ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or tachyarrhythmia; an alpha-1 blocker such as doxazosin with caution for orthostatic hypotension; a centrally acting agent such as clonidine, including a transdermal route to reduce rebound risk; and amiloride where available, with similar potassium monitoring considerations in CKD [^113ehTpj]. Hold on, I should verify potassium at baseline if considering amiloride because it also raises serum potassium and may be problematic when combined with an ACE inhibitor in CKD, necessitating the same vigilance as with MRAs [^113ehTpj].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and adherence factors that could be limiting control before and after adding an MRA. Sodium restriction to under about 2 grams of sodium per day, weight reduction where applicable, moderation of alcohol intake, and regular home BP monitoring with adherence checks are emphasized in resistant HTN management, and given the complexity of multi-drug regimens, I should also consider simplified regimens or fixed-dose combinations that do not reintroduce thiazides in those with eGFR below threshold, to improve adherence without compromising renal safety [^11791MY7] [^117Jg3oM] [^115EkV4K]. I should confirm there are no NSAID or sympathomimetic exposures and consider targeted evaluation for secondary causes if clinical features suggest them, as these are common culprits in apparent resistance [^117Jg3oM].

> I will now examine targets and follow-up cadence to avoid therapeutic inertia. For CKD, ESH and ERA materials suggest aiming for systolic BP under about 130 mm Hg if tolerated, with careful monitoring in advanced CKD due to potential reversible eGFR dips when intensifying therapy, so early follow-up within 2 to 4 weeks after each intensification is reasonable, with earlier labs when adding an MRA, and escalation after 4 to 8 weeks if goals are not met despite adherence and optimized dosing [^116vyvd4] [^117Jg3oM]. I should double-check that escalation timing aligns with safety monitoring, ensuring lab results are reviewed before each uptitration to mitigate hyperkalemia or renal adverse events in this ACEi plus MRA pathway [^117Jg3oM].

> Final recommendation: Add low-dose spironolactone, 12.5 to 25 mg orally daily, after confirming baseline potassium and eGFR, keep hydrochlorothiazide discontinued, and recheck potassium and creatinine approximately 1 week and 4 weeks after initiation with ongoing periodic monitoring, using a potassium binder such as patiromer if hyperkalemia threatens continuation, then titrate cautiously to 25 to 50 mg as tolerated while reinforcing sodium restriction and adherence; if BP remains uncontrolled after 4 to 8 weeks at an optimal tolerated MRA dose or if MRA is contraindicated, proceed with an alternative such as a beta-blocker, alpha-1 blocker, or clonidine, and consider a loop diuretic strategy based on eGFR and volume status [^113ehTpj] [^111YfX3u] [^114mZvNb] [^111Wg5Xp] [^11791MY7] [^117Jg3oM] [^114bnyEQ] [^115zZzeq].

---

Add **spironolactone 12.5–25 mg daily** [^113ehTpj] as the next antihypertensive for a patient on maximal doses of lisinopril and amlodipine who developed renal dysfunction on HCTZ, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^114mZvNb]. If spironolactone is not tolerated or causes hyperkalemia, **use a loop diuretic** (e.g. furosemide) if eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111Wg5Xp]. Avoid **dual RAS blockade** [^114bnyEQ] and **thiazide-like diuretics** given the prior renal dysfunction. Consider beta- or alpha-blockers for additional control [^113ehTpj].

---

## Recommended next medication: mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)

- **Rationale**: MRAs are first-line add-on therapy for resistant hypertension and provide significant BP reduction and cardiovascular benefit [^113ehTpj].

- **Clinical evidence**: The PATHWAY-2 trial showed spironolactone is superior to other fourth-line agents in resistant hypertension [^113ehTpj].

- **Renal considerations**: MRAs are effective in CKD but require close monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal function changes [^114mZvNb].

---

## Alternative option: loop diuretics

- **Rationale**: Loop diuretics are recommended when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or when thiazides cause renal dysfunction [^111Wg5Xp].

- **Clinical evidence**: Loop diuretics effectively control volume and BP in CKD and resistant hypertension.

- **Renal considerations**: Monitor electrolytes and renal function closely due to risk of hypokalemia and volume depletion [^117Jg3oM].

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

**Dual RAS blockade** — combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB — should be avoided [^114bnyEQ] due to increased risk of renal dysfunction [^113b78nV] and hyperkalemia. **Thiazide-like diuretics** such as chlorthalidone or indapamide should also be avoided given the prior renal dysfunction with HCTZ.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Blood pressure**: Regular home or ambulatory monitoring to assess control and adherence [^117Jg3oM].

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium closely, especially after adding MRAs [^114mZvNb] or loop diuretics [^117Jg3oM].

- **Adherence**: Reinforce adherence and lifestyle measures [^115EkV4K] to optimize control [^11791MY7].

## Summary table: recommended next medication and alternatives

| **Medication class** | **Recommended agent** | **Dose** | **Renal considerations** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| MRA | Spironolactone | 12.5–25 mg daily | Effective in CKD; monitor hyperkalemia [^113ehTpj] | Potassium, creatinine, eGFR |
| Loop diuretic | Furosemide | 20–40 mg daily | Effective when eGFR < 45 [^111Wg5Xp]; monitor electrolytes | Potassium, sodium, creatinine, eGFR |
| Beta-blocker | Carvedilol | 12.5–25 mg BID | Use if additional control needed [^113ehTpj] | Heart rate, BP |
| Alpha-blocker | Doxazosin | 1–8 mg daily | Use if additional control needed [^113ehTpj] | BP, orthostatic symptoms |

---

Spironolactone is the **preferred next medication** [^113ehTpj] for resistant hypertension after maximized doses of lisinopril and amlodipine; **loop diuretics** [^111Wg5Xp] are alternatives if MRAs are not tolerated.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: Population based retrospective cohort study [^114UAARM]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the optimal systolic blood pressure goal above which new antihypertensive medications should be added or doses of existing medications increased, referred to as the "systolic intensification threshold". Additionally, it aimed to determine the relation between delays in medication intensification and follow-up and the risk of cardiovascular events or death.

- **Design**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted.

- **Setting**: The study was set in primary care practices in the United Kingdom, spanning the years 1986 to 2010.

- **Participants**: The study included 88,756 adults with hypertension taken from The Health Improvement Network nationwide primary care research database.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes measured were rates of acute cardiovascular events or death from any cause. These outcomes were analyzed for patients with different hypertension treatment strategies, defined by systolic intensification threshold, time to intensification, and time to follow-up over a ten-year treatment strategy assessment period. Adjustments were made for age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic deprivation, history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, Charlson comorbidity index, body mass index, medication possession ratio, and baseline blood pressure.

Results indicated that during a median follow-up of 37.4 months after the treatment strategy assessment period, 9,985 (11.3%) participants experienced an acute cardiovascular event or died. No difference in risk of the outcome was observed between systolic intensification thresholds of 130–150 mm Hg. However, systolic intensification thresholds greater than 150 mm Hg were associated with progressively greater risk (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.30; P < 0.001).

### Captopril [^115s7Bbd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of captopril tablets may be increased to 100 mg taken twice a day (b.i.d.) or three times a day (t.i.d.) and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. while continuing the diuretic. The usual dose ranges from 25 to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., but a maximum daily dose of 450 mg should not be exceeded.

For patients with severe hypertension, such as accelerated or malignant hypertension, where temporary discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, the diuretic should be continued while other antihypertensive medications are stopped. Captopril tablets should be promptly initiated at 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. under close medical supervision.

If necessitated by the patient's clinical condition, the daily dose of captopril tablets may be increased every 24 hours or less under continuous medical supervision until a satisfactory blood pressure response is obtained or the maximum dose is reached. In this regimen, the addition of a more potent diuretic, such as furosemide, may also be indicated.

Beta-blockers may also be used in conjunction with captopril tablet therapy; however, the effects of the two drugs are less than additive.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: An update [^113GgoKf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is now considered a part of a complex syndrome of changes in cardiac and vascular structure and function. All guidelines suggest that ≥ 1 antihypertensive agent is required in most patients with hypertension to reach BP goals that will effectively reduce cardiovascular risk. Therapy with two drugs, either separately or as fixed combinations that include agents with complementary actions, is often needed. Many combinations have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and often include a diuretic with an RAAS blocker. The choice of combination therapy depends on risk factors, the presence of comorbidities like diabetes and renal dysfunction, and adverse effects; it should be tailored according to the individual patient.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend initiating an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as the initial or add-on antihypertensive treatment. This approach aims to improve kidney outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of race or diabetes status.

### Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide [^116DKgra]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40% to 60% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting dose of amlodipine 2.5 mg is not an available strength with amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Renal impairment**: Safety and effectiveness of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) have not been established. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment.

- **Hepatic impairment**:
	- **Amlodipine**: Exposure to amlodipine is increased in patients with hepatic insufficiency. The recommended initial dose of amlodipine in patients with hepatic impairment is 2.5 mg, which is not an available strength with amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Valsartan**: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic insufficiency.

### Diverse effects of increasing lisinopril doses on lipid abnormalities in chronic nephropathies [^111TSr9s]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia frequently complicates chronic nephropathies and increases the risk of renal and cardiovascular events. This might be ameliorated by drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which effectively reduce proteinuria.

- **Methods and results**: In this longitudinal study, we evaluated the extent to which uptitration of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to maximum tolerated doses (median [range]: 30 [10 to 40] mg/d) ameliorated proteinuria and dyslipidemia in 28 patients with nondiabetic chronic nephropathies. Maximum lisinopril doses significantly and safely reduced proteinuria, serum total, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides without substantially affecting serum HDL and renal hemodynamics. Proteinuria already decreased at 10 mg/d. Serum lipids progressively and dose-dependently decreased during uptitration to maximum doses. Reduction in total and LDL cholesterol correlated with increases in serum albumin/total protein concentration and oncotic pressure, peaked at lisinopril maximum doses, and persisted after treatment withdrawal. Despite less proteinuria reduction, hypercholesterolemia decreased more (and reflected the increase in serum albumin) in hypoalbuminemic than in normoalbuminemic patients who, despite more proteinuria reduction, had less decrease in cholesterol and no changes in serum albumin. Changes in serum triglycerides were independent of changes in serum proteins, were strongly correlated with lisinopril doses (r = -0.89, P = 0.003), and recovered promptly after treatment withdrawal. Lisinopril was well tolerated and did not affect renal hemodynamics.

### What is a preferred angiotensin ii receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^113i4CED]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

It is now accepted that most hypertensive patients will not reach and maintain blood pressure (BP) goals on monotherapy. Therefore, initial combination therapy is increasingly used and recommended by guidelines, particularly for patients with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as a history of prior CV events, comorbid diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and evidence of organ damage, such as renal disease.

Guidelines also recommend the use of single-pill combinations (SPCs) over free-drug combinations due to their improved adherence. In patients with evidence of renal disease or those with a greater risk of developing renal disease, such as individuals with diabetes and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, guidelines clearly recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to superior renoprotective effects compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents.

Combinations containing an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) rather than an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may be preferred because ARBs are associated with superior tolerability, which may lead to improved adherence. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with proteinuria and/or renal insufficiency, ARB-based treatment is recommended because these agents delay the progression of nephropathy.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, specifically concerning RAAS inhibitors such as ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating a renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor (either an ACEi or ARB) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and moderately to severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2-A3) with diabetes.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^116o55xs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amlodipine has indications other than hypertension, which are described in its full prescribing information.

- **Drug interactions**: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure-lowering effect.

- **Valsartan**: Valsartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. An oral dose of 80 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 80% at peak, with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. No information on the effect of larger doses is available. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a two- to three-fold rise in plasma renin and a consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan; very little effect on serum potassium was observed. Administration of valsartan to patients with essential hypertension results in a significant reduction of sitting, supine, and standing systolic blood pressure, usually with little or no orthostatic change. Valsartan has indications other than hypertension, which are described in its full prescribing information.

- **Hydrochlorothiazide**: After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.

### Aliskiren: A novel renoprotective agent or simply an alternative to ACE inhibitors [^115xbstP]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence in developed nations. The economic and psychosocial costs of CKD are considerable and are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Specific treatments do not exist for many causes of CKD. Therefore, treatment relies on the introduction of therapies that retard the progression of structural renal damage and renal impairment.

At present, aside from judicious use of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure, and possibly low-protein diets and statin therapy, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the only widely available treatments. Although these measures attenuate the inexorable progression to renal failure, they do not halt it. One limiting factor may be feedback effects of ACEis and ARBs, such as increased plasma renin activity.

Aliskiren is a newer agent that inhibits renin, the rate-limiting step in the RAAS. There are several theoretical reasons to suggest that aliskiren may have renoprotective actions superior to those of ACEis and ARBs. In this paper, the available evidence regarding the renoprotective effects of aliskiren is reviewed, with an emphasis on comparison with ACEis and ARBs.

### Hypertension [^116sbFAA]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Resistant and uncontrolled hypertension are common presentations to the nephrology clinic. Many of these patients benefit from evaluation for secondary hypertension to optimize antihypertensive therapy and reduce the risks of target organ damage from uncontrolled hypertension. The purpose of this review is to present several cases of difficult-to-control and/or secondary hypertension and to identify optimal approaches to evaluating and managing hypertension in these high-risk patients.

### Joint UK societies' 2014 consensus statement on renal denervation for resistant hypertension [^1146Qp3x]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The study design mandated that each enrolled patient was on a maximum tolerated dose or maximum Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose of at least three antihypertensive agents from different classes for at least two weeks prior to enrolment. Although there was an emphasis on maintaining a constant therapeutic regimen throughout the study, as many as 20% of patients were not on stable medications within six weeks of inclusion. Given that attainment of the full effect of diuretics (including aldosterone antagonists) is known to take up to eight weeks, it is quite possible that some of the blood pressure changes in both study limbs were due to late effects of the enrolment medication regimen.

There were also substantial differences in the use of aldosterone antagonists (22.5/28.7%) and vasodilators (36.8/45%) between the RDN/sham limbs at baseline, respectively, and a preponderance of African-Americans, who are more likely to respond to these drug classes, in the sham group (29.2% sham vs. 24.8% RDN). Indeed, African-American patients demonstrated a striking systolic blood pressure reduction of 17.8 mm Hg in the sham arm versus 15.5 mm Hg in the RDN limb.

Approximately 40% of patients in both arms required medication changes during the study, which is unusual. The exact reasons for and the disposition of the medication changes are yet to be clarified. It is noteworthy that there were eight points of investigator/subject contact during the study with close scrutiny of medications and blood pressure at every point. It is possible that medication compliance was artificially enhanced in this study.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112i7NXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, increased clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management of CKD afford the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy, but also to intervene to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of renal impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB, or both, in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus.

- **Search strategy**: In March 2010, we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialized register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Reference lists of review articles and relevant studies were also checked. The search was conducted using the optimally sensitive strategy developed.

When addressing specific circumstances for hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in renal transplant recipients, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as first-line antihypertensive agents for adult kidney transplant recipients.

### Olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: A subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^112H3VUT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The TRINITY study was a phase 3, randomized, parallel-group study conducted at 317 clinical sites in the United States and Puerto Rico. It consisted of a 12-week double-blind treatment period followed by a 40-week open-label treatment period. Details of the 12-week study design have been published previously; the study design for the 12-week double-blind and open-label treatment periods is summarized in Figure 1. Eligible study participants, stratified by age, race, and diabetes status, were randomized into a regimen that resulted in four treatment groups. These groups received treatment from weeks 4 to 12 with one of the following: OM 40/AML 10 mg (single-pill combination), OM 40/HCTZ 25 mg (single-pill combination), AML 10/HCTZ 25 mg (not a single-pill combination; given separately), or OM 40/AML 10/HCTZ 25 mg (single-pill OM/HCTZ combination plus AML).

Although stratification for chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) was not part of the stratification algorithm, there was a balanced distribution of participants within each treatment arm for both comorbidities in the total cohort. All participants received dual-combination treatment for four weeks, except for a subset of 36 control participants who received placebo for two weeks and were subsequently switched to one of the three dual-combination treatments from week 2 to week 4. At week 4, participants were either randomly maintained on dual-combination treatment until week 12 or given triple-combination treatment with OM 40/AML 10/HCTZ 25 mg until week 12.

Participants completing the 12-week study were then enrolled in a 40-week open-label treatment period.

### Impact of antihypertensive drug classes on cardiovascular outcomes: Insights from the STEP study [^113WMPs9]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In the STEP trial, participants received free antihypertensive medications upon enrollment, including olmesartan (an ARB), amlodipine (a CCB), and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic). At the start of the trial, participants were initiated on olmesartan-medoxomil tablets as the preferred ARB or amlodipine tablets as the preferred CCB. Hydrochlorothiazide was not recommended as a primary monotherapy for the initial treatment. Other antihypertensive medications, such as beta-blockers, were allowed at the discretion of the investigators when deemed necessary and appropriate. Medication adjustments (dose increases and additional antihypertensive therapy) to achieve target SBP were based on office blood pressure measurements, which were evaluated monthly for the first three months and every three months thereafter. In the present study, we focused on four main classes of antihypertensive medications, categorized based on their pharmacological mechanisms: ARBs, CCBs, thiazide-type diuretics, and beta-blockers.

The primary exposure of interest was the relative time for each class of antihypertensive medication, defined as the ratio of medication exposure time to event time. Medication exposure time was calculated as the number of days from the first prescription date to the discontinuation date during the follow-up period, the first event, or the end of the study, whichever came first. If a particular class of antihypertensive drug was discontinued at a clinical visit but reinitiated at a later visit, the days of exposure were added to the previous count.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Conversely, in the general black population, including those with diabetes, treatment should start with a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. For individuals aged 18 years and older with chronic kidney disease (CKD), initial or additional antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If the target blood pressure (BP) is not achieved within one month of treatment, the dose of the initial drug should be increased or a second drug added. If the target BP still cannot be reached with two drugs, a third drug should be added and titrated. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients who cannot attain their target BP.

- **Basis of recommendations**: Most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories despite differing treatment targets. For the nonblack population without diabetes, recommendations universally include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first-line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is the variability in BP-lowering effects among individual drugs within this class.

A Cochrane review of over 60 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of six different thiazide diuretics. Unlike other thiazide medications studied, hydrochlorothiazide demonstrated a dose-dependent effect.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^1153qgDw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The active ingredients of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide target three separate mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Specifically, amlodipine blocks the contractile effects of calcium on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells; valsartan blocks the vasoconstriction and sodium-retaining effects of angiotensin II on cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal, and renal cells; and hydrochlorothiazide directly promotes the excretion of sodium and chloride in the kidney, leading to reductions in intravascular volume. A more detailed description of the mechanism of action of each individual component follows.

- **Amlodipine**: Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro; however, such effects have not been observed in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiological pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel plays a crucial role in its action.

Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, institute supportive treatment.

- **Amlodipine**: Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg amlodipine in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral doses equivalent to 4 or more mg/kg amlodipine in dogs (11 or more times the MRHD on a mg/m² basis) caused marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.

If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, initiate cardiovascular support, including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly reduce absorption.

Finally, triple antihypertensive drug therapy may not control BP in a number of CKD patients. Hypertension is defined as resistant to treatment when appropriate lifestyle measures and treatment with optimal or best tolerated doses of three or more drugs (a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, a RAS blocker, and a CCB) fail to lower office BP. Those with serum potassium ≥ 4.5 mmol/L were excluded from this study; thus, the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in such individuals are not established.

In the AMBER trial (Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease) that used spironolactone with the addition of placebo or patiromer in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension and eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², BP was effectively reduced in both groups. However, the rates of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) were about 60% and 35%, respectively, at 12 weeks. Based on the above findings, th

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^1147HnY8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **General considerations**: The dosage should be administered once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

- **Hypertension**:
	- **Add-on therapy**: This medication may be used as add-on therapy for patients not adequately controlled on monotherapy. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled with amlodipine alone (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) or with valsartan alone (or another ARB) may be switched to combination therapy with Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets.
	- Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.
	- Amlodipine and Valsartan Tablets may be substituted for titrated components. When used as initial therapy, initiate treatment with 5/160 mg and titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily.

### Optimal systolic blood pressure target, time to intensification, and time to follow-up in treatment of hypertension: population based retrospective cohort study [^1163XZSn]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the optimal systolic blood pressure goal for initiating or adjusting antihypertensive medications, defined as the "systolic intensification threshold". It also examined the relationship between delays in medication intensification and follow-up on the risk of cardiovascular events or death.

The study was set in primary care practices in the United Kingdom between 1986 and 2010 and included 88,756 adults with hypertension, compiled from The Health Improvement Network, a nationwide primary care research database.

- **Main outcome measures**: Rates of acute cardiovascular events or death from any cause were assessed among patients with varying hypertension treatment strategies. These strategies were defined by systolic intensification threshold, time to intensification, and time to follow-up, over a 10-year treatment strategy assessment period. Adjustments were made for factors including age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic deprivation, history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease, Charlson comorbidity index, body mass index, medication possession ratio, and baseline blood pressure.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 37.4 months post the treatment strategy assessment period, 9985 (11.3%) participants experienced an acute cardiovascular event or died. No significant difference in outcome risk was observed between systolic intensification thresholds of 130–150 mm Hg. However, thresholds exceeding 150 mm Hg were linked to a progressively higher risk (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.30; P < 0.001 for intensification).

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112m1vJ7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g. patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia); such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide the selection of therapy.

- **Limitation of use**: Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP CCB), valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^115XFS1K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypotension in volume- or salt-depleted patients**: Excessive hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension, was observed in 1.7% of patients treated with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide (10 mg/320 mg/25 mg) compared to 1.8% of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (320 mg/25 mg) patients, 0.4% of amlodipine/valsartan (10 mg/320 mg) patients, and 0.2% of hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine (25 mg/10 mg) patients in a controlled trial involving patients with moderate to severe uncomplicated hypertension. For patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted individuals receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur in those receiving angiotensin receptor blockers. It is recommended to correct this condition before administering amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide.

Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied in patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or those undergoing surgery or dialysis. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan often experience some reduction in blood pressure. However, discontinuation of therapy due to persistent symptomatic hypotension is usually not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials involving heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation.

### Benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension in high-risk patients [^114Ly14t]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). High credibility.

The optimal combination drug therapy for hypertension is not established, although U.S. guidelines recommend the inclusion of a diuretic. We hypothesized that treatment with the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker would be more effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events than treatment with an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 11,506 patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events to receive treatment with either benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. The primary endpoint was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization.

- **Results**: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. The trial was terminated early following a mean follow-up of 36 months when the boundary of the prespecified stopping rule was exceeded. Mean blood pressures after dose adjustment were 131.6/73.3 mm Hg in the benazepril-amlodipine group and 132.5/74.4 mm Hg in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 552 primary-outcome events in the benazepril-amlodipine group (9.6%) and 679 in the benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide group (11.8%), representing an absolute risk reduction with benazepril-amlodipine therapy of 2.2% and a relative risk reduction of 19.6% (hazard ratio, 0.80, 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to [CI].

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^114AvQ93]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Two-drug, ARB-based SPCs are available in combination with either HCTZ or amlodipine. Telmisartan, a long-acting ARB with superior 24-hour BP-lowering efficacy compared with several other ARBs, and the only ARB with an indication for the prevention of CV disease progression, is available in two SPC formulations: telmisartan/HCTZ and telmisartan/amlodipine.

Reaching a decision about which of these to use in a hypertensive patient with evidence of renal impairment is difficult in the absence of clinical trial data. However, evidence from the ACCOMPLISH trial supports the use of a RAS blocker combined with a CCB, rather than HCTZ, for high CV risk hypertensive patients, such as those with coronary artery disease with or without stable angina, patients with a metabolic risk profile, and particularly for those with renal disease.

Data demonstrating beneficial metabolic and inflammatory effects with ARB/CCB combined therapy (versus ARB/HCTZ therapy) may also lead to the preferred use of RAS blocker-CCB combinations to achieve further BP reductions whilst avoiding further metabolic disturbances and protecting the kidneys from further damage. However, in hypertensive patients at increased CV risk requiring an antihypertensive agent that specifically reduces blood volume, the combination of an ARB is recommended to protect.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend increasing the dose of the initial drug or adding a second drug from one of the following classes: thiazide-type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, if the goal blood pressure is not reached within a month of treatment. It is crucial to continue assessing blood pressure and adjusting the treatment regimen until the goal is reached.

### Olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^114fQwCq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Combining antihypertensive agents from different classes has been estimated to produce blood pressure (BP) reductions approximately 5 times greater than doubling the dose of any single agent. A meta-analysis has shown that one drug at standard dose compared with a combination of three drugs at half the standard dose reduced the incidence of coronary heart disease by about 24% and 45%, respectively, and stroke by 33% and 60%, respectively, in individuals aged 60 to 69 years with systolic blood pressure (SeBP) of 150/90 mm Hg.

The complementary mechanisms of action of an angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic result in each agent targeting a separate pathway and provide coverage for multiple different pathways contributing to hypertension. Additionally, in patients with evidence of renal disease or at greater risk of developing renal disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to use renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker–based combination therapy.

Guidelines recognize that multiple antihypertensive agents are often required in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, the American Heart Association recommends starting with two or more antihypertensive agents in patients with coronary artery disease. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommends a lower BP goal (< 130/80 mm Hg) for patients with diabetes or CKD, as both are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Similarly, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommends a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for patients at risk.

### Prevention of renal dysfunction and hypertension by amlodipine after heart transplant [^1114Cpjs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

To assess whether treatment with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist can prevent the development of hypertension and renal dysfunction after heart transplantation, 38 patients receiving cyclosporine for immunosuppression were randomized shortly after cardiac transplantation to placebo or amlodipine 2.5 mg/day using a double-blind design. The dose was gradually increased to 10 mg/day as tolerated. At 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed for the assessment of BP load, echocardiography for the assessment of left ventricular function and mass, 24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance, and blood sampling for cyclosporine levels.

In the placebo group, BP showed modest increases during follow-up, whereas creatinine clearance decreased by about 10 ml/min. In contrast, in the amlodipine group, systolic BP decreased by 15 to 20 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 7 to 10 mm Hg, whereas creatinine clearance tended to increase. Between-group differences were significant as well. During follow-up, left ventricular mass and function showed small decreases, similar for the two groups. Cyclosporine doses and blood levels did not differ during follow-up.

In conclusion, the initiation of treatment with the dihydropyridine amlodipine shortly after cardiac transplantation represents an effective strategy to maintain normal BP and renal function for ≥ 1 year.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^111d4khd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Administer the medication once daily. Increase the dosage gradually up to a maximum of 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg. Amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as add-on or switch therapy for patients who are not adequately controlled with any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. Substitution is possible for its individually titrated components.

- **General considerations**: The dosage is to be taken once daily, with the potential for increase after two weeks of therapy. The full blood pressure-lowering effect is achieved two weeks after reaching the maximal dose of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg.

- **Add-on/switch therapy**: These tablets may be suitable for patients inadequately controlled with any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. If a patient experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions to an individual component, they may be switched to a formulation containing a lower dose of that component to maintain similar blood pressure reductions.

- **Replacement therapy**: These tablets can be substituted for the individually titrated components.

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116vyvd4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after the development of proteinuria, the progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations, the 2023 ESH guidelines suggest that the blood pressure (BP) target for proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well. For both patient categories, a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 30 mg/g is recommended. A similar target may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD. Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is recommended, as a further functional but reversible decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most patients with CKD have cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be taken into account. Consequently, these CV comorbidities and not CKD protection may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations: (i) none of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with diabetes and CKD, and therefore evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation; (ii) the MDRD and AASK trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to specific SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values; (iii) the MDRD and AASK trials recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years).

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^115WstSF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

A range of mostly two-drug antihypertensive SPCs is available. Preferred drug classes for combination regimens target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics. The selection depends on individual patient factors, such as additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and comorbidities.

For example, in patients with diabetes and high-normal blood pressure (BP) or overt hypertension, which together confer a greater risk of renal damage, combination therapy with a RAS blocker is preferred. These agents offer a superior protective effect against the initiation and progression of nephropathy. In patients with renal disease, antihypertensive therapy should target a range of markers of renal and cardiovascular risk, such as serum creatinine, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, usually through RAS blockade. The aim is to reduce and slow the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CV events.

Microalbuminuria, in particular, is a marker of global CV risk and is very common in patients with hypertension. Several position statements recommend combined therapy that includes RAS blockers. The American Society of Hypertension indicates a preference for RAS blockers in combination with either a diuretic or CCB, with single-pill combinations (SPCs) preferred over separate agents when convenience is a significant consideration. Additionally, the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks (ISHB) recommends a RAS blocker-diuretic or CCB combination in patients.

### Medication adherence-still the holy grail [^115EkV4K]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Fixed‐dose combination antihypertensive products have been commercially available for decades and, over time, have grown in number. Most are based on a thiazide diuretic backbone (usually hydrochlorothiazide but sometimes chlorthalidone) with the addition of various other classes of antihypertensive medications, including β‐blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers. There are also two‐drug combinations that include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor plus calcium channel blocker or ARB plus calcium channel blocker, and three‐drug combinations including hydrochlorothiazide, a calcium channel blocker, and an ARB. Within each combination product, multiple dosing options for each drug within the combination are available to align with a patient's individual dose needs. Importantly, all of the fixed‐dose combination products are available in a generic formulation, which decreases the costs for patients.

Recently, data were presented from the Diuretic Comparison Project, which compared chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide at equipotent doses in the first-line treatment of hypertension for patients in the Veterans Administration health system. After five years of follow‐up, there was no difference in the primary outcome of first occurrence of stroke, noncancer death, or myocardial infarction.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112M43u5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension significantly increases the risk of organ damage and mortality, especially in patients with previous cardiovascular (CV) events, diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and renal impairment. Most patients with hypertension require at least two antihypertensive medications to reach blood pressure (BP) targets. Therefore, identifying the most suitable combination regimen based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is crucial for effective risk management.

Single-pill combinations (SPCs), which contain two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action, offer advantages over free-drug combinations. These advantages include simplified treatment regimens, increased convenience, and reduced costs. The improved adherence and convenience associated with SPC use are acknowledged in updated hypertension guidelines.

Despite a wide array of SPCs available for hypertension treatment, there is a lack of clinical evidence from direct head-to-head comparisons to guide the selection of treatments for individual patients. However, in patients with renal disease or at high risk for developing renal disease — such as those with diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria, and high-normal BP or overt hypertension — guidelines recommend renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker-based combination therapy due to its superior renoprotective effects compared to other antihypertensive classes. Additionally, RAS inhibitors mitigate the edema and renal hyperfiltration associated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, making them a favorable choice for combination therapy.

May be administered with or without food.

- **Dosage and administration**: When used for cardiovascular risk reduction, monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate, adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be necessary.

- **Hypertension**: Dosage must be individualized. The usual starting dose of Micardis tablets is 40 mg orally once a day. Blood pressure response is dose-related over the range of 20 to 80 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within two weeks, and maximal reduction is generally attained after four weeks. No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis may develop orthostatic hypotension; their blood pressure should be closely monitored. Micardis tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents and may be taken with or without food.

- **Cardiovascular risk reduction**: The recommended dose of Micardis tablets is 80 mg once a day and can be administered with or without food. It is not known whether doses lower than 80 mg of telmisartan are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. When initiating Micardis therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction, monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, and if appropriate, adjustment of medications that lower blood pressure may be necessary.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the eighth joint national committee (JNC 8) [^115zZzeq]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically in choosing antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the JNC8 2014 guidelines recommend adding and titrating a third drug from the provided list if the goal blood pressure (BP) cannot be reached with two drugs. Do not use an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) together in the same patient.

### Azor [^116FSjxP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Amlodipine. Following the administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; therefore, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/−2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or volume.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^111ZpKtH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Potassium abnormalities**: In the controlled trial of amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with the combination therapy, compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with dual therapies. Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium levels on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, occurring more frequently in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia, which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. It is important to monitor serum electrolytes periodically. If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs such as muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations, amlodipine, valsartan, and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: Little to no rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and interrelated pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, with the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use. Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option.

Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Therapy insight: How changes in renal function with increasing age affect cardiovascular drug prescribing [^1179HFWV]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Age is well recognized as a powerful prognostic factor in the setting of cardiovascular disease. With the aging of the US population, it is projected that more than 50 million people will be aged over 65 years by the year 2020. This growing elderly population has increased rates of morbidity and mortality owing to cardiovascular disease; however, proven therapies for prevention and treatment are often underused in older patients, largely because physicians perceive them as being frail and have limited understanding of age-related unique adverse and therapeutic effects.

Advancing age is associated with a number of physiological and pathophysiological changes that impact the toxic effects, efficacy, and dosing of many medications. Decreases in lean muscle mass affect the volume of distribution, and reductions in hepatic function affect the metabolism of many medications. Age-related reductions in renal function might have the most profound impact on the safety profile and dosing of medications in elderly patients. The strong association between renal and cardiovascular disease makes recognition of renal dysfunction and appropriate dose adjustment particularly important in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. This article reviews approaches to the estimation of renal function and unique considerations related to prescribing medication for elderly patients with concomitant renal and cardiovascular disease.

### Drug dosage adjustment in hospitalized patients with renal impairment at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia [^113eTHjC]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The metabolism and excretion of many drugs and their pharmacologically active metabolites depend on normal renal function. In patients with kidney dysfunction, the renal excretion of the parent drug and its metabolites is impaired, leading to their excessive accumulation in the body. Furthermore, the plasma protein binding of drugs may be significantly reduced, which in turn can influence the pharmacokinetic processes of distribution and elimination. The activity of several drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters has been shown to be impaired in chronic renal failure.

Medication dosing errors are the most critical drug-related problems in patients with renal impairment. Inappropriate dosing in patients with kidney disease can cause toxicity or ineffective therapy. In particular, older patients are at a higher risk of developing advanced disease and related adverse events due to age-related decline in renal function and the use of multiple medications to treat co-morbid conditions. Drug accumulation and toxicity can develop rapidly if dosages are not adjusted in patients with impaired renal function. Drug elimination by the kidneys correlates with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), so it is logical to use eGFR or eCrCl for adjusting dosages in patients with renal failure.

Drug dosing in renal insufficiency needs to be individualized whenever possible to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize toxicity. The two major approaches are to either lengthen the interval between doses or to reduce the dose.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management.

Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration, and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects.

A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and…

### Olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide in participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or chronic cardiovascular disease: a subanalysis of the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group TRINITY study [^112r3dV3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). High credibility.

The subgroup analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of triple-combination treatment in difficult-to-treat participants with hypertension and diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Blood pressure (BP) reductions with triple-combination treatment in these subgroups at week 12 were comparable to those for the overall study cohort (−37/22 mm Hg). Long-term treatment with varying doses of olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide (OM/AML/HCTZ) in these subgroups resulted in similar BP-lowering effects for those receiving triple-combination treatment during the double-blind period of the study. Triple-combination treatment also enabled these high-risk subgroups to achieve BP goals (< 130/80 mm Hg) at week 12 and at week 52. This treatment was well tolerated in these subgroups, with a low percentage of participants discontinuing treatment across treatment groups and no clinically meaningful differences in adverse events (AEs). The presence of diabetes, CKD, or chronic CVD did not change the AE profile of the drugs used in this analysis from that observed in the total TRINITY study cohort.

It has been estimated that at least 75% of patients with hypertension require combination therapy to maintain BP control, and large clinical trials have reported that 23–54% of participants require three or more antihypertensive agents. Thus, there is a growing emphasis on the need for practical strategies to consistently achieve and maintain BP goals with the use of multiple antihypertensive agents in clinical practice.

Single-pill combination therapy may improve BP control through regimen simplification, which may lead to an improvement in patient adherence.

### Adding a new medication versus maximizing dose to intensify hypertension treatment in older adults: A retrospective observational study [^1131D927]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There are two approaches to intensifying antihypertensive treatment when target blood pressure is not reached: adding a new medication and maximizing dose. Which strategy is better is unknown.

- **Objective**: To assess the frequency of intensification by adding a new medication versus maximizing dose, as well as the association of each method with intensification sustainability and follow-up systolic blood pressure (SBP).

- **Design**: Large-scale, population-based, retrospective cohort study. Observational data were used to emulate a target trial with two groups, new medication and maximizing dose, who underwent intensification of their drug regimen.

- **Setting**: Veterans Health Administration (2011 to 2013).

- **Patients**: Veterans aged 65 years or older with hypertension, an SBP of 130 mm Hg or higher, and at least one antihypertensive medication at less than the maximum dose.

- **Measurements**: The following two intensification approaches were emulated: adding a new medication, defined as a total dose increase with new medication, and maximizing dose, defined as a total dose increase without new medication. Inverse probability weighting was used to assess the observational effectiveness of the intensification approach on sustainability of intensified treatment and follow-up SBP at 3 and 12 months.

- **Results**: Among 178,562 patients, 45,575 (25.5%) had intensification by adding a new medication and 132,987 (74.5%) by maximizing dose. Compared with maximizing dose, adding a new medication was associated with less intensification sustainability (average treatment effect, -15.2% [95% CI, -15%).

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, and lipids.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014), and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

### Renoprotection: A matter of blood pressure reduction or agent-characteristics [^111STRVJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Data from recent clinical trials show that lowering blood pressure (BP) reduces the rate of renal function loss in chronic renal disease. There is evidence supporting the assertion that BP lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect in both diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. However, to dissociate BP-dependent and non-BP-dependent action of RAAS blockade, the relevant trials are often flawed by design, resulting in BP differences between the comparative antihypertensive strategies. This review discusses whether the relevant literature allows for the conclusion that RAAS intervention has renoprotective effects in addition to its effects on BP.

- **Antiproteinuric action**: The main evidence for a specific renoprotective action of RAAS blockade is provided by its consistent antiproteinuric action, which cannot be completely attributed to the reduction in BP. Indeed, other strategies that lower proteinuria without having an antihypertensive effect, such as reducing dietary protein intake or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, appear to have a renoprotective effect as well. Interestingly, a consistent finding across different intervention studies is that the more proteinuria is reduced, the better the kidney appears to be protected. Therefore, it is concluded that the agent-characteristics of RAAS intervention (i.e. antiproteinuric properties) independently influence renal function loss in addition to its BP-lowering effect.

Future studies should further explore the renoprotective benefit of non-antihypertensive strategies.

### Kidney function and clinical recommendations of drug dose adjustment in geriatric patients [^115PZQGH]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Estimation of glomerular filtration rate

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using two serum creatinine-based equations and three cystatin C-based equations, which are listed below:

- **Cockroft-Gault equation**: Used for serum creatinine-based estimation.

- **MDRD equation**: Another method for serum creatinine-based calculation.

- **Grubb equation**: A cystatin C-based estimation.

- **Hoek equation**: Another cystatin C-based methodology.

- **Perkins equation**: Uses the Simple Cystatin C formula.

The serum creatinine-based equations include the Cockroft-Gault (CG) equation, adjusted for body surface area by the DuBois formula, and the abbreviated four-variable MDRD equation. The cystatin C-based equations include the Grubb equation, the Hoek equation, and the Perkins equation. The CG and MDRD equations were chosen due to their common usage and familiarity to practitioners. The Hoek and Grubb equations, based on European study populations, were selected for their suitability to our study population, while the Perkins equation offers practicality for daily use, including home visits due to its simplicity and ease of calculation on a pocket calculator.

Verification of drug dose adjustment to renal function

For each estimated GFR (eGFR) value, each patient's drug doses, according to their actually prescribed medication and estimated renal function, were verified using several literature references. Five different references, mentioned in the Background section, were consulted in our study. We selected references that are easily accessible and commonly used in daily clinical practice in the US, Great Britain, and Germany. More extensive pharmaceutical literature references were not included, as we aimed to examine tools suitable for practical use.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^117BdqoR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Geriatric**: Elderly patients exhibit decreased clearance of amlodipine, resulting in increased peak plasma levels, elimination half-life, and area under the curve (AUC). For valsartan, exposure (measured by AUC) is higher by 70%, and the half-life is 35% longer in the elderly compared to the young. No dosage adjustment is necessary.

	- **Gender**: The pharmacokinetics of valsartan do not differ significantly between males and females.

	- **Renal insufficiency**:
		- **Amlodipine**: The pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by renal impairment.
		- **Valsartan**: There is no apparent correlation between renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) and exposure (measured by AUC) in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Dose adjustment is not required for mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction. No studies have been performed in patients with severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min). Valsartan is not removed by hemodialysis, so exercise caution with dosing in severe renal disease.

	- **Hepatic insufficiency**: Patients with hepatic insufficiency experience decreased clearance of amlodipine, leading to an increase in AUC by approximately 40% to 60%.

### Renal considerations in the treatment of hypertension [^114eZqGc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

There are renal implications when employing intensive blood pressure control strategies. This approach provides cardiovascular benefits in patients with and without chronic kidney disease; however, the impact on renal disease progression differs according to the pattern of underlying renal injury.

In the setting of proteinuria, stringent blood pressure control generally confers a protective effect on renal disease progression, but in the absence of proteinuria, this benefit tends to be much less impressive. Thiazide diuretics are frequently part of the regimen to achieve intensive blood pressure control. These drugs can cause hyponatremia and present with biochemical evidence mimicking the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.

Altered prostaglandin transport may explain the unique susceptibility to this complication observed in some patients. Hyperkalemia is also a complication of intensive blood pressure lowering, particularly in the context of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade. There are strategies and new drugs now available that allow the use of these blockers while ensuring a normal plasma potassium concentration.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: what class of drug to use first-line? This review addresses that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: An electronic search of MEDLINE (January 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Register was conducted using the standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of the six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment were selected. More than 70% of participants must have had blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84).

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, especially in managing resistant HTN (hypertension), the ESH 2023 guidelines recommend close monitoring of patients with resistant HTN. This includes periodic ambulatory BP (blood pressure) monitoring and assessment of HTN-mediated organ damage, particularly concerning kidney function and serum potassium levels. Regular home BP monitoring, along with monitoring of drug adherence, should also be attempted.
