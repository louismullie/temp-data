## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the likely cause, recommended tests, and treatment for a 17-year-old with low-grade fever, marked tachypnea, chest/back pain, and negative influenza/COVID-19/streptococcal testing — focusing on differential diagnosis, diagnostic strategy, and initial management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely and most dangerous causes of pleuritic chest pain in an adolescent. Then, I should verify which initial tests are evidence-based and time-sensitive. Next, I will examine when to pursue targeted microbiologic testing versus avoiding low-yield panels. After that, I need to assess severity and determine site of care. Finally, I will consider initial empiric therapy, symptom control, and follow-up contingencies, while double-checking for complications like effusions or pulmonary embolism that would change management.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome-level probability anchors. Fever, significant tachypnea (35/min), and pleuritic chest/back pain after negative common viral and strep testing raise the pretest probability of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and in adolescents the odds of an atypical etiology such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae increase, although history/exam alone cannot establish etiology with high certainty; tachypnea and fever meaningfully increase the likelihood of radiographic pneumonia, but imaging confirmation is still standard in this context [^111sa4KA] [^116fz6M8] [^111yU9kA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — must-not-miss diagnoses need parallel consideration. Pleuritic chest pain obliges evaluation for pulmonary embolism using a validated decision pathway, even if the pretest probability in a healthy teen might be low; similarly, pneumothorax and pericarditis/myopericarditis are critical alternatives to exclude given tachypnea and chest pain, with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) considered if a non-ischemic cardiac cause is suspected [^112kotWt] [^111piybs] [^116CDa7c].

> I need to check the immediate test strategy. A chest radiograph (CXR) is recommended for unexplained pleuritic chest pain to evaluate for pneumonia and other causes; reassessing vitals and obtaining pulse oximetry are essential to risk stratify for respiratory compromise; lung ultrasound can be a helpful adjunct (high sensitivity/specificity for bacterial pneumonia and excellent for detecting effusions and pneumothorax), but CXR remains the first-line standard for CAP confirmation in this setting [^116wb9HA] [^111ukg7W] [^1129ekny].

> Wait, let me verify the role of CT. I initially thought a CT might expedite diagnosis, but I should correct that impulse: CT is not first-line for suspected CAP; it can be reserved for equivocal cases to reclassify uncertain diagnoses and potentially reduce inappropriate antibiotics when the probability is intermediate or an alternative diagnosis is suspected after initial imaging and clinical assessment [^112SKERq].

> Next, I should review microbiologic testing. In school-aged and adolescent patients with suspected atypical CAP, obtaining Mycoplasma pneumoniae testing is reasonable if results are available in a clinically relevant timeframe to guide antibiotic selection; conversely, broad multiplex noninfluenza respiratory PCR panels should generally be avoided in the ED to limit unnecessary antibiotic initiation, and noninfluenza viral testing is mainly considered in hospitalized patients with severe CAP or immunocompromising conditions [^111sa4KA] [^113HibVu] [^113qzNpg] [^116b4DFn].

> I will now examine the PE workup pathway. I should confirm pretest probability and, if not low, add D-dimer and proceed to CT pulmonary angiography if indicated by the decision rule; recognizing that adult rules are better validated than pediatric ones, I need to ensure clinical judgment accounts for age, risk factors, and exam findings before imaging escalation in a 17-year-old with pleuritic chest pain and tachypnea [^112kotWt] [^111zogSw].

> Let me think about severity and the site of care. I should verify for hypoxemia, increased work of breathing, dehydration, or hemodynamic instability to decide on ED management versus outpatient care; in adolescents with suspected CAP and tachypnea of 35/min, disposition hinges on oxygenation, distress, comorbidities, and social support, with pediatric CAP frameworks emphasizing clinical assessment for respiratory distress and the overall impression to guide admission decisions [^111sa4KA] [^116fz6M8].

> Now for initial empiric therapy — hold on, I should confirm the likely pathogen profile. For an adolescent outpatient with suspected atypical CAP, a macrolide is recommended by pediatric IDSA/PIDS guidelines; azithromycin is active against Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, though I need to be mindful of macrolide resistance patterns and consider a beta-lactam if typical bacterial CAP is suspected instead of atypical predominance or if local resistance undermines macrolide efficacy [^111sa4KA] [^116iTkk9] [^111sa4KA].

> For symptom control, I should confirm safe analgesia choices. NSAIDs are appropriate for pleuritic pain unless contraindications exist; I need to ensure adequate hydration, antipyretic use as needed, and clear return precautions for worsening dyspnea, persistent tachypnea, hypoxemia, or new hemoptysis, with reassessment in 48–72 hours to confirm clinical response [^116yLNyX].

> But wait, what if imaging suggests an effusion? I should double-check for parapneumonic effusion or empyema with ultrasound guidance and, if present and clinically significant, obtain pleural fluid for diagnostic studies including WBC with differential to help distinguish bacterial etiologies, recognizing its role in guiding drainage and antibiotic decisions [^117A5Er8] [^116hK7Pv].

> Let me reconsider follow-up imaging. Routine repeat CXR is not required if the patient improves clinically; if symptoms persist or worsen despite therapy, I should re-evaluate for complications, alternative diagnoses, or PE and consider advanced imaging or echocardiography selectively when non-ischemic cardiac or thromboembolic etiologies remain in play after initial testing [^116wb9HA] [^116CDa7c].

> In summary, I need to ensure a stepwise plan: obtain CXR and pulse oximetry now, treat pain, evaluate PE risks pragmatically, and, if CAP is supported and the patient is stable for outpatient care, start macrolide therapy targeting atypical pathogens while sending Mycoplasma testing if timely; avoid broad multiplex viral panels in the ED, escalate diagnostics for effusion or PE when indicated, and arrange close 48–72 hour follow-up with clear safety-net instructions for deterioration [^116wb9HA] [^111sa4KA] [^113qzNpg] [^112kotWt].

The most likely cause is **atypical pneumonia** [^111sa4KA] (Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae [^113HibVu]), given fever, tachypnea [^111yU9kA], chest/back pain, and negative influenza, COVID-19, and streptococcal tests. Obtain a **chest X-ray** to confirm pneumonia and exclude pneumothorax or effusion [^116wb9HA]; if inconclusive, add **POCUS** [^117Y6jfL] or chest CT [^112SKERq]. Start empiric **azithromycin** [^111sa4KA] for atypical coverage, provide NSAIDs for pain [^116yLNyX], and monitor for complications [^113JQDfQ]. Escalate care if hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, or clinical deterioration develop [^111ukg7W].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Atypical pneumonia**, e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae [^111sa4KA].

- **Bacterial pneumonia**, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Staphylococcus aureus [^113HibVu] [^113JQDfQ].

- **Viral pneumonia**, e.g. other respiratory viruses (e.g. RSV, adenovirus) [^116fz6M8].

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)** is less likely but should be considered in adolescents with pleuritic chest pain [^111piybs].

- **Pneumothorax**, spontaneous or secondary to underlying lung disease [^113G3N6G].

- **Musculoskeletal pain** such as costochondritis or muscle strain [^115bP4UB].

- **Pericarditis or myocarditis** are inflammatory cardiac conditions [^116CDa7c].

Given the negative influenza, COVID-19, and streptococcal tests, **atypical pneumonia remains the most likely diagnosis** [^113HibVu].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Chest X-ray (CXR) | Confirm pneumonia; exclude pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or other abnormalities [^116wb9HA] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Assess for leukocytosis or leukopenia, suggesting bacterial or viral infection [^11331Ns8] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin | Inflammatory markers to differentiate bacterial from viral infection [^112wzyj6] |
| Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae PCR or serology | Confirm atypical pneumonia [^113HibVu] [^111sa4KA] |
| D-dimer (if PE suspected) | Rule out pulmonary embolism [^111piybs] |
| Electrocardiogram (ECG) | Rule out cardiac involvement (pericarditis, myocarditis) [^116CDa7c] |
| Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) | Evaluate for pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation [^117Y6jfL] [^117A5Er8] |

---

## Initial treatment plan

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy** [^111sa4KA] with azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days) [^111LVtWD] or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7–10 days) to cover atypical pathogens.

- **Supportive care** includes antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for fever and pain control [^116yLNyX], adequate hydration, and rest [^113JQDfQ].

- **Monitoring** involves regular assessment of respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and clinical improvement [^111ukg7W].

- **Escalation of care** warrants hospitalization if hypoxia (SpO2 < 92%), hemodynamic instability, or clinical deterioration occurs [^111feA8k].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Respiratory failure** resulting from progressive pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^113JQDfQ].

- **Pleural effusion or empyema** with accumulation of fluid or pus in the pleural space [^117A5Er8].

- **Sepsis** with systemic infection leading to multi-organ dysfunction [^113JQDfQ].

- **Chronic respiratory symptoms** such as persistent cough, wheezing, or bronchiectasis [^113JQDfQ].

- **Cardiac complications** including myocarditis or pericarditis [^116CDa7c].

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

With appropriate antibiotics and supportive care, the prognosis for atypical pneumonia in adolescents is **generally excellent** [^116fz6M8]. Most patients experience significant improvement within 48–72 hours of treatment initiation, and complete recovery typically occurs within 2–3 weeks. Persistent symptoms beyond this period may indicate complications or alternative diagnoses and warrant further evaluation.

---

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is **atypical pneumonia** (Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae) [^111sa4KA]. Recommended diagnostic tests include chest X-ray [^116wb9HA], CBC, CRP, procalcitonin [^112wzyj6], and PCR or serology for atypical pathogens. Initial treatment involves empiric antibiotic therapy (azithromycin or doxycycline) [^111LVtWD], supportive care, and monitoring for complications. Prognosis is generally excellent with appropriate treatment, with recovery expected within 2–3 weeks [^116fz6M8].

### Computed tomography scan contribution to the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia [^112SKERq]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Recent studies have unveiled a high incidence of misdiagnosis in pneumonia. CT scans can improve the diagnosis reclassification of 8–18% of patients. CT scans are especially useful to rule out pneumonia and have a maximal impact in the category of patients with an intermediate probability of disease. This diagnostic rectification may lower inappropriate antibiotic prescription and allow timely identification of an alternative cause of a patient's symptoms. The clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic strategy incorporating CT scans for patients suspected of pneumonia should be tested in further studies.

### Integrating point-of-care ultrasound in the ED evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath [^117Y6jfL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The differential diagnoses of patients presenting with chest pain (CP) and shortness of breath (SOB) are broad and non-specific. We aimed to:

- **Determine the impact of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)**: on emergency physicians' differential diagnosis.
- **Evaluate the accuracy of POCUS**: when compared to chest radiograph (CXR) and composite final diagnosis.

We conducted a prospective observational study with a convenience sample of patients presenting with CP and SOB to the Emergency Department (ED). Treating physicians selected possible diagnoses from a pre-indexed list of causes of CP and SOB. The final composite diagnosis from a chart review was determined as the reference standard for the diagnosis. The primary analysis involved calculations of sensitivity and specificity for POCUS identifiable diagnoses in detecting the cause of CP and SOB. Additional comparative accuracy analysis with CXRs was conducted.

In the study, 128 patients with a mean age of 64 ± 17 years were included. Using a reference standard of composite final diagnoses, POCUS demonstrated equal or higher specificity compared to CXR for all indications for which it was used, except for pneumonia. POCUS correctly identified all patients with pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. In patients with a normal thoracic ultrasound, CXR never provided any actionable clinical information. Adding POCUS to the initial evaluation significantly narrowed the differential diagnoses, reducing the median differential diagnosis from 5 (IQR 3–6) to 3 (IQR 2–4), p < 0.

### Epidemiology and risk factors of pediatric chest pain: A systematic review [^115bP4UB]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The epidemiology and associated risk factors of pediatric chest pain are not well described. Several studies report the prevalence of chest pain types among children and adolescents; however, detailed prospective studies that aim to determine continued morbidity, mortality, health-care-seeking behaviors, continued medication use, and quality of life are lacking. A greater understanding of pediatric chest pain epidemiology and risk factors is required.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^11331Ns8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, the potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and the associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, while the prognosis is crucial in deciding the site of care.

This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection.

Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis. However, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history and physical examination is essential.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and the resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present significant diagnostic evaluation challenges. These challenges range from understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognize patients in need of critical care, to evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate, rapid, and point‐of‐care testing. The diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and focuses solely on the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

- **Target condition being diagnosed**: COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms), mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest), severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need), or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome).

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Usual suspect and unsecured diagnosis in the acute setting [^113Q7ima]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common known bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract, especially in patients between 5 and 30 years of age. It may be encountered at a relatively high rate in the non-life-threatened fraction of Emergency Department (ED) patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms or cough. Yet, its hallmarks are very non-specific, including a great variety of presentations from mild pharyngitis to potentially life-threatening complications such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

Here, we describe a typical case of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a young adult with mild pharyngitis as the leading symptom. Disease presentation, complications, diagnostic means, therapeutic options, and suspicious clinical settings are discussed to provide a review of the clinical aspects of the disease that are important in the ED setting.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care tests in acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129ekny]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Point-of-care tests could be essential in differentiating bacterial and viral acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections and driving antibiotic stewardship in the community.

- **Objectives**: To assess diagnostic test accuracy of point-of-care tests in community settings for acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

- **Data sources**: Multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Open Gray) from inception to 31 May 2021, without language restrictions.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Diagnostic test accuracy studies involving patients at primary care, outpatient clinic, emergency department, and long-term care facilities with a clinical suspicion of acute community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. The comparator was any test used as a comparison to the index test. In order not to limit the study inclusion, the comparator was not defined a priori.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Four investigators independently extracted data, rated risk of bias, and assessed the quality using QUADAS-2.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: The measures of diagnostic test accuracy were calculated with 95% CI.

- **Results**: A total of 421 studies addressed at least one point-of-care test. The diagnostic performance of molecular tests was higher compared with that of rapid diagnostic tests for all the pathogens studied. The accuracy of stand-alone signs and symptoms or biomarkers was poor. Lung ultrasound showed high sensitivity and specificity (90% for both) for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist-a pictorial essay [^114m3Q12]. Insights into Imaging (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 pneumonia represents the most severe pandemic of the twenty-first century and has crucial clinical, social, and economic implications. The scientific community has focused attention and resources on the clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, few papers analyzing the vast spectrum of differential diagnoses have been published.

- **Main body**: The complexity of differential diagnosis lies in the evidence of similar radiological findings, such as ground-glass opacities, crazy paving patterns, and consolidations in COVID-19 pneumonia and a multitude of other lung diseases. Differential diagnosis is and will be extremely important during and after the pandemic peak when there are fewer COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present COVID-19 pneumonia's most frequent differential diagnoses to help the radiologist face the COVID-19 pneumonia challenge.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical data, laboratory tests, and imaging are pillars of a trident that allow us to reach a correct diagnosis to ensure excellent allocation of human and economic resources. The radiologist has a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia as they may raise suspicion of the pathology and help to avoid the COVID-19 virus spread.

### Mimickers of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest CT: Spectrum of CT and clinical features [^111v5xDi]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A broad spectrum of pulmonary conditions demonstrates imaging features that mimic those of COVID-19 and are difficult to differentiate from it. Awareness of these conditions, careful radiologic analysis, and attention to the clinical data are required to prevent an erroneous diagnosis that could potentially adversely impact management and patients' outcomes. A correct diagnosis of these conditions may prevent unnecessary hospitalization and reduce strict quarantine measures for all suspected patients, which holds significant pressure on healthcare providers and medical infrastructure.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^112wzyj6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 and in identifying people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 include troublesome dry cough (such as coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period or having three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8°C, diarrhea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, increased respiratory rate (above 20 breaths per minute), increased heart rate (above 100 beats per minute), chest tightness, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, blue lips or face, and temperature above 38°C. Hypoxia based on measuring pulse oximetry is often used, with various arbitrary thresholds (for example, 93%).

- **Routinely available biomarkers**: Routinely available biomarkers for infection and inflammation may be considered in the investigation of people with possible COVID‐19. For example, many healthcare facilities have access to standard laboratory tests for infection, such as C‐reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, measures of anticoagulation, and white blood cell count with different lymphocyte subsets. Evaluation of these commonly available tests, particularly in low‐resource settings, may be helpful for the triage of people with potential COVID‐19.

- **Imaging tests**: Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and CT are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to identify COVID‐19 pneumonia.

### Felodipine extended-release tablets [^112npofp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Adverse events occurred in 0.5% to 1.5% of patients who received felodipine extended-release tablets in all controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day. Serious adverse events occurred at a lower rate, or events were reported during marketing experience. These lower-rate events are in italics. Events are listed in order of decreasing severity within each category, and the relationship of these events to administration of felodipine extended-release tablets is uncertain:

- **Body as a whole**: Chest pain, facial edema, flu-like illness
- **Cardiovascular**: Myocardial infarction, hypotension, syncope, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, tachycardia, premature beats
- **Digestive**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, dry mouth, flatulence, acid regurgitation
- **Endocrine**: Gynecomastia
- **Hematologic**: Anemia
- **Metabolic**: ALT (SGPT) increased
- **Musculoskeletal**:
	- **Joint and muscle pain**: Arthralgia, back pain, leg pain, foot pain, muscle cramps, myalgia, arm pain, knee pain, hip pain
- **Nervous/psychiatric**:
	- **Sleep disorders**: Insomnia
	- **Mood disorders**: Depression, anxiety disorders, irritability, nervousness
	- **Other**: Somnolence, decreased libido
- **Respiratory**:
	- **Infections and inflammation**: Bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, respiratory infection
	- **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, epistaxis
- **Skin**: Angioedema, contusion, erythema, urticaria, leukocytoclastic vasculitis
- **Special senses**: Visual disturbances
- **Urogenital**: Impotence, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, dysuria, polyuria

Gingival hyperplasia — usually mild — occurred in less than 0.5% of patients in controlled studies. This condition may be avoided or may regress with proper management.

### Recurrent rash in an 11-year-old boy with pericardial and pleural effusions [^112cSXw1]. Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old, previously healthy boy presented to the emergency center (EC) with acute respiratory distress, following 5 months of recurring and worsening rash accompanied by progressive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Initially, the patient and his younger brothers were diagnosed with roseola. Although his brothers' symptoms resolved, the boy's rash recurred, leading his primary care provider to prescribe amoxicillin. The rash subsequently worsened with amoxicillin, prompting its discontinuation and initiation of a prednisone course, which alleviated the rash temporarily. Upon completion of the prednisone course, the rash returned more diffusely, along with shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough. Due to these symptoms, his mother brought him to the EC.

Upon examination, he exhibited tachypnea and tachycardia. Initial imaging was notable for an echocardiogram showing mild to moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, a chest X-ray (CXR) indicating a large right pleural effusion, and chest computerized tomography revealing prominent and diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, along with numerous enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, d-dimer, and brain natriuretic peptide. The differential diagnosis considered infectious, oncologic, and rheumatologic etiologies. Our panel of experts reviews the evaluation, hospital course, and treatment of this patient presenting with an unusual rash and serositis.

### Costochondral autograft as a salvage procedure after failed trapeziectomy in trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis [^114HsPnz]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis at the base of the thumb is a common problem, especially in women. Among the many surgical procedures aimed at restoring the function of the trapeziometacarpal joint, total trapeziectomy has been shown to provide good long-term results in most patients. However, some patients may experience continued pain, leading the surgeon to consider a revision procedure. This study reports on the use of costochondral autograft as interposition material in the revision of trapeziectomy for trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis and evaluates its usefulness.

The study design was retrospective. All patients received a costochondral autograft as a revision procedure following a failed trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction. Patients were clinically assessed before and after surgery with a follow-up period of 24 months. Results were categorized as follows: good, indicating complete relief of pain; fair, indicating persistent mild pain and stiffness; and poor, indicating no relief of pain or improvement with revision surgery.

Four patients were included in the study, with results showing 2 good outcomes, 2 fair outcomes, and no poor outcomes. Pain relief was achieved in all patients. Thumb opposition improved slightly in one patient, while the remaining three showed no change. There was no change in pinch strength. Additionally, one case of iatrogenic injury to the sensory branch of the radial nerve was observed.

In conclusion, costochondral autograft as a revision procedure after failed trapeziectomy is considered a reliable option. These preliminary outcomes indicate that the results are not as favorable when compared with soft-tissue interposition. Nevertheless, in cases of iterative failures, the use of costochondral autograft may still be a viable option.

### Atypical pneumonia — time to breathe new life into a useful term [^115GqbRu]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The term atypical pneumonia was originally used to describe an unusual presentation of pneumonia. It is now more widely used in reference to either pneumonia caused by a relatively common group of pathogens or to a distinct clinical syndrome, the existence of which is difficult to demonstrate. As such, the use of atypical pneumonia is often inaccurate, potentially confusing, and of dubious scientific merit. We need to return to the original meaning of atypical pneumonia and restrict its use to describe pneumonia that is truly unusual in clinical presentation or epidemiology, or both.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation for non-ischemic cardiac causes such as myopericarditis, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This is to determine the presence of ventricular wall motion abnormalities, pericardial effusion, valvular abnormalities, or restrictive physiology in patients with acute chest pain and suspected myopericarditis.

Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.

- **Resistance**: Azithromycin demonstrates cross-resistance with erythromycin. The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is the modification of the 23S rRNA target, most often by methylation. Ribosomal modifications can lead to cross-resistance to other macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype).

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:
	- **Gram-positive bacteria**:
		- Staphylococcus aureus
		- Streptococcus pneumoniae
	- **Gram-negative bacteria**:
		- Haemophilus influenzae
		- Moraxella catarrhalis
		- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
		- Legionella pneumophila
	- **Other bacteria**:
		- Chlamydophila pneumoniae
		- Chlamydia trachomatis
		- Mycoplasma pneumoniae
		- Mycoplasma hominis

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections is not established for these bacteria.

### Tibsovo [^1125WSxx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety profile of single-agent Tibsovo was studied in 28 adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with 500 mg daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The median duration of exposure to Tibsovo was 4.3 months, with a range of 0.3 to 40.9 months. Ten patients (36%) were exposed to Tibsovo for at least 6 months, and 6 patients (21%) were exposed for at least 1 year.

- **Common serious adverse reactions**: Included differentiation syndrome (18%), prolonged electrocardiogram QT (7%), and fatigue (7%). There was one case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).

- **Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption (≥ 10%)**: Included prolonged electrocardiogram QT (14%) and differentiation syndrome (11%). Two (7%) patients required a dose reduction due to prolonged electrocardiogram QT. One patient each required permanent discontinuation due to diarrhea and PRES.

Tables detailing the most common adverse reactions reported in the trial and changes in selected post-baseline laboratory values observed in patients with newly diagnosed AML were referenced but not shown here.

### Epidemiology of sarcopenia and insight into possible therapeutic targets [^114J4cbG]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal aging is a major public health concern owing to demographic shifts in the population. Sarcopenia, generally defined as the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is associated with a considerable risk of falls, loss of independence in older adults, and hospitalization with poorer health outcomes. This condition is therefore associated with increased morbidity and health care costs. As with bone mass, muscle mass and strength increase during late adolescence and early adulthood but begin to decline substantially from approximately 50 years of age.

Sarcopenia is characterized by many features, including loss of muscle mass, altered muscle composition, infiltration with fat and fibrous tissue, and alterations in innervation. A better understanding of these factors might help us to develop strategies targeting these effects. However, at the time of writing, methodological challenges and controversies regarding how best to define the condition, in addition to uncertainty about what outcome measures to consider, have delayed research into possible therapeutic options.

Most pharmacological agents investigated at the time of writing are hormonal, although new developments have seen the emergence of agents that target myostatin signaling to increase muscle mass. This review considers the approaches for defining sarcopenia and discusses its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic opportunities.

### Mucoid degeneration of the anterior cruciate ligament corrected with autograft reconstruction [^112cnywu]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured knee ligament, typically in non-contact athletic injuries in young adults. Mucoid degeneration of the ACL (ACL-MD) is an uncommon pathology wherein the deposition of glycosaminoglycans within the collagenous bundles leads to hypertrophy, loss of full knee flexion, and knee pain without instability. ACL-MD usually presents in individuals over 40 years with sudden-onset knee pain after minimal trauma or as an incidental MRI finding. However, it is rarely described in young adults. We present a case of ACL-MD in a previously healthy adult in his early 20s, who exhibited three months of persistent dull left knee pain and limited range of motion following a minor twisting injury. This case underscores the importance of critically assessing anatomical structures when encountering musculoskeletal pathologies and considering the unique presentations of musculoskeletal diseases in atypical age groups.

### Severe pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila: Differential diagnosis and therapeutic considerations [^117G9rqS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Severe Legionella pneumonia poses a diagnostic challenge and requires early intervention. Legionnaire's disease can have several presenting signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities that suggest Legionella pneumophila is the pathogen, but none are sufficient to distinguish L. pneumophila pneumonia from other respiratory pathogens. L. pneumophila is primarily an intracellular pathogen and needs treatment with antibiotics that efficiently enter the intracellular space.

### Patterns of repeated diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes [^115e3Kje]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

While the COVID-19 diagnostic test has a high false-negative rate, not everyone who initially tests negative is re-tested. Michigan Medicine, a primary regional center, provided an ideal setting for studying testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic.

- **Objectives**: To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with downstream outcomes amongst positive cases.

- **Methods**: Characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for patients presenting for a COVID-19 diagnostic test were collected. We examined whether patient characteristics differed with repeated testing and estimated a false-negative rate for the test. We then studied repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19-related outcomes.

- **Results**: Patient age, sex, body mass index, neighborhood poverty levels, pre-existing type 2 diabetes, and circulatory, kidney, and liver diseases, as well as cough, fever/chills, and pain symptoms 14 days prior to a first test, were associated with repeated testing. Amongst patients with a positive result, age (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: (1.05, 1.34)) and pre-existing kidney diseases (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: (1.41, 3.68)) remained significant. Hospitalization (OR: 7.88; 95% CI: (5.15, 12.26)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6.93; 95% CI: (4.44, 10.92)) were associated with repeated testing. The estimated false-negative rate was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)).

- **Conclusions**: While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset underwent multiple rounds of testing.

### Covid-19 pneumonia: The great radiological mimicker [^115vdvZr]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide since December 2019. Although the reference diagnostic test is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest-computed tomography (CT) has been frequently used in diagnosis because of the low sensitivity rates of RT-PCR. CT findings of COVID-19 are well described in the literature and include predominantly peripheral, bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs), a combination of GGOs with consolidations, and/or septal thickening creating a "crazy-paving" pattern. Longitudinal changes of typical CT findings and less reported findings, such as air bronchograms, CT halo sign, and reverse halo sign, may mimic a wide range of lung pathologies radiologically.

Moreover, accompanying and underlying lung abnormalities may interfere with the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The diseases that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic can be broadly classified as infectious or non-infectious diseases, including pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, neoplasms, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary infarction, interstitial lung diseases, and aspiration pneumonia. We summarize the imaging findings of COVID-19 and the aforementioned lung pathologies that COVID-19 pneumonia may mimic. We also discuss the features that may aid in the differential diagnosis, as the disease continues to spread and will remain one of our main differential diagnoses for some time.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography.

Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease.

Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

### Vafseo [^1143kU6Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no data on the presence of vadadustat in human milk, the effects of vadadustat on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Vadadustat is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Given the serious adverse reactions seen in adults treated with Vafseo, such as thrombotic vascular events, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Vafseo and for 2 days after the final dose.

- **Data**: Vadadustat was detected in the milk of lactating rats following a single oral administration of radiolabeled vadadustat at 50 mg/kg. The maximum ratio of milk to plasma concentration in rats was 14.5 at 8 hours postdose, and the ratio of milk to plasma AUC was 6.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Vafseo in pediatric patients have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: There were 1330 patients 65 years of age and older in the pooled INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2 clinical trials. Of the total number of Vafseo-treated patients in these studies, 449 (23%) were 65 to 74 years of age, 194 (10%) were 75 to 84 years of age, and 24 (1%) were 85 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Vafseo is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Xanax [^1147JQWp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Risks from concomitant use with opioids**: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including Xanax, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Due to these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to the use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe Xanax concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of Xanax than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking Xanax, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Xanax is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Abuse, misuse, and addiction**: The use of benzodiazepines, including Xanax, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve theft exposed users.

### Sarcopenia [^112ARgPs]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sarcopenia:

- **Definition**: Sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by accelerated loss of muscle mass and function.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of sarcopenia involves age-related structural changes and mechanisms at cellular and subcellular levels, including qualitative changes in posttranslational modifications of muscle proteins, loss of coordinated control between contractile, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum protein expression, and progressive loss of motoneurons leading to reduced muscle fiber number and size.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults ranges from 9.9% to 40.4%, depending on the definition used. The prevalence of sarcopenia is reported to be 25–35% in patients with cancer and 40–70% in patients with liver cirrhosis.

- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for sarcopenia include advancing age, a sedentary lifestyle, inadequate nutrition, and certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and liver cirrhosis.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, sarcopenia presents with decreased muscle strength, impaired physical performance, and an overall decline in functional abilities. It can lead to reduced mobility, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of fall-related injuries.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Sarcopenia is associated with adverse outcomes, including falls, functional decline, frailty, and a significantly higher risk of mortality, independent of population and sarcopenia definition.

### Erythromycin [^1161ajgJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Erythromycin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis through binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. The major route of resistance is modification of the 23S rRNA in the 50S ribosomal subunit, leading to insensitivity, while efflux can also be significant. Antagonism exists in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol.

Erythromycin has been demonstrated to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections:

- **Gram-positive bacteria**: Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Gram-negative bacteria**: Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

- **Other microorganisms**: Chlamydia trachomatis, Entamoeba histolytica, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Treponema pallidum, Ureaplasma urealyticum.

The following in vitro data are available, though their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following bacteria exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for erythromycin. However, the efficacy of erythromycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical studies.

### The enduring challenge of determining pneumonia etiology in children: Considerations for future research priorities [^116pCHV7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

- **Challenges in pneumonia etiology studies**: Unlike case definitions for acute gastroenteritis and febrile illness that are based on the presence of a specific symptom (e.g. diarrhea) or sign (e.g. fever), case definitions for pneumonia define a syndrome that cannot be reduced to a single, or even a constellation of, signs and/or symptoms. As mentioned, WHO created a standardized clinical case management definition for children with suspected pneumonia in the 1980s, prioritizing sensitivity over the specificity achieved in earlier radiologically based definitions. Throughout this article, we refer to sensitivity of a case definition (or test) as the percentage of all children with pneumonia who are identified. On the other hand, specificity refers to the percentage of all children without pneumonia who do not meet a case definition (or did not have a positive test result).

- **Sensitivity vs. specificity in case definitions**: High sensitivity usually leads to misdiagnosing some children without pneumonia as having pneumonia (false positives); high specificity usually results in missing some children who have pneumonia (false negatives). Although the WHO's sensitive case definition was developed to maximize the likelihood that children with pneumonia would be treated with antibiotics in peripheral health facilities lacking radiologic capacity, it has been co-opted for use in many pneumonia etiology and disease burden studies. Using the WHO case management definitions results in misclassification, an acceptable consequence in the context of ensuring treatment for those likely to have pneumonia.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist - A pictorial essay [^1171cWrn]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 pneumonia generally progresses through four stages characterized by different radiological features. Ground-glass opacities, crazy paving, consolidations, and fibrotic striae are common to various pathologies. Radiological differential diagnosis is based on the localization of these radiological features in the lung and their timing of occurrence. The presence of pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and adenopathies is suggestive of alternative diagnoses.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist — a pictorial essay [^1121kVUY]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, when a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan and subsequently termed COVID-19, the viral pneumonia has been spreading globally. On March 11, 2020, the WHO defined COVID-19 pneumonia as a pandemic.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community has focused on the clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, few papers have analyzed the vast spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia differential diagnoses. The complexity of differential diagnosis is high, especially in populations not drastically affected by COVID-19, and it is expected to increase after the peak of the pandemic when there are fewer cases.

The crucial and challenging role of the radiologist is, and will be, to raise suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia. This ensures the correct allocation of human and economic resources and helps prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present the most frequent differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia to assist radiologists in facing this challenge.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^117HVDH9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Our March 2021 edition of this review demonstrated that thoracic imaging computed tomography (CT) is sensitive and moderately specific in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. This new edition presents an update of the review.

- **Objectives**: Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging in individuals with suspected COVID-19; assess the rate of positive imaging in those who initially had a negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result but tested positive on follow-up RT-PCR; and evaluate the accuracy of thoracic imaging for screening COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. The secondary objective was to assess threshold effects of index test positivity on accuracy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through February 17, 2021. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included diagnostic accuracy studies of all designs, except for case-control, that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19. Studies needed to assess chest CT, chest X-ray, or ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID-19, use a reference standard that included RT-PCR, and report estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which we could compute estimates. We excluded studies that used imaging as part of the reference standard and those that excluded participants with normal index test results.

### A roadmap for delivering a human musculoskeletal cell atlas [^115ykdzq]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Advances in single-cell technologies have transformed the ability to identify the individual cell types present within tissues and organs. The musculoskeletal bionetwork, part of the wider Human Cell Atlas project, aims to create a detailed map of the healthy musculoskeletal system at a single-cell resolution throughout tissue development and across the human lifespan, with complementary generation of data from diseased tissues. Given the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, this detailed reference dataset will be critical to understanding normal musculoskeletal function in growth, homeostasis, and ageing.

This endeavor will also help to identify the cellular basis for disease and lay the foundations for novel therapeutic approaches to treating diseases of the joints, soft tissues, and bone. Here, we present a roadmap delineating the critical steps required to construct the first draft of a human musculoskeletal cell atlas. We describe the key challenges involved in mapping the extracellular matrix-rich, but cell-poor, tissues of the musculoskeletal system, outline early milestones that have been achieved, and describe the vision and directions for a comprehensive musculoskeletal cell atlas. By embracing cutting-edge technologies, integrating diverse data sets, and fostering international collaborations, this endeavor has the potential to drive transformative changes in musculoskeletal medicine.

### Diagnosis and management of pneumonia in infants less than 90 days of age [^111p1y1s]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Guidelines and recent studies on pediatric pneumonia pertain to children older than 3 months of age. Little information exists regarding the diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcomes of infants less than 90 days with pneumonia.

- **Methods**: We compared infants under 90 days of age diagnosed with pneumonia across 38 US children's hospitals from 2016 to 2021 to children aged 90 days to 5 years. We evaluated whether differences exist in patient characteristics, diagnostic testing, antibiotic treatment, and outcomes between these young infants and older children. Additionally, we assessed seasonal variability and trends over time in pneumonia diagnoses by age group.

- **Results**: Among 109,796 children diagnosed with pneumonia, 3,128 (2.8%) were less than 90 days of age. Compared with older children, infants younger than 90 days had more laboratory testing performed (88.6% vs. 48.8%, P < .001; median number of laboratory tests 4 [interquartile range: 2–5] vs. 0 [interquartile range: 0–3], respectively), with broad variation in testing across hospitals. Chest radiograph utilization did not differ by age group. Infants under 90 days were more likely to be hospitalized and require respiratory support than older children. Seasonal variation was observed for pneumonia encounters in both age groups.

- **Conclusions**: Infants under 90 days with pneumonia were more likely to undergo laboratory testing, be hospitalized, and require respiratory support than children aged 90 days to 5 years. This may reflect inherent differences in the pathophysiology of pneumonia by age, the manner in which pneumonia is diagnosed, or other factors.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist — a pictorial essay [^114iHDz9]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

There is a wide spectrum of possible differential diagnoses for COVID-19 pneumonia, and it is always necessary to consider a triptych of clinical, laboratory, and radiological data to reach the correct diagnosis.

- **Radiological features of pathologies in differential diagnosis**: Analysed pathologies usually share at least one radiological feature, such as ground-glass areas, crazy paving opacities, and consolidations, with COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings may present either as common or rare manifestations of pathologies or occasionally be described as absent. The timing of these features' presentation frequently varies with respect to COVID-19 pneumonia's characteristic phases.

- **Key: C, common; R, rare; OD/A, occasionally described/absent**.

- **Infective pneumonia**: Respiratory infections are the most common illnesses occurring in humans, with community-acquired pneumonia being the most prevalent.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: A pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^116Mwvu7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

A 7‐year‐old patient with no history of severe infections presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, fever, and acute respiratory insufficiency. Although this clinical condition is usually associated with an acute respiratory infection, a rare primary immunodeficiency was eventually diagnosed. The borderline growth represented the only finding indicative of possible chronicity. Because the respiratory failure did not respond to first‐line therapeutic approaches, a detailed pulmonary evaluation was performed, revealing acute diffuse lung parenchymal disease.

While the chest CT pattern can usually narrow the otherwise extensive differential diagnoses, in our case, the lung involvement combined with skin involvement required an extensive workup to exclude a range of diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and vasculitis. The diffuse nodular pattern with hilar lymphadenopathy also warranted an oncologic screening in search of possible malignancy. Finally, the history of mold and mulch exposure and high levels of specific IgG antibodies against molds, together with the corresponding CT pattern, suggested the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP).

However, at the initial stage, several aspects were unclear. First, the association of HP with skin lesions was elusive. Second, an ongoing fungal lung infection had to be thoroughly assessed, particularly as the targeted examinations were inconclusive. Third, although the CMV positivity in BAL did not match the short history of symptoms, CMV infection may, in rare cases, present as a diffuse parenchymal pattern on CT.

### Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis: clinical features and pathogenic mechanisms [^116S6Tri]. Nature Reviews. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a systemic condition characterized by the ossification and calcification of ligaments and entheses. DISH is observed on all continents and in all races, but it is most commonly found in men over 50 years of age. Although DISH is asymptomatic in most individuals, it often indicates an underlying metabolic disease. The presence of spinal or extraspinal ossifications can sometimes lead to symptoms, including pain, stiffness, reduced range of articular motion, and dysphagia. Additionally, there is an increased risk of unstable spinal fractures.

The etiology of DISH is poorly understood, and the roles of the many factors that might contribute to the development of excess bone are not well delineated. The study of pathophysiological aspects of DISH is complicated by the formal diagnosis requiring the presence of multiple contiguous fully formed bridging ossifications, which likely represent advanced stages of the condition. This review provides an up-to-date discussion of the epidemiological, etiological, and clinical aspects of DISH. Existing classification criteria, used in the absence of diagnostic criteria to establish a diagnosis of DISH, are also considered. The need for modified criteria that enable timely identification of early phases in the development of DISH is emphasized.

### Alternative diagnoses in patients in whom the GP considered the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115732DE]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) often presents with nonspecific symptoms and may be an easily missed diagnosis. When the differential diagnosis includes PE, an empirical list of frequently occurring alternative diagnoses could support the GP in diagnostic decision-making.

- **Objectives**: To identify common alternative diagnoses in patients in whom the GP suspected PE but in whom PE could be ruled out; to investigate how the Wells clinical decision rule for PE combined with a point-of-care d-dimer test is associated with these alternative diagnoses.

- **Methods**: Secondary analysis of the Amsterdam Maastricht Utrecht Study on thrombo-embolism (Amuse-2) study, which validated the Wells PE rule combined with point-of-care d-dimer testing in primary care. All 598 patients had been referred to and diagnosed in secondary care. All diagnostic information was retrieved from the GPs' medical records.

- **Results**: In 516 patients without PE, the most frequent alternative diagnoses were nonspecific thoracic pain/dyspnoea (42.6%), pneumonia (13.0%), myalgia (11.8%), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4.8%), panic disorder/hyperventilation (4.1%), and respiratory tract infection (2.3%). Pneumonia occurred almost as frequently as PE. Patients without PE with either a positive Wells rule (> 4) or a positive d-dimer test were more often (odds ratio = 2.1) diagnosed with a clinically relevant disease than patients with a negative Wells rule and negative d-dimer test.

- **Conclusion**: In primary care patients suspected of PE, the most common clinically relevant diagnosis other than PE was pneumonia.

### From dyspnea to diagnosis: A pediatric case report on an unexpected condition [^115UnyjY]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old Caucasian patient arrived at the pediatric emergency room with symptoms of acute dyspnea. His parents reported that he had been quite well the previous day, and during the night, he suddenly woke up with shortness of breath. Apart from abnormal growth at the third percentile, this was a healthy patient with no significant past medical history. The patient was born to a primigravida mother at 38 weeks of gestation, with normal postnatal adaptation and up-to-date vaccinations (Figure 1a).

On arrival, he was febrile (38.1°C), tachypneic (60 breaths/min), and dyspneic, with a dry cough and marked tachycardia (144 beats/min). The peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 83% on room air without apparent cyanosis. The physical examination revealed a shallow breathing pattern and prolonged active expiration with apparent retractions of the subcostal and jugular regions. On auscultation, there were both expiratory wheezing and rhonchi.

An intensive bronchodilation therapy with a short-acting β agonist (SABA) was started, and the patient was admitted to the inpatient department. On oxygen therapy (3 L/min via a face mask), his SpO2 normalized. The physician then ordered a C-reactive protein (CRP), full blood count (CBC), chest radiograph, and an antigen panel for common respiratory viruses. The CRP was elevated (77.8 mg/L, reference range: 0–5 mg/L), and the CBC showed marked leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance (33.0 × 10⁹/L, reference range: 4.5–14.5 × 10⁹/L). The chest radiograph (Figure 1b) revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltration.

### Does this child have pneumonia? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^111yU9kA]. JAMA (2017). High credibility.

Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Identifying clinical symptoms and physical examination findings associated with pneumonia is crucial to improving timely diagnosis, preventing significant morbidity, and limiting antibiotic overuse.

The objective of this review is to systematically evaluate the accuracy of symptoms and physical examination findings in identifying children with radiographic pneumonia. For data sources and study selection, MEDLINE and Embase (1956 to May 2017) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles, to identify diagnostic studies of pediatric pneumonia across a broad age range. These studies had to include children younger than age 5 years, although some enrolled children up to age 19 years. A total of 3644 unique articles were identified, of which 23 met the inclusion criteria.

In terms of data extraction and synthesis, two authors independently abstracted raw data and assessed methodological quality, with a third author resolving disputes. The main outcomes and measures included the calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, and specificity for individual symptoms and physical examination findings for the diagnosis of pneumonia. An infiltrate on a chest radiograph was considered the reference standard for diagnosing pneumonia.

The results included twenty-three prospective cohort studies of children (N = 13,833) with possible pneumonia. Of these, eight were from North America, with a range of 78 to 2829 patients per study. The prevalence of radiographic pneumonia in North American studies was 19% (95% CI, 11%-31%) and 37% (95% CI, 26%-50%) outside of North America.

### Osteochondroma of acromioclavicular joint [^113zdVLQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Osteochondroma is the most common type of benign bone tumor. It is a benign chondrogenic lesion derived from aberrant cartilage from the perichondral ring, and it commonly presents in the proximal humerus, proximal femur, and knee. Osteochondroma is usually solitary but can be multiple in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses. Malignant changes occur in approximately 1% of cases. Osteochondroma usually causes local pain or swelling.

We discuss a unique case of an osteochondroma that highlights the fact that osteochondromas can occur in the most unlikely places. They should be properly visualized via radiography to evaluate any extensions and compromised surrounding structures before surgical intervention.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS at intermediate risk, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining fractional flow reserve (FFR) with computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of vessel-specific ischemia. This approach guides decision-making regarding the use of coronary revascularization in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and no known coronary artery disease, who have coronary artery stenosis of 40–90% in a proximal or middle coronary artery on coronary CTA.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^1123me72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

As the studies in our cohort included individuals suspected of having COVID-19, our findings are applicable to such cases. Our search did not identify many studies that evaluated the accuracy of chest CT, ultrasound of the lungs, and chest X-ray for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities in children is not as well-established.

Additionally, the lack of data available in the included studies pertaining to signs and symptoms of presenting cases, the severity of the symptoms, as well as the timing of symptom onset, adds complexity to the interpretation of the findings in this review. It should be noted that the results apply mostly to imaging interpreted by radiologists.

### Pneumonia [^113JQDfQ]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2021). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that affects the alveoli and distal airways; it is a major health problem associated with high morbidity and short-term and long-term mortality in all age groups worldwide. Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses, and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence.

Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children under five years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. The development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance, will improve the management of pneumonia.

### Early Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection presenting as multiple pulmonary masses: an unusual presentation in a child [^117Vw5wx]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Because most children are not imaged prior to the onset of clinical symptoms, the appearance of early Mycoplasma infection has not been extensively studied. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with large pulmonary masses incidentally detected during spine MRI evaluation for scoliosis. Eight days later, the patient developed acute respiratory symptoms, and the masses seen previously had evolved into a diffuse bronchiolitis. Diagnostic testing identified Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the likely etiology. We briefly review chest CT findings of infection by Mycoplasma and compare them to this unusual presentation of Mycoplasma pneumonia with subclinical imaging findings.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children: the challenges of microbiological diagnosis [^114tD4C9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years of age globally. To improve the management of CAP, it is essential to distinguish CAP from other common pediatric conditions and develop better diagnostic methods to detect the causative organism. This would enable the best allocation of resources in both industrialized and developing countries. The diagnostic modalities available for identifying viruses and bacteria in the upper and lower respiratory tract of children are reviewed, with a discussion of their utility and limitations in diagnosing CAP in children.
