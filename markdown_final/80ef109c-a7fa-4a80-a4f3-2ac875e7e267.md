## Question

What is the first-line antifungal treatment for coccidioidomycosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line antifungal treatment is for coccidioidomycosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline consensus and whether fluconazole is the default agent. Then, I should verify dose ranges and duration for uncomplicated pulmonary disease. Next, I will examine exceptions where amphotericin B is preferred up front, including severe pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, and pregnancy. After that, I need to check special populations such as HIV, transplant recipients, and pediatrics. Finally, I will review alternatives for azole intolerance or failure and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and durations.

> Let me first confirm the general principle so I don't jump to conclusions: multiple authoritative guidelines converge on an oral triazole as first-line therapy for most non-severe coccidioidomycosis, with fluconazole typically preferred due to tolerability, penetration, and ease of monitoring, whereas amphotericin B is reserved for severe disease or special circumstances [^113SizSA] [^113wHUFj] [^11228YmR].

> I need to verify the standard adult dosing for uncomplicated pulmonary disease; the IDSA guideline recommends fluconazole at a daily dose of at least 400 mg, with some experts using 800 mg daily, and typical treatment duration is 3 to 6 months or longer until symptoms, inflammatory markers, and radiography stabilize, noting that complete serologic resolution is not required to stop therapy [^112Usdxh] [^113SizSA] [^111McTcS].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "first-line" with "always appropriate"; I should confirm when to avoid azoles initially. In patients with diffuse/severe pulmonary involvement, rapidly progressive disease, or extrathoracic dissemination, guidelines prefer amphotericin B as initial therapy until stabilization, then transition to a triazole for consolidation and maintenance, with lipid formulations favored when renal function is a concern [^1156ySAv] [^112TtQPi] [^116WJTPB].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, because this is a frequent exception. In the first trimester, amphotericin B is recommended for nonmeningeal disease due to teratogenicity concerns with azoles; after the first trimester, an azole such as fluconazole can be considered with counseling, and for coccidioidal meningitis, intrathecal amphotericin B is recommended in the first trimester with transition to azoles thereafter [^111Y7cMq] [^1155GdGi] [^111qgiJz].

> I will now examine HIV-specific management so I don't overgeneralize. For mild-to-moderate pulmonary disease, fluconazole 400 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg three times daily for 3 days then twice daily is recommended; for severe or disseminated disease, start amphotericin B and then continue with a triazole, and for meningitis, high-dose fluconazole (400–800 mg daily) is preferred with lifelong therapy generally indicated; importantly, management should align with immune status, continuing full-dose therapy when CD4 is less than 250 cells/mm³ and viremia is present [^113wHUFj] [^1156ySAv] [^114Xu1XD] [^113wVHUm].

> Let me consider transplant recipients and those on biologics, since immunosuppression shifts thresholds. For clinically stable pulmonary disease, start fluconazole 400 mg daily; for severe or rapidly progressive disease, initiate amphotericin B until stabilized, then continue with a triazole, and after initial treatment, suppressive azole therapy is recommended to prevent relapse given high recurrence risk off therapy [^112TtQPi] [^114AEuN8] [^113qwuix].

> I should double-check pediatric guidance so I don't miss age-specific nuances. For infants and children with suspected coccidioidomycosis, empiric fluconazole at 6–12 mg/kg daily is recommended until the diagnosis is excluded; for severe disease, liposomal amphotericin B is preferred initially, followed by fluconazole or itraconazole to complete at least a 1-year course, with chronic suppressive therapy considered in immunocompromised hosts [^114UVnPq] [^111pXuCz] [^113qBXrz] [^112Tq2o1].

> Next, I should review alternatives and escalation strategies when fluconazole is not suitable or fails. Itraconazole is a reasonable alternative, particularly for skeletal disease where some data suggest better efficacy, though it requires closer monitoring for absorption and drug interactions; for azole failure or intolerance, voriconazole, posaconazole, or isavuconazole can be considered, and for refractory meningitis, intrathecal amphotericin B is an option after fluconazole escalation [^116EWMGT] [^115zksnG] [^1148DHvp] [^112vuupt].

> But wait, what if the disease is mild and the patient is immunocompetent; do we need treatment at all? I should confirm that observation is acceptable in many such cases. For immunocompetent patients with mild, nondebilitating primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, guidelines support observation with supportive care rather than immediate antifungal therapy, reserving treatment for those with significant symptoms, extensive involvement, diabetes, frailty, or higher-risk ancestry profiles [^111Mr7Yh] [^116ErquD] [^116zqpEq].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm consistent: first-line therapy for most non-severe coccidioidomycosis is an oral triazole, with fluconazole preferred at 400 mg daily (some use 400–800 mg) for 3–6 months or longer based on clinical response; amphotericin B is the initial therapy of choice for severe pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, or first-trimester pregnancy, with subsequent transition to a triazole for consolidation and maintenance; special populations such as those with HIV, transplant recipients, and children require tailored regimens and often longer or suppressive courses [^113SizSA] [^112Usdxh] [^1156ySAv] [^111Y7cMq] [^113wVHUm] [^113qBXrz].

---

Fluconazole is the **first-line antifungal** for coccidioidomycosis in nonpregnant adults with mild-to-moderate disease, typically at 400 mg daily for 3–6 months [^112Usdxh] [^113SizSA]. Itraconazole is an **alternative**, especially for skeletal disease or fluconazole intolerance [^1118VGbq] [^115zksnG]. Amphotericin B is reserved for **severe or disseminated disease**, including CNS involvement, and for first-trimester pregnancy [^1156ySAv] [^111Y7cMq]. Lifelong therapy is required for **meningeal disease** [^112D7W2j] [^117HKp5W].

---

## Indications for antifungal therapy

Antifungal therapy is **not universally required** for all patients with coccidioidomycosis; indications depend on disease severity, patient immune status, and clinical presentation [^116ErquD]. The IDSA and ATS provide clear guidance on when to initiate therapy [^111Mr7Yh] [^116zqpEq]:

- **Mild-to-moderate disease**: Observation and supportive care may suffice for immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms [^116ErquD] [^116zqpEq].

- **Severe or disseminated disease**: Antifungal therapy is indicated for patients with severe pulmonary involvement, disseminated disease, or immunocompromised states [^112JhuxD] [^113SizSA].

- **Meningeal disease**: Lifelong antifungal therapy is recommended for coccidioidal meningitis [^112D7W2j] [^117HKp5W].

---

## First-line antifungal therapy

Fluconazole is the **preferred first-line antifungal** for most nonpregnant adults with mild-to-moderate coccidioidomycosis [^notfound]. It is an orally administered triazole with favorable pharmacokinetics, excellent bioavailability, and minimal drug interactions [^notfound].

---

### Dosage and duration

- **Standard dosage**: 400 mg orally once daily [^113SizSA] [^111McTcS].

- **Duration**: 3 to 6 months, with adjustments based on clinical response and resolution of symptoms [^112Usdxh] [^115Fjwdu].

- **Higher doses**: Some experts recommend 800 mg daily for severe or refractory cases, although evidence supporting higher doses is limited [^112jbvhk] [^11228YmR].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting fluconazole

Fluconazole has been extensively studied and is effective in treating coccidioidomycosis. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies demonstrate clinical response rates of approximately 70% in pulmonary disease and 79% in nonmeningeal disseminated disease. It is **particularly effective** in treating pulmonary and soft-tissue infections, though less effective in skeletal disease compared to itraconazole [^1118VGbq] [^115zksnG].

---

## Alternative antifungal therapy

Itraconazole is an **alternative first-line agent**, particularly for skeletal disease or in patients intolerant to fluconazole [^1118VGbq] [^113fdR9k]. It requires careful monitoring due to variable absorption and significant drug interactions [^116EWMGT].

---

### Dosage and duration

- **Standard dosage**: 200 mg orally twice daily [^1118VGbq] [^11228YmR].

- **Duration**: Similar to fluconazole, typically 3 to 6 months, adjusted based on clinical response [^112Usdxh] [^115Fjwdu].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting itraconazole

Itraconazole has demonstrated efficacy comparable to fluconazole in pulmonary and soft-tissue infections, with slightly superior efficacy in skeletal disease. However, its use is limited by absorption variability and drug interactions [^116EWMGT] [^115zksnG].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

### Severe or disseminated disease

For severe or disseminated coccidioidomycosis, particularly with diffuse pulmonary involvement or CNS disease, **amphotericin B is recommended as initial therapy** [^1156ySAv]. Lipid formulations are preferred due to better tolerability [^116WJTPB]. After clinical stabilization, patients should transition to fluconazole or itraconazole for long-term maintenance therapy [^116WJTPB].

---

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, **amphotericin B is the preferred antifungal agent** due to potential teratogenic effects of azoles [^111Y7cMq]. After the first trimester, azole therapy may be considered with careful monitoring and patient counseling [^1155GdGi].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV infection, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, **generally require antifungal therapy** regardless of disease severity [^115Nq4G4]. Fluconazole or itraconazole are appropriate first-line agents, with amphotericin B reserved for severe or refractory cases [^11228YmR].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical, serologic, and radiographic monitoring is essential to assess treatment response and detect relapse [^112Usdxh]. Serologic titers (complement fixation) are particularly useful in monitoring disease progression or relapse, especially in disseminated disease [^1139ogeK].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **First-line therapy** | **Alternative therapy** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild-to-moderate pulmonary disease | Fluconazole 400 mg daily | Itraconazole 200 mg BID | 3–6 months |
| Severe or disseminated disease | Amphotericin B (lipid formulation) | Fluconazole or itraconazole after stabilization | ≥ 12 months |
| Coccidioidal meningitis | Fluconazole 400–800 mg daily | Itraconazole 200 mg BID | Lifelong therapy |
| Pregnancy (first trimester) | Amphotericin B | ∅ | Until stabilization |
| Pregnancy (second-third trimester) | Fluconazole or itraconazole | ∅ | 3–6 months |

---

Fluconazole is the **first-line antifungal therapy** for coccidioidomycosis in nonpregnant adults with mild-to-moderate disease, with itraconazole as an alternative, particularly for skeletal disease. Amphotericin B is reserved for severe or disseminated disease and for pregnant patients in the first trimester. Lifelong therapy is required for coccidioidal meningitis [^112D7W2j].

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

Regarding specific circumstances for coccidioidomycosis, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV, antifungal therapy, HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to prefer amphotericin B as the preferred initial therapy in patients with diffuse pulmonary involvement or severely ill patients with extrathoracic disseminated disease.
Consider administering lipid formulations as equivalent alternative initial therapy, particularly in patients with underlying renal dysfunction.
Continue amphotericin B until clinical improvement is observed and then change to an oral triazole antifungal.

### Treatment for early, uncomplicated coccidioidomycosis: what is success? [^111QYiG7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis remains challenging. Such infections produce a variety of signs, symptoms, and serologic responses that cause morbidity in patients and concern in treating clinicians for the possibility of extrapulmonary dissemination. Illness may be due to ongoing fungal growth that produces acute inflammatory responses, resulting in tissue damage and necrosis, and for this, administering an antifungal drug may be of benefit. In contrast, convalescence may be prolonged by other immunologic reactions to infection, even after fungal replication has been arrested, and in those situations, antifungal therapy is unlikely to yield clinical improvement. In this presentation, we discuss what findings are clinical indicators of fungal growth and what other sequelae are not. Understanding these differences provides a rational management strategy for deciding when to continue, discontinue, or reinstitute antifungal treatments.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^112Usdxh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antifungal treatment options — uncomplicated coccidioidal pneumonia: For early uncomplicated coccidioidal infection, the usual adult fluconazole dose is 400 mg daily, and some experts would recommend 800 mg daily. Many experts would recommend a treatment duration ranging from 3 to 6 months or longer, and treatment can be discontinued when signs, symptoms, and inflammatory markers have resolved and serologies and radiographs have stabilized; complete serological resolution is not necessary to discontinue medications. Whether or not antifungal therapy is initiated, all patients will benefit from other elements of a management plan, and no clinical studies exist to guide the optimal dose or duration for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^112jbvhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM) — management of failure of initial therapy recommends that in patients who clinically fail initial fluconazole therapy, higher doses are a first option (strong, moderate); alternative options are to change to another orally administered azole or to initiate intrathecal AmB therapy (strong, moderate). A combination of clinical, CSF, and potential radiographic parameters obtained on a regular basis should be used to define treatment success and failure, with CSF parameters the most important variable. If low-dose fluconazole (400 mg orally daily) was the original option, increasing to 800–1200 mg daily should be considered, and the Mycosis Study Group defined response as a decrease in baseline score by 40% without relapse while treatment was continued.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^116EWMGT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM) primary therapy — For CM, we recommend fluconazole 400–1200 mg orally daily as initial therapy for most patients with normal renal function (strong, moderate). There is no role for a dose < 400 mg daily in the adult patient without substantial renal impairment. Some experts prefer to use itraconazole 200 mg 2–4 times daily, but this requires closer monitoring to assure adequate absorption, and there are more drug–drug interactions than with fluconazole.

IDSA coccidioidomycosis — initiation of antifungal therapy in newly diagnosed primary pulmonary disease: We recommend initiating antifungal treatment for patients who, at the time of diagnosis, have significantly debilitating illness (strong, low). For patients at the time of diagnosis with extensive pulmonary involvement, with concurrent diabetes, or who are otherwise frail because of age or comorbidities, we recommend initiating antifungal treatment (strong, low); some experts would also include African or Filipino ancestry as indications for treatment. If treatment is begun in nonpregnant adults, the treatment should be an orally absorbed azole antifungal (eg, fluconazole) at a daily dose of ≥ 400 mg (strong, low).

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — recommendations for neonates and breastfeeding: We recommend against coccidioidal serologic tests for infants during the first 3 months of life, and positive tests should be interpreted with caution during the first year of life (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy with fluconazole at 6–12 mg/kg daily is recommended for infants suspected of coccidioidomycosis and should continue until the diagnosis has been ruled out (strong, low). Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers on azole antifungals other than fluconazole (strong, moderate).

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^111Y7cMq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — recommendations for pregnant women: For initial nonmeningeal infection in the first trimester, intravenous AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); other options include no therapy with close monitoring (weak, low) or an azole antifungal after educating the mother (weak, low). After the first trimester, an azole antifungal can be considered (strong, low), with the alternative of intravenous AmB throughout pregnancy (weak, moderate). For CM in the first trimester, intrathecal AmB is recommended (strong, moderate); after the first trimester, an azole antifungal, such as fluconazole or itraconazole, can be prescribed (strong, low). Among women with prior coccidioidomycosis not on therapy, the risk of reactivation is low and antifungal therapy is not recommended (strong, moderate); for such women, close follow-up with coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy should be performed (strong, moderate). For nonmeningeal disease in remission on an azole when pregnancy begins, azole therapy may be discontinued with clinical and serological monitoring every 4–6 weeks (weak, low), or azole therapy may be stopped and intravenous AmB started in the first trimester, changing back to an azole after the first trimester (strong, low). For pregnant women with CM already on an azole, azole therapy should be stopped for the first trimester due to teratogenicity risk (strong, moderate) and intrathecal AmB can be initiated, especially if meningeal signs and symptoms are present (strong, moderate); azole therapy may then be restarted in the second trimester (weak, low) or intrathecal AmB continued throughout gestation (weak, low). An alternative is to continue azole therapy throughout with informed maternal agreement (weak, low), and a final alternative is to stop all therapy during pregnancy and restart in the second or third trimester (weak, very low), though some experts do not recommend it because of relapse risk. Febrile pulmonary illness in pregnancy in endemic or appropriately traveled women should be evaluated for active coccidioidomycosis, including chest radiograph and coccidioidal serology and cultures (strong, moderate).

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^1131g4yp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV — primary prevention, treatment thresholds, and monitoring: Antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal-endemic regions (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 250 cells/μL (strong, moderate), and therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains < 250 cells/μL (strong, low). For patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥ 250 cells/μL, clinical management should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), whereas outside coccidioidal-endemic regions serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low).

Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — azole therapy and amphotericin B (AmB): In a randomized double-blinded comparison of fluconazole 400 mg daily to itraconazole 200 mg twice daily, the clinical response after 8 months of treatment was approximately 55%, and response rates between the 2 regimens for chronic pulmonary infections were comparable. Some experts recommend higher doses of fluconazole; however, there is no evidence that higher doses are more effective. Treatment courses should be continued for at least 1 year and, in some cases, longer, but symptoms recur in approximately 30% of patients upon discontinuation. Because AmB is administered intravenously and is often accompanied by significant side effects, we recommend that AmB be reserved for patients who do not respond to azoles or in patients whose illness is so severe that it requires management in an intensive care unit.

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis — natural history and comparative observational outcomes: In a survey of endemic-area clinicians, among 354 patients with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, 325 (92%) recovered without complication and 1 had fatal CM; at that time, no effective antifungal treatment was available. In an observational Veterans Administration study of early infection, treated (n = 54) vs untreated (n = 51) fluconazole cohorts had similar time to at least 50% symptom improvement (95 days vs 98 days; p = 0.899), and none of the 50 untreated patients had progressive, recurrent, or disseminated infection, whereas among the 54 treated patients, 8 had documented recurrence of pulmonary symptoms or extrapulmonary complications after treatment discontinuation, with 1 meningitis occurring 2 years after discontinuation. In another prospective observational study of otherwise healthy adults with mild to moderate disease, 20 of 36 (56%) received antifungal treatment and 16 of 36 (44%) received no antifungal treatment, and the treated group did not reach primary (50% drop in symptom score) or secondary endpoints faster than the untreated group. No randomized trials exist to assess whether antifungal treatment shortens early uncomplicated illness or prevents later complications, and the optimal dose or duration of such treatment has not been established.

HSCT or solid organ transplant recipients with active coccidioidomycosis — post-initial treatment management: Following initial treatment, the guideline recommends suppressive oral azole therapy be continued to prevent relapsed infection (strong, very low). Case reports describe discontinuation after resolution in 2 of 9, 2 of 4, 1 of 4, and 4 of 4 patients, with 6 of the 9 who stopped prophylaxis relapsing; because of this risk, therapy should be continued indefinitely or until withdrawal of all antirejection medications. After complete resolution of uncomplicated pulmonary infection, some authors have continued a lower azole dose (eg, fluconazole 200 mg daily) with prevention of relapse in a limited group, but some committee members were strongly opposed to fluconazole dosage reduction < 400 mg daily under any circumstances; for many requiring ongoing suppression, fluconazole is acceptable.

Coccidioidomycosis in pregnancy — treatment by trimester and prior disease status is outlined as follows: The development of symptomatic coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy should prompt consideration of starting administration of antifungal therapy (strong, moderate). For initial nonmeningeal infection in the first trimester, intravenous AmB is recommended (strong, moderate), with other options including no therapy with close monitoring (weak, low) or an azole antifungal after educating the mother regarding potential teratogenicity (weak, low); after the first trimester an azole antifungal, such fluconazole or itraconazole, can be considered (strong, low), and a final alternative is intravenous AmB throughout pregnancy (weak, moderate). For CM in the first trimester, intrathecal AmB is recommended (strong, moderate), and after the first trimester an azole antifungal such as fluconazole or itraconazole can be prescribed (strong, low). For women with a history of prior coccidioidomycosis not on therapy, close follow-up including obtaining coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy should be performed (strong, moderate). For women with nonmeningeal disease in remission who become pregnant while on azoles, azole antifungal therapy may be discontinued with clinical and serological monitoring every 4–6 weeks to assess for reactivation (weak, low) or stopped with initiation of intravenous AmB during the first trimester, changing back to an azole after the first trimester (strong, low). For pregnant women with CM already on azoles, azole therapy should be stopped for the first trimester to avoid the risk of teratogenicity (strong, moderate), with approaches including initiating intrathecal AmB during this period (strong, moderate), restarting azole therapy during the second trimester or continuing intrathecal AmB throughout gestation (weak, low), and an alternative of continuing azole therapy throughout gestation with informed maternal agreement (weak, low); a final alternative is to stop the azole antifungal, monitor closely during the first trimester, and restart during the second or third trimester (weak, very low), which some experts do not recommend because of relapse risk.

Bone and/or joint coccidioidomycosis — evidence summary notes no trials comparing AmB with oral azole therapy; published trials of azole therapy alone found success rates of 52%–85% in skeletal infections. A retrospective series including 28 patients reported AmB as initial therapy in 17 patients with only 1 clinical failure; eight patients started on azoles mostly had poor response and were switched to AmB, and of 8 with vertebral involvement only 1 treated with an azole alone had success. In another vertebral disease series, only 7 of 39 received AmB. One randomized double-blind trial compared 400 mg fluconazole daily with 200 mg itraconazole twice daily in nonmeningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis and found neither agent superior overall, though a subgroup analysis showed slightly greater efficacy of itraconazole for skeletal infection; there are no comparative studies of fluconazole at doses > 400 mg per day.

Background information about coccidioidomycosis — organism biology and early pulmonary infection are summarized as follows: Coccidioides species are dimorphic fungi that cause coccidioidomycosis, growing in the environment as mycelia that produce single-cell arthroconidia and, after mammalian infection, transforming into spherules that revert back to mycelial growth if cultured. Virtually all coccidioidal infections are initiated by inhalation of an arthroconidium, and the most common initial syndrome is that of a respiratory illness.

Coccidioidomycosis in children with HIV — Liposomal amphotericin B is the treatment of choice with similar efficacy and fewer adverse events. After the patient is stabilized, therapy with an azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) can be substituted and continued to complete a 1-year course of antifungal therapy. Chronic suppressive therapy (secondary prophylaxis) with fluconazole or itraconazole is routinely recommended following initial induction therapy for disseminated disease. Therapy with amphotericin B results in a more rapid clinical response in severe, non-meningitic disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112Tq2o1]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis treatment — For severe illness with respiratory compromise due to diffuse pulmonary or disseminated non-meningitic disease, liposomal amphotericin B preparation at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight IV once daily can be increased to as much as 10 mg/kg body weight IV once daily for life-threatening infections; amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.5–1.0 mg/kg body weight IV once daily is also listed, until clinical improvement. After stabilization, therapy with an azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) can be substituted and continued to complete a 1-year course of antifungal therapy. If unable to use amphotericin B, fluconazole 12 mg/kg body weight (maximum 800–1,200 mg) per dose IV or by mouth once daily is provided, and treatment is continued for a total of 1 year followed by secondary prophylaxis. Surgical debridement of bone, joint, and/or excision of cavitary lung lesions may be helpful. Itraconazole is the preferred azole for treatment of bone infections, with fluconazole as an alternative agent. Some experts initiate an azole during amphotericin B therapy, whereas others defer until after amphotericin B is stopped. For treatment failure, can consider voriconazole, isavuconazole, caspofungin, or posaconazole (or combinations), with experience limited in children and options to be discussed with an expert. Chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole or itraconazole is routinely recommended following initial induction therapy for disseminated disease, and therapy with amphotericin B results in a more rapid clinical response in severe, nonmeningeal disease.

Coccidioides immitis and C posadasii are pathogenic dimorphic fungi responsible for causing coccidioidomycosis in the Southwestern United States and Central and South America. Antifungal therapy is beneficial and entails careful periodic assessment with therapies ranging from none or short courses of therapy to prolonged antifungal therapy. Factors that influence the decision to treat are the duration or severity of infection, radiographic findings, anticomplementary titers, presence of underlying immunosuppression, and comorbidities. Cure for disseminated infection is infrequent with current treatment regimens.

Asymptomatic coccidioidal cavity management — We recommend against the use of antifungal therapy for patients with an asymptomatic cavity (strong, low). Coccidioidal pneumonia can leave a thin-walled cavity as a residual in 5% of cases; in a patient who is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed, periodic follow-up observation is recommended, and usually, periodic plain radiographs of the chest are adequate for monitoring; if cavities are very large or adjacent to the pleura, they may rupture, but this complication is surprisingly infrequent and antifungal treatment would not prevent this.

Coccidioidomycosis in HIV — therapy after immune reconstitution: In HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV RNA on potent antiretroviral (ARV) therapy who have a CD4 ≥ 250/mm³, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in the general population (AII). For patients who meet the above criteria with focal pulmonary disease, treatment with triazole antifungal should continue for a minimum of 6 months (AII). For patients with diffuse pulmonary disease and those with extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and for patients with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 < 250/mm³, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII).

Treatment decisions were determined by the treating physicians, and whether a patient received antifungal therapy before enrollment was recorded (medication name, dose, frequency, duration). After patients were enrolled, physician investigators determined the need to initiate or continue antifungal medication on a case-by-case basis. Patients were assigned to the treatment group if at any time before enrollment through study completion they received any antifungal treatment.

The medical care for coccidioidomycosis was provided by physician investigators and conducted in a standardized fashion. The initial evaluation included a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serologic testing for HIV, pregnancy testing, and serologic testing for coccidioidomycosis (by enzyme immunoassay, immunodiffusion, and complement fixation); collection of microbiological specimens, if applicable (mostly sputum for fungal culture); and analysis of chest radiographs. Patients were evaluated clinically, serologically, and radiographically (chest) at enrollment and at 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks.

### Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 [^112EhCMM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a recognized opportunistic infection among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Early in the HIV epidemic, most cases presented as overwhelming diffuse pulmonary disease with a high mortality rate. Although these cases are still seen, patients without significant immunodeficiency frequently present with a community-acquired pneumonia syndrome. Diagnosis can be established by cytological staining, culture, or serologic testing. All patients with HIV infection and symptomatic coccidioidomycosis should be treated with antifungal therapy. Severe cases frequently require a combination of therapy with amphotericin B and a triazole antifungal. Therapy for at least 1 year is recommended, but for patients with a focal pulmonary infection and peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts of > 250 cells/microL, it may be reasonable to stop therapy after this time. Other manifestations of coccidioidomycosis require prolonged therapy, and life-long treatment is recommended for persons with meningitis.

HSCT or solid organ transplant recipients with active coccidioidomycosis — For clinically stable acute or chronic pulmonary disease with normal renal function, we recommend initiating treatment with fluconazole 400 mg daily or the equivalent dose based upon renal function (strong, low). For very severe and/or rapidly progressing acute pulmonary or disseminated disease, we recommend the use of AmB until the patient has stabilized, followed by fluconazole (strong, low). For extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis, we recommend the same treatment as for non–transplant recipients (strong, very low).

HIV-associated coccidioidomycosis — treatment duration and discontinuation criteria: In people who have CD4 count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in patients in the general population (AII). For focal pulmonary disease meeting the criteria, treatment with a triazole antifungal agent should continue for a minimum of 3 to 6 months (AII). For diffuse pulmonary disease or extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and therapy should be discontinued based on clinical and immunological response and in consultation with an expert (BIII). For people with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 count < 250 cells/mm³, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII).

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^111qgiJz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — pregnancy and neonatal considerations note that the risk is higher later in pregnancy, particularly the third trimester and immediately postpartum, and that azole antifungal therapy appears to have been teratogenic in a small number of cases with at least 5 instances of congenital craniosynostosis and skeletal abnormalities observed in infants born to mothers receiving high-dose fluconazole early in pregnancy. The US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in August 2011 that long-term, high doses (400–800 mg/day) of fluconazole could be associated with birth defects in infants whose mothers were treated during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the warning does not mention concern for treatment beyond the first trimester. AmB has been shown to be safe and effective for coccidioidomycosis during pregnancy, but its use is limited by its restriction to intravenous administration and significant toxicity. Positive coccidioidal serology in newborns occurs passively, may not indicate active infection, and may persist up to the first year of life, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has indicated that breastfeeding while receiving fluconazole, but not other currently approved azole antifungals, is likely safe for the newborn.

### Treatment of valley fever… [^114xE7s6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most infections go away on their own without any medication.
- People with severe infections are treated with antifungal medications.
- Most people fully recover with time. Treatment Many people who get sick with Valley fever have mild symptoms. They often get better without medication within a few months. Healthcare providers may prescribe 3–6 months of oral antifungal medication like fluconazole. This is for people with more serious infections or people with risk factors for severe infections. Severe infections People who have severe lung infections or infections that have spread to other parts of the body need antifungal treatment. These people may need to be hospitalized and for these types of infections, the course of treatment is usually longer than 6 months. Valley fever that develops into meningitis is fatal if it's not treated, so lifelong antifungal treatment is necessary for those cases.

### Clinical overview of valley fever… [^116S2uJv]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- About 40% of cases of Valley fever develop lung infection symptoms.
- Infections are usually self-limiting but 5–10% develop complications. Disseminated disease is rare.
- Serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG antibodies are the most common diagnostics.
- Infections are usually treated with fluconazole or amphotericin B. Enzyme immunoassay EIA is a very sensitive and commonly used method for diagnosing coccidioidomycosis. Two EIAs for detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against Coccidioides are currently available:

- Premier ® CoccidioidesEIA – Meridian Bioscience, Inc.
- Enzyme Immunoassay for detection of specific antibodies against Coccidioidesspp – Immuno Mycologics, Inc. Complement Fixation CF etects IgG antibodies and allows for assessment of disease severity. Lateral Flow Assay The Sona Coccidioides Antibody LFA is a rapid test.

It detects the presence of total antibodies against Coccidioides spp. Treatment and recovery No evidence from randomized trials exists to determine whether antifungal treatment for uncomplicated coccidioidal infections reduces symptom duration or prevents complications. Some infections will resolve without antifungal treatment. Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines suggest treatment for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in patients who:

- Are immunosuppressed
- Have severe or significantly debilitating illness
- Have diabetes or are frail because of age or comorbidities
- Are pregnant women
- Are of African or Filipino ancestry Disseminated coccidioidomycosis requires antifungal treatment, typically fluconazole or amphotericin B. For more detailed treatment guidelines, please refer to the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Coccidioidomycosis.
