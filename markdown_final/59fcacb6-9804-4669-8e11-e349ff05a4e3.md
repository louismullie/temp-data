## Question

How much do thiazide diuretics increase serum calcium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much thiazide diuretics increase serum calcium and what the clinical implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence that quantifies the effect size. Then, I should verify whether the effect is consistent across populations and doses. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and reconcile any conflicting clinical data. Finally, I need to translate this into practical monitoring and safety guidance, including special populations and drug interactions.

> Let me first confirm the most reliable estimate. A large mendelian randomization analysis using genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics found a significant increase in serum calcium with a beta coefficient of 0.051 SD, which corresponds to approximately 0.8 mg/dL, and the authors explicitly note that prior reports estimate an increase of about 0.8 mg/dL among thiazide users, which aligns with this instrumental variable estimate [^113Qw9oE] [^111Y6Fsb].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across sources. Multiple authoritative documents concur that thiazides reduce urinary calcium excretion and can raise serum calcium, with FDA labeling repeatedly advising caution and calcium monitoring when thiazides are combined with agents that increase calcium or in patients with hypercalcemia, reinforcing a clinically meaningful effect on serum calcium [^113spn7Y] [^1159wiCj] [^1148LQfJ] [^114zzwFD] [^116hUEW9] [^116qup1f].

> I should double-check whether this effect varies by population or dose. In a randomized trial of Black adults receiving vitamin D3, hydrochlorothiazide use was associated with a mean serum calcium increase of about 0.2 mg/dL, suggesting that while the direction is consistent, the magnitude can be smaller in some settings, likely reflecting differences in baseline calcium handling, diet, and co-therapies [^112Tkqe9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in primary hyperparathyroidism cohorts, thiazides reduced urinary calcium without consistently increasing serum calcium, indicating that in PHPT the serum calcium effect may be blunted or offset by disease physiology, so the 0.8 mg/dL figure should not be overgeneralized to PHPT patients [^114QnBj3] [^117NNnDz].

> Next, I should review the mechanism to ensure biological plausibility. Thiazides inhibit the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, which increases distal calcium reabsorption and reduces calciuria; this renal calcium retention provides a direct pathway to mild hypercalcemia, and extracellular volume contraction may further enhance proximal calcium reabsorption, reinforcing the effect in some contexts [^115iy6Mt] [^113spn7Y].

> But wait, what about clinical significance and safety thresholds. The mendelian randomization estimate of roughly 0.8 mg/dL would typically shift a patient with a baseline calcium of 9.5 mg/dL to about 10.3 mg/dL, which falls in the mild hypercalcemia range and is often asymptomatic, though symptoms can occur in a subset. Severe hypercalcemia is uncommon with thiazides alone and, when present, should prompt evaluation for underlying primary hyperparathyroidism or other causes [^117NS27X] [^113spn7Y].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and drug interactions. Guidelines advise avoiding or using thiazides cautiously in patients with cancer and bone metastases due to potential increases in serum calcium, and FDA labeling warns about hypercalcemia risk when thiazides are combined with vitamin D analogs or calcium supplements, so coadministration warrants close monitoring and dose adjustments as needed [^117KYF7y] [^116hUEW9] [^116qup1f] [^115eppWT].

> Let me consider practical monitoring. Authoritative guidance recommends periodic serum electrolyte checks with thiazide therapy, including calcium, potassium, sodium, and creatinine, with heightened vigilance in older adults, those with CKD, or anyone on interacting drugs. If hypercalcemia is detected, I should confirm persistence off thiazide and evaluate for PHPT or other etiologies before attributing causality [^114Z3kxS] [^1172SeSg] [^115HxQeX] [^113spn7Y].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and reconcile variability. The best-supported estimate is that thiazide diuretics increase serum calcium by about 0.8 mg/dL on average in general populations, with smaller increases observed in some subgroups and minimal or inconsistent serum calcium changes in PHPT. The effect is mechanistically coherent, dose- and context-dependent, and generally mild but clinically relevant enough to warrant routine monitoring and cautious use with calcium-raising co-therapies [^113Qw9oE] [^111Y6Fsb] [^112Tkqe9] [^114QnBj3] [^113spn7Y].

---

Thiazide diuretics typically raise serum calcium by about **0.2–0.8 mg/dL** (0.05–0.2 mmol/L) [^113Qw9oE] due to increased distal tubular calcium reabsorption [^115iy6Mt] and reduced urinary calcium excretion [^111Y6Fsb]. The effect is usually mild and asymptomatic, but **monitoring is advised** in patients at risk of hypercalcemia or on calcium-raising drugs [^113spn7Y] [^116hUEW9]. Clinically significant hypercalcemia is uncommon and often signals underlying hyperparathyroidism [^111ifY2c] [^117NS27X].

---

## Mechanism of thiazide-induced hypercalcemia

Thiazides increase serum calcium primarily by **reducing urinary calcium excretion** via enhanced distal tubular reabsorption [^115iy6Mt], which can produce mild hypercalcemia, especially with prolonged use or high doses [^113spn7Y].

---

## Magnitude of serum calcium increase

The average increase in serum calcium with thiazides is **approximately 0.2–0.8 mg/dL** (0.05–0.2 mmol/L) [^113Qw9oE] [^111Y6Fsb]. Mendelian randomization estimates a mean increase of about 0.8 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) [^notfound]. Clinical studies show smaller, variable increases, often around 0.2 mg/dL (0.05 mmol/L) [^112Tkqe9], depending on dose, duration, and patient factors.

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

Thiazide-induced hypercalcemia is usually mild and asymptomatic, but **clinically significant hypercalcemia** can occur, particularly in patients with underlying disorders or those taking calcium-raising medications [^113spn7Y]. Risk factors include:

- **Primary hyperparathyroidism**: Thiazides can unmask or exacerbate hypercalcemia [^111ifY2c] [^114vqPTs].
- **Vitamin D supplementation**: Combined use increases hypercalcemia risk [^112Tkqe9] [^116hUEW9].
- **High doses or prolonged use**: Greater risk of sustained hypercalcemia [^111ifY2c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **routine monitoring** of serum calcium in patients on thiazides, especially those at risk of hypercalcemia or on calcium-raising drugs [^114Z3kxS] [^1172SeSg]. Thiazides should be discontinued before evaluating parathyroid function to avoid confounding results [^113spn7Y] [^114vqPTs].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Magnitude of calcium increase** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Mendelian randomization | ~0.8 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) | - Mild hypercalcemia <br/> - Usually asymptomatic [^117NS27X] [^111Y6Fsb] |
| Clinical studies | ~0.2 mg/dL (0.05 mmol/L) | - Mild hypercalcemia <br/> - Usually asymptomatic [^112Tkqe9] [^117NS27X] |
| Case reports | Variable; occasionally severe | - Clinically significant hypercalcemia <br/> - Often with underlying disorders [^111ifY2c] [^116vNcXm] |

---

Thiazide diuretics typically cause a **modest rise in serum calcium** of about 0.2–0.8 mg/dL (0.05–0.2 mmol/L) [^112Tkqe9] [^111Y6Fsb], reflecting reduced urinary calcium excretion [^115iy6Mt]. The effect is usually mild and asymptomatic, but monitoring is prudent in at-risk patients or when combined with calcium-raising therapies [^113spn7Y] [^116hUEW9].

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with cancer (management), ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics only if needed for BP control and in patients with fluid retention because of their potential to cause unwanted effects in patients with cancer, including increases in serum calcium concentration in patients with bone metastasis, increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to prolonging QT interval (by inducing hypokalemia), increased risk of hyponatremia, and potential worsening of hypovolemic states or dehydration.

### Incidence and clinical spectrum of thiazide-associated hypercalcemia [^111ifY2c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The study determines the incidence of thiazide-associated hypercalcemia and clarifies its clinical features and natural history.

Methods

In a population-based descriptive study, Olmsted County, Minn, residents with thiazide-associated hypercalcemia were identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project and the Mayo Clinic Laboratory Information System. Changes in incidence rates were evaluated by Poisson regression.

Results

Seventy-two Olmsted County residents (68 women and 4 men; mean age, 64 years) with thiazide-associated hypercalcemia first recognized in 1992 to 2001 were identified. The overall annual age- and sex-adjusted (to 2000 US whites) incidence was 7.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9–9.5) per 100,000. There was an increase in incidence after 1996, peaking at 16.3 (95% CI, 8.3–24.3) per 100,000 in 1998. The highest rate was 55.3 per 100,000 in 70- to 79-year-old women. Hypercalcemia was identified a mean of 6 ± 7 years after thiazide initiation, and the average highest serum calcium was 10.7 ± 0.3 mg/dL with serum parathyroid hormone (obtained in 53 patients) of 4.8 ± 2.7 pmol/L. Of 33 patients who discontinued the thiazide, 21 (64%) had persistent hypercalcemia. Patients subsequently diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism had the highest average serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels of 11.0 ± 0.3 mg/dL and 6.3 ± 2.4 pmol/L, respectively.

Conclusion

The persistence of hypercalcemia in patients discontinuing thiazides, and similarities in the clinical spectrum, suggest that underlying primary hyperparathyroidism is common in patients who develop hypercalcemia while taking thiazide diuretics.

### Olmesartan medoxomil amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide [^113AkSZb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.

Amlodipine. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II: marked sensitivity to thiazides, hypercalciuria, normomagnesemia, and low bone mineral density [^117PBggV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Mutations in WNK kinases cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA II) and may represent a novel signaling pathway regulating blood pressure and K(+) and H(+) homeostasis. PHA II is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, with normal glomerular filtration rate. Thiazide diuretics correct all abnormalities. Inactivating mutations in the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter cause Gitelman syndrome, featuring hypotension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis plus hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia. We investigated whether hypercalciuria and hypermagnesemia occurred in a large family with PHA II. Eight affected and eight unaffected members of a PHA II family with the Q565E WNK 4 mutation were studied. In affected members blood and urinary chemistry were measured on and off hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and bone mineral density was determined. Marked sensitivity to HCTZ was found. A mean dose of 20 mg/d reduced mean blood pressure in the six hypertensive subjects by 54.3 (systolic) and 24.5 (diastolic) mm Hg. In affected subjects, HCTZ reduced mean serum K(+) by 1.12 mmol/liter, mean serum Cl(-) by 6.2 mmol/liter, and mean urinary calcium by 65% and elevated mean serum calcium by 0.11 mmol/liter and mean serum urate by 118 micromol/liter. Compared with the literature, this represents an increase of 6–7 in HCTZ potency. Affected members had normomagnesemia, hypercalciuria (336 ± 113 vs. 155 ± 39 mg/d in unaffected relatives, P = 0.0002), and decreased bone mineral density. In PHA II the observed marked sensitivity to thiazides and the hypercalciuria are consistent with increased NaCl cotransporter activity. PHA II may serve as a model to investigate thiazides' beneficial effects and side effects.

General

All patients receiving diuretic therapy should be observed for evidence of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present or after prolonged therapy.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Hypokalemia may be avoided or treated by use of potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements such as foods with a high potassium content.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazides.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

### Iatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D3 ointment (1, 24 (OH) 2D3) combined with thiazide diuretics in a case of psoriasis [^116vNcXm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Tacalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analogue developed for topical treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Hypercalcemia has not been previously reported during treatment with topical tacalcitol. We experienced a male patient with psoriasis and hypertension whose conditions were treated with tacalcitol ointment and thiazide, respectively, resulting in hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia. After initiation of topical vitamin D3 ointment (20 micro g/g of tacalcitol) 10 g/day for the skin lesions, both the serum level of calcium and urinary excretion of calcium increased gradually. On day 28 of the treatment, his serum calcium levels had reached 3.55 mmol/l, and his urinary calcium excretion had also increased from 0.008 g/day to 0.475 g/day. The tacalcitol treatment was terminated, seven days later, the serum calcium level had returned to the reference range without any specific treatment. The present case is the first report of hypercalcemia induced by vitamin D3 ointment and thiazide simultaneously.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^1148LQfJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 6.7% versus 3.5% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 0% for placebo.

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide also contains losartan which can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Concomitant use of other drugs that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy. Because losartan decreases uric acid, losartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide attenuates the diuretic-induced hyperuricemia.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.

5.6 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Hypercalciuria: diagnosis and treatment [^116C2DfM]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypercalciuria is the most common biochemical predictor of calcium stones. It can be classified as absorptive (intestinal), renal, and resorptive (primary hyperparathyroidism), but most will be labeled as having idiopathic hypercalciuria. Assessment with serum laboratories and 24-hour urine collection is necessary for evaluation. A diet of low sodium, low animal protein, and adequate dietary calcium with fluid intake greater than 3.5 L/d is the mainstay of therapeutic intervention. Thiazides are an appropriate pharmaceutical adjunct in patients with persistent hypercalciuria and recurrent stones.

The study included 634 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [8.6] years; 339 men [53.5%] and 295 women [46.5%]; 2 Asian [0.3%], 12 Black [1.9%], 2 Hispanic [0.3%], 2 North American Native [0.3%], 602 White [95.0%], 2 of other races and ethnicities [0.3%], and 12 of unknown race and ethnicity [1.9%]). Figure 1 reveals significant associations between higher thiazide doses and greater 24-hour mean (SE) and percentage calcium reductions (low dose: −79.3 [7.6] mg/d [95% CI, −94.1 to −64.4 mg/d] and −18.9% [2.5%] [95% CI, −23.9% to −14.0%]; medium dose: −94.1 [6.4] mg/d [95% CI, −106.7 to −81.5 mg/d] and −25.5% [2.1%] [95% CI, −29.6% to −21.3%]; high dose: −104.6 [6.3] mg/d [95% CI, −117.0 to −92.3 mg/d] and −28.4% [2.1%] [95% CI, −32.6% to −24.4%]; p = 0.04 for absolute difference and P = 0.02 for percentage difference). The adjusted cumulative incidence of a symptomatic stone event at 4 years was 28.8% (95% CI, 21.1%-35.7%), 19.5% (95% CI, 12.9%-25.7%), and 18.0% (95% CI, 11.5%-24.0%) for patients in the low (mean [SD], 24 [61] mg/d), medium (mean [SD], −90 [25] mg/d), and high (mean [SD], −216 [74] mg/d) tercile, respectively, of calcium change after thiazide prescription (P = 0.04 for trend; Figure 2).

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^114hUDwr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to prevention of stone recurrence, AUA 2014 guidelines recommend to offer thiazide diuretics in patients with high or relatively high urine calcium and recurrent calcium stones.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^114Yq1rA]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Thiazide-type diuretics are at least as effective as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, and ACE inhibitors in reducing CV outcomes. Thiazide diuretics are particularly effective in preventing stroke and HF in hypertensive patients. These drugs are very effective in the elderly and very elderly patients. The combined use of thiazide-like diuretics with aldosterone antagonists may be worthwhile. Thus, diuretics should remain the leading agents in the management of hypertension. However, the statement that these drugs are superior to other drugs in almost all patients with hypertension is not supported by superiority studies. Particularly in the younger hypertensive subjects, the benefit of diuretics as first-line antihypertensive drugs should be weight against the risk of unwanted effects in the long term. This holds particularly true in subjects at high risk of developing diabetes.

Due to this strong association with serum calcium, diuretic medications may theoretically affect BPPV risk as well. Diuretics are a large group of drugs that are commonly used to treat conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Certain classes, such as thiazide and loop diuretics, are well‐known to affect serum calcium concentration. Thiazides are thought to promote the passive reabsorption of calcium from urine in the distal convoluted tubules of the nephrons, resulting in mild hypercalcemia. However, loop diuretics disrupt the electrochemical gradient of the thick ascending limb of nephrons that allows for calcium reabsorption, resulting in increased urinary loss of calcium and mild hypocalcemia. Other common classes of diuretics include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) and potassium‐sparing diuretics. Although the association is not as strong as with loop and thiazide diuretics, there is some recent evidence to suggest that CAIs may induce a mild hypocalcemia. Potassium‐sparing diuretics, however, do not seem to have a consistent, well‐documented effect on calcium metabolism independent of pre‐existing renal or endocrinologic pathologies.,

Given these effects that diuretics have on serum calcium concentrations, it is possible that they may also extend to the cellular environment of the otoconia. If so, these effects may even modify BPPV risk. No such associations, however, have been reported in the literature, and there are currently no relevant clinical recommendations for reference, despite the high prevalence of this disease. Given that diuretics could theoretically have clinical implications in this regard, it is important to further explore this association so that diuretic prescribing practices may be adjusted accordingly. We hypothesized that the prevalence of BPPV may associate with the use of different classes of diuretics.

### Thiazide diuretics arrest the progression of nephrocalcinosis in children with X-linked hypophosphatemia [^115Bbrfe]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is characterized clinically by rickets, hypophosphatemia, and hyperphosphaturia. Conventional treatment of XLH with oral phosphate and vitamin D is associated with increased urinary calcium excretion and nephrocalcinosis. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of thiazide diuretics on the clinical and radiologic course of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH.

Methods

The effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on clinical and radiologic progression of nephrocalcinosis was evaluated in 11 children with XLH. All patients had been treated previously with vitamin D and oral phosphate and had radiologic evidence of nephrocalcinosis. The average age of the patients at the start of HCTZ was 6.6 ± 1.0 years. The effect of oral HCTZ at 0.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day given for 3.3 ± 0.6 years on the progression of nephrocalcinosis and urinary calcium excretion was evaluated.

Results

There was no change in serum phosphorous, calcium, potassium, and chloride after HCTZ therapy. HCTZ therapy increased serum bicarbonate and decreased urinary calcium excretion. The grade of nephrocalcinosis increased from 0.4 ± 0.2 to 1.5 ± 0.3 in the 2.3 ± 0.3 years before initiation of HCTZ therapy, whereas the degree of nephrocalcinosis was stable after 3.3 ± 0.6 years of HCTZ therapy (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 3.0 ± 0.3).

Conclusion

HCTZ decreased urinary calcium excretion but did not result in the resolution of nephrocalcinosis. However, when compared with the control period, HCTZ prevented the progression of nephrocalcinosis in children with XLH.

### Olmesartan medoxomil / amlodipine besylate / hydrochlorothiazide (Tribenzor) [^113yVLVb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.

Amlodipine. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111xUmcs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical guideline — pharmacologic therapy for recurrent nephrolithiasis — summarizes mechanism-based selection and scope of evidence. Clinicians often select pharmacologic therapy on the basis of method of action: thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium and are often prescribed for patients with hypercalciuria, citrates bind to calcium and decrease urine acidity, and allopurinol decreases uric acid in urine. Almost all studies analyzed included only patients with calcium stones, the most common stone type, and although biochemistry suggests a relationship between pharmacologic method of action and stone type, no randomized, controlled trials link biochemical testing to outcomes. Our recommendations do not include patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism or other rare cases.

### The mechanism of hypocalciuria with NaCl cotransporter inhibition [^115iy6Mt]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are used to prevent the recurrence of calcium-containing kidney stones. The ability of these drugs to reduce urinary calcium excretion has a key role in this process. Although studies have shown a reduction in the recurrence rate of calcium-containing stones in patients treated with thiazides, whether hypocalciuria results from increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal or distal nephron is still unclear. When extracellular fluid volume is considerably reduced, the proximal tubule is likely to have a major role in thiazide-induced hypocalciuria. This process frequently occurs when high doses of thiazides and sodium restriction are prescribed for the treatment of kidney stone disease. The distal tubule is predominantly involved in NaCl cotransporter inhibition-induced hypocalciuria when the extracellular fluid volume is not reduced, a clinical scenario observed in patients with Gitelman syndrome. In this Perspectives article, we discuss the evidence supporting the hypocalciuric effects of NaCl cotransporter inhibition in the proximal and distal nephron.

### The evidence-based use of thiazide diuretics in hypertension and nephrolithiasis [^113i7nxS]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Thiazide-type diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and nephrolithiasis. Evidence from randomized clinical trials needs to be considered in decisions about agent choice and dose. In nephrolithiasis, one of the major limitations of the literature is a paucity of data on the dose-response effect of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on urinary calcium excretion. The best available evidence for prevention of stone recurrence suggests the use of indapamide at 2.5 mg/d, chlorthalidone at 25 to 50 mg daily, or HCTZ 25 mg twice a day or 50 mg daily. In hypertension, chlorthalidone (12.5 to 30 mg daily) may be the best choice when a diuretic is used for initial therapy, with indapamide (1.5 mg daily) being a valuable alternative for older patients. When adding a thiazide to other drug classes, indapamide (2.5 mg daily) has demonstrated value in hypertensive patients who have had a stroke, and HCTZ (12.5 to 25 mg daily) has a safe track record in several patient groups. Although chlorthalidone has not been tested as add-on therapy, the authors believe it is a safe option in such cases.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^115zBL1L]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Kidney stones belong to the most frequent human diseases and constitute a global health problem. Kidney stones are extremely painful, relapse frequently and cause enormous health care expenditures and excess morbidity. Thus, a well-tolerated, inexpensive and effective approach to prevent kidney stones is highly desired. While thiazides have been the cornerstone of pharmacologic metaphylaxis for several decades, evidence for benefits and harms of thiazides in general and dose-response relationship in particular in the recurrence prevention of kidney stones remain unclear.

Strengths of the NOSTONE study include the large number of patients studied, the prospective multicenter, parallel-arm, double-blind and placebo-controlled design with stratification by disease activity, the clear allocation concealment and intention-to-treat analysis, the employment of high sensitivity and high specificity imaging, the use of state-of-the-art dietary recommendations, the careful assessment of putative side effects in the stone population and the exclusive public funding support.

The results of the NOSTONE trial will provide patients and physicians alike with long-sought evidence to adapt and hopefully improve preventive measures for calcium containing kidney stones.

### Hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism… [^1167Z2bK]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Twenty patients being treated with thiazides were found among 95 subjects with hyercalcemia verified in repeated determinations in a health screening of 15, 903 persons. There were 1, 034 patients treated with thiazides in this total health screening. The prevalence of hypercalcemia in the patients treated with thiazide was considerably higher than the prevalence of hypercalcemia found in the entire healthscreened population. The thiazide treatment was withdrawn in the 20 hypercalcemic subjects after an examination, and the patients were observed at intervals during a follow-up period of one year. The necks of 14 were explored during or after the follow-up period because of an initial serum calcium level ≥ 3. 0 mmole/ liter or persistent hypercalcemia. Parathyroid adenomas were seen in all patients receiving surgery. Single adenomas predominated in surgical findings.

The finding of the present high number of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism may be associated with elevated blood pressure resulting in thiazide treatment after detection.

### Hydrochlorothiazide and prevention of kidney-stone recurrence [^117K4GFT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common conditions affecting the kidney and is characterized by a high risk of recurrence. Thiazide diuretic agents are widely used for prevention of the recurrence of kidney stones, but data regarding the efficacy of such agents as compared with placebo are limited. Furthermore, dose-response data are also limited.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones to receive hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg once daily or placebo once daily. The main objective was to investigate the dose-response effect for the primary end point, a composite of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence of kidney stones. Radiologic recurrence was defined as the appearance of new stones on imaging or the enlargement of preexisting stones that had been observed on the baseline image. Safety was also assessed.

Results

In all, 416 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a median of 2.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 60 of 102 patients (59%) in the placebo group, in 62 of 105 patients (59%) in the 12.5-mg hydrochlorothiazide group (rate ratio vs. placebo, 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 1.93), in 61 of 108 patients (56%) in the 25-mg group (rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.79), and in 49 of 101 patients (49%) in the 50-mg group (rate ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.36). There was no relation between the hydrochlorothiazide dose and the occurrence of a primary end-point event (P = 0.66). Hypokalemia, gout, new-onset diabetes mellitus, skin allergy, and a plasma creatinine level exceeding 150% of the baseline level were more common among patients who received hydrochlorothiazide than among those who received placebo.

Conclusions

Among patients with recurrent kidney stones, the incidence of recurrence did not appear to differ substantially among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once daily at a dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg or placebo once daily.

### Thiazide dose, urine calcium, and symptomatic kidney stone events [^115qPUjB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although thiazides are a mainstay of kidney stone prevention, one study (the Hydrochlorothiazide for Kidney Stone Recurrence Prevention [NOSTONE] trial) questioned their efficacy, leading some to argue against their use for this indication. Because thiazides are believed to mitigate stone formation by reducing urine calcium, one explanation for NOSTONE's null finding is that the calcium reductions were insufficient to affect recurrence risk. We conducted a cohort study quantifying the association between thiazide dose and calcium reduction and correlating calcium changes with symptomatic stone events.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116N6MPx]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones — empiric therapy when no metabolic abnormality persists states that clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics and/or potassium citrate to patients with recurrent calcium stones in whom other metabolic abnormalities are absent or have been appropriately addressed and stone formation persists (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). It adds that thiazides and potassium citrate therapy have been shown to prevent recurrent stones in patients with normal range urinary calcium and citrate, respectively, and therefore it may be appropriate to utilize these therapies for patients with recurrent stones who do not demonstrate specific urinary abnormalities, with potassium citrate possibly preferred first-line in patients with no identified risk factors for nephrolithiasis given its relatively low side effect profile.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the reduction of kidney stone risk [^111Y6Fsb]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

For over 3 decades, thiazide drugs have been the standard of care for the prevention of kidney stone recurrence. This practice was built upon observational data sets and multiple small clinical trials. However, the largest randomized clinical trial failed to find a protective effect of thiazides on kidney stone recurrence. Our mendelian randomization study provides further evidence that the action of thiazides may be sufficient to prevent kidney stone formation.

The use of mendelian randomization in this context offers several benefits. Genetic proxies may overcome potential confounding or reverse causation bias that may arise in studies of drug effects. For example, salt intake can increase urinary sodium and blunt the hypocalciuric effect of thiazide diuretics, but dietary habits are difficult to control in clinical studies. Mendelian randomization, on the other hand, is based on genetic variation assigned at birth and unaffected by environmental factors such as diet. Additionally, mendelian randomization provides a rapid and cost-effective means of investigating drug targets, whereas a large clinical trial would require immense effort and cost. Genetic proxies can approximate the effect of thiazide drugs over the course of a lifetime, as opposed to the confined duration of clinical trials.

The finding that genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics increase serum calcium while also reducing the risk of kidney stones is important. First, it supports the robustness of our instrumental variables, which appear to mimic the expected change in calcium seen in clinical practice. Prior reports estimate an increase of 0.8 mg/dL of serum calcium among thiazide users. Second, it supports the theory that modulation of calcium excretion through thiazide diuretics is a relevant mechanism for the reduced risk of kidney stones. While the exact mechanism is not completely understood, thiazides do appear to affect calcium absorption in the kidney and modulate uptake in bone.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^111RhHBc]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is a worldwide healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of ~ 18.8% in men and ~ 9.4% in women in Western civilizations. Incidence and prevalence of renal stone disease are increasing globally, irrespective of age, sex and race. Without a specific treatment, 5- and 20-year recurrence rates are ~ 40% and ~ 75%, respectively. In the United States, hospitalizations, surgery and lost work time associated with kidney stones cost more than 5 billion US Dollars annually. Thus, given the high cost and the morbidity related to recurrent kidney stone disease, medical prophylaxis seems to be an attractive approach. Indeed, apart from its benefits to patients in terms of reduced morbidity and risk from procedures, medical prevention of nephrolithiasis is clearly cost effective.

Eighty to 90% of stones are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both. Increased excretion of calcium in the urine, hypercalciuria, is the most frequent metabolic abnormality encountered in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis. The hypercalciuria encountered in recurrent stone formers is often familial and strongly influenced by diet, but in most cases of unknown origin and hence designated "idiopathic". Gut absorption of calcium is enhanced in idiopathic hypercalciuria, but serum calcium remains typically normal because intestinally absorbed calcium is promptly excreted by the kidneys. Despite intestinal calcium hyperabsorption, patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria are often in negative calcium balance because of excessive renal calcium losses, especially under a low calcium diet. As a consequence, low bone mass is a frequent finding in normo- and especially hypercalciuric stone formers. Thiazide diuretics are the only drugs known to reduce urinary calcium excretion. This peculiar property is employed in the prevention of recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis but also in the prevention of bone loss in patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis and/or arterial hypertension.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (avalide) [^114sVaHg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of AVALIDE with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6	Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria [^117MFR7W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is an inherited metabolic abnormality characterised by excessive amounts of calcium excreted into the urine in patients with normal serum levels of calcium. The morbidity of hypercalciuria is related to kidney stone disease and bone demineralization. In children, hypercalciuria can cause recurrent haematuria, frequency-dysuria syndrome, urinary tract infection and abdominal and lumbar pain. Several pharmacological treatments have been described that can decrease the levels of urinary calcium or its index of urinary crystallization.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for preventing complications and decreasing urological symptoms in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), handsearched relevant conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS that compared any pharmacological intervention for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria, with placebo, other pharmacological intervention or a different administration mode or dose of the same treatment given for a minimum duration of four months and had a follow-up period of at least six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean difference (MD).

Main Results

Five studies (316 adult patients) were included. Four compared thiazides with standard treatment (periodic clinical follow-up and increased water intake) or specific dietary recommendations and one analysed the effect of thiazide plus a neutral potassium salt. There was a significant decrease in the number of new stone recurrences in those treated with thiazides (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.96), although the follow-up periods varied. The stone formation rate also showed a statistically significant decrease in the patients treated with diuretics (MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.06). Thiazides plus potassium salts significantly decreased calciuria and vitamin D levels.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria and recurrent stones, the addition of thiazides to a normal or modified diet for short to long periods (five months to three years) reduced the number of stone recurrences and decreased the stone formation rate. Thiazides and neutral potassium phosphate decreased calciuria in symptomatic patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria. There were no studies investigating the effect of pharmacological treatment on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. To the Editor. — The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been found to increase serum calcium levels and even to cause frank hypercalcemia in patients with a variety of diseases as well as in normal subjects. The mechanism for this hypercalcemic effect is not known but appears to require the presence of the parathyroid glands. The following is a report of a patient who appears to have hypercalcemia secondary to the use of the diuretic chlorthalidone. Report of a Case. — A 42-year-old woman had been treated for mild labile hypertension for three years with chlorthalidone, 25 mg every other day. She had a history of tension headaches and mild anxiety reactions. One year prior to her initial clinic visit, the patient's serum calcium level was 10. 8 mg/100 ml, and ten months later,
10. 6 mg/100 ml.

### Risk of hypercalcemia in blacks taking hydrochlorothiazide and vitamin D [^112Tkqe9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hydrochlorothiazide, an effective antihypertensive medication commonly prescribed to blacks, decreases urinary calcium excretion. Blacks have significantly higher rates of hypertension and lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Thus, they are more likely to be exposed to vitamin D supplementation and thiazide diuretics. The risk for hypercalcemia among blacks using vitamin D and hydrochlorothiazide is undefined.

Methods

We assessed the frequency of hypercalcemia in hydrochlorothiazide users in a post hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind, dose-finding trial of 328 blacks (median age 51 years) assigned to either placebo, or 1000, 2000, or 4000 international units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 3 months during the winter (2007–2010).

Results

Of the 328 participants, 84 reported hydrochlorothiazide use and had serum calcium levels assessed. Additionally, a comparison convenience group of 44 enrolled participants who were not taking hydrochlorothiazide had serum calcium measurements at 3 months, but not at baseline. At 3 months, hydrochlorothiazide participants had higher calcium levels (0.2 mg/dL, P < .001) than nonhydrochlorothiazide participants, but only one participant in the hydrochlorothiazide group had hypercalcemia. In contrast, none of the nonhydrochlorothiazide participants had hypercalcemia. In a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, 25-hydroxyvitamin D at 3 months, and other covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide use (Estimate [SE]: 0.05 [0.01], P = 0.01) predicted serum calcium at 3 months.

Conclusion

In summary, vitamin D3 supplementation up to 4000 IU in hydrochlorothiazide users is associated with an increase in serum calcium but a low frequency of hypercalcemia. These findings suggest that participants of this population can use hydrochlorothiazide with up to 4000 IU of vitamin D3 daily and experience a low frequency of hypercalcemia.

### Hydroflumenthiazide (Saluron) [^1177bTHE]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

Anticoagulants (oral): effects may be decreased when used concurrently with thiazide diuretics; dosage adjustments may be necessary.

Antigout medications: thiazide diuretics may raise the level of blood uric acid; dosage adjustment of antigout medications may be necessary to control hyperuricemia and gout.

Other antihypertensive medications, especially diazoxide; pre-anesthetic and anesthetic agents used in surgery; skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing, used in surgery: effects may be potentiated when used concurrently with thiazide diuretics; dosage adjustments may be necessary.

Amphotericin B or Corticosteroids, including Corticotropin (ACTH): concurrent use with thiazide diuretics may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia.

Cardiac glycosides: concurrent use with thiazide diuretics may enhance the possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia.

Colestipol: may inhibit gastrointestinal absorption of the thiazide diuretics; administration 1 hour before or 4 hours after colestipol is recommended.

Hypoglycemics: thiazide diuretics may raise blood glucose levels. For adult-onset diabetics, dosage adjustment of hypoglycemic medications may be necessary during and after thiazide diuretic therapy; insulin requirements may be increased, decreased, or unchanged.

Lithium salts: concurrent use with thiazide diuretics is not recommended, as they may provoke lithium toxicity because of reduced renal clearance.

Methenamine: effectiveness may be decreased when used concurrently with thiazide diuretics, because of alkalinization of the urine.

Diagnostic Interference

With expected physiologic effects.

Blood and urine glucose levels: usually only in patients with a predisposition to glucose intolerance.

Serum bilirubin levels: displacement from albumin binding.

Serum calcium levels: thiazide diuretics should be discontinued before parathyroid function tests are carried out.

Serum uric acid levels: may be increased.

Serum magnesium, potassium, and sodium levels: may be decreased, serum magnesium levels may increase in uremic patients.

Serum protein-bound iodine (PBI) levels: may be decreased.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^112BpV2B]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — pharmacologic therapy for recurrent calcium stones: Clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics to patients with high or relatively high urine calcium and recurrent calcium stones (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Thiazide dosages associated with a hypocalciuric effect include hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg orally, twice daily; 50 mg orally, once daily), chlorthalidone (25 mg orally, once daily), and indapamide (2.5 mg orally, once daily), and dietary prescription, especially restriction of sodium intake, should be continued when thiazides are prescribed to maximize the hypocalciuric effect and limit potassium wasting.

### Medical management of common urinary calculi [^111ka4UE]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common condition affecting nearly 5 percent of U.S. men and women during their lifetimes. Recurrent calculi can be prevented in most patients by the use of a simplified evaluation, reasonable dietary and fluid recommendations, and directed pharmacologic intervention. Serum studies and 24-hour urine collections are the mainstays of metabolic investigation and usually are warranted in patients with recurrent calculi. Although some stones are the result of inherited conditions, most result from a complex interaction between diet, fluid habits, and genetic predisposition. Calcium-sparing diuretics such as thiazides often are used to treat hypercalciuria. Citrate medications increase levels of this naturally occurring stone inhibitor. Allopurinol can be helpful in patients with hyperuricosuria, and urease inhibitors can help break the cycle of infectious calculi. Aggressive fluid intake and moderated intake of salt, calcium, and meat are recommended for most patients.

### Effect of indapamide on urinary calcium excretion in patients with and without urinary stone disease [^1175gmsW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Indapamide is an antihypertensive agent similar to thiazides, but with some different effects. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are useful in preventing recurrent urinary stone formation due to their hypocalciuric effects.

Objective

To determine the hypocalciuric and other effects on certain laboratory parameters of indapamide 1.5 mg in different patient groups.

Methods

Four groups of patients recruited from urology and nephrology outpatient departments were experiencing non-hypercalciuric urinary stone disease (group 1), idiopathic hypercalciuria (group 2), urinary stone disease with hypercalciuria (group 3), and essential hypertension (group 4). In all patients, fasting serum uric acid, calcium, sodium, potassium, cholesterol, triglyceride, parathyroid hormone (PTH) values, and morning second-spot urine calcium and creatinine levels were assessed before and 8 weeks after treatment with indapamide.

Results

Urinary calcium excretion was reduced significantly in all groups: group 1 from 0.10 ± 0.02 to 0.07 ± 0.03 (mean ± SD; 30% reduction; p < 0.001), group 2 from 0.30 ± 0.15 to 0.15 ± 0.10 (50% reduction; p < 0.001), group 3 from 0.35 ± 0.15 to 0.20 ± 0.10 (43% reduction; p < 0.001), and group 4 from 0.10 ± 0.03 to 0.08 ± 0.02 (20% reduction; p < 0.0010). These results should be interpreted with caution since no control group was included in this study. Mean serum uric acid and triglyceride levels were significantly increased, and mean PTH and potassium levels and diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significantly decreased in all groups. Few temporary adverse effects, such as dizziness and fatigue, were noticed and none of them caused discontinuation of treatment.

Conclusions

Indapamide 1.5 mg/day is effective in decreasing calciuria in patients with non-hypercalciuric urinary stone disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, urinary stone disease with hypercalciuria, and essential hypertension. This could be achieved with few adverse effects similar to those of thiazides and indapamide 2.5 mg. Indapamide decreased the PTH levels in all groups. Long-term clinical benefits of these effects should be evaluated prospectively with further randomized studies.

### Diuretics, calciuria and secondary hyperparathyroidism in the chronic renal insufficiency cohort [^113JxPEf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is associated with bone disease, cardiovascular disease and death. Pathophysiological factors that maintain secondary hyperparathyroidism in advanced CKD are well-known, but early mechanisms of the disease that can be targeted for its primary prevention are poorly understood. Diuretics are widely used to control volume status and blood pressure in CKD patients but are also known to have important effects on renal calcium handling, which we hypothesized could alter the risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

We examined the relationship of diuretic treatment with urinary calcium excretion, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH ≥ 65 pg/mL) in a cross-sectional study of 3616 CKD patients in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort.

Results

Compared with no diuretics, treatment with loop diuretics was independently associated with higher adjusted urinary calcium (55.0 versus 39.6 mg/day; P < 0.001), higher adjusted PTH [67.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 65.2–70.7 pg/mL, versus 52.8, 95% CI 51.1–54.6 pg/mL, P < 0.001] and greater odds of secondary hyperparathyroidism (odds ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.7–2.6). Thiazide monotherapy was associated with lower calciuria (25.5 versus 39.6 mg/day; P < 0.001) but only modestly lower PTH levels (50.0, 95% CI 47.8–52.3, versus 520.8, 95% CI 51.1–54.6 pg/mL, P = 0.04) compared with no diuretics. However, coadministration of thiazide and loop diuretics was associated with blunted urinary calcium (30.3 versus 55.0 mg/day; P < 0.001) and odds of hyperparathyroidism (odds ratio 1.3 versus 2.1; P for interaction = 0.05) compared with loop diuretics alone.

Conclusions

Loop diuretic use was associated with greater calciuria, PTH levels and odds of secondary hyperparathyroidism compared to no treatment. These associations were attenuated in patients who were coadministered thiazides. Diuretic choice is a potentially modifiable determinant of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^114zzwFD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia may develop in association with the use of spironolactone; physicians should be alert to its possible onset. The development of gynecomastia appears to be related to both dosage level and duration of therapy and is normally reversible when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued. In rare instances, some breast enlargement may persist when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued.

Somnolence

Somnolence and dizziness have been reported to occur in some patients. Caution is advised when driving or operating machinery until the response to initial treatment has been determined.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be advised to avoid potassium supplements and foods containing high levels of potassium including salt substitutes.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer

Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening.

Laboratory Tests

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be done at appropriate intervals, particularly in the elderly and those with significant renal or hepatic impairments.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists, Aldosterone Blockers, Potassium Supplements, Heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, and Other Drugs Known to Cause Hyperkalemia

Concomitant administration may lead to severe hyperkalemia.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics

Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism if serum calcium is elevated (total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium) in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the absence of conditions mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism (thiazide diuretics or lithium) and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### Adverse metabolic side effects of thiazides: implications for patients with calcium nephrolithiasis [^114xyeQB]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Thiazide use to prevent recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis is supported by randomized, controlled trials. Concerns regarding adverse metabolic effects of thiazides, which are also used to treat hypertension, have reemerged with analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial. The risks posed by thiazide induced hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia and dyslipidemia may decrease the expected cardiovascular benefit of lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Whether these side effects occur and are clinically significant in nonhypertensive patients with kidney stones treated with thiazides is unclear.

Materials and Methods

A review of the literature was performed for randomized, controlled trials with thiazides for calcium nephrolithiasis. We sought data regarding metabolic effects in this population, including hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia and dyslipidemia.

Results

Nine randomized, controlled trials of thiazide treatment for kidney stones were included. Mean patient age was 42 years and followup was 2.6 years. Only 2 of the 9 studies measured glucose and lipid levels, which did not significantly change with treatment. Three studies measured serum potassium and 2 showed a significant decrease. Three of the 9 studies measured serum uric acid levels, which increased in all 3. None of the trials studied the development of diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

There is a lack of data on the metabolic effects of thiazides used to prevent recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis. It remains unclear if metabolic effects occur and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy patients with recurrent nephrolithiasis on thiazide prophylaxis. Further research is needed to elucidate other alternatives for the treatment of recurrent nephrolithiasis.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^1117S8iL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Insulin

Many patients with T2DM are often treated with insulin early in the disease process, in spite of the availability of multiple classes of antidiabetic agents with extremely low risks of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, with longer durations of diabetes and progressive β-cell deterioration, most patients with T2DM will eventually require insulin to control glucose levels effectively, and prevent diabetes-related complications. Direct insulin-related positive effects on the lipid profile include reductions in TG levels, most apparent with more dramatic improvement of glycemic control, along with increases in HDL-C levels; LDL-C levels remain typically unaffected.

Antihypertensive agents

The latest guidelines from the US Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) recommend the use of thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium antagonists as first-line treatment of patients with hypertension, including those with diabetes. The JNC 8 guidelines do not include β-blockers as first-line treatment, but these agents have been widely used in the past, particularly in hypertensive patients with heart failure or with an increased risk of CHD.

Thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists

Thiazide diuretics lead to dose-dependent increases in cholesterol levels without altering HDL-C levels. Despite this increase in cholesterol levels, diuretic-based antihypertensive treatment effectively reduced the risk of stroke, MI, and CHD in patients with diabetes in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP).

Calcium antagonists do not appear to affect the lipid profile, although some evidence suggests that they might enhance TG removal. Results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) showed a greater decrease of serum cholesterol in patients treated with calcium antagonists compared with diuretics.

ACE inhibitors

The available data on the effect of ACE inhibitors on lipid profiles are inconsistent. In the past, it was believed that ACE inhibitors had no effects on the lipid profile; however, newer data suggest that some ACE inhibitors could have favorable effects on the lipid profile and atherosclerotic changes, significantly lowering serum LDL-C and TG levels, and increasing HDL-C levels.

ARBs

ARBs have been shown to significantly increase HDL-C levels and decrease LDL-C levels. In general, ARBs also tend to lower apo B levels, while only losartan and valsartan have been shown to significantly decrease TG levels. Treatment with ARBs may therefore positively impact CVD risk through blood pressure reduction and positive effects on the plasma lipid profile.

### Medications that affect calcium [^115MvVLC]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review medications that can affect serum calcium concentrations.

Methods

The literature was reviewed for articles pertaining to medications that affect calcium concentrations.

Results

The serum calcium concentration is tightly regulated because of the importance of this mineral in diffuse cellular processes. Many medications have been reported to cause changes in serum calcium levels by influencing intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium resorption, and bone remodeling or through altering parathyroid or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated regulation. Some medications are used specifically to alter serum calcium as a therapeutic intervention. With others, the calcium disturbances are viewed as a side effect of the treatment.

Conclusion

It is important to be aware of the influence that medications can have on serum calcium levels when evaluating patients with disorders of calcium homeostasis.

### Interrelationships among metabolic syndrome, bone-derived cytokines, and the most common metabolic syndrome-related diseases negatively affecting bone quality [^116m1Xr4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is known to be an important factor affecting bone loss. As a result of hypertension, there is an increased excretion of calcium (Ca) in the urine due to competition between sodium (Na) and Ca ions in the renal proximal tubule. Urinary excretion of Ca reduces the level of circulating Ca, resulting in activation of parathyroid hormone (PTH), thereby increasing bone resorption. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that maintenance of Ca levels provides protective effects on bone strength and reduces the incidence of bone fractures in hypertension by limiting urinary Ca loss. Sympathetic tone, vascular perturbations, cytokines, renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system, and vitamin D were described as further aspects connecting OP, hypertension, and related CVDs. According to Li et al. the risk of fragility fractures was higher in subjects with hypertension compared to healthy individuals. A cross-sectional study by Li et al. revealed a positive association between hypertension and lumbar spine BMD in both postmenopausal women and older men. In general, thiazide diuretics (thiazides) are well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive drugs that are considered candidates for the prevention of postmenopausal bone loss due to their ability to reduce urinary Ca excretion. Furthermore, they are known to have a positive effect on BMD and their use is associated with a reduced risk of OP-related fractures. A meta-analysis of Cheng et al. showed that patients treated with thiazides had significantly higher serum Ca levels, lower urinary Ca levels, and unchanged BMD. The recent findings by van der Burgh et al. suggest their positive impacts on lumbar spine BMD but not on lumbar spine TBS. Therefore, reduced fracture risk after thiazide therapy can be explained by elevated bone mass rather than improved bone microarchitecture. Other antihypertensives such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and selective β-adrenergic receptor blockers might also improve BMD. A recent meta-analysis by Langerhuizen et al. revealed that, in addition to thiazide diuretics, ARBs and β-blockers can reduce the risk of hip fracture. Additionally, nonselective β-adrenergic receptor blockers and dihydropyridine Ca channel blockers were found to have no significant relationship with BMD or bone strength. Since negative results have been reported on the impact of loop diuretics and α-adrenergic receptor blockers on OP indicators, they are not recommended for patients who are at increased risk of OP or already have OP.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the reduction of kidney stone risk [^115G8pt9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Figure 1.
Association of Genetic Proxies of Thiazide Diuretics, β-Blockers, and Systolic Blood Pressure With Risk of Kidney Stones

FinnGenn indicates the FinnGen study; MVP, Million Veteran Program; OR, odds ratio; UKB, UK Biobank.

Genetic proxies of β-blockers and systolic blood pressure served as negative controls. Genetic proxies of β-blockers did not have a significant effect in the meta-analysis (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.07; p = 0.52). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (P for MVP Q = .67, P for MR-Egger Q = .61) or pleiotropy (P for MVP MR-Egger intercept = .69, P for MR-PRESSO global test = .72) (eTable 11 in Supplement 1). Similarly, genetic determinants of systolic blood pressure were not associated with the odds of kidney stones (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01; p = 0.49). There was evidence of heterogeneity (P for MVP Q < .001, P for MR-Egger Q < .001) and pleiotropy (P for MVP MR-Egger intercept = .81, P for MR-PRESSO global test < .001). However, no outliers were detected in the MR-PRESSO outlier test (eTable 12 in Supplement 1).

The association of genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics was tested against laboratory values related to the treatment of kidney stones (Figure 2). Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with higher levels of serum calcium (β [SE], 0.051 [0.0093]; P < .001) and total cholesterol (β [SE], 0.065 [0.015]; P < .001) but lower levels of serum potassium (β [SE], −0.073 [0.022]; P < .001). There were no significant associations with hemoglobin A 1c, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, phosphorus, urate, or vitamin D (eTable 13 in Supplement 1).

### Increased bone mineral density in a population-based group of 70-year-old women on thiazide diuretics, independent of parathyroid hormone levels [^116P5fHq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have shown greater bone mineral density (BMD) in people receiving thiazide diuretics compared with controls. Most researchers have related this association to the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides with subsequent rise in serum calcium and fall in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Recent experimental evidence suggests, however, a direct effect of thiazides on osteoblast-like cells.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that the association of thiazides and raised BMD is independent of PTH levels in humans.

Subjects

A population-based group of 248 70-year-old Icelandic women, 51 receiving thiazide diuretics, 39 receiving other antihypertensive therapy and the rest acting as controls.

Main Outcome Measures

The independent contribution of thiazide usage and PTH to BMD in a multivariate analysis.

Results

The mean BMD was 9.6% greater in the lumbar spine (P < 0.01) and 5.4% greater in the whole skeleton (P < 0.01) amongst thiazide users than in controls, reduced to 7.6% (P < 0.02) and 4.5% (P < 0.01), respectively, when corrected for fat mass which was 5.8 kg greater in the thiazide group. In a multivariate analysis, corrected for body weight and body composition, serum calcium and ln-PTH, thiazides remained a significant independent predictor of BMD in the total skeleton and lumbar spine, but not in the total hip or femoral neck. Thiazides explained about 3% of the variability in whole body and lumbar spine BMD.

Conclusions

Thiazides augment or preserve BMD independent of PTH, implying other mechanisms.

### Adverse effect profile of trichlormethiazide: a retrospective observational study [^112m9azp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide diuretics have remained important medications for the treatment of hypertension for over 50 years, since they became available in the late 1950s. Numerous clinical trials have shown the clinical efficacy of thiazides, as well as a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, resulting from their blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect. Most complications of thiazide therapy are related to their adverse-effect profile. It is well known that thiazides can reduce the excretion of calcium and uric acid, thereby leading to an increase in their plasma levels, and that these drugs increase potassium and magnesium excretion, potentially leading to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Low doses of thiazides, however, are usually tolerated and have been shown to improve quality-of-life measures. Thiazides are now more commonly used at lower doses to minimize the potential harm of adverse effects. Recent reports thus recommend thiazide diuretics as first-line choices for the treatment of essential hypertension, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Trichlormethiazide, a thiazide diuretic, was introduced in 1960 and remains one of the most frequently used diuretics for treating hypertension in Japan. While many studies have shown an important side effect of thiazides, i.e. adverse effects on electrolytes, very few data exist on plasma electrolyte levels in patients with trichlormethiazide treatment. To clarify whether adverse changes in plasma electrolyte levels are associated with trichlormethiazide is important for clinical practice. In this study, we examined changes in serum electrolyte levels of new users of generally prescribed doses of trichlormethiazide, of 1 mg or 2 mg per day, and compared them with each respective control (who had not received trichlormethiazide). We also examined changes in serum uric acid levels in addition to serum creatinine and urea nitrogen.

### Differentiating primary from secondary hyperparathyroidism in stone patients: the "thiazide challenge" [^114eAkpq]. Journal of Endourology (2009). Low credibility.

Differentiating between resorptive hypercalciuria (i.e., primary hyperparathyroidism) and renal leak hypercalciuria (i.e., secondary hyperparathyroidism) in the patient with stones and with hypercalciuria and elevated serum parathyroid hormone is important. Primary hyperparathyroidism necessitates endocrine surgery, while secondary hyperparathyroidism is managed with long-term thiazide diuretics. We present a reliable method for distinguishing between these two conditions: The "thiazide challenge".

### Thiazide diuretic-induced change in fasting plasma glucose: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114AxSA7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior meta-analyses measuring thiazide-induced glycemic change have demonstrated an increased risk of incident diabetes; however, this measure's definition has changed over time.

Aim

To determine the magnitude of change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for thiazide diuretics.

Data Sources

A research librarian designed and conducted searches in Medline®, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception through July 2018) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (inception to December 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic to any comparator reporting FPG were identified. Trials enrolling < 50 participants, those with a follow-up period of < 4 weeks, and conference abstracts were excluded.

Data Extraction

Independent duplicate screening of citations and full-text articles, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias was conducted.

Data Synthesis

Ninety-five studies were included (N = 76,608 participants), with thiazides compared with placebo, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretic, and others alone or in combination. Thiazide diuretics marginally increased FPG (weighted mean difference 0.20 mmol/L (95% CI 0.15–0.25); I² = 84%) (1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL). Results did not change substantially when considering dose or duration, comparing thiazides with placebo or an active comparator, or using thiazides as monotherapy or combination therapy, even when combined with a potassium-correcting agent.

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics have a small and clinically unimportant impact on FPG.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — thiazide diuretic adjunct: When calcium control remains difficult despite other measures, thiazide diuretics may be considered; if no contraindications exist, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily may be effective, but it must be titrated to avoid hypotension.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^112YqgYB]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of pharmacological treatment on PHPT-related bone disease

Because there is no curative pharmaceutical treatment, nonsurgical treatment is a choice in symptomatic patients for whom surgery is contraindicated or when localization of the enlarged parathyroid gland(s) is challenging or in patients who don't wish to undergo surgery. In addition, it can also be considered in asymptomatic PHPT. The effect of medical treatment on bone metabolism is summarized in Table 3.

Table 3.
Pharmacological approaches and their effect on bone metabolism in primary hyperparathyroidism

Independently of the agent chosen, general measures should be taken; adequate hydration is important to prevent exacerbating hypercalcemia; thiazide diuretics should be avoided because they increase renal calcium reabsorption; lithium should be avoided because it may raise PTH by raising the set point at which extracellular calcium suppresses PTH secretion. Normal calcium intake (as indicated in the general population) and vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients with a goal of > 20 or even > 30 ng/mL are usually also recommended in patients with PHPT. Oral bisphosphonates, especially alendronate, have been investigated regarding their effectiveness in improving the bone aspects in PHPT. Their use led to reduction of bone markers and increase in BMD at the femur, total hip, and spine, although serum calcium and PTH levels remained unchanged. There are no data regarding fracture risk reduction. In addition, no evidence concerning the effect of IV bisphosphonates in the treatment of PHPT is available. Denosumab is another antiresorptive agent that has favorable outcomes regarding BMD at the femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine, as well as TBS. Cinacalcet is useful in reducing serum calcium and PTH serum levels significantly; however, it has no effect on BMD. Hormone replacement therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) seem to increase BMD and reduce bone turnover markers, although they have minimal effect on calcium and PTH levels. Relevant data regarding the effect of the nonsurgical pharmacological treatments on the PHPT-induced bone damage are provided next.

### Furosemide increases the risk of hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease [^116ayzZc]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diuretics are widely used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While thiazide-like diuretics limit urinary calcium excretion, loop diuretics (LD) promote calcium wasting, which might facilitate the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT2). We sought to investigate, in CKD patients not on dialysis, the influence of either hydrochlorothiazide (Hydro) or furosemide (Furo) on circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and whether such actions are determined by the effects of these compounds on calcium excretion.

Methods

Electronic charts of all nephrology outpatients (CKD stages 2–5) who were given Hydro or Furo were included. We assessed estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), biochemical parameters and 24-hour calcium excretion. Hyperparathyroidism was defined as PTH > 65 pg/ml.

Results

Out of 275 patients, 108 (29%) were taking Hydro and 167 (61%) Furo. Patients on Hydro were younger, mostly female and had higher eGFR. The median 24-hour urinary calcium excretion in the overall cohort was 41 (22, 76), being lower in Furo than in Hydro patients (37 (16, 68) vs. 47 (26, 88) mg/24 h, respectively, p = 0.016). Logistic regression showed that, after adjustment for eGFR, calcium excretion rate was found not to increase the risk ratio for HPT2, whereas Furo was a strong predictor of HPT2.

Conclusion

Furo increased the risk of HPT2 among CKD patients compared to Hydro. This effect was independent of eGFR or calcium excretion. The use of LD in CKD, currently preferred in advanced stages, should be reappraised.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the reduction of kidney stone risk [^113Qw9oE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Clinical trial data have called into question the efficacy of thiazide diuretics for the prevention of kidney stones.

Objective

To identify whether there is an association between genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the risk of kidney stones.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This genetic association study undertook a mendelian randomization analysis of derived exposures and outcomes from genome-wide association study summary statistics. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were derived from the International Consortium for Blood Pressure. Kidney stone cases and controls were derived from the Million Veteran Program, UK Biobank, and the FinnGen study. These cross-sectional designs do not report a duration of follow-up. Data analysis was performed in May 2023.

Exposure

Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were genetic variants in the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene associated with systolic blood pressure. Genetic proxies of β-blockers and systolic blood pressure served as negative controls.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the odds of kidney stones. The secondary outcomes were serum laboratory values relevant to the treatment of kidney stones.

Results

The main analysis included up to 1 079 657 individuals, including 50 832 kidney stone cases and 1 028 825 controls. In a meta-analysis of all cohorts, genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with a lower odds of kidney stones (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81–0.89; P < .001). Genetic proxies of β-blockers (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96–1.07; p = 0.52) and systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00–1.01; p = 0.49) were not associated with kidney stones. Genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with higher serum calcium (β [SE], 0.051 [0.0092]; P < .001) and total cholesterol (β [SE], 0.065 [0.015]; P < .001), but lower serum potassium (β [SE], -0.073 [0.022]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this genetic association study, genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics were associated with reduced kidney stone risk. This finding reflects a drug effect over the course of a lifetime, unconstrained by the limited follow-up period of clinical trials.

### The influence of thiazide intake on calcium and parathyroid hormone levels in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^117NNnDz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The effects of thiazide medication in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) have so far not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which the administration of thiazides may influence biochemical parameters and therefore the diagnosis of PHPT in a large cohort of patients.

Design and Patients

The biochemical parameters of 1066 patients with PHPT were analysed, and drug history was documented. Calcium (Ca)/creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) was calculated. The results of patients given thiazides (n = 170) and those not given thiazides (n = 896) were analysed and compared.

Measurements

Twenty-four-hour urinary calcium excretion (24hU), albumin-corrected serum calcium, PTH, creatinine, 1,25OH- and 25OH-vitamin D were measured, and CCCR was calculated.

Results

24hUC a and CCCR were significantly lower in patients on thiazides (P = 0·02 and P = 0·0068, resp.), and serum creatinine was significantly higher in those subjects (P < 0·0001). Serum Ca levels only proved different in an analysis of covariance among patients younger than 60 years (P = 0·003). Nevertheless, PTH was not different in both groups (P = 0·917).

Conclusions

According to recently published guidelines, 24hUCa measurement is necessary to give indication for surgery in asymptomatic patients and to distinguish between PHPT and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia [FHH]. Thiazides significantly decrease 24hUC a, yet neither increase serum Ca nor influence PTH levels in patients with PHPT. However, discontinuing thiazides is crucial for a correct CCCR calculation to pre-operatively rule out FHH. As a consequence, the withdrawal of thiazide medication must be recommended for the diagnosis of PHPT prior to surgery.

### Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg (olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg) [^112Gh7tN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.

Amlodipine. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### The effect of thiazide diuretics on urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and serum sodium in the general population [^111TMSs4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Stronger Association Between Urinary PGE2 Excretion and Serum Sodium in Thiazide Users

The association between urinary PGE2 excretion and serum sodium was stronger in thiazide users compared to the participants not using thiazides after correction for confounders (change in serum sodium per 2-fold higher urinary PGE2 excretion −0.73 mmol/L, 95% CI −1.25 to −0.21 vs −0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.001, P for interaction = .002, Fig. 2A). Results for the association between urinary PGEM excretion and serum sodium were similar (thiazide users: −0.6 mmol/L, 95% CI −1.08 to −0.13, non-thiazide users −0.25, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.13, P for interaction = .02, Fig. 2B). This interaction did not change when only selecting participants with over 3 months of thiazide use [PGE2: P for interaction = .0008, PGEM: P for interaction = .006, Supplementary Fig. S4A] or excluding normotensive participants from the analysis [PGE2: P for interaction = .005, PGEM: P for interaction = .02, Supplementary Fig. S4B]. The stronger association between urinary PGE2 or PGEM excretion and serum sodium was specific to users of thiazide diuretics since there was no significant interaction when stratifying by use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, calcium antagonist, or β-blockers (Supplementary Fig. S5).

CKD-MBD — serum calcium target in CKD stages 3–5D — we suggest maintaining serum calcium levels in the reference range (2D). This weak recommendation suggests using the laboratory reference range as the treatment target, and the threshold above which calcium level becomes significantly associated with increased relative risk for all-cause mortality varies among studies from 9.5 to 11.4 mg/dL. A calcium level outside the reference range requires further evaluation for treatment effects or other causes.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^111vAmnU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic and Endocrine Effects

In diabetic patients, insulin requirements may be increased, decreased, or unchanged due to the hydrochlorothiazide component. Diabetes mellitus that has been latent may become manifest during administration of thiazide diuretics.

Because calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides, amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy; however, the common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration have not been seen.

Hyperuricemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Other Precautions

In patients receiving thiazides, sensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazides.

Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.

Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment, except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.

If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.

Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^1161ey6K]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrolithiasis is a global healthcare problem with a current lifetime risk of 18.8% in men and 9.4% in women. Given the high cost of medical treatments and surgical interventions as well as the morbidity related to symptomatic stone disease, medical prophylaxis for stone recurrence is an attractive approach. Thiazide diuretics have been the cornerstone of pharmacologic metaphylaxis for more than 40years. However, evidence for benefits and harms of thiazides in the prevention of calcium containing kidney stones in general remains unclear. In addition, the efficacy of the currently employed low dose thiazide regimens to prevent stone recurrence is not known.

Methods

The NOSTONE trial is an investigator-initiated 3-year prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide treatment in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. We plan to include 416 adult (≥ 18years) patients with recurrent (≥ 2 stone episodes in the last 10years) calcium containing kidney stones (containing ≥ 50% of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both). Patients will be randomly allocated to 50mg or 25mg or 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide or placebo. The primary outcome will be incidence of stone recurrence (a composite of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence). Secondary outcomes will be individual components of the composite primary outcome, safety and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide treatment, changes in urinary biochemistry elicited by hydrochlorothiazide treatment and impact of baseline disease severity, biochemical abnormalities and stone composition on treatment response.

Discussion

The NOSTONE study will provide long-sought information on the efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium containing kidney stones. Strengths of the study include the randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled design, the large amount of patients studied, the employment of high sensitivity and high specificity imaging and the exclusive public funding support.

### Women who develop ovarian cancer show an increase in serum calcium and a decrease in serum albumin. A longitudinal study in the Janus serum bank cohort [^114WxQXm]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

We observed a large decline in serum albumin post-diagnosis of ovarian cancer (~ 20%). This was observed in both early stage and metastatic disease, with a larger decline among women with metastatic disease (p < .01). The association of ovarian cancer with hypoalbuminemia is well-known. Ovarian cancers cause serum albumin to decline by several mechanisms, including bowel obstruction, loss of albumin to ascites, poor nutrition, and inhibition of albumin synthesis. In early stage ovarian cancer, the fall in serum albumin likely results from metabolic factors secreted by ovarian cells, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the synthesis of albumin by hepatocytes and promotes the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells.

It is important to consider possible alternative explanations for the effects we observed. Albumin levels are relatively stable in healthy women but can decline in several conditions, including malnutrition and malabsorption. Serum calcium values also are very stable but can be increased by factors including thiazide diuretics, lithium and excess vitamins A and D. In non-hospitalized individuals, the commonest cause of elevated serum calcium is primary hyperparathyroidism. It is conceivable that some women could have developed primary hyperparathyroidism in the interval from T1 to T2, causing their serum calcium to rise. However, the co-occurrence of ovarian cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism is considered exceptionally rare. Moreover (to our knowledge), primary hyperparathyroidism does not cause serum albumin levels to decline. Thus, we conclude that primary hyperparathyroidism is unlikely to have had an important influence on these data.

### Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide [^115eppWT]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin): since thiazides may elevate blood glucose levels, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.

Calcium Salts: Increased serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion may occur. If calcium must be prescribed, monitor serum calcium levels and adjust calcium dosage accordingly.

Cardiac Glycosides: enhanced possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor potassium levels (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Captopril).

Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.

Diazoxide: enhanced hyperglycemic, hyperuricemic, and antihypertensive effects. Be cognizant of possible interaction; monitor blood glucose and serum uric acid levels.

Lithium: diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Captopril: Lithium).

MAO Inhibitors: dosage adjustments of one or both agents may be necessary since hypotensive effects are enhanced.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117SK94m]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — pharmacologic therapy evidence and dosing reports that moderate-quality evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol reduce the risk for recurrence of composite calcium stones, and combination therapy with these agents was not more beneficial than monotherapy; most patients have calcium stones, and evidence showed that thiazide diuretics, citrates, and allopurinol all effectively reduced recurrence of this stone type. The available evidence evaluated higher doses of thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg; chlorothalidone, 25 or 50 mg; indapamide, 2.5 mg), and the use of lower doses of thiazides is associated with fewer adverse effects, but their effectiveness in preventing stone recurrence compared with higher doses is not known.

Bendroflumethiazide

When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics:

Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics -potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Amphotericin B, corticosteroids, or corticotropin (ACTH) -may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia. Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacements if necessary.

Anticoagulants (oral) -dosage adjustments of anticoagulant medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may decrease their effects.

Antigout medications -dosage adjustments of antigout medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may raise the level of blood uric acid.

Other antihypertensive medications (e.g., ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking agents)-dosage adjustments may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may potentiate their effects.

Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) -since thiazides may elevate blood glucose levels, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.

Calcium salts -increased serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion may occur. If calcium must be prescribed monitor serum calcium levels and adjust calcium dosage accordingly.

Cardiac glycosides -enhanced possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacement if necessary.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide on urinary calcium excretion in dent disease: an uncontrolled trial [^117W9YGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide doses equivalent to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) have been proposed to correct hypercalciuria and prevent kidney failure in patients with Dent disease. However, they can cause adverse metabolic effects in the long term. In treating hypertension in children, lower thiazide doses have been shown to be as effective and well tolerated.

Study Design

Uncontrolled trial, with forced-titration sequential open-label study design.

Setting & Participants

7 boys with genetically confirmed Dent disease and mild phenotype (neither overt sodium wasting nor kidney failure).

Intervention

After a 1-month run-in period, patients sequentially received amiloride (5 mg/d) alone (1 month) and then for 3 periods of 2 months in association with increasing doses of HCTZ (< 0.2, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/d).

Outcomes

Urinary calcium excretion and extracellular volume indicators.

Measurements

At the end of each period, 2 daily 24-hour urinary collections were performed on the days preceding admission. Blood and spot urine samples also were collected.

Results

A greater HCTZ dose increased renin, aldosterone, and plasma protein concentrations. Amiloride alone had no effect on calcium excretion. The greatest HCTZ doses decreased spot urinary calcium excretion by 42% compared with baseline (median, 0.3; minimum, maximum, 0.2, 0.8 versus median, 0.8; minimum, maximum, 0.4, 1.1, respectively; P = 0.03). However, patients developed adverse reactions, including muscle cramps (n = 2), biological (n = 7) or symptomatic hypovolemia (n = 1), hypokalemia (n = 4), and hyponatremia (n = 1), which all corrected after treatment withdrawal.

Limitation

Small sample size and absence of a control group.

Conclusion

HCTZ doses greater than 0.4 mg/kg/d decreased calcium excretion, but were associated with significant adverse events. Thiazide diuretic therapy should be considered with caution in children with Dent disease.

Gain-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) gene cause autosomal dominant and/or sporadic hypocalcemia with hypercalciuria. Because treatment of the hypocalcemia with vitamin D and/or calcium in patients with such mutations results in increased hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal impairment, its use should be limited to alleviating the symptoms of symptomatic patients. Because thiazide diuretics have been successfully used to treat patients with hypercalciuria and hypoparathyroidism, they are theoretically useful in reducing urine calcium excretion and maintaining serum calcium levels in patients with gain-of-function mutations of the CaR gene. In this study, we report on the clinical course, molecular analysis, and effects of hydrochlorothiazide therapy in two Japanese patients with gain-of-function mutations of the CaR gene. Within a few weeks after birth, they developed generalized tonic seizures due to hypocalcemia (serum calcium values: 1.1 mmol/liter and 1.3 mmol/liter, respectively). Despite treatment with the standard dose of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in one patient and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in the other, acceptable serum calcium levels near the lower limit of normal were not established, and their urinary calcium excretion inappropriately increased. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg) reduced their urinary calcium excretion and maintained their serum calcium concentrations near the lower limit of normal, allowing the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) doses to be reduced, and it alleviated their symptoms. A heterozygous missense mutation was identified in both patients. In one patient, the mutation was A843E in the seventh transmembrane domain of the CaR, and in the other it was L125P in the N-terminal extracellular domain. In vitro transient transfection of their mutant CaR cDNAs into HEK293 cells shifted the concentration-response curve of Ca(2+) to the left. In conclusion, two sporadic cases of hypercalciuric hypocalcemia were due to de novo gain-of-function mutations of the CaR gene. Hydrochlorothiazide with vitamin D(3) successfully reduced the patients' urinary calcium excretion and controlled their serum calcium concentrations and symptoms. Thiazide diuretics are effective in patients with gain-of function mutations of the CaR gene.

### Determinants and outcomes associated with urinary calcium excretion in chronic kidney disease [^116jmQd3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Abnormalities in calcium metabolism are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diminished urinary calcium excretion may promote vascular calcification and increased urinary calcium excretion may lead to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, conditions associated with CKD.

Objective

To study predictors of urinary calcium excretion and its association with adverse clinical outcomes in CKD.

Design, Setting and Patients

This study assessed 3768 nondialysis participants in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study from April 2003 to September 2008. Participants were followed up to October 2018.

Exposure

Clinically plausible predictors of urinary calcium excretion and 24-h urinary calcium excretion at baseline.

Main Outcome Measures

Urinary calcium excretion; incident end stage kidney disease (ESKD), CKD progression [50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline or incident ESKD], all-cause mortality, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events.

Results

eGFR was positive correlated with 24-h urinary calcium excretion. The variables most strongly associated with 24-h urinary calcium excretion in males and females were 24-h urinary sodium (β = 0.19 and 0.28, respectively), serum parathyroid hormone (β = -0.22 and -0.20, respectively), loop diuretics (β = 0.36 and 0.26, respectively), thiazide diuretics (β = -0.49 and -0.53, respectively), and self-identified black race (β = -0.23 and -0.27, respectively). Lower urinary calcium excretion was associated with greater risks of adverse outcomes, but these associations were greatly attenuated or nullified after adjustment for baseline eGFR.

Conclusion

Urinary calcium excretion is markedly lower in individuals with CKD compared to the general population. Determinants of urinary calcium excretion differed between sexes and levels of CKD. Associations between urinary calcium excretion and adverse clinical events were substantially confounded by eGFR.

### Thiazide treatment in primary hyperparathyroidism – A new indication for an old medication? [^114QnBj3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

There is no therapy for control of hypercalciuria in nonoperable patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Thiazides are used for idiopathic hypercalciuria but are avoided in PHPT to prevent exacerbating hypercalcemia. Nevertheless, several reports suggested that thiazides may be safe in patients with PHPT.

Objective

To test the safety and efficacy of thiazides in PHPT.

Design

Retrospective analysis of medical records.

Setting

Endocrine clinic at a tertiary hospital.

Patients

Fourteen male and 58 female patients with PHPT treated with thiazides.

Interventions

Data were compared for each patient before and after thiazide administration.

Main Outcome Measures

Effect of thiazide on urine and serum calcium levels.

Results

Data are given as mean ± standard deviation. Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 50 mg/d led to a decrease in mean levels of urine calcium (427 ± 174 mg/d to 251 ± 114 mg/d; P < 0.001) and parathyroid hormone (115 ± 57 ng/L to 74 ± 36 ng/L; P < 0.001), with no change in serum calcium level (10.7 ± 0.4 mg/dL off treatment, 10.5 ± 1.2 mg/dL on treatment, P = 0.4). Findings were consistent over all doses, with no difference in the extent of reduction in urine calcium level or change in serum calcium level by thiazide dose.

Conclusion

Thiazides may be effective even at a dose of 12.5 mg/d and safe at doses of up to 50 mg/d for controlling hypercalciuria in patients with PHPT and may have an advantage in decreasing serum parathyroid hormone level. However, careful monitoring for hypercalcemia is required.

### Effects of thiazide-and loop-diuretics, alone or in combination, on calcitropic hormones and biochemical bone markers: a randomized controlled study [^1138mHEt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Diuretics are commonly used drugs that in addition to their effect on the cardiovascular system also affect calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. We evaluated the effects of loop diuretics (LD) and thiazide diuretics (TD) on calcitropic hormones and biochemical bone markers.

Design

A total of 50 postmenopausal women were randomized to 7 days of treatment with either the TD bendroflumethiazide, the LD bumetanide, bendroflumethiazide plus bumetanide, or placebo. Blood and urine (24 h) were sampled on each day. Statistical inferences were made versus the concomitant changes in the placebo group.

Results

Bendroflumethiazide increased the tubular reabsorption of calcium (TRCa) (+0.46 ± 0.11%, P = 0.009), plasma levels of parathyroid hormones (PTH) (+24 ± 10%, P = 0.06), and 1,25(OH)2D (+12 ± 6%, P = 0.03). Bumetanide decreased the TRCa (-0.5 ± 0.1%, P = 0.01) and increased plasma PTH and 1,25(OH)2D levels (+27 ± 9%, P = 0.02 and +36 ± 12%, P = 0.006, respectively). Treatment with either of the drugs did not alter plasma calcium, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase (bone-ALP) or urinary NTx/creatinine ratio. However, treatment with both drugs caused an increased plasma calcium level (+2.7 ± 1.0%, P = 0.007) and decreased plasma levels of bone-ALP (-21 ± 3%, P = 0.001), osteocalcin (-6 ± 3%, P = 0.03), and urinary NTx/creatinine ratio (-39 ± 6%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism are to a major degree influenced by diuretic treatment. Surprisingly, LD and TD exerted a similar effect on calcitropic hormones despite their opposite effects on the renal calcium excretion. In clinical practice, treatment with diuretics has to be considered as a cause of parathyroid stimulation.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112fTEBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6 Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

### Risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo modified by diuretics – A population-level case-control study [^116grhEy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies a potential relationship between BPPV and diuretic use. As there are currently no pharmacologic practices recommended for the prevention of BPPV, these results could lead to the development of such strategies, particularly for patients with both hypertension and other BPPV risk factors. While our initial hypothesis attributed such a relationship to diuretics' effects on serum calcium, the varied associations in this study suggest that this explanation may be inadequate. It has been previously reported that increased water intake may correlate with reduced vertigo incidence, while dehydration may associate with increased BPPV incidence. Otoconia are thought to require constant cellular maintenance to prevent degeneration and fragmentation, with ischemic processes reportedly increasing BPPV risk possibly by interfering with the highly metabolic inner ear tissue. Therefore, a low circulating intravascular volume, exacerbated by diuretic use, might increase overall BPPV risk due to poor perfusion of otoconia‐supporting tissues. This seems to explain the consistently higher odds of using all classes of diuretics seen in BPPV(+) patients in the general population. However, hypotension‐related vertigo cases misdiagnosed as BPPV in the BPPV(+) arm or missed BPPV diagnoses in the BPPV(−) arm could also create this association and cannot be excluded.

As thiazides and loops may induce greater diuretic effects than CAIs at therapeutic doses, dehydration may also explain why non‐MD BPPV(+) patients had higher odds of using thiazides and loops than non‐MD BPPV(−) patients.CAI use did not differ significantly between these 2 groups, possibly due to its generally milder diuretic effect and lower risk of compromising inner ear perfusion.

For patients with MD, an excess of endolymphatic fluid is thought to be present and diuretic use is often recommended. Also, because BPPV may present more frequently in MD patients, it has been theorized that hydropic changes may damage inner ear structures. Therefore, diuresis may reduce BPPV risk in patients with MD, which the results of the MD population in this study seem to support. Thiazide and loop diuretics were more commonly used by non‐positional vertigo patients, while the milder CAIs again had no significant association. Total loop diuretic and CAI use was notably uncommon in this population; therefore, evidence for their associations is weaker than that for thiazide use.

### Efficacy of standard and low dose hydrochlorothiazide in the recurrence prevention of calcium nephrolithiasis (NOSTONE trial): protocol for a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113d3Mka]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy of thiazides in the recurrence prevention of kidney stones has been studied in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (Table 1). With the exception of two trials, thiazides significantly reduced stone recurrence compared to placebo or control. However, as detailed in Table 1 and highlighted by a recent systematic review, thiazide RCTs thus far conducted suffer from significant methodological deficiencies, including: use of high thiazide doses, low overall number of patients studied, lack of outcome uniformity, use of outdated dietary recommendations, unclear allocation concealment, lack of double-blinding and intention-to-treat analysis, absence of adverse event and drop out reporting, unknown baseline risk of disease severity and baseline biochemical abnormalities of patients studied, lack of patient stratification and employment of low sensitivity and specificity imaging modalities.

Table 1
Randomized controlled trials of thiazides in the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis

a TID, three times daily, b BID, twice times daily, c RR, relative risk

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was used in five of the 11 thiazide RCTs for stone prevention and is thus currently the best studied thiazide in the prevention of stone recurrence. However, other thiazides such as bendroflumethiazide, chlorthalidone, trichlormethiazide and indapamide also reduced stone recurrence in one or more trials and seem to be effective as well. In all trials, high thiazide doses were employed, in the case of HCTZ, 50–100 mg daily. In four of the five HCTZ trials, the diuretic was given twice daily, whereas in the treatment of arterial hypertension, HCTZ is typically given once daily. Once daily HCTZ at the dose of 50 mg, 25 mg or 12.5 mg reduces calciuria in healthy volunteers, a surrogate marker for stone prevention. Detailed HCTZ dose-response studies with respect to urinary composition and stone recurrence are lacking. Twice daily HCTZ increases the frequency of side effects and augments diuresis at night and thereby likely affects compliance.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^113SJKS3]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Together, these data challenge the idea that thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics have similar effects on blood pressure and underscore the fact that because of significant pharmacokinetic differences, thiazide and thiazide-like should not be considered as a homogenous class of antihypertensive agents. These data are the basis for the endorsement of longer acting thiazide-like molecules by some guidelines.

Tolerability

Potency, dose–response, and elimination half-lives are also fundamental drivers of tolerability (Table 3). For all three molecules, effects on serum potassium and metabolic parameters have been shown to be dose-dependent. Lower doses of thiazide-like diuretics can be prescribed in order to minimize the impact of treatment on laboratory parameters without jeopardizing blood pressure reduction. This was illustrated in a study of hypertensive patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (N = 690) who were treated with indapamide sustained release 1.5 mg or indapamide immediate release 2.5 mg. Equivalent blood pressure reductions were noted, but the risk of hypokalemia (K + < 3.4 mmol/l) was reduced 62% with the lower sustained release dose. The indapamide sustained release 1.5 mg dose was also associated with smaller increases in uric acid than the immediate release 2.5 mg dosage (34 versus 51 μmol/l).

TABLE 3
Laboratory parameters

Consistent with this understanding, a pooled analysis of phase III trials (N = 1195) showed that with the sustained release 1.5 mg dose, indapamide had a neutral effect on laboratory parameters (serum lipid levels, glucose levels, renal function). Serum uric acid levels were temporarily increased, but returned to baseline rapidly. Metabolic neutrality has also been recorded in the elderly and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the NESTOR and HYVET studies. Even in the elderly subgroup of patients in NESTOR (patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria aged 65–80 years; n = 187), 1 year of treatment with indapamide was well tolerated. Lipids, fasting plasma glucose, and HbA1c remained clinically stable throughout the study; and no differences with the enalapril group were observed with respect to kidney function. Differences between groups were only observed for serum potassium and uric acid.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### Thiazides for kidney stone recurrence prevention [^116u2fPf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

NOSTONE KEY FINDINGS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS

NOSTONE enrolled 416 patients at 12 sites throughout Switzerland. Median follow-up time was 2.92 years, and 387 patients (93%) completed follow-up as planned. In the placebo group, 60 of 102 patients (59%) experienced the primary composite end point of symptomatic or radiologic recurrence. Numbers in the hydrochlorothiazide arms were 62 of 105 patients (59%) receiving 12.5 mg [rate ratio as compared to placebo (RR), 1.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92–1.93], 61 of 108 patients (56%) receiving 25 mg (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.86–1.79), and 49 of 101 patients (49%) receiving 50 mg (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.63–1.36). There was no relation between hydrochlorothiazide dose and the primary end point (ratio of rate ratios, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87–1.09; test for trend, P = 0.66). These results were confirmed by several sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect.

The NOSTONE results indicate that hydrochlorothiazide is not efficiently preventing recurrence of kidney stones. This presents a significant deviation from prevailing recommendations and the majority of prior thiazide trials, thus necessitating an extensive analysis. We highlight in the following section several important aspects of the NOSTONE trial design, and reconcile NOSTONE trial findings with the existing trial literature pertaining to the prevention of kidney stones.

NOSTONE selected patients with recurrent idiopathic calcium kidney stones, that would be treated with a thiazide according to current guidelines. However, as it was the case in most prior thiazide trials, NOSTONE did not specifically select patients with hypercalciuria. Indeed, urine calcium is a continuous risk factor for stone formation, and current guidelines recommend thiazides in all patients with recurrent calcium stones. Median baseline urine calcium in NOSTONE was 244 mg/24 h (6.1 mmol/24 h), and 63% of participants were hypercalciuric (defined as urine calcium > 200 mg/24 h or > 5 mmol/24 h). A subgroup analysis of the NOSTONE trial showed no benefit of hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo in patients with hypercalciuria.

### Mendelian randomization analysis of genetic proxies of thiazide diuretics and the reduction of kidney stone risk [^111iKH88]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Secondary Outcomes

The secondary outcomes were serum laboratory values relevant to the treatment of kidney stones, including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, urate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, cholesterol, glucose, and hemoglobin A 1c. In clinical practice, these measurements are often used in the evaluation or follow-up of patients who receive thiazide diuretics for kidney stones. Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion in the urine, which causes serum calcium levels to rise. They also cause extracellular volume contraction and consequently increase uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Thiazides also affect insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism leading to hyperglycemia. Hypercholesterolemia is affected by thiazide use, but the mechanism is not clearly understood. Finally, potassium levels in the serum fall from the diuretic-induced increased sodium delivery to the distal nephron as well as an indirect effect on aldosterone-mediated actions of the sodium–potassium pump in the collecting tubule of the kidney.

The secondary outcomes were downloaded from the OpenGWAS API. The calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, urate, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, potassium, cholesterol, glucose, and hemoglobin A 1c outcomes were derived from the Neale lab analysis of UKB round 2 GWAS. The GWAS was adjusted for age, sex, age squared, age × sex, age × sex squared, and the first 20 principal components, and outcomes were inverse rank-normal transformed. The potassium outcome was not available from that resource, so it was obtained from the BioBank Japan. The GWAS was adjusted for age, sex, and the first 10 principal components, and outcomes were also inverse rank-normal transformed.

### Comparison of combination therapies, including the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan and either a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide diuretic, in elderly patients with hypertension [^113UGMiz]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

The blood pressure goals set for the treatment of hypertensive patients have been lowered in recent guidelines. To reduce blood pressure levels sufficiently, combination therapies are often needed, but there is little evidence about which combination should be chosen. The present study was carried out to compare the effects of combination therapies, including the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan and either a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a thiazide diuretic, in elderly patients with hypertension. A total of 65 patients aged 65–85 years, with blood pressures of 140/90 mmHg or higher for those taking antihypertensive medication or 160/100 mmHg or higher for those not on medication, were randomly assigned to either the group treated with olmesartan plus a dihydropyridine CCB or the group treated with olmesartan plus a thiazide diuretic; 58 patients completed the treatment for 6 months. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were reduced during the treatment period in both the groups. The reductions in SBP at 1 and 6 months were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the CCB combination group than in the diuretic group (-29 vs. -18 mmHg, respectively, at 1 month; -32 vs. -23 mmHg, respectively, at 6 months). Despite greater reduction in SBP in the CCB group, the serum creatinine level and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remained unchanged, whereas in the diuretic group, creatinine was elevated (+0.06 mg per 100 ml, P < 0.05) and eGFR was reduced (-4.5 mlmin(-1) per 1.73 m(2)). In addition, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced in the diuretic group (-5.0 mg per 100 ml, P < 0.01). These results suggest that olmesartan plus a CCB is the preferable combination therapy in comparison with olmesartan plus a thiazide diuretic for elderly patients with hypertension.

5.1 Effects on Calcium Metabolism

In controlled clinical trials hypercalcemia was observed in subjects exposed to VECTICAL Ointment. If aberrations in parameters of calcium metabolism occur, treatment should be discontinued until these parameters have normalized. The effects of VECTICAL Ointment on calcium metabolism following treatment durations greater than 52 weeks have not been evaluated. Increased absorption may occur with occlusive use. VECTICAL Ointment should be used with caution in patients receiving medications known to increase the serum calcium level, such as thiazide diuretics, and in patients receiving calcium supplements or high doses of vitamin D.

### Thiazide dose, urine calcium, and symptomatic kidney stone events [^112mGA8m]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Increasing thiazide dosage was associated with greater reductions in calcium, which was negatively correlated with symptomatic stone events. The calcium reductions observed were greater than those in NOSTONE (−42 to −51 mg/d), which may explain NOSTONE's null results. Limitations include the possibility of omitted variable bias and unmeasured differences between participants prescribed different dosages that could confound the observed associations. We analyzed a sample of mostly older adults, potentially limiting generalizability. Nonetheless, for individuals prescribed thiazides for stone prevention, it may be beneficial to monitor calcium excretion and adjust dose and diet to attain an adequate reduction in urine calcium.
