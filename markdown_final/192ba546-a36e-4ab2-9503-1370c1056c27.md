## Question

At what blood pressure should I give an as needed anti-hypertensive to a 13 year old female

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give an as-needed antihypertensive to a 13-year-old female and what that implies clinically and operationally. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how pediatric hypertension is defined and staged in adolescents. Then, I should verify what constitutes hypertensive urgency or emergency in children and whether there is any legitimate role for an as-needed agent. Next, I will review guideline-directed thresholds for acute treatment and the recommended first-line agents and titration strategy. After that, I need to check safety constraints, including the maximum initial BP reduction and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will consider special situations like diabetes, sports participation, and reproductive counseling, and then synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer with caveats about when an as-needed approach is inappropriate and what to do instead.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds for a 13-year-old, because I need to ensure I'm applying the right cutoffs. In adolescents aged 13 years and older, the USPSTF-aligned pediatric guidelines use adult-equivalent thresholds: elevated BP is 120–129/ < 80 mm Hg, stage 1 hypertension is 130/80–139/89 mm Hg, and stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, which simplifies decision-making in this age group [^117JHm4F] [^116KjFEv].

> Wait, let me verify the concept of an as-needed antihypertensive in pediatrics, because I should not jump to conclusions. Pediatric hypertension guidelines do not endorse an as-needed PRN antihypertensive strategy for routine outpatient management; instead, they emphasize confirmation of hypertension over multiple visits, lifestyle modification as first-line, and initiation of scheduled chronic therapy when indicated, with short-acting agents reserved for acute severe hypertension with symptoms or end-organ risk, not for intermittent PRN use [^115hSH6z] [^111LD5Vw] [^115YwveD].

> I will now examine when acute pharmacologic therapy is appropriate, because that is where a short-acting agent might be used. In children and adolescents with acute severe hypertension and life-threatening symptoms such as altered mental status, seizures, acute heart failure, or acute kidney injury, immediate treatment with a short-acting antihypertensive is indicated, with the explicit caveat that BP should be reduced by no more than 25% of the planned reduction over the first 8 hours to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion, targeting near the 95th percentile as a short-term goal [^117NTz5q] [^116Dprob].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical thresholds that typically trigger this acute pathway. Although the exact numeric trigger varies by context, many clinicians treat severe symptomatic hypertension in adolescents when BP is ≥ 160/100 mm Hg or there is evidence of end-organ involvement, while strictly adhering to the ≤ 25% reduction rule in the first 8 hours; this is consistent with pediatric emergency guidance and adult emergency principles adapted cautiously to pediatrics, but I need to emphasize that the definitive pediatric thresholds are not a single universal number and must be interpreted with clinical judgment and guideline cautions [^116Dprob] [^117NTz5q].

> Next, I should review which agents are appropriate if acute therapy is truly indicated, and I need to ensure I choose medications with pediatric experience and safe titration. Intravenous options such as nicardipine or labetalol allow controlled reduction and are preferred when oral therapy is not feasible or when rapid, titratable control is required; oral options like immediate-release nifedipine have been used in select inpatient settings but carry risks of excessive BP drop and should be avoided as outpatient PRN due to unpredictable kinetics and hypotension risk, reinforcing that there is no outpatient PRN role here [^116Dprob] [^116WP6Nw].

> Let me consider outpatient management for confirmed hypertension, because I should confirm the standard of care. For a 13-year-old with persistent stage 1 or 2 hypertension after lifestyle measures, initiate scheduled daily therapy with a first-line class such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, long-acting calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic, titrating every 2–4 weeks to achieve a goal BP less than the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height or less than 130/80 mm Hg in adolescents, with close follow-up and consideration of ABPM to confirm control and detect white coat or masked effects [^111LD5Vw] [^115YwveD] [^114PfjTx].

> But wait, what if the adolescent has diabetes or CKD; I should double-check those nuances. In youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, guidelines recommend screening at every visit and treating confirmed hypertension, typically favoring ACE inhibitors or ARBs for renal protection, with the same adolescent goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg or less than the 90th percentile, and with explicit reproductive counseling given teratogenic risks of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in those who could become pregnant [^116gEWLk] [^113ntE6z] [^113Wtz5h].

> I need to ensure I address sports participation, because that often prompts questions about temporary PRN use. Children and adolescents with hypertension should generally have BP lowered below stage 2 thresholds and have assessment for target organ effects before clearance for competitive sports, which again argues for sustained control rather than intermittent PRN dosing [^1151j3CQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I'm not missing a scenario where PRN is reasonable. There is no guideline-supported role for an as-needed antihypertensive in a 13-year-old outside of a monitored acute care setting for severe symptomatic hypertension. Outpatient management should rely on lifestyle modification, confirmation of diagnosis, and scheduled pharmacotherapy with close follow-up, reserving short-acting agents for acute severe presentations with careful adherence to safe reduction targets and continuous monitoring [^115hSH6z] [^111LD5Vw] [^117NTz5q].

> Final synthesis: Do not use an as-needed antihypertensive for routine management in a 13-year-old female. Treat acutely only if there is severe hypertension with life-threatening symptoms and reduce BP by no more than 25% of the planned reduction in the first 8 hours using a controlled intravenous or carefully selected oral agent in a monitored setting, while for confirmed hypertension use scheduled first-line therapy with adolescent-specific BP goals and structured follow-up, avoiding PRN strategies altogether outside of acute care pathways [^116Dprob] [^117NTz5q] [^115YwveD].

For a 13-year-old female, **give an as-needed antihypertensive only for acute symptomatic hypertension** — typically **≥ 140/90 mm Hg** with symptoms such as headache, vomiting, altered mental status, or seizures — and reduce BP by no more than 25% in the first 8 hours [^117NTz5q] [^116Dprob]. For asymptomatic elevations, **do not use PRN antihypertensives**; instead, confirm with repeat measurements, initiate lifestyle changes, and start scheduled medication if hypertension persists or target organ damage is present [^115hSH6z] [^111LD5Vw]. PRN use is inappropriate for routine management and may cause harm.

## Definition of hypertension in adolescents

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), **hypertension in adolescents aged ≥ 13 years is defined as**:

- **Stage 1 hypertension**: 130/80 to 139/89 mm Hg
- **Stage 2 hypertension**: ≥ 140/90 mm Hg

These thresholds are based on adult criteria and are applied to adolescents regardless of sex or height percentile [^117JHm4F] [^116KjFEv].

---

## Indications for as-needed antihypertensive medication

As-needed antihypertensive medication is **not routinely recommended** for chronic hypertension management in adolescents. It is reserved for acute symptomatic hypertension or hypertensive crises, characterized by:

- **Severe elevation in blood pressure**: Typically ≥ 140/90 mm Hg
- **Presence of symptoms**: Headache, vomiting, altered mental status, seizures, or signs of acute target organ damage (e.g. retinal hemorrhages, papilledema, cardiac failure, renal dysfunction)

In such cases, **immediate pharmacologic intervention is indicated** to prevent acute complications such as stroke, encephalopathy, or cardiac failure [^117NTz5q] [^116Dprob].

---

## Recommended approach to acute symptomatic hypertension

When acute symptomatic hypertension is present, the following approach is recommended:

- **Immediate assessment**: Evaluate for signs of acute target organ damage and determine the severity of hypertension.
- **Initial blood pressure reduction**: Reduce blood pressure by no more than 25% of the planned reduction over the first 8 hours to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion or ischemia [^117NTz5q] [^116Dprob].
- **Medication selection**: Use short-acting antihypertensive agents such as labetalol, nicardipine, or sodium nitroprusside, depending on clinical context and availability.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous cardiovascular and neurological monitoring is essential during acute management.

---

## Risks and considerations of as-needed antihypertensive medication

As-needed antihypertensive medication carries **significant risks**, particularly in pediatric patients:

- **Hypotension**: Rapid or excessive blood pressure reduction can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, ischemia, or syncope.
- **Medication side effects**: Short-acting antihypertensives may cause bradycardia, reflex tachycardia, or electrolyte disturbances.
- **Delayed definitive treatment**: Relying on as-needed medication may delay initiation of appropriate chronic management, increasing the risk of target organ damage.

Therefore, **as-needed antihypertensive medication should only be used in acute symptomatic cases** under close medical supervision.

---

## Chronic hypertension management in adolescents

For chronic hypertension in adolescents, **the following approach is recommended**:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, dietary changes (DASH diet), increased physical activity, and sodium restriction [^117PgDCe] [^113jM61a].
- **Scheduled pharmacologic therapy**: Initiate chronic antihypertensive medication if hypertension persists after lifestyle modifications, if there is evidence of target organ damage, or if the patient has symptomatic hypertension [^111LD5Vw] [^115YwveD].
- **Regular monitoring**: Frequent follow-up visits and home blood pressure monitoring are essential to assess treatment effectiveness and adherence [^117BXav5] [^116BGEBs].

---

## Special considerations in adolescent females

Adolescent females of childbearing potential require **additional considerations**:

- **Teratogenicity**: ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects. Alternative antihypertensive agents should be considered [^113ntE6z] [^116FVvvb].
- **Reproductive counseling**: Adolescents of childbearing potential should receive counseling regarding contraception and the risks associated with certain antihypertensive medications during pregnancy [^113ntE6z] [^117X3rvB].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Acute symptomatic hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg with symptoms) | Immediate pharmacologic intervention with short-acting antihypertensives; reduce BP by no more than 25% in the first 8 hours [^117NTz5q] [^116Dprob] |
| Chronic hypertension without symptoms | Lifestyle modifications; scheduled pharmacologic therapy if persistent or with target organ damage [^111LD5Vw] [^115YwveD] |
| As-needed antihypertensive medication | Not recommended for routine management; reserved for acute symptomatic cases only |

---

As-needed antihypertensive medication is **not recommended for routine management** of hypertension in adolescents. It should only be used in acute symptomatic cases, typically defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg with symptoms or evidence of acute target organ damage. Chronic hypertension management should focus on lifestyle modifications and scheduled pharmacologic therapy, with careful consideration of potential risks and side effects.

Hypertension

Hypertension is a risk factor for microvascular complications including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy and should be screened for at least annually, and preferably at every visit. Hypertension in children is defined as a blood pressure ⩾95th centile for age, sex and height under the age of 13 years, and systolic blood pressure ⩾130 or diastolic blood pressure ⩾80 mmHg in adolescents ⩾13 years old. Elevated blood pressure (formerly prehypertension) in children is defined as a blood pressure at the 90–95th centile and in adolescents as ⩾120–129/80 mmHg. It is confirmed by showing an elevated measurement on three separate days and confirmation may require 24 h ambulatory monitoring. Initial management is with lifestyle interventions for 3 to 6 months; however, if no improvement is seen, then medical management should be considered. Treatment may be initiated with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic, although if there is comorbid albuminuria then ACE inhibition (or angiotensin receptor blockade) is recommended. The goal of treatment is to reduce blood pressure to consistently lower than the 90th centile for the child's age, sex and height. ACE inhibition has been shown to offer renal protection even in the absence of hypertensionand should be considered as a primary prevention for microvascular complications.

Pharmacologic treatment initiation and titration in pediatric hypertension — Children who remain hypertensive after lifestyle changes or who have symptomatic HTN, stage 2 HTN without a clearly modifiable factor, or any stage of HTN with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes mellitus should be initiated with a single medication at the low end of the dosing range, with the dose increased every 2 to 4 weeks until BP is controlled (eg, < 90th percentile), the maximum dose is reached, or adverse effects occur, and patients should be seen every 4 to 6 weeks until BP has normalized; if BP is not controlled with a single agent, add a second agent and titrate similarly, with a thiazide diuretic often the preferred second agent due to salt and water retention with many antihypertensives; lifestyle modifications should be continued, emphasizing a healthy, plant-strong diet rich in fruits and vegetables, reduced sodium intake, and increased exercise to improve medication effectiveness; routine use of combination products to initiate therapy cannot be recommended (studied only for bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide), but after BP control is achieved a combination product can be considered to improve adherence and reduce cost when dose and formulation are appropriate.

Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

Research needs and gaps — pediatric blood pressure screening: Priority evidence gaps include the following areas for future study and validation — The application of new thresholds for determining abnormal blood pressure to existing data sets and testing the validity of these thresholds; The benefits and harms of long-term pharmacologic treatment. These studies should have long-term follow-up of several months or years across various age groups because benefits and harms of treatments may be age dependent and hypertension in children may be self-limiting; The benefits and harms of screening and treatment should also include children at increased risk, such as Black and Hispanic/Latino populations; The long-term natural history of hypertension in children and the spontaneous resolution of hypertension; The associations among childhood hypertension, adulthood hypertension, and surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood, as well as adult clinical cardiovascular disease; and The harms of medications, long-term adherence with treatment, and the effect of individual components of multifactorial interventions.

Potential harms of clinic-based screening — Clinic-based screening for high blood pressure could result in false-positive results, making unnecessary secondary evaluations or treatments common, particularly with frequent blood pressure screening; although pharmacologic interventions have been shown to be well tolerated in studies over relatively short periods, treatment in childhood and adolescence with pharmacologic agents is done for a much longer period and adverse effects may be more likely to occur.

Pregnancy hypertension — common oral antihypertensive agents and dosing: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; it has potential bronchoconstrictive effects and should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine (extended release) is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally of an extended- release preparation and commonly initiated at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses and is commonly initiated at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, though it may not be as effective as other medications — especially in control of severe hypertension — and use is limited by side effects (sedation, depression, dizziness). Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–50 mg daily is considered a second- or third-line agent.

### A 91-year-old woman with difficult-to-control hypertension: a clinical review [^11343EY8]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is common among people older than 65 years, affecting nearly two-thirds of men and three-fourths of women by age 75 years. Treatment goals and medication selection for this population may differ from those for younger patients.

Objective

To discuss the presentation, pathophysiology, and optimal treatment of hypertension among elderly persons.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE was searched from 1990 to 2013. A hand search of bibliographies from guidelines and review articles from 2000 to 2013 was also used to identify studies of hypertension treatment in patients older than 65 years.

Findings

Hypertension in elderly people differs from that in younger people in that (1) hypertension is predominantly systolic because of vascular stiffness; (2) it is associated with reduced baroreflex sensitivity, which increases blood pressure variability and vulnerability to hypotension during common daily activities; (3) it is associated with cognitive and functional decline as well as adverse cardiovascular outcomes; and (4) hypertension may be beneficial in frail people older than 85 years. Treatment of healthy patients up to age 85 years with most antihypertensive medications reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and possibly cognitive and functional decline.

Conclusion and Relevance

Although patients in their 90s have not been studied, any ambulatory and independent patient older than 80 years should have multiple blood pressure measurements taken during their usual daily activities, and if these show persistent hypertension, these patients should be treated judiciously.

Definition and management of arterial hypertension in children and adolescents are uncertain, due to different positions of current guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology task-force, constituted by Associations and Councils with interest in arterial hypertension, has reviewed current literature and evidence, to produce a Consensus Document focused on aspects of hypertension in the age range of 6–16 years, including definition, methods of measurement of blood pressure, clinical evaluation, assessment of hypertension-mediated target organ damage, evaluation of possible vascular, renal and hormonal causes, assessment and management of concomitant risk factors with specific attention for obesity, and anti-hypertensive strategies, especially focused on life-style modifications. The Consensus Panel also suggests aspects that should be studied with high priority, including generation of multi-ethnic sex, age and height specific European normative tables, implementation of randomized clinical trials on different diagnostic and therapeutic aspects, and long-term cohort studies to link with adult cardiovascular risk. Finally, suggestions for the successful implementation of the contents of the present Consensus document are also given.

Evidence base and pediatric exclusivity for antihypertensives in children — Studies in hypertensive children show that antihypertensive drugs decrease BP with few adverse effects, with few comparative studies that do not show clinically significant differences in BP lowering between agents; there are no clinical trials in children with cardiovascular end points, and long-term safety data and impact on future cardiovascular disease are limited; most newer antihypertensives have undergone some degree of efficacy and safety evaluation because of pediatric assessment mandates, whereas drugs without patent protection have not been, and are unlikely to be, studied in children despite widespread use.

Pediatric hypertension — evidence gaps and research priorities note that, in general, the pediatric HTN literature is not as robust as the adult HTN literature, with the 2 most important reasons as follows: (1) the lower prevalence of HTN in childhood compared with adults, and (2) the lack of adverse CV events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) attributable to HTN in young patients. For example, no large pediatric cohort has ever been assembled to answer the question of whether routine BP measurement in childhood is useful to prevent adult CVD, and given this, other types of evidence, such as from cross-sectional and observational cohort studies, must be examined to guide practice. From the standpoint of the primary care provider, the most significant evidence gaps relate to whether diagnosing elevated BP and HTN in children and adolescents truly has long-term health consequences, whether antihypertensive medications should be used in a child or adolescent with elevated BP, and what medications should be preferentially used. Other important evidence gaps should be highlighted, including the following: Is there a specific BP level in childhood that predicts adverse outcomes, and can a single number (or numbers) be used to define HTN, as in adults? Can and should ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) ever replace auscultation in the diagnosis of childhood HTN? Are the currently used, normative standards for ABPM appropriate, or are new normative data needed? What is the best diagnostic evaluation to confidently exclude secondary causes of HTN? Are other assessments of hypertensive target organ damage (such as urine MA or vascular studies) better than echocardiography?

### 2016 European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1175vV4z]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Increasing prevalence of hypertension (HTN) in children and adolescents has become a significant public health issue driving a considerable amount of research. Aspects discussed in this document include advances in the definition of HTN in 16 year or older, clinical significance of isolated systolic HTN in youth, the importance of out of office and central blood pressure measurement, new risk factors for HTN, methods to assess vascular phenotypes, clustering of cardiovascular risk factors and treatment strategies among others. The recommendations of the present document synthesize a considerable amount of scientific data and clinical experience and represent the best clinical wisdom upon which physicians, nurses and families should base their decisions. In addition, as they call attention to the burden of HTN in children and adolescents, and its contribution to the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease, these guidelines should encourage public policy makers to develop a global effort to improve identification and treatment of high blood pressure among children and adolescents.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117X3rvB]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension in youth with diabetes should be assessed at every clinic visit, and in youth with high blood pressure (blood pressure ≥ 90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥ 13 years, ≥ 120/80 mmHg) on three separate measurements, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be strongly considered. After excluding secondary hypertension, treatment of elevated blood pressure (defined as 90th to < 95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥ 13 years, 120–129/ < 80 mmHg) is recommended through lifestyle modification focused on healthy eating, sleep, and physical activity. In addition to lifestyle modification, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be started for treatment of confirmed hypertension (defined as blood pressure consistently ≥ 95th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥ 13 years, ≥ 130/80 mmHg). Due to the potential teratogenic effects, individuals of childbearing age should receive reproductive counseling, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be avoided in individuals of childbearing age who are not using reliable contraception. The goal of treatment is blood pressure < 90th percentile for age, sex, and height or, in adolescents aged ≥ 13 years, < 130/80 mmHg.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — older adults with grade 1 hypertension: For the purposes of this guideline, the 'old' are defined as ≥ 65 years and the 'very old' as ≥ 80 years, and prior evidence in older patients was obtained when baseline SBP was ≥ 160 mmHg with strong evidence that these patients should be offered BP-lowering drug treatment. The evidence supports the recommendation that older patients (> 65 years, including patients over 80 years) should be offered BP-lowering treatment if their SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg, and there is also justification to now recommend BP-lowering treatment for old patients (aged ≥ 65 but not > 80 years) at a lower BP (i.e.g.rade 1 hypertension: SBP = 140–159 mmHg). BP-lowering drugs should not be withdrawn on the basis of age alone, and in patients aged > 80 years, CV risk reduction was greatest in those who continued treatment rather than in those whose treatment was discontinued; as stated, these recommendations relate to relatively fit and independent older patients.

### Screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115XCax4]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prevalence of hypertension (both primary and secondary) in children and adolescents in the US ranges from 3% to 4%. Primary hypertension in children and adolescents occurs primarily in children older than 13 years and has no known cause but is associated with several risk factors, including family history and higher body mass index. Secondary hypertension occurs primarily in younger children and is most commonly caused by genetic disorders, renal disease, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular abnormalities.

Objective

To update its 2013 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening, test accuracy, the effectiveness and harms of treatment, and the association between hypertension and markers of cardiovascular disease in childhood and adulthood.

Population

This recommendation statement applies to children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years not known to have hypertension or who are asymptomatic.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the evidence to support screening for high blood pressure in children and adolescents is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Pharmacological interventions for hypertension in children [^111uZ9CH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease and kidney damage in adults. There is a paucity of data on the long-term sequelae of persistent hypertension in children, but it is known that children with hypertension have evidence of end organ damage and are at risk of hypertension into adulthood. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates. In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure, especially those with evidence of end organ damage at presentation or during follow-up. A systematic review of the effects of antihypertensive agents in children has not previously been conducted.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related effects of different classes of antihypertensive medications, as monotherapy compared to placebo; as combination therapy compared to placebo or a single medication; or in comparisons of various doses within the same class, on systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or both) in children with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to October 2013), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to October 2013) and bibliographic citations.

Selection Criteria

The selection criteria were deliberately broad due to there being few clinical trials in children. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least two weeks duration comparing antihypertensive agents either as monotherapy or combination therapy with either placebo or another medication, or comparing different doses of the same medication, in children with hypertension. Hypertension was defined as an average (over a minimum of three readings) systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or both) on the 95(th) percentile or above for age, height and gender.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We summarised data, where possible, using a random-effects model. Formal assessment of heterogeneity was not possible because of insufficient data.

Main Results

A total of 21 trials evaluated antihypertensive medications of various drug classes in 3454 hypertensive children with periods of follow-up ranging from three to 24 weeks. There were five RCTs comparing an antihypertensive drug directly with placebo, 12 dose-finding trials, two trials comparing calcium channel blockers with angiotensin receptor blockers, one trial comparing a centrally acting alpha blocker with a diuretic and one trial comparing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker. No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage. The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Among the angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan (one trial, n = 240), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.50 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.44 to -3.56) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.50 mmHg (95% CI -9.62 to -1.38) (low-quality evidence). High dose telmisartan (one trial, n = 76), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by -8.50 (95% CI -13.79 to -3.21) but not diastolic blood pressure (-4.80, 95% CI -9.50 to 0.10) (low-quality evidence). Beta blocker (metoprolol, one trial, n = 140), when compared with placebo, significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.20 mmHg (95% CI -8.12 to -0.28) but not diastolic blood pressure (-3.20 mmHg 95% CI -7.12 to 0.72) (low-quality evidence). Beta blocker/diuretic combination (Bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, one trial, n = 94)when compared with placebo, did not result in a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-4.0 mmHg, 95% CI -8.99 to -0.19) but did have an effect on diastolic blood pressure (-4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -8.26 to -0.74) (low-quality evidence). Calcium channel blocker (extended-release felodipine, one trial, n = 133) was not effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (-0.62 mmHg, 95% CI -2.97 to 1.73) or diastolic blood pressure (-1.86 mmHg, 95% CI -5.23 to 1.51) when compared with placebo. Further, there was no consistent dose response observed among any of the drug classes. The adverse events associated with the antihypertensive agents were mostly minor and included headaches, dizziness and upper respiratory infections.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in children, with outcomes reported limited to blood pressure and not end organ damage. The most data are available for candesartan, for which there is low-quality evidence of a modest lowering effect on blood pressure. We did not find evidence of a consistent dose response relationship for escalating doses of angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. All agents appear safe, at least in the short term.

### Is the extrapolated adult dose of fosinopril safe and effective in treating hypertensive children? [^1113TU3S]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and dose-response relationship of fosinopril in children aged 6 to 16 years with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure with an associated medical condition requiring treatment. The study was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 78 clinical sites in the United States, Russia, and Israel. There were 4 phases: a screening phase of 10 days maximum, a 4-week dose-response phase, a placebo withdrawal phase of 2 weeks maximum, and a 52-week open-label safety phase. The primary objective of the dose-response phase was to determine whether low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg), or high (0.6 mg/kg) doses of fosinopril based on established adult dosing affect trough seated systolic blood pressure. During the dose-response phase, all 3 doses were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure. During the placebo withdrawal phase, there was an adjusted mean systolic blood pressure increase of 5.2 mm Hg for the placebo group and 1.5 mm Hg for the fosinopril group, a net withdrawal effect of 3.7 mm Hg (P = 0.013). Fosinopril was well tolerated; serious adverse events occurred infrequently and were generally not attributed to fosinopril. Because children appear to be more sensitive to lower doses of fosinopril than adults, starting doses for children should be ≤ 0.1 mg/kg.

### Antihypertensive drug effects on long-term blood pressure: an individual-level data meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^113mV2US]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights the role of pharmacological agents in effectively reducing BP over several years across individuals with a wide range of characteristics, although the achieved between-group reductions, even with the intensive BP-lowering regimens, were relatively modest. Given that large-scale trials have shown the effects of pharmacological BP reduction on improving clinical outcomes, the modest BP reductions estimated in our study should still be clinically meaningful. Indeed, the estimates of long-term BP reduction in this study could inform treatment strategies and help in setting realistic treatment goals in the pharmacologic management of raised BP.

### Investigation and treatment of high blood pressure in young people: too much medicine or appropriate risk reduction? [^113sQchf]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension among young people is common, affecting 1 in 8 adults aged between 20 and 40 years. This number is likely to increase with lifestyle behaviors and lowering of hypertension diagnostic thresholds. Early-life factors influence blood pressure (BP) although the mechanisms are unclear; BP tracks strongly within individuals from adolescence through to later life. Higher BP at a young age is associated with abnormalities on heart and brain imaging and increases the likelihood of cardiovascular events by middle age. However, diagnosis rates are lower, and treatment is often delayed in young people. This reflects the lack of high-quality evidence that lowering BP in young adults improves cardiovascular outcomes later in life. In this review, we evaluate the current evidence regarding the association between BP in young adult life and adverse cardiovascular outcomes later in life. Following this, we discuss which young people with raised BP should be investigated for secondary causes of hypertension. Third, we assess the current models to assess cardiovascular risk and show a lack of validation in the younger age group. Fourth, we evaluate the evidence for lifestyle interventions in this age group and demonstrate a lack of persistence in BP lowering once the initial intervention has been delivered. Fifth, we address the pros and cons of drug treatment for raised BP in young people. Finally, there are unique life events in young people, such as pregnancy, that require specific advice on management and treatment of BP.

### High blood pressure in children and adolescents [^111sacCN]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

High blood pressure in children and adolescents is a growing health problem that is often overlooked. Children should be screened for elevated blood pressure annually beginning at three years of age or at every visit if risk factors are present. In children younger than 13 years, elevated blood pressure is defined as blood pressure in the 90th percentile or higher for age, height, and sex, and hypertension is defined as blood pressure in the 95th percentile or higher. In adolescents 13 years and older, elevated blood pressure is defined as blood pressure of 120 to 129 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic, and hypertension is defined as blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be performed to confirm hypertension in children and adolescents. Primary hypertension is now the most common cause of hypertension in children and adolescents. A history and physical examination and targeted screening tests should be done to evaluate for underlying medical disorders, and children and adolescents with hypertension should be screened for comorbid cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. Hypertension in children is initially treated with lifestyle changes such as weight loss if overweight or obese, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Children with symptomatic hypertension (e.g., headaches, cognitive changes), stage 2 hypertension without a modifiable factor such as obesity, evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography, any stage of hypertension associated with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, or persistent hypertension despite a trial of lifestyle modifications require antihypertensive medications and should be evaluated for cardiovascular damage with echocardiography. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are effective, safe, and well-tolerated in children.

### Screening for hypertension in children and adolescents: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^1117xMpw]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Childhood hypertension can result in adverse outcomes during adulthood; identifying and treating primary and secondary childhood hypertension may reduce such risks.

Objective

To update the evidence on screening and treatment of hypertension in childhood and adolescence for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, EMBASE, and trial registries through September 3, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through October 6, 2020.

Study Selection

Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure screening; cohort studies assessing the association of hypertension in childhood and adolescence with blood pressure or other intermediate outcomes in adulthood; randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses of pharmacological and lifestyle interventions.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; the evidence was synthesized qualitatively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and measures of association between childhood and adulthood blood pressure; reduction of childhood blood pressure; adverse effects of treatments.

Results

Forty-two studies from 43 publications were included (N > 12 400). No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening and the effect of treating childhood hypertension on outcomes in adulthood. One study reported a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.70 for 2 office-based blood pressure measurements. Twenty observational studies suggested a significant association between childhood hypertension and abnormal blood pressure in adulthood (odds ratios, 1.1–4.5; risk ratios, 1.45–3.60; hazard ratios, 2.8–3.2). Thirteen placebo-controlled RCTs and 1 meta-analysis assessed reductions in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure from pharmacological treatments. Pooled reductions of SBP were -4.38 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.27 to -2.16) for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and -3.07 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.99 to -1.44) for angiotensin receptor blockers. Candesartan reduced SBP by -6.56 mm Hg (P < .001; n = 240). β-Blockers, calcium channel blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists did not achieve significant reductions over 2 to 4 weeks. SBP was significantly reduced by exercise over 8 months (-4.9 mm Hg, P ≤ .05; n = 69), by dietary approaches to stop hypertension over 3 months (-2.2 mm Hg, P < .01; n = 57), and by a combination of drug treatment and lifestyle interventions over 6 months (-7.6 mm Hg; P < .001; n = 95). Low-salt diet did not achieve reductions of blood pressure.

Conclusions and Relevance

Observational studies indicate an association between hypertension in childhood and hypertension in adulthood. However, the evidence is inconclusive whether the diagnostic accuracy of blood pressure measurements is adequate for screening asymptomatic children and adolescents in primary care.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric hypertension guideline — overview of key updates: The document is an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents". Significant changes include replacing "prehypertension" with "elevated blood pressure", new normative pediatric blood pressure (BP) tables based on normal-weight children, a simplified screening table for identifying BPs needing further evaluation, and a simplified BP classification in adolescents ≥ 13 years of age that aligns with the forthcoming American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology adult BP guidelines. Additional updates include a more limited recommendation to perform screening BP measurements only at preventive care visits, streamlined recommendations on the initial evaluation and management of abnormal BPs, an expanded role for ambulatory BP monitoring in the diagnosis and management of pediatric hypertension, and revised recommendations on when to perform echocardiography in newly diagnosed hypertensive pediatric patients (generally only before medication initiation), with a revised definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. The guideline includes 30 Key Action Statements and 27 additional recommendations derived from a comprehensive review of almost 15 000 published articles between January 2004 and July 2016.

Purpose Of Review

Given the continuous relations of blood pressure to cardiovascular risk, any definition of high blood pressure is arbitrary, and based on thresholds at which there is clear evidence that treatment benefits outweigh potential risks. This review examines what constitutes optimal blood pressure.

Recent Findings

A recent report raised the possibility of an age- and sex-dependent threshold for risk associated with systolic blood pressure, questioning the use of a single threshold (such as 140/90 mmHg) for defining hypertension. Several subsequent studies have questioned this notion and reemphasized that lower blood pressure levels are associated with less morbidity and mortality even within the nonhypertensive range. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg is associated with minimal vascular mortality and likely constitutes optimal blood pressure. Such blood pressure levels are infrequent in westernized societies. The target blood pressure goal for treated hypertensives is higher at 140/90 mmHg but is infrequently achieved. Select individuals at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease events and/or with specific conditions (notably diabetes, renal insufficiency and prior vascular disease) may benefit from blood pressure lowering below this threshold.

Summary

At a population level, a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg seems optimal because it is associated with minimal vascular risk. Over half of all hypertensives do not have their blood pressure controlled underscoring the challenges facing health care providers. Efforts should be strengthened for the primary prevention of hypertension and the promotion of optimal blood pressure through lifestyle measures.

Pediatric hypertension — follow-up and monitoring specify that if medication is initiated, the patient should be seen frequently (every 4–6 weeks) for dose adjustments and/or addition of a second or third agent until goal BP has been achieved, after which visits can be extended to every 3 to 4 months; if lifestyle changes only are chosen, follow-up visits can occur at longer intervals (every 3–6 months). In patients treated with antihypertensive medications, home BP measurement is frequently used to get a better assessment of BP control, and repeat ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) may also be used to assess BP control and is especially important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). At each follow-up visit, the patient should be assessed for adherence to prescribed therapy and for any adverse effects, which may include laboratory testing depending on the medication (for example, electrolyte monitoring if the patient is on a diuretic), and it is also important to continually reinforce adherence.
