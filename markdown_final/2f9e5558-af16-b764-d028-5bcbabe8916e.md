## Question

A 67-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. On day 3 of admission, his urine output drops to less than 0.3 mL/kg/h for 8 hours, and his serum creatinine rises from 1.0 mg/dL to 2.2 mg/dL. He is hemodynamically stable and not volume overloaded. The ICU team discusses possible interventions to improve his kidney function. One resident suggests starting low-dose dopamine, another suggests using diuretics to enhance kidney recovery, and a third proposes fenoldopam infusion. The attending asks you, as the senior resident, to recommend which of these therapies, if any, should be initiated to treat his acute kidney injury.

Based on current KDIGO guidelines, which of the proposed therapies (low-dose dopamine, diuretics to enhance kidney recovery, fenoldopam) should be used in this patient to treat his acute kidney injury, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the proposed therapies (low-dose dopamine, diuretics to enhance kidney recovery, fenoldopam) should be used in a 67-year-old man with sepsis-associated AKI who is hemodynamically stable and not volume overloaded, and why, according to current KDIGO guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the AKI diagnosis and staging using KDIGO criteria. Then, I should verify the guideline stance on low-dose dopamine. Next, I will examine the evidence and recommendations for loop diuretics to "treat" AKI or hasten recovery. After that, I need to check the status of fenoldopam. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant plan and address any nuances or exceptions, including when diuretics are appropriate for fluid management rather than renal recovery.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage. By KDIGO, AKI is defined by an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours. Staging uses creatinine and urine output thresholds, with Stage 3 including urine output less than 0.3 mL/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours, so this patient's oliguria and creatinine rise meet AKI criteria and, if persistent, would approach Stage 3 by urine output, though I should double-check the exact duration before labeling Stage 3 definitively [^112QvBnQ] [^112yakDN].

> Now, low-dose dopamine. Wait, let me verify the guideline position. KDIGO explicitly recommends not using low-dose dopamine to treat AKI, citing lack of benefit and potential harm, so I should not recommend it here despite historical teaching that "renal-dose" dopamine might help. The recommendation is strong and applies across etiologies, including sepsis-associated AKI, so dopamine is off the table for renal protection or recovery in this scenario [^112uMs2F].

> Next, diuretics to enhance kidney recovery. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the exact wording. KDIGO recommends not using diuretics to prevent AKI and suggests not using diuretics to treat AKI except for management of volume overload; importantly, they also suggest not using diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery or to reduce the duration or frequency of RRT, and the evidence shows no improvement in mortality, RRT requirement, or renal recovery with loop diuretics in AKI. So, in a patient who is euvolemic and not overloaded, using diuretics to "treat" AKI or hasten recovery is not supported and may distract from hemodynamic optimization and cause electrolyte disturbances [^113CGoBy] [^117Mmx7L] [^114LP4C4] [^1165AUd9].

> I will now examine fenoldopam. Let me think about the strength of evidence. KDIGO states that adequately powered multicenter trials with clinically significant endpoints are lacking for fenoldopam to prevent or treat AKI, and the balance of evidence does not support routine use. Given potential hypotension and lack of proven benefit, fenoldopam should not be used for AKI treatment in this context either [^114UAVE8].

> But wait, what if the team is conflating fluid management with renal recovery? I should clarify that loop diuretics remain appropriate when there is true volume overload or pulmonary edema, to facilitate fluid removal and relieve symptoms, but that is a fluid-management indication, not a therapy to improve intrinsic kidney function or hasten recovery. In this patient, who is hemodynamically stable and not volume overloaded, there is no indication for diuretics, and using them could mask oliguria without improving outcomes [^113CGoBy] [^114LP4C4].

> Next, I should review what to do instead. Let me verify the core principles. KDIGO emphasizes prompt evaluation of the cause with attention to reversible factors, optimization of volume status and perfusion pressure, discontinuation of nephrotoxins, and close monitoring of creatinine and urine output. In sepsis, protocolized hemodynamic support with fluids and vasopressors to maintain adequate MAP is recommended, and while vasopressors can improve renal perfusion in shock, they should be used for hemodynamic targets rather than as renal-specific therapies. I need to ensure we are not missing sepsis-related contributors like hypotension, hypovolemia, or nephrotoxic agents that can be corrected [^111zactY] [^1158K9pt] [^112o9gbs] [^112YeV64].

> Hold on, I should verify RRT considerations. The vignette does not suggest life-threatening indications such as severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema from fluid overload, or uremic complications, so emergent RRT is not indicated now. KDIGO advises deciding on RRT using the broader clinical context and trends rather than single creatinine thresholds, and to initiate when metabolic and fluid demands exceed kidney capacity; I should confirm we are trending labs and clinical status rather than reacting to a single value [^112QdGN4] [^1164os86].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. None of the proposed pharmacologic strategies — low-dose dopamine, diuretics to enhance recovery, or fenoldopam — are recommended by KDIGO for treating AKI in this patient. The appropriate course is to avoid these therapies, continue supportive care with careful hemodynamic management, remove nephrotoxins, and monitor closely for progression or indications for RRT, while addressing the underlying sepsis and pneumonia [^112uMs2F] [^113CGoBy] [^114UAVE8] [^1158K9pt].

---

Per KDIGO, **do not use low-dose dopamine, diuretics to enhance recovery, or fenoldopam** for this patient with sepsis-associated AKI. These therapies do not improve renal outcomes and may cause harm [^112uMs2F] [^113CGoBy] [^114UAVE8]. The focus should be on **supportive care**: optimize hemodynamics, avoid nephrotoxins, and reserve diuretics for volume overload — not to promote renal recovery [^1158K9pt] [^117Mmx7L].

---

## Evidence and recommendations from KDIGO guidelines

### Low-dose dopamine

- **Recommendation**: Do not use low-dose dopamine to treat AKI [^112uMs2F].
- **Rationale**: No benefit in renal function, need for RRT, or mortality; risk of arrhythmias and other adverse effects [^112o9gbs].

---

### Diuretics to enhance kidney recovery

- **Recommendation**: Do not use diuretics to enhance kidney function recovery or reduce RRT duration/frequency [^117Mmx7L].
- **Rationale**: No improvement in renal recovery or RRT needs; use only for volume overload management [^114LP4C4] [^113CGoBy].

---

### Fenoldopam

- **Recommendation**: Do not use fenoldopam to prevent or treat AKI [^114UAVE8].
- **Rationale**: No proven benefit; risk of hypotension and harm [^112KsQoD].

---

## Clinical implications for the patient

Given hemodynamic stability and no volume overload, **supportive care** is indicated:

- **Hemodynamic optimization**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with fluids and vasopressors as needed [^112o9gbs] [^116HjY8k].
- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Discontinue or adjust nephrotoxic drugs [^1158K9pt].
- **Monitor closely**: Track urine output, creatinine, and electrolytes; consider RRT only for standard indications (e.g. refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, volume overload, uremic symptoms) [^112QdGN4].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Kdigo recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-dose dopamine | Do not use | No benefit; potential harm |
| Diuretics for recovery | Do not use | No benefit; use only for volume overload |
| Fenoldopam | Do not use | No benefit; potential harm |

---

KDIGO advises against low-dose dopamine, diuretics to enhance recovery, and fenoldopam for this patient. Prioritize **supportive care** and reserve diuretics for volume overload — not to promote renal recovery.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) recommendations — rating framework and implications are defined as follows: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1, Level 2, or Not Graded, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1 ("We recommend") implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2 ("We suggest") implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". The additional category "Not Graded" "was used, typically, to provide guidance based on common sense or where the topic does not allow adequate application of evidence", and "are generally written as simple declarative statements, but are not meant to be interpreted as being stronger recommendations than Level 1 or 2 recommendations". Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^115zwJZn]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical advances over the past decade, standardized protocols, and physician awareness have significantly improved survival in patients with sepsis, but mortality rates remain between 20% and 36%, with approximately 270, 000 deaths annually in the United States. Lactate-guided resuscitation reduces overall mortality compared with no lactate monitoring. Of patients with sepsis, 80% are initially treated in an emergency department, and the remainder develop sepsis during hospitalization for other conditions. 5 Major risk factors for developing sepsis are age of 65 years or older, malnutrition, chronic illness, immunosuppression, recent surgery or hospitalization, and indwelling devices. 3 Approximately one-third of sepsis cases occur in the postoperative period.
6.

Although an increasing number of patients admitted for sepsis become well enough to be discharged from the hospital, these patients have higher rates of readmission and of death within 12 months and significantly reduced physical and cognitive function compared with matched controls.
7. 8 Previously, septic shock was identified by the presence of hypotension. It is now recognized that hypotension can be a late manifestation, and tissue hypoperfusion precedes hypotension. Lactate level, an indirect marker of tissue perfusion, has been incorporated in the diagnosis of septic shock in addition to the need for vasopressor therapy required to maintain mean arterial pressure of greater than 65 mm Hg. In this article, use of the term sepsis includes both sepsis and septic shock unless otherwise specified. SIRS is defined as the presence of at least two of the following four criteria: temperature greater than 100. 4°F or less than
96.

8°F; heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute or partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 32 mm Hg; and white blood cell count greater than 12, 000 per μL, less than 4, 000 per μL, or greater than 10% immature forms. The overall sensitivity of the SIRS criteria for detecting sepsis is only about 50% to 60%, and one in eight patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis does not meet SIRS criteria. 10, 11 A limitation of the SIRS criteria is that SIRS may be present with noninfectious conditions such as autoimmune disorders, vasculitis, pancreatitis, burns, trauma, or recent surgery. 9, 12–14 Sepsis should be suspected in patients meeting at least two of the three qSOFA criteria: respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute or greater, altered mental status, and systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less. These patients should undergo additional evaluation.

The qSOFA is limited by its low sensitivity and because it typically identifies patients who present late in the course of sepsis. 12 and is used in the ICU to predict in-hospital mortality. It assesses the severity of dysfunction for six organ systems in critically ill patients. The score is calculated at the time of ICU admission and then every 48 hours. An increase in the SOFA score by at least two points from baseline indicates acute organ dysfunction with a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis and an increase in mortality rate of greater than 20%. 13, 16. After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, patients with sepsis should complete the sepsis bundle within three hours of presentation. 24–27 Vasopressor therapy is initiated if the patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation.

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline on the classification and management of acute kidney injury (AKI). The guideline was derived from evidence available through February 2011. Since then, new evidence has emerged that has important implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing AKI. In April of 2019, KDIGO held a controversies conference entitled Acute Kidney Injury with the following goals: determine best practices and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline; address ongoing controversial issues; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management. Here, we present the findings of this conference and describe key areas that future guidelines may address.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### Reading between the (guide) lines – the KDIGO practice guideline on acute kidney injury in the individual patient [^115qv7nj]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guidelines for acute kidney injury (AKI) are designed to assist health-care providers around the world in managing patients with AKI. Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

Rationale for a guideline on AKI — AKI is a global problem with immediate and long-term adverse outcomes, more prevalent in and a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), with individuals with CKD especially susceptible; the burden may be greatest in developing countries, and early detection to prevent progression to kidney failure requiring dialysis is of paramount importance, yet preventable risk factors are not widely known and variably practiced.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) hemodynamic management research priorities specify that studies are needed comparing different types of vasopressors for prevention and treatment of AKI in hemodynamically unstable patients, with some evidence suggesting that certain vasopressors may preserve renal function better than others (e.g., vasopressin analogs vs. catecholamines), warranting comparative studies. The choice of a target mean arterial perfusion pressure range of 65–90 mm Hg as a component of resuscitation needs further study, and the specific components of goal-directed therapy that accrue benefits for patients at risk for AKI need to be determined; notably, protocoled use of inotropes to normalize mixed venous oxygen saturation or supranormalize oxygen delivery in "late" critical illness did not result in decreased AKI or improved outcomes. Given limitations of current studies and lack of comparative effectiveness studies, protocols for resuscitation in septic shock and high-risk surgery appear to be superior to no protocol.

KDIGO AKI — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) recommendations state to initiate RRT emergently when life‑threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance exist, and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). The rationale notes that while no RCTs exist for dialysis for life‑threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^1164os86]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline suggested initiating RRT emergently in the presence of life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance. Since 2012, data from several RCTs and observational studies have become available. However, the optimal timing for acute RRT remains unknown. It has been proposed that initiation of RRT should be considered when metabolic and fluid demands exceed the kidney's capacity to meet them. – This concept acknowledges the dynamic nature of acute illness and stresses the importance of regular evaluation of the demand and renal capacity relationship. However, the exact methods for determining demand and capacity are unknown. Existing evidence does not support using biomarkers when deciding whether to initiate RRT. Use of a standardized FST can be considered in AKI, to further quantify the likelihood of AKI progression, and integrated into the spectrum of clinical information available when planning for and deciding to initiate RRT. In determining whether or not to start RRT, risk of complications, global prognosis, potential for recovery, and patient preferences should be considered (Figure 3). Although some regions of the globe have challenges and constraints in providing universal access to RRT, we recommend a similar approach be undertaken for considering for whom and when to start RRT in all regions. – Additionally, a similar approach should be undertaken in both intensive care unit and non–intensive care unit settings.

KDOQI US commentary — evaluation and management positions for AKI state that the authors "strongly concur with the KDIGO recommendations that the cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible" and that "patients with AKI should be evaluated promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes", but they express concerns that "the stage-based management recommendations… are not adequately evidence based" and "implicitly assume homogeneity within each AKI stage and successive increases in severity across stages". They note "the lack of correlation between serum creatinine level and GFR in the acute setting", such that increases in serum creatinine can yield "apparent progression in AKI stage, despite improvement in GFR", and describe the recommendations as "relatively nonspecific and unlikely to help in daily clinical practice". They caution that "development of clinical action plans based on AKI stage may result in inappropriate protocolization of care", and cite examples where "waiting until stage 2 AKI to check for changes in drug dosing" is implied and recommendations to consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) and "intensive care unit admission in stage 2 AKI seem premature". They also "agree with the emphasis on close postdischarge clinical evaluation of patients with moderate to severe AKI".

KDIGO/KDOQI AKI definition, staging, and performance measures — the definition and staging system provides an important tool for epidemiologic studies and trial design, but there is insufficient validation for its use in diagnosis and clinical management, and we do not believe that there are sufficient data to support use of the stage-based management approach; rather, management of patients with AKI should be based on assessment of overall clinical status; although AKI is an important risk factor for CKD, the majority of patients with mild, readily reversible AKI are at relatively low risk of progressive CKD; from a U.S. public health standpoint, follow-up should be targeted to the highest risk populations; the KDIGO recommendations for definition and staging of adult AKI should not be used for the development of clinical performance measures, and administrative coding for AKI should not be based solely on this definition and staging system.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — potential applications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) span renal replacement, life‑threatening indications, nonemergent indications, and renal support. Renal replacement is described as "the traditional, prevailing approach based on utilization of RRT when there is little or no residual kidney function". For life‑threatening indications, hyperkalemia has "No trials to validate these criteria" and "requires frequent monitoring of potassium levels and adjustment of concurrent medical management to prevent relapses", pulmonary edema may be managed because "RRT is often utilized to prevent the need for ventilatory support", and "it is rare to wait to initiate RRT in AKI patients until there are uremic complications". For nonemergent indications, solute control notes that "BUN reflects factors not directly associated with kidney function" and that "SCr is influenced by age, race, muscle mass, and catabolic rate, and by changes in its volume of distribution due to fluid administration or withdrawal", with "Fluid overload is an important determinant of the timing of RRT initiation" and "No standard criteria for initiating dialysis exist". For renal support, the approach "is based on the utilization of RRT techniques as an adjunct to enhance kidney function, modify fluid balance, and control solute levels", highlighting that "Fluid overload is emerging as an important factor associated with, and possibly contributing to, adverse outcomes in AKI", with reports that "Recent studies have shown potential benefits from extracorporeal fluid removal in CHF. Intraoperative fluid removal using modified ultrafiltration has been shown to improve outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgery patients". Additional supportive uses include that "Permissive hypercapnic acidosis in patients with lung injury can be corrected with RRT, without inducing fluid overload and hypernatremia", and that "studies are ongoing to assess the efficacy of RRT for cytokine manipulation in sepsis".

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever international multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. Two topics, contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy, deserve special attention because of the frequency in which they are encountered and the availability of evidence. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided. This review is an abridged version of the guideline and provides additional rationale and commentary for those recommendation statements that most directly impact the practice of critical care.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline methodology — development, evidence review, outcomes, and grading are described as follows: KDIGO contracted with the Tufts Evidence Review Team (ERT) and the Work Group, KDIGO Co-Chairs, ERT, liaisons, and KDIGO support staff met for four 2-day meetings. Evidence review focused on four major topic areas — definition and classification, prevention, pharmacologic treatment, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) — with populations of interest at risk for AKI (including after intravascular contrast-media exposure, aminoglycosides, amphotericin) and those with or at risk for AKI (sepsis, trauma, critical care, or cardiothoracic surgery); studies on AKI from rhabdomyolysis, specific infections, and poisoning or drug overdose were excluded, and overall, 18 385 citations were screened. Outcomes were limited to those important for decision making, including development of AKI, need for or dependence on RRT, and all-cause mortality, with a "crucial" outcome selected as that weighing most heavily in assessing overall quality of evidence. Grading used the GRADE system with strength rated as level 1 meaning "strong" or level 2 meaning "weak" or discretionary, and each statement assigned evidence quality A (high), B (moderate), C (low), or D (very low); on topics not amenable to systematic review, the Work Group could issue statements that are not graded and felt these should not be viewed as weaker than graded recommendations.

Transitions between continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) are described as frequent and largely driven by hemodynamic status or coagulation issues, and IHD "may, therefore, be the preferred treatment in patients where immediate removal of small solutes is required, such as severe hyperkalemia, some cases of poisoning, and tumor lysis syndrome", while hybrid sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) "may share some of the advantages of both IHD and CRRT without having their disadvantages". Evidence includes multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and a Cochrane meta-analysis "analyzing 15 RCTs in 1550 AKI patients", in which "outcomes were similar in critically ill AKI patients treated with CRRT and IHD", with other meta-analyses and a subsequent RCT also reporting similar outcomes; cost findings are mixed, with regional studies showing "reduced cost with IHD compared to CRRT", but a multinational observational analysis found "considerable heterogeneity in costs related to IHD and CRRT" and concluded "either therapy might be cost effective".

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diuretics — evidence and rationale indicate frequent use despite no demonstrated benefit and potential harm. Recent observational studies showed that 59–70% of patients with AKI received diuretics around nephrology consultation or before renal replacement therapy (RRT), yet there is no evidence that the use of diuretics reduces the incidence or severity of AKI. Systematic reviews of frusemide (furosemide) reported no significant effect on in-hospital mortality, RRT requirement, dialysis sessions, or persistent oliguria, with pooled RR for mortality of 2.67 (95% CI 0.75–7.25; P = 0.115) and for RRT incidence of 4.08 (95% CI 0.46–35.96; P = 0.21) versus placebo. Prophylactic furosemide was found to be ineffective or harmful after cardiac surgery and to increase the risk of AKI when given to prevent CI-AKI. In the largest trial including 338 patients with AKI requiring dialysis, patients randomized to furosemide (25 mg/kg/d i.v. or 35 mg/kg/d orally) versus placebo reached 2 l/d diuresis sooner (5.7 days vs 7.8 days, P = 0.004) without differences in survival or number of dialysis sessions, and current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with AKI.

### Harmonizing acute and chronic kidney disease definition and classification: report of a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^111proz3]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease is an important public health problem. Both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease have been well defined and classified, leading to improved research efforts and subsequent management strategies and recommendations. For those patients with abnormalities in kidney function and/or structure who meet neither the definition of AKI nor chronic kidney disease, there remains a gap in research, care, and guidance. The term acute kidney diseases and disorders, abbreviated to acute kidney disease (AKD), has been introduced as an important construct to address this. To expand and harmonize existing definitions and to ultimately better inform research and clinical care, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organized a consensus workshop. Multiple invitees from around the globe, representing both acute and chronic kidney disease researchers and experts, met virtually to examine existing data, and discuss key concepts related to AKD. Despite some remaining unresolved questions, conference attendees reached general consensus on the definition and classification of AKD, management strategies, and research priorities. AKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney function and/or structure with implications for health and with a duration of ≤ 3 months. AKD may include AKI, but, more importantly, also includes abnormalities in kidney function that are not as severe as AKI or that develop over a period of > 7 days. The cause(s) of AKD should be sought, and classification includes functional and structural parameters. Management of AKD is currently based on empirical considerations. A robust research agenda to enable refinement and validation of definitions and classification systems, and thus testing of interventions and strategies, is proposed.

NOMENCLATURE AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

AKI-related definitions

AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized as related entities representing a continuum of disease. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) 2002 guideline and the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline defined CKD as measured or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m, or the presence of markers of kidney damage (e.g. albuminuria) for > 90 days. The 2012 KDIGO guideline defined AKI as an abrupt decrease in kidney function occurring over 7 days or fewer (Table 1). To complete the continuum, the 2012 guideline proposed the term acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) to define conditions of impaired kidney function not meeting the criteria for either AKI or CKD but having adverse outcomes and requiring clinical care. However, consensus on the exact criteria and indicators of severity is urgently needed.

Because the diagnosis of AKI should be tied to management decisions, and because changing disease definitions may have major implications for disease epidemiology, the case for revising the 2012 KDIGO definition of AKI should be strong before changes are proposed. Furthermore, in the context of an AKI guideline revision, several classification systems in addition to the stages of AKI should be rigorously defined. These relate to the distinctions among persistent, transient, relapsing, and recovered AKI; various etiologies of AKI; and community-onset versus hospital-onset AKI. In addition, there is emerging evidence that markers of structural kidney damage may be associated with clinically relevant outcomes and therefore identify potentially actionable entities. For an AKI guideline revision, the evidence base should be reviewed to determine whether markers of kidney damage constitute risk factors for AKI, define a new entity (such as subclinical or preclinical AKI), or should be incorporated into the AKI definition. Finally, the future guideline should use nomenclature that is precise and patient-centered.

Pediatric acute kidney injury — special considerations for acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) — span wide age and size ranges and include specific indications. Pediatric and adolescent patients range in age from the premature neonate to 25 years of age, with a size range of 1.5–200 kg. The epidemiology of pediatric AKI has shifted to injury from other systemic illnesses or treatments. Newborns with inborn errors of metabolism who do not respond to dietary and pharmacologic management require expeditious dialytic removal of ammonia to decrease the risk of death and long-term neurologic dysfunction, and infants after surgical correction of congenital heart disease often receive peritoneal dialysis (PD) early after cardiopulmonary bypass to prevent fluid overload and/or minimize the proinflammatory response.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

CONCLUSIONS

Although much of the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline remains state of the art, advances over the past decade have improved our understanding of best practices. Many of these advances are widely accepted (e.g. nephrotoxic medication stewardship, shared decision making for RRT), but others are more controversial (Table 5). Although some centers and specific programs have embraced new technologies and ways of thinking, others have taken a more conservative, or "wait-and-see" approach. Even among conference participants, there was lack of unanimity for various perspectives, and obvious practice variation continues to exist, even among experts. Perhaps more than any new trial or discovery, this fact provides ample rationale for revisiting the AKI guideline in the near future.

RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY

RRT terminology and initiation

In recent years, the suggestion has been made that the English term "renal" should be replaced by "kidney", because the latter is more familiar to most English speakers. Additionally, the term "replacement" may not be sufficient, and terms such as "support" or "partial replacement" may be more accurate. The implications of changes in nomenclature are not insignificant. Additionally, the distinction between kidney versus renal does not apply in all languages. Accordingly, KDIGO has convened a separate Nomenclature Consensus Conference for the purpose of recommending nomenclature consistent with guidelines for acute and chronic kidney disease. Above all, patients should be the focus of all communication and care. Whenever possible, all decisions about treatment should be shared with patients, their families and/or next of kin, and if required, all members of the end-of-life care multidisciplinary team. All communication with patients and their supporting families/friends should be provided in simple lay language at regular intervals, with the awareness that patients may be traumatized. "Life support", "kidney machine", or similar words are preferred to the term RRT. If RRT becomes permanent, and the patient enters the chronic dialysis pathway, all relevant medical or nursing personnel should change their language to specify the type of RRT (transplant, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis).

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) renal replacement therapy (RRT) dose — additional considerations: In patients who do not achieve the target dose of RRT despite optimization of the initial modality, a switch to another modality or combination "should be considered". For patients with septic shock and AKI, there are "insufficient data supporting a recommendation for elevated RRT doses", though "limited data suggest that a higher dose might be beneficial in some patients". A small single-center RCT in "20 patients with septic shock and AKI" randomized to high-volume "(effluent flow of 65 ml/kg/h)" versus low-volume CVVH "(effluent flow of 35 ml/kg/h)" used a primary end point of vasopressor dose to maintain mean arterial pressure at "65 mm Hg". The "Mean norepinephrine dose decreased more rapidly after 24 h in high-volume as compared to low-volume CVVH treatment", while "Survival on day 28 was not affected".

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — vasopressors: We recommend the use of vasopressors in conjunction with fluids in patients with vasomotor shock with, or at risk for, AKI. (1C) Sepsis and septic shock are major contributing factors to AKI and vasopressor requirement appears to be highly associated with AKI in this population, and in the setting of vasomotor paralysis preservation or improvement of renal perfusion can only be achieved through use of systemic vasopressors once intravascular volume has been restored. Small open-label studies reported improvement in creatinine clearance (CrCl) following a 6- to 8-hour infusion of norepinephrine or terlipressin, while vasopressin reduced the need for norepinephrine and increased urine output and CrCl. A large randomized controlled trial comparing dopamine to norepinephrine as initial vasopressor in shock showed no significant differences in renal function or mortality, but more arrhythmic events occurred with dopamine and a subgroup analysis found an increased rate of death at 28 days among cardiogenic shock, not among septic or hypovolemic shock. Vasopressin is gaining popularity for shock refractory to norepinephrine and increases blood pressure and enhances diuresis, but has not as yet been proven to enhance survival or to reduce the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

The guideline further notes: "Given the potential to mitigate fluid overload but also to worsen renal function and possibly cause kidney injury, further study is required to clarify the safety of loop diuretics in the management of patients with AKI".
