## Question

Does the body naturally cmeat the virus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the body can naturally clear viral infections without medical treatment, and how that happens mechanistically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between innate and adaptive immunity and their timelines. Then, I should verify the key antiviral effectors, especially interferons and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Next, I will examine real-world examples of natural clearance across viruses, including acute and chronic infections. After that, I need to consider viral evasion strategies that can thwart clearance. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced conclusion and note exceptions where natural clearance fails or is incomplete, anchoring the reasoning in current immunology literature.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework: the immune system has two coordinated arms, innate and adaptive, and both are required for effective viral control in most settings, with innate responses acting within hours to days and adaptive responses maturing over days to weeks, which sets the tempo for natural clearance in acute infections [^114Lv9QU] [^112a8Vs7].

> I will now examine the innate arm's early antiviral actions, because rapid interferon signaling and restriction factors often determine whether a virus is contained before adaptive immunity is fully engaged. Pattern recognition receptors sense viral nucleic acids and trigger type I and III interferons, which induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication and spread, while constitutive restriction factors like TRIM5α provide additional early blocks to specific viruses such as HIV-1 [^115235Ay] [^117XPVRa] [^1127Upbn].

> Wait, let me verify the role of interferon timing and location, because that matters for outcomes. In SARS-CoV-2, delayed local interferon responses correlate with more severe disease, whereas early interferon signaling is associated with asymptomatic or mild infection, and exogenous interferon-λ can accelerate viral clearance even when adaptive responses are delayed, underscoring the causal importance of interferon-mediated innate control [^114PueJ1] [^113BR3DH].

> Next, I should review adaptive effectors that finish the job. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells eliminate infected cells, CD4+ T cells provide help for optimal CD8+ and B cell responses, and neutralizing antibodies block viral entry and can engage Fc-mediated effector functions, with memory B and T cells conferring durable protection against reinfection in many viral diseases [^112a8Vs7] [^11537bGv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without concrete examples. Most people naturally clear common respiratory viruses like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses, and the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections resolve without antiviral therapy, reflecting effective innate and adaptive responses, while a substantial fraction of acute hepatitis C infections also undergo spontaneous clearance, demonstrating that natural viral clearance is a realistic outcome across diverse viruses [^112R9eYr] [^114Un8xd] [^114qMyrL].

> But wait, what if the virus evades these defenses? Many viruses have evolved sophisticated immune evasion, including interferon antagonism, NK cell escape, and antigenic variation, which can delay or blunt host control, and in some cases establish chronicity, as seen with HIV, hepatitis B and C, and persistent herpesviruses like CMV and EBV, where the immune system often contains but does not eradicate infection without therapy [^112w2hxQ] [^1129tgbP] [^111WcvDE] [^1115KHwz] [^114gyMtB].

> I should double-check the balance between viral cytopathicity and immune-mediated pathology. In highly cytopathic infections or when immune responses are dysregulated, tissue damage can be severe even as the virus is being cleared, and timing of interventions that modulate immunity, such as interferon or anti-inflammatory therapy, can shift outcomes, highlighting that natural clearance does not always equate to harmless resolution [^113NbVV5] [^116HLWvU] [^114ZoYHx].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Yes, the body can naturally clear many viral infections through coordinated innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, with interferon-driven antiviral states, cytotoxic T cell killing of infected cells, and neutralizing antibodies being central, but clearance depends on virus-specific factors, host genetics and age, infection dose and route, and the quality and timing of immune responses, and some viruses persist or cause severe disease despite these defenses, necessitating medical management in those contexts [^114sUysx].

---

The body can naturally **clear many viruses** through coordinated innate and adaptive immune responses [^114sUysx], including interferons, NK cells, and virus-specific T and B cells [^114HETki]. Clearance is **not guaranteed** [^114sUysx]; some viruses evade or suppress immunity, causing chronic or latent infections (e.g. HIV, HBV, HSV, EBV) [^112mFZni]. Outcomes depend on virus type, host factors, and immune strength [^114sUysx]; most acute infections resolve spontaneously, but persistent viruses may require medical therapy or vaccination to control or prevent disease [^112gBw5B].

---

## Innate immune responses

The innate immune system provides **rapid, nonspecific defenses** that limit early viral spread [^111sxp5b] [^111JL854]:

- **Interferons (IFNs)**: Type I (α/β) and III (λ) IFNs are rapidly induced upon viral infection, establishing an antiviral state in infected and neighboring cells, inhibiting viral replication and spread [^114Un8xd] [^115z5L4Y].

- **Natural killer (NK) cells**: NK cells recognize and kill virally infected cells, particularly those with reduced MHC I expression, providing early control before adaptive immunity matures [^112oGfq3].

- **Antiviral proteins**: Constitutive and inducible antiviral proteins, such as TRIM5α [^1127Upbn] and ISG15 [^112ap8mf], directly inhibit viral replication and assembly.

---

## Adaptive immune responses

Adaptive immunity provides **specific, long-lasting protection** through **T cells**, which include CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that eliminate infected cells and CD4+ helper T cells that support CTL and B cell responses [^111v4iR5], and **B cells**, which produce virus-specific antibodies that neutralize free virions, opsonize infected cells for phagocytosis, and activate complement [^112a8Vs7].

---

## Examples of natural viral clearance

Many viral infections are **cleared spontaneously** by the immune system:

| **Virus** | **Clearance mechanism** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|
| Influenza virus | - IFN response <br/> - CTLs <br/> - Neutralizing antibodies | - Most infections resolve spontaneously [^112R9eYr] |
| SARS-CoV-2 | - IFN response <br/> - T and B cell responses | - Most infections resolve; some persist or cause severe disease [^113QmZMm] [^11537bGv] |
| Hepatitis C virus (HCV) | - Strong T cell response | - ~20–30% spontaneous clearance [^114qMyrL] |
| Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) | - T cell control | - Latent infection controlled lifelong [^114gyMtB] |

---

## Viral strategies to evade immune clearance

Viruses have evolved **sophisticated mechanisms** to evade or suppress host immunity:

- **Interferon antagonism**: Many viruses encode proteins that inhibit IFN signaling (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, influenza, HIV) [^112w2hxQ] [^11563Jd8] [^1169uXPY].

- **Antigenic variation**: Rapid mutation of surface proteins (e.g. HIV, influenza) allows viruses to escape antibody recognition [^112a8Vs7].

- **Latency**: Some viruses establish latent infections, persisting in a dormant state (e.g. HSV, EBV, HIV) [^114gyMtB] [^111WcvDE].

- **Immune suppression**: Viruses like HIV directly impair immune cells, weakening host defenses [^114L1gXV].

---

## Factors influencing natural viral clearance

Several host and viral factors determine whether **natural clearance** occurs:

- **Host genetics**: Genetic variations affect immune responses and susceptibility to chronic infection (e.g. HCV, HIV) [^114sUysx].

- **Age and health status**: Younger, healthy individuals clear infections more effectively than older or immunocompromised patients [^114rxyZm].

- **Viral load and tropism**: Higher viral loads and invasive tropism increase the risk of chronic infection and immune evasion [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of natural viral clearance

Natural clearance is **not always successful** or sufficient:

- **Chronic infections**: HIV, HBV, and HCV often persist despite immune responses, requiring antiviral therapy [^111WcvDE] [^114qMyrL].

- **Latent infections**: HSV, EBV, and CMV persist lifelong, with periodic reactivation [^114gyMtB] [^1115KHwz].

- **Severe disease**: Excessive immune responses can cause immunopathology (e.g. COVID-19 cytokine storms) [^116HLWvU].

---

## Role of medical interventions

Medical interventions are **essential** when natural immunity is insufficient:

- **Antiviral therapies**: Direct-acting antivirals (e.g. for HIV, HCV, influenza) reduce viral load and facilitate clearance [^116NFwaQ].

- **Vaccines**: Prevent infection or reduce severity by priming adaptive immunity (e.g. influenza, COVID-19) [^113sjTg7].

- **Immunomodulators**: Therapies that enhance or regulate immune responses (e.g. interferons) improve clearance in some infections [^114PueJ1].

---

The body can naturally clear many viral infections through innate and adaptive immune responses, but **clearance is not guaranteed** [^113QmZMm]. Viral evasion, host factors, and immune dysregulation can lead to chronic or severe disease, necessitating medical intervention [^112w2hxQ].

### NK cells in host responses to viral infections [^112oGfq3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphocytes that play an important role in viral clearance. NK cell responses to viral infections were originally believed to be non-specific and lacked immune memory recall responses. It is now appreciated that NK cell responses to viral infections can be specific and in some cases memory recall responses are established. Increasing evidence also illuminates the complexity of NK cell interactions with both innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we summarize the evidence for NK cell-specific memory responses to viral infections and the intricate reciprocal interactions between NK cells and other immune cells that dictate their activation and effector functions.

### The origin of COVID-19 and why It matters [^113UhL7j]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is among the deadliest infectious diseases to have emerged in recent history. As with all past pandemics, the specific mechanism of its emergence in humans remains unknown. Nevertheless, a large body of virologic, epidemiologic, veterinary, and ecologic data establishes that the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, evolved directly or indirectly from a β-coronavirus in the sarbecovirus (SARS-like virus) group that naturally infect bats and pangolins in Asia and Southeast Asia. Scientists have warned for decades that such sarbecoviruses are poised to emerge again and again, identified risk factors, and argued for enhanced pandemic prevention and control efforts. Unfortunately, few such preventive actions were taken resulting in the latest coronavirus emergence detected in late 2019 which quickly spread pandemically. The risk of similar coronavirus outbreaks in the future remains high. In addition to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, we must undertake vigorous scientific, public health, and societal actions, including significantly increased funding for basic and applied research addressing disease emergence, to prevent this tragic history from repeating itself.

### Decoding type I and III interferon signalling during viral infection [^115235Ay]. Nature Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses are central to host defence against viral infection. Despite the existence of at least 20 IFNs, there are only three known cell surface receptors. IFN signalling and viral evasion mechanisms form an immensely complex network that differs across species. In this Review, we begin by highlighting some of the advances that have been made towards understanding the complexity of differential IFN signalling inputs and outputs that contribute to antiviral defences. Next, we explore some of the ways viruses can interfere with, or circumvent, these defences. Lastly, we address the largely under-reviewed impact of IFN signalling on host tropism, and we offer perspectives on the future of research into IFN signalling complexity and viral evasion across species.

### Defining total-body AIDS-virus burden with implications for curative strategies [^111WcvDE]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

In the quest for a functional cure or the eradication of HIV infection, it is necessary to know the sizes of the reservoirs from which infection rebounds after treatment interruption. Thus, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in tissues of infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected humans. Before antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs contained > 98% of the SIV RNA + and DNA + cells. With ART, the numbers of virus (v) RNA+ cells substantially decreased but remained detectable, and their persistence was associated with relatively lower drug concentrations in LT than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ART also decreased the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA + cells, but the estimated size of the residual tissue burden of 10 8 vDNA + cells potentially containing replication-competent proviruses, along with evidence of continuing virus production in LT despite ART, indicated two important sources for rebound following treatment interruption. The large sizes of these tissue reservoirs underscore challenges in developing 'HIV cure' strategies targeting multiple sources of virus production.

Introduction

Viruses need to hijack the host cell machinery to replicate effectively; however, they must first overcome the host's defenses. The efficacy of a viral infection depends on the comparative potency of the effector molecules used by the virus and the host. A critical determinant of whether a host succumbs to or can subvert a viral infection is the speed at which the host's defenses are activated. Almost all innate immune responses require an extended sequence of actions: pathogen sensing, signal transduction, transcription, translation, protein folding, and transport to the site of action. To initiate signaling upon viral infection, host cells detect viral DNA or RNA using a set of PRRs; these include retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (RNA sensors), cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), interferon gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), and dead-box helicase 41 (DDX41) (DNA sensors).

Recognition of viral nucleic acids by PRRs triggers transduction of downstream signals mainly via adaptor proteins such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which induce expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes via autocrine or paracrine mechanisms; the products of genes (proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IFNs) inhibit viral replication and spread and induce activation of adaptive immune responses. These antiviral signaling pathways play a crucial role in achieving an optimal outcome for the host; therefore, much attention has been devoted to identifying and understanding the signaling pathways and regulatory factors involved in antiviral innate immunity(Figs. 1, 2).

Conventional posttranslational modifications such as polyubiquitination and phosphorylation, unconventional posttranslational modifications such as acetylation and methylation, and other regulatory mechanisms such as physical interactions and translocations affect the production of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines by targeting innate immune sensors and downstream signaling molecules (e.g. receptors, adaptors, enzymes, and transcription factors). These aforementioned modifications play a critical role in regulating the production of IFNs and inflammatory cytokines, which can, if production is unchecked, have deleterious effects on the host by promoting the development of autoimmune disorders, allergies, and other immunopathologies, as well as by activating and regulating the cellular status to exacerbate the severity of viral disease.

### Antiviral response in pandemic influenza viruses [^11563Jd8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Coevolution of pathogens with their hosts has resulted in the shaping of the host immune system. A major component of this system is the innate immune response, which includes all the host barriers and responses with broad specificity against pathogens. The innate immune response not only represents the first barrier against infection but also provides the appropriate signals required for the subsequent adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses to develop. The type I interferon (IFNα/β) response constitutes a critical element of the innate immune system that is particularly important in the battle against viral pathogens. Secretion of IFNα/β results in the induction of a cellular antiviral response involving the transcriptional upregulation of > 100 genes.

Despite the host's sophisticated immune system, viruses continue to successfully infect them and cause disease and, in some cases, death. The success of viruses is explained, at least in part, by the acquisition of viral genes during evolution that antagonize the host immune response. Viral-encoded IFNα/β antagonists are of particular interest, since they appear to be present in most animal viruses. We detail how influenza viruses evade the host innate immunity, with particular emphasis on the IFNα/β response, and the implications of this immune evasion in pandemic influenza.

### The importance of lytic and nonlytic immune responses in viral infections [^112bCCEV]. Trends in Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Antiviral immune effector mechanisms can be divided broadly into lytic and nonlytic components. We use mathematical models to investigate the fundamental question of which type of response is required to combat different types of viral infection. According to our model, the relative roles of the two types of component depend on the cytopathicity of the virus relative to its rate of replication. If the viral cytopathicity is low relative to the rate of viral replication, the model predicts that a combination of lytic and nonlytic effector mechanisms is likely to be required to resolve the disease, particularly if the virus replicates at a fast rate. By contrast, if viral cytopathicity is high relative to the replication rate of the virus, then lytic and nonlytic mechanisms can, in principle, resolve the infection independently. We discuss our findings in the context of specific viral infections and use our model to interpret empirical data.

### Defensins in innate antiviral immunity [^117NhztS]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2006). Medium credibility.

Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides that are produced by leukocytes and epithelial cells, and that have an important role in innate immunity. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of the antiviral action(s) of defensins indicate that they have a dual role in antiviral defence, acting directly on the virion and on the host cell. This Review focuses on the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of mammalian defensins, and on the clinical relevance of these activities. Understanding the complex function of defensins in innate immunity against viral infection has implications for the prevention and treatment of viral disease.

### Global screening for human viral pathogens [^111YV12H]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Remaining Challenges

Recovering viruses from large pools of human serum and plasma and routinely cloning and sequencing the viral nucleic acids (using established shotgun approaches) appears technically feasible. Consequently, the titers of many known human viral pathogens may be estimated routinely, and new viruses (both pathogenic and nonpathogenic) may be discovered systematically.

The initial choice is between filtration and centrifugation. Seawater contains little contaminating material of the size and density of the virus particles, filtration is simple and efficient, and no free nucleic acids have been reported. Plasma and serum present different problems, complicated by the presence of large amounts of protein, some nonviral particles in the virus window, and variable amounts of soluble nonviral nucleic acids that must be eliminated. An advantage of centrifugal methods is that all separations, down to banding in microliter gradients, can be (and have been) done with the virions in suspension, a process that avoids aggregation that may occur on filter surfaces.

Several key questions remain to be addressed in a practical project: 1) Can this process be carried out rapidly enough to support a timely therapeutic or prophylactic response to a new agent (natural or engineered)? 2) Will the novel virions that originated from one or a very few infected persons be recovered and detected? 3) Can the affected persons be located?

### The cytoplasmic body component TRIM5alpha restricts HIV-1 infection in old world monkeys [^1127Upbn]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Host cell barriers to the early phase of immunodeficiency virus replication explain the current distribution of these viruses among human and non-human primate species. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, efficiently enters the cells of Old World monkeys but encounters a block before reverse transcription. This species-specific restriction acts on the incoming HIV-1 capsid and is mediated by a dominant repressive factor. Here we identify TRIM5alpha, a component of cytoplasmic bodies, as the blocking factor. HIV-1 infection is restricted more efficiently by rhesus monkey TRIM5alpha than by human TRIM5alpha. The simian immunodeficiency virus, which naturally infects Old World monkeys, is less susceptible to the TRIM5alpha-mediated block than is HIV-1, and this difference in susceptibility is due to the viral capsid. The early block to HIV-1 infection in monkey cells is relieved by interference with TRIM5alpha expression. Our studies identify TRIM5alpha as a species-specific mediator of innate cellular resistance to HIV-1 and reveal host cell components that modulate the uncoating of a retroviral capsid.

### Novel paradigms of innate immune sensing of viral infections [^116EoXgo]. Cytokine (2013). Low credibility.

According to the existing paradigm, cellular recognition of viral infection is mediated by molecular patterns within the virus particle or produced during virus replication. However, there are various physical cellular changes indicative of infection that could also trigger innate antiviral responses. The type-I interferon response is rapidly engaged to limit viral infection and a number of studies have shown that the interferon response, or components of it, are induced by general perturbations to cellular processes. Virus entry requires membrane and cytoskeletal perturbation, and both membrane fusion or actin depolymerising agents alone are able to activate antiviral genes. Viruses cause cellular stress and change the cellular environment, and oxidative stress or endoplasmic reticulum stress will amplify antiviral signaling. Many of these responses converge on interferon regulatory factor 3, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in determining the degree to which the cell responds. This review highlights novel paradigms of viral recognition and speculates that viral infection is sensed as a danger signal.

### The virome in host health and disease [^116gVA7U]. Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

The mammalian virome includes diverse commensal and pathogenic viruses that evoke a broad range of immune responses from the host. Sustained viral immunomodulation is implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases, but also confers unexpected benefits to the host. These outcomes of viral infections are often dependent on host genotype. Moreover, it is becoming clear that the virome is part of a dynamic network of microorganisms that inhabit the body. Therefore, viruses can be viewed as a component of the microbiome, and interactions with commensal bacteria and other microbial agents influence their behavior. This piece is a review of our current understanding of how the virome, together with other components of the microbiome, affects the function of the host immune system to regulate health and disease.

### The pathogenesis and treatment of the '' in COVID-19 [^116HLWvU]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli. The pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex. The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high. Certain evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the cytokine storm in their bodies. This article reviews the occurrence mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment.

### The battle between host and SARS-CoV-2: innate immunity and viral evasion strategies [^113ygVvg]. Molecular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen causing COVID-19, has caused more than 200 million confirmed cases, resulting in more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide by the end of August, 2021. Upon detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), multiple signaling cascades are activated, which ultimately leads to innate immune response such as induction of type I and III interferons, as well as other antiviral genes that together restrict viral spread by suppressing different steps of the viral life cycle. Our understanding of the contribution of the innate immune system in recognizing and subsequently initiating a host response to an invasion of SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly expanding from 2020. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved multiple immune evasion strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we will address the current knowledge of innate immunity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades a host's innate defense system.

### Innate antiviral immunity: how prior exposures can guide future responses [^112SKKpL]. Trends in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Innate immunity is an intrinsic baseline defense in cells, with its earliest origins in bacteria, and with key roles in defense against pathogens and in the activation of B and T cell responses. In mammals, the efficacy of innate immunity in initiating the cascades that lead to pathogen control results from the interplay of transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic responses regulating immune activation and long-lived pathogen-specific memory responses. Recent studies suggest that intrinsic innate immunity is modulated by individual exposure histories - prior infections, vaccinations, and metabolites of microbial origin - and this promotes, or impairs, the development of efficacious innate immune responses. Understanding how environmental factors regulate innate immunity and boost protection from infection or response to vaccination could be a valuable tool for pandemic preparedness.

### Inducing broad-based immunity against viruses with pandemic potential [^115cRtxo]. Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

The brutal toll of another viral pandemic can be blunted by investing now in research that uncovers mechanisms of broad-based immunity so we may have vaccines and therapeutics at the ready. We do not know exactly what pathogen may trigger the next wave or next pandemic. We do know, however, that the human immune system must respond and must be bolstered with effective vaccines and other therapeutics to preserve lives and livelihoods. These countermeasures must focus on features conserved among families of pathogens in order to be responsive against something yet to emerge. Here, we focus on immunological approaches to mitigate the impact of the next emerging virus pandemic by developing vaccines that elicit both broadly protective antibodies and T cells. Identifying human immune mechanisms of broad protection against virus families with pandemic potential will be our best defense for humanity in the future.

### History of oncolytic viruses: genesis to genetic engineering [^116wCQtK]. Molecular Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Since the turn of the nineteenth century, when their existence was first recognized, viruses have attracted considerable interest as possible agents of tumor destruction. Early case reports emphasized regression of cancers during naturally acquired virus infections, providing the basis for clinical trials where body fluids containing human or animal viruses were used to transmit infections to cancer patients. Most often the viruses were arrested by the host immune system and failed to impact tumor growth, but sometimes, in immunosuppressed patients, infection persisted and tumors regressed, although morbidity as a result of the infection of normal tissues was unacceptable. With the advent of rodent models and new methods for virus propagation, there were numerous attempts through the 1950s and 1960s to force the evolution of viruses with greater tumor specificity, but success was limited and many researchers abandoned the field. Technology employing reverse genetics later brought about a renewal of interest in virotherapy that allowed the generation of more potent, tumor-specific oncolytics. Here, examination of early oncolytic virotherapy before genetic engineering serves to highlight tremendous advances, yet also hints at ways to penetrate host immune defenses, a significant remaining challenge in modern virotherapy research.

### Explaining how vaccines work… [^115vckvC]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Vaccines work by imitating an infection to engage the body's natural defenses.
- Vaccines help the body learn how to defend itself from disease without the dangers of a full-blown infection.
- Everyone should get all recommended vaccines at the recommended times. Vaccines work by imitating an infection Vaccines work by imitating an infection — the presence of a disease-causing organism in the body — to engage the body's natural defenses. The active ingredient in all vaccines is an antigen, the name for any substance that causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies. In a vaccine, the antigen could be either
- Weakened or killed bacteria or viruses
- Bits of their exterior surface or genetic material, or
- Bacterial toxin treated to make it non-toxic. How does your body fight an infection. Antibodies are proteins produced by white blood cells to identify and neutralize foreign substances.

White blood cells are created in the bone marrow but dispersed throughout the body in low numbers, ready to begin multiplying and attacking microbes and substances not native to the body. After they have eliminated an infection, white blood cells stop multiplying and their numbers dwindle until only a few are left to keep watch. At that point, a person is considered immunized. Can you still get infected after being vaccinated. Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination. Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected. But a vaccinated person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection. Vaccines strengthen the body's natural defenses To be immune is to be partially or fully resistant to a specific infectious disease or disease-causing organism.

A person who is immune can resist the bacteria or viruses that cause a disease, but the protection is never perfect. Immunization is the process of being made resistant to an infectious disease, usually by means of a vaccine. Either way, active immunity takes longer to develop but lasts longer than passive immunity. Passive immunity is provided by antibodies produced by another human being or animal.
- Full-term babies acquire passive immunity from their mother's antibodies during the final months of pregnancy.
- Patients can acquire passive immunity through antibody-containing blood products derived from human or animal sources. Passive immunity provides protection that is immediate but fades within weeks or months.

### Human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis and prospects for immune control in patients with established infection [^114L1gXV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in inevitable progressive deterioration of the immune system in the majority of untreated patients. Prospects for virus eradication are remote, because HIV establishes long-lived reservoirs during the earliest stages of infection that are impervious to available antiviral therapies. Understanding how the immune system copes with this illness and other chronic viral infections is the key to designing future strategies for long-term control of viremia. Valuable insights have been gained from 2 populations in particular: patients with chronic, long-term, nonprogressing infections, in whom viremia is controllable in the absence of antiviral medications, and acutely infected patients, in whom the initial HIV-specific immune response might be preserved and augmented by timely intervention. These cases of immune control of HIV provide hope for the development of improved vaccine products that may eventually produce vaccine-induced immunity that will enhance durable control of HIV infection.

### A broadly neutralizing antibody recognizes a unique epitope with a signature motif common across coronaviruses [^114ZhAo6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The development of potent therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with broad neutralizing capacity has become a critical priority in combating RNA viruses, given their rapid antigenic evolution and persistent emergence of pathogenic variants. Antibodies produced in the body as a natural immune response are triggered by infections or vaccinations. The identification of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAb) that recognize cross-reactive epitopes (CRE) and tolerate diversity within core epitopes against HIV or Influenza has sparked increased interest in exploring common epitopes and vulnerabilities –. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of CREs in the natural immune response against coronaviruses from all genera –.

The synthetic immune system, utilizing combinatorial antibody library technology, comprises 10 11 diverse human antibody sequences and encompasses a comprehensive "fossil record" of adaptive and spontaneous humoral immune responses from the community. The diversity of the synthetic immune system is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the natural B-cell repertoire of an individual. The chemical nature and vast diversity of this synthetic system enable rapid screening (or evolution) within minutes to hours, in contrast to the days to years required for antibodies to adapt within a natural immune system. Additionally, the community "fossil records", inherited by a synthetic immune system, ensure comprehensive coverage of rare and specialized antibodies, including cross-reactive antibodies, and provide retrospective tracing of immunological imprinting –.

Pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoV), including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, along with HIV and Marburg virus, belong to a super-family of viruses that encode Class I enveloped glycoproteins. These viruses pose serious threats to global public health –. One prominent feature of Class I viral fusion machinery is the trimeric glycoprotein displaying on virion surface, as observed in coronaviruses, retroviruses, filoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses. This trimeric structure is crucial for membrane fusion, which forms an intermediate structure that exposes three heptad repeat 1 domains (HR1) required for progression to the six-helix bundle (6-HB) after receptor-binding –. Subsequently, three α-helices of the heptad repeat 2 domain (HR2) pack antiparallel into the grooves of the coiled-coil of trimeric HR1s. The functionally and structurally conserved intermediate, often referred to as the "pre-hairpin intermediate", is the target of peptidomimetic or small molecule inhibitors, as well as various antibodies –.

### Innate antiviral defenses independent of inducible IFN α / β production [^117PSqqW]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The type I interferons (IFNs) (IFNα and IFNβ) not only have potent antiviral activities, but also have pathological functions if produced at high levels or over a long time. Recent articles have described antiviral immune mechanisms that are activated in response to virus infection at epithelial surfaces independently of IFNα and IFNβ. This may allow the host to exert rapid local antiviral activity and only induce a full-blown, and potentially pathological, type I IFN response in situations where stronger protective immunity is needed. Here, I describe the emerging understanding of early antiviral defenses, which are independent of type I IFN responses, and also discuss how this enables tissues to exert rapid antiviral activities and to limit type I IFN production.

### African swine fever virus pF778R attenuates type I interferon response by impeding STAT1 nuclear translocation [^1151vQ1A]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Type I IFN represents the most effective mechanism through which the host exerts innate immunity against viral infections. Upon viral infection, the body produces interferon (IFN), which activates the JAK/STAT signaling cascade and induces the expression of hundreds of ISGs to combat the infection. This constitutes the first line of defense against viral infections. Many viruses have developed strategies to evade host immune defenses and ensure their proliferation by inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway at various stages. ASFV is an immunosuppressive virus that primarily targets host macrophages. Increasing evidence suggests that various ASFV-encoded proteins participate in evading the host's innate immunity. For example, MGF505–7R, which is produced by ASFV, can hinder the body's natural immune response through the JAK/STAT pathway. It does this by degrading JAK1 and inhibiting ISGF3 through upregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF125 and interacting with IRF9, respectively. MGF360–9 L interacts with and degrades STAT1 and STAT2 via the apoptosis and proteasome pathways. pS273R and pA104R lead to the degradation of STAT2 and attenuation of STAT1 phosphorylation, respectively. pI215L triggers the degradation of IRF9 and STAT2 through autophagy-lysosome and proteasome pathways, respectively.

### Respiratory viral infections: knowledge based therapeutics [^114rxyZm]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Lung viral infections continue to kill millions of people worldwide. Virus-specific properties, replication kinetics and longevity affect the subsequent vigour of innate and adaptive immunity, which contribute to clinical manifestations. The point at which lung innate immunity activates is different between individuals and is determined by age, genetics, underlying conditions and infection history. On resolution of virus-induced lung disease an 'altered state of homeostasis' exists that in turn affects the next antigenic challenge. The last two years has produced a plethora of studies on the resolution of inflammatory lung disease; highlighting potential for immune modulation. In the future a more precise etiological diagnosis, combined with a knowledge of co-morbidities and an immune signature will lead to the development of more specifically targeted therapeutics.

### About Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) | EBV and mono… [^114gyMtB]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- EBV is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads through bodily fluids, primarily saliva.
- EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses.
- There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. What it is Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family. Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. About mononucleosis. Who is at risk After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.

How it spreads You can spread the virus for weeks. EBV is most commonly spread through saliva by:

- Kissing
- Sharing drinks and food
- Sharing drinking cups, eating utensils, or toothbrushes
- Having contact with toys that children have drooled on The virus probably survives on an object at least as long as the object remains moist. EBV can also spread through blood and semen during sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantations. Testing and diagnosis Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus. Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV.

However, some things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever.

### Organ system view of the hepatic innate immunity in HCV infection [^114qMyrL]. Journal of Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

An orchestration of innate and adaptive immunity determines the infection outcome and whether the host achieves clearance or allows the pathogen to establish persistent infection. The robust activation of the innate immune response plays the most critical role in both limiting viral replication and halting the spread of the pathogen immediately after infection. The magnitude of innate immune activation is coupled with the efficient mounting of the adaptive immunity. Although immunity against HCV infection is known to be inadequate as most cases transitions to chronicity, approximately 25% of acute infection cases result in spontaneous clearance. The exact immune mechanisms that govern the infection outcome remain largely unknown; recent discoveries suggest that the innate immune system facilitates this event. Both infected hepatocytes and local innate immune cells trigger the front line defense program of the liver as well as the recruitment of diverse adaptive immune cells to the site of infection. Although hepatocyte is the target of HCV infection, nearly all cell types that exist in the liver are involved in the innate defense and contribute to the pathophysiology of hepatic inflammation. The main focus of this comprehensive review is to discuss the current knowledge on how each hepatic cell type contributes to the organ system level innate immunity against HCV infection as well as interplays with the viral evasion program. Furthermore, this review article also aims to synchronize the observations from both molecular biological studies and clinical studies with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of HCV mediated hepatitis.

Malignancies that arise as a result of viral infection account for roughly 15% of cancer cases worldwide. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against oncogenic viral infection and is also involved in the response against viral-driven tumors. In this review, we discuss research advances made over the last five years elucidating how the innate immune system recognizes and responds to oncogenic viruses, how these viruses have evolved to escape this immune pressure, and ways that innate immunity can inform the development of novel therapeutics against oncogenic viral infection and their associated cancers.

### Immune responses to viral gene therapy vectors [^111JL854]. Molecular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview of Immune Responses to Viral Vectors

The immune system is comprised of a complex interwoven network of multiple different cell types that collaborate to protect host tissues from further infection and mobilize a cadre of effectors tailored to specifically eliminate the invading pathogen. The cellular network can be generally broken up into innate and adaptive arms. Innate immune responses occur early, are not antigen specific, and do not result in immunological memory. Adaptive immune responses are conditioned by the inflammatory environment created by innate immune sensing, rely on activation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific (effector) B and T cell differentiation, and generate immunological memory. Viral vectors share many commonalities with natural viruses but are distinctly different in that they are non-replicative, delivered in a single high-titer bolus, and introduced at an unnatural site. So, although canonical immunological concepts can be applied, the unwanted immune response to viral vectors also has inherently unique aspects. Vector particles containing viral proteins that are identical or similar to antigens that humans are exposed to as a result of natural infection may be neutralized by antibodies upon injection into in some humans because of pre-existing immunity. Recognition of viral structures (e.g. capsids or nucleic acids) by innate immune sensors may cause tissue infiltration by innate immune cells, may trigger the production of interferon (IFN)-α/β (type 1 IFN, hereafter abbreviated as T1 IFN), thereby inducing an antiviral state in the tissue and reducing transduction, and provides an activation signal for adaptive immune responses. Activation of, and subsequent antigen presentation by, dendritic cells (DCs) is a critical step in linking innate to adaptive immunity, leading to activation/differentiation and expansion of T cells. While major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (MHC I)-restricted CD8 + T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) are capable of lysing virally infected cells, MHC class II (MHC II)-restricted CD4 + T cells provide help for optimal CD8 + T cell activation and for B cell activation, leading to antibody formation. T helper (Th) cells are also critical for generation of memory responses.

### Innate immune sensing of coronavirus and viral evasion strategies [^112gPYLP]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Protecting the 'self' from the 'non-self' is essential for maintaining life. Therefore, distinguishing between self and non-self is critical. In living organisms, the invasion of harmful factors can be recognized and protected against by two systems: biological barriers, such as skin and mucous membranes, and host immunity. In some organisms, including humans, the latter can be further divided into innate and acquired immunity. Innate immunity, along with biological barriers, constitutes the first line of defense against pathogen infection. Activation of the innate immune system is initiated by the recognition of harmful factors, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), through germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Activated PRRs rapidly trigger multiple host defense programs to protect against harmful invaders, such as viruses. Therefore, the innate immune system is frequently targeted by pathogens for immune evasion. Dysregulation or imbalance of innate immune responses induced by pathogens often leads to the onset of various diseases.

Pathogenesis and treatment options for‐19

Initially, SARS‐CoV‐2 may either pass through the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, primarily the nasal and pharyngeal epithelia, or directly enter the lower respiratory tract and infect bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. The main symptoms of respiratory infection are fever and cough. In this initial phase, the virus can enter the peripheral bloodstream via the lungs and this may result in viraemia. The virus may then proceed to affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as the heart and blood vessels, the kidneys, and the GI tract. However, the GI tract may also be directly infected by the oral route. Patients with an increased risk of developing severe disease may experience severe pulmonary involvement resulting in systemic inflammation. The massive inflammatory process at that time results in a severe cytokine storm also affecting other organs in the body. This seemingly occurs in line with other blood‐derived viruses entering organs via ACE2 on activated endothelium causing, for example, renal or GI problems. In the vasculature, this coincides with red blood cell aggregation and thrombosis. The clinical phase progresses from the initial viraemia to an acute phase (pneumonia), followed by either recovery or severe disease (including ARDS, AKI, and eventually multi‐organ failure) requiring ICU admission. The distinction would depend on patient comorbidity, obesity‐induced pre‐existent inflammation, immune function, and ACE/ACE2 balance in already affected organs. Each phase demands its own treatment regimen ranging from virus entry and replication inhibition in the initial phase to anti‐inflammatory and anti‐thrombotic medication at later stages. In the following paragraphs, we aim to highlight some of the most commonly advocated treatment strategies being explored to combat COVID‐19.

### The yin and Yang of viruses and interferons [^116wHf2E]. Trends in Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Interferons (IFNs)-α/β are critical effectors of the innate immune response to virus infections. Through activation of the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), they induce expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins capable of suppressing viral replication and promoting viral clearance. Many highly pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade an IFN response and the balance between the robustness of the host immune response and viral antagonistic mechanisms determines whether or not the virus is cleared. Here, we discuss IFNs as broad-spectrum antivirals for treatment of acute virus infections. In particular, they are useful for treatment of re-emerging virus infections, where direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have limited utility due to DAA-resistant mutations, and for newly emerging virus strains in which the time to vaccine availability precludes vaccination at the onset of an outbreak.

### Innate immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 [^112w2hxQ]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has been associated with substantial global morbidity and mortality. Despite a tropism that is largely confined to the airways, COVID-19 is associated with multiorgan dysfunction and long-term cognitive pathologies. A major driver of this biology stems from the combined effects of virus-mediated interference with the host antiviral defences in infected cells and the sensing of pathogen-associated material by bystander cells. Such a dynamic results in delayed induction of type I and III interferons (IFN-I and IFN-III) at the site of infection, but systemic IFN-I and IFN-III priming in distal organs and barrier epithelial surfaces, respectively. In this Review, we examine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 biology and the cellular response to infection, detailing how antagonism and dysregulation of host innate immune defences contribute to disease severity of COVID-19.

### Mathematical assessment of the effect of traditional beliefs and customs on the transmission dynamics of the 2014 Ebola outbreaks [^116wbA5k]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The natural reservoir and host of the EBOV is considered (albeit not yet proven) to be fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family. It is hypothesized that the virus is introduced into the human population when a human comes into contact with the blood, organ secretions or bodily fluids of an animal infected with the EBOV. The incubation period of EBOV is between 2 and 21 days (although some studies have estimated the most common incubation period to be 8 to 10 days). During the incubation period, the virus infects body cells, replicates and bursts out of the infected cells, producing EBOV glycoproteins that attach to the inside of blood vessels, rendering the blood vessels to be more permeable. The increased permeability causes the blood vessels to leak out blood. The virus also evades the host's natural defense system, by infecting immune cells, a channel through which it is transported to other body parts and organs, such as the liver, spleen, kidney and brain. The virus can cause these organs to fail, leading to death of the infected human host.

Ebola-infected humans typically exhibit flu-like symptoms during the initial phase of the infection, and can have, or progress to, other symptoms such as fever, severe headache, muscle aches, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pains, loss of appetite and, at times, bleeding (which may be visible or internal). An infected human is infectious (i.e. capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible individuals) at the onset of symptoms. Transmission typically occurs when a susceptible human comes into contact with virus-infected fluids, such as blood, bodily secretions (e.g. feces, saliva, vomit, urine, semen and sweat), organs or bodily fluids of an infected human (dead or alive). Contact with such fluids may be as a result of direct contact between susceptible and infected humans, or due to indirect contact with environments contaminated with the aforementioned fluids. Individuals with high risk of exposure to EBOV are the immediate family members of Ebola-infected humans and health-care workers who treat Ebola-infected patients.

### Systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics to model response to antiviral therapies [^116NFwaQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Finding antivirals that target severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) will be crucial in managing the ongoing pandemic. In addition to the development of novel agents, substantial efforts are underway to establish whether currently available agents may be repurposed. A key biomarker for clinical antiviral activity is viral load in bodily fluids and assessing a drug's or drug combination's ability to reduce viral load is an important first step in identifying therapies that influence clinical outcome.

To correctly assess antiviral activity, it is first necessary to understand viral load natural history. As a rapidly progressing, primarily respiratory viral infection, SARS‐CoV‐2 elimination from the body seems to be mainly driven by a combination of innate immune response and exhaustion of target cells available for infection. Observational cohort studies published to date have shown that the rate of viral load decline seems slower in older patients, those with more severe disease, and those with comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression. Interpreting these observational studies requires caution because patients have often received antiviral therapies. Due to the timepoint of initial infection being unknown, assessing viral load in response to treatment must account for time since symptom onset.

Since February 2020, case reports and case series of patient‐level viral dynamics have been published, some of which report dosing of antiviral drugs. Clinical trials of antivirals and their association with viral load are also beginning to read out. Meanwhile, large pragmatic trials of repurposed monotherapy antivirals have yet to find a clearly effective agent. At this crucial juncture, it is vital to develop a pharmacodynamic modeling framework that can be used to describe the natural history of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral dynamics, make initial estimates on antiviral efficacy of agents used to date, and to design and evaluate phase II trials using viral load as a biomarker.

This systematic review therefore aimed to search for case reports, case series, and clinical trials reporting serial individual patient‐level SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load measurements in humans from any sampling site upon which an individual patient‐level meta‐analysis was then performed. A nonlinear mixed‐effects (NLME) viral dynamic model was fitted to describe the viral trajectories in each sampling site and to give a quantitative measure of viral dynamics. In data of sufficient quality, the parameters of multivariable Cox proportional hazards (Cox‐PH) regression models of time to viral clearance, and NLME models of antiviral efficacy were estimated.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and congenital CMV infection… [^1115KHwz]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cytomegalovirus is a common virus found in people of all ages.
- A healthy person's immune system usually keeps the virus from causing illness.
- Some babies born with CMV can have health problems at birth or that develop later. What it is CMV is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly 1 in 3 children is already infected with CMV by age 5. Over half of adults have been infected with CMV by age
40. Once CMV is in a person's body, it stays there for life and can reactivate. A person can also be re-infected with a different strain of the virus. Signs and symptoms Most people with CMV show no signs or symptoms and aren't aware that they have been infected. In healthy people Sometimes, infection in healthy people can cause mild illness like:

- Fever
- Sore throat
- Fatigue
- Swollen glands Occasionally, CMV can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis.

How it spreads People with CMV can pass the virus through body fluids, such as saliva, urine, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. An infected person can spread CMV:
- From direct contact with saliva or urine, especially from babies and young children
- Through sexual contact
- From breast milk to nursing infants
- Through transplanted organs and blood transfusions
- During pregnancy. Prevention You can lower your chances of getting CMV by reducing contact with saliva and urine from babies and young children. Make sure you:

- Do not share food, utensils, cups, or pacifiers with a child.
- Wash your hands with soap and water after changing diapers or helping a child to use the toilet. Treatment and recovery Healthy people who are infected with CMV usually do not require medical treatment. Medications called antivirals are available to treat:

- CMV infection in people who have weakened immune systems.
- Babies with signs of congenital CMV at birth.

Valganciclovir is an antiviral that might improve hearing and developmental outcomes in babies. It can have serious side effects and has only been studied in babies with signs of congenital CMV infection. There is limited information on the effectiveness of valganciclovir to treat infants with hearing loss alone.

### SARS-CoV-2 mediated dysregulation in cell signaling events drives the severity of COVID-19 [^114FUkqG]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A balance in immune response against an unfamiliar pathogen is crucial to eliminate the infection. A cascade of cell signaling events is immediately activated upon sensing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by cellular toll like receptors in a natural host response manner against the invading virus. The ultimate aim of such innate immune signaling pathways is to provide a required level of protection to our bodies by interfering with the invader. However, if there is any loss in such balance, an impairment in immune system emerge that fails to control the regulated transcription and translation of signaling components. Consequently, excessive level of proinflammatory mediators release into the circulatory systems that ultimately cause "cytokine storm" and COVID-19 pathological syndromes. The limited production of interferons (IFNs), while excessive yield of pro-inflammatory cytokines followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests an abnormal cell signaling event and explains the reasons of increased immunopathology and severity in COVID-19.

### Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 induced by infection or vaccination [^11537bGv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibodies (Abs) are produced by B cells in response to viral infection or vaccination. As key effector molecules capable of binding unprocessed antigen, they provide a first line of defense against subsequent exposures. In addition to the robust Ab responses produced by short‐lived plasma cells during an acute infection, lower levels of pathogen‐specific Abs are constitutively produced by long‐lived plasma cells in the bone marrow, providing serological memory for years after the pathogen has been cleared.

As secreted soluble proteins, the measurement of Abs in blood is amenable to scalable diagnostics aimed at determining responses to past infections and vaccines. Indeed, most viral infections and vaccines provide protection against re‐infection through the induction of neutralizing Abs that bind viral surface structures and block virus entry into target cells. During natural infection, CD8 + T cells play an important complementary role to contain the infection through their ability to eliminate already infected cells, while CD4 + helper T cells, amongst other functions, provide signals that support the development of Ab responses. Knowledge about quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Ab response to SARS‐CoV‐2, including durability and epitope specificities of the response is central to our understanding of anti‐viral immunity and offers information that can guide public health and clinical measures.

Since the virus emerged in late 2019, much effort has been directed to the characterization of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 with the aim to understand the roles of different immune functions in viral clearance. As in other viral infections, T and B cells work in concert alongside the instructive innate immune system to control SARS‐CoV‐2, with the adaptive arms displaying distinct response kinetics, mode of antigen recognition, effector functions and immunological memory, often consistent with textbook knowledge. As the vast majority of SARS‐CoV‐2 cases result in asymptomatic or mild disease (with elderly cases developing disease more frequently), our immune system generally responds appropriately, with diverse myeloid, lymphoid and non‐hematopoietic lineages contributing to host defense and viral clearance. However, longer‐term consequences of COVID‐19, such as potentially auto‐reactive antibodies and persistent fatigue in post‐acute COVID‐19 syndrome, or 'Long Covid', affect a subset of individuals, requiring further investigation.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The story behind the virus with the crown

Coronaviruses belong to a large group of related viruses, named coronavirus family, which can infect humans and animals and lead to diseases of the airways, the gut, liver, and the nervous system. Some members of coronavirus family may infect the upper airways with rather mild courses, and others — as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 — may affect the lower respiratory airways with pneumonia and fatal courses (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Human coronaviruses

Belonging to the β‐coronavirus genus, SARS‐CoV‐2 is the pathogen that causes the new infectious respiratory disease, termed as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19), which was reported to have emerged in December 2019, in Wuhan (Hubei province, China), first (or supposedly even earlier) and turned rapidly to be a global pandemic.SARS‐CoV‐2 displays 79% nucleotide identity with SARS‐CoV and 51.8% nucleotide identity with MERS‐CoV, but most importantly shares 96% identity across the entire genome with a bat coronavirus, which is supposed to be the natural origin of SARS‐CoV‐2.

### Influenza virus still surprises [^1156o2Ji]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Influenza virus remains a major public heath concern, both in its annual toll in death and debilitation and its potential to cause devastating pandemics. A number of recent surprising discoveries emphasize how little we know about influenza virus and its interaction with its hosts. These include the description of a novel viral protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame, the demonstration that the most abundant viral non-structural protein interferes with the induction of interferons by infected cells, and the finding that natural killer cells express activating receptors that detect viral cell-surface proteins. The introduction of improved methods for genetically manipulating influenza virus promises to revolutionize our understanding of viral replication and its interaction with the host innate and acquired immune systems, and will also enable the improvement of vaccines. Using knowledge of viral sequences recovered from archived or interred tissues from victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic, it is now possible to investigate why this virus was so pathogenic - it killed more than 20000000 people, most of whom were young adults in the prime of their lives.

### Mechanisms of inhibition of the host interferon alpha / β-mediated antiviral responses by viruses [^1169uXPY]. Microbes and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Complex multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to prevent and control infection by pathogens. Among these mechanisms, the type I interferon or interferon alpha/beta system represents one of the first lines of defense against viral infections. Typically, viral infection induces the synthesis and secretion of interferon alpha/beta by the infected cell, which in turn activates signaling pathways leading to an antiviral state. As a counter measure, many viruses have developed intriguing mechanisms to evade the interferon alpha/beta system of the host. In this review, we will summarize recent research developments in this interesting field of virus-host cell interactions.

The B cell response to SARS‐COV‐2

Our immune response to viral infections engages functions that combat the invading pathogen in a stepwise manner (Fig. 1). First, the innate immune system is engaged, which recognizes and eliminates foreign viral material and activates a signaling cascade that limits the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. The innate immune system may do a substantial part of the work to contain SARS‐CoV‐2 in some cases, such as asymptomatic or mild infections in children and young adults, although this is difficult to demonstrate empirically.

Fig. 1
(a) Kinetics of innate and adaptive immune responses following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Following rapid action by the innate immune system immediately after virus exposure, B and T cell responses develop within the first weeks. Short‐lived IgM antibodies are produced by responding B cells initially and is followed by a more persistent and high‐affinity class‐switched response. (b) Production of highly diverse virus‐specific antibodies. After cognate antigen encounter, activated naïve B cells enter the germinal center (GC) where they receive T cell help to generate a high‐affinity antibody repertoire. Short‐lived peripheral plasma cells produce most antibodies during the infection, while GC‐derived memory B cells and bone marrow‐resident plasma cells cooperate to provide long‐lasting protection against re‐infection. (c) Maturation of the antibody response following viral clearance. While the magnitude of the antibody response gradually wanes after the virus replication is controlled, the quality of the B cell response continues to improve for several months following the infection

### Viral infection of the lung: host response and sequelae [^116XXa34]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Because of its essential role in gas exchange and oxygen delivery, the lung has evolved a variety of strategies to control inflammation and maintain homeostasis. Invasion of the lung by pathogens (and in some instances exposure to certain noninfectious particulates) disrupts this equilibrium and triggers a cascade of events aimed at preventing or limiting colonization (and more importantly infection) by pathogenic microorganisms. In this review we focus on viral infection of the lung and summarize recent advances in our understanding of the triggering of innate and adaptive immune responses to viral respiratory tract infection, mechanisms of viral clearance, and the well-recognized consequences of acute viral infection complicating underlying lung diseases, such as asthma.

Introductory comments

The immune system becomes vital once an individual is exposed to an infectious agent. However, the nature of infectious agents varies and so different approaches are required by the immune system to deal with different types of infectious agent. These different approaches follow similar general strategies, which aim to seek out and destroy, but the precise immune mechanisms involved can differ. For example, most bacteria do not invade host cells and remain accessible to the host's immune system; often these bacteria will be engulfed by innate phagocytic cells (typically neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells), killed within intracellular phagocytic vacuoles and then digested. Remnants of the digested bacteria (antigens) can then be displayed via major histocompatibility class (MHC) II on the surface of the phagocyte. These antigens are recognised by antigen-specific CD4 + helper T lymphocytes and this triggers the acquired (also called adaptive) immune response to the bacteria, which involves the orchestrating T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes (which produce antigen-specific antibodies) and the further activation of innate immune cells. This response to extracellular bacteria is clearly targeted at killing those bacteria. Viruses (and some bacteria) invade host cells rather than remaining exclusively extracellular; this can trigger presentation of antigens via MHC I on the surface of the infected cells. Recognition of these antigens by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes results in killing of the host cell that is presenting the antigen. Natural killer cells also recognise virally infected cells and act in an analogous way to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by killing the infected cells. Thus, this response to virally infected cells is targeted at killing the host cells that harbour viruses. Killing host cells of course liberates viruses and the battle between host immune cells and virally infected cells continues.

There are four general functions of the immune system that enable effective host defence:

Creating a barrier to prevent pathogens from entering the body.
Identifying pathogens if they breech a barrier.
Eliminating pathogens.
Generating an immunological memory.

Barrier function

The barrier function of the immune system acts to prevent pathogens from entering the body from the external environment. This includes physical barriers like the skin and mucosal layers (gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, genitourinary tract); chemical barriers like the acid pH of the stomach; and biological barriers like the presence of commensal organisms on the skin and in the intestinal tract, secretions like IgA and antimicrobial proteins in saliva and tears, and the complement system.

### COVID-19 vaccine basics… [^113sjTg7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of "memory" T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal signs the body is building immunity. mRNA vaccines To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This immune response, which produces antibodies, is what helps protect us from getting sick from that germ in the future.

How mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work
- First, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle or upper thigh, depending on the age of who is getting vaccinated.
- After vaccination, the mRNA will enter the muscle cells. Once inside, they use the cells' machinery to produce a harmless piece of what is called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After the protein piece is made, our cells break down the mRNA and remove it, leaving the body as waste.
- Next, our cells display the spike protein piece on their surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein does not belong there. This triggers our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19. How protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work
- Protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle.

After vaccination, nearby cells pick up these proteins.
- Next, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.

### Innate immunity and interferon in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome [^114Un8xd]. Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

Innate immunity and the actions of type I and III interferons (IFNs) are essential for protection from SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Each is induced in response to infection and serves to restrict viral replication and spread while directing the polarization and modulation of the adaptive immune response. Owing to the distribution of their specific receptors, type I and III IFNs, respectively, impart systemic and local actions. Therapeutic IFN has been administered to combat COVID-19 but with differential outcomes when given early or late in infection. In this perspective, we sort out the role of innate immunity and complex actions of IFNs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. We conclude that IFNs are a beneficial component of innate immunity that has mediated natural clearance of infection in over 700 million people. Therapeutic induction of innate immunity and use of IFN should be featured in strategies to treat acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in people at risk for severe COVID-19.

### Emerging nipah virus with pandemic potential and high mortality rates: is the scientific community learning from former pandemics? [^1114xfpz]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

After five outbreaks of NiV infections, some of which were sporadic and only affected one or two infected people, the last outbreak in India to date occurred in September 2023. Only in the first case is the source of infection unknown. The later infections could be traced back to human contact with family members or medical staff.

NiV is named after Sungai Nipah, a Malaysian village where the virus was first detected in farmers in 1998. It is closely related to the Hendra virus, which also belongs to the paramyxoviruses. NiV encodes two glycoproteins, the receptor‐binding protein G and the fusion protein F. Two main genotypes of NiV have been described. Clade I: NiV‐B was detected in India and Bangladesh. Clade II NiV‐M was reported in Malaysia and Cambodia. The Bangladesh type, in particular, is more virulent. It has been shown to have higher pathogenicity and more severe clinical manifestations. So far, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines have reported one or more outbreaks. The natural reservoir hosts of NiV are mainly four species of flying foxes of the genus Pteropus, also known as fruit bats. These hosts have been found close to human dwellings and have even entered them. The most common intermediate hosts are pigs. As a zoonotic virus, NiV is particularly difficult to combat because the entry receptor EFNB2 is highly conserved in mammals. In some communities in Nepal, flying foxes are consumed as bushmeat, indicating the associated risk. NiV can also be transmitted through body fluids, contaminated food with urine, saliva, or excretions from infected animals.

### Paving new roads toward the advancement of broad-spectrum antiviral agents [^117C4Fhw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs) have the advantageous property of being effective against a wide range of viruses with a single drug, offering a promising therapeutic solution for the largely unmet need in treating both existing and emerging viral infections. In this review, we summarize the current strategies for the development of novel BSAs, focusing on either targeting the commonalities during the replication of multiple viruses or the systemic immunity of humans. In comparison to BSAs that target viral replication, these immuno-modulatory agents possess an expanded spectrum of antiviral activity. However, antiviral immunity is a double-edged sword, and maintaining immune homeostasis ultimately dictates the health status of hosts during viral infections. Therefore, establishing an ideal goal for immuno-modulation in antiviral interventions is crucial. Herein we propose a bionic approach for immuno-modulation inspired by mimicking bats, which possess a more robust immune system for combating viral invasions, compared to humans. In addition, we discuss an empirical approach to treat diverse viral infections using traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), mainly through bidirectional immuno-modulation to restore the disrupted homeostasis. Advancing our understanding of both the immune system of bats and the mechanisms underlying antiviral TCMs will significantly contribute to the future development of novel BSAs.

### How the SARS coronavirus causes disease: host or organism? [^113NbVV5]. The Journal of Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

The previous epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has ended. However, many questions concerning how the aetiological agent, the novel SARS coronavirus (CoV), causes illness in humans remain unanswered. The pathology of fatal cases of SARS is dominated by diffuse alveolar damage. Specific histological changes are not detected in other organs. These contrast remarkably with the clinical picture, in which there are apparent manifestations in multiple organs. Both pathogen and host factors are important in the pathogenesis of SARS. The choice of specific receptors and the unique genome of the SARS-CoV are important elements in understanding the biology of the pathogen. For the host cells, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection, whether there are cytopathic effects or not, depends on the cell types that are infected. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines and, perhaps, autoimmunity, may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. Continued research is still required to determine the pathogenetic mechanisms involved and to combat this new emerging human infectious disease.

### Virus infections: escape, resistance, and counterattack [^112mFZni]. Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Many viruses establish life-long infections in their natural host with few if any clinical manifestations. The relationship between virus and host is a dynamic process in which the virus has evolved the means to coexist by reducing its visibility, while the host immune system attempts to suppress and eliminate infection without damage to itself. This short review describes a variety of strategies that are employed by viruses to evade host immune responses. These include virus-associated escape from T cell recognition, and resistance to apoptosis and counterattack, with special reference to two papers published in this issue of Immunity (Mueller et al., 2001; Raftery et al., 2001).

### Innate immunity: the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2 [^113QmZMm]. Nature Immunology (2022). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality. While most infections are mild, some patients experience severe and potentially fatal systemic inflammation, tissue damage, cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense, sensing the virus through pattern recognition receptors and activating inflammatory pathways that promote viral clearance. Here, we discuss innate immune processes involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition and the resultant inflammation. Improved understanding of how the innate immune system detects and responds to SARS-CoV-2 will help identify targeted therapeutic modalities that mitigate severe disease and improve patient outcomes.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 2: host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115dk2qU]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects whole-body metabolism in different ways, with emerging evidence supporting a correlation between these adaptations and COVID-19 disease severity. Moreover, the balance of biochemical components, whether the machinery (e.g. TCA proteins), fuel sources (e.g. lipids), or messenger molecules (e.g. metabolites) appear to shift towards a physiological catabolic state that may be further exacerbated by a patient's underlying conditions and demographics. Metabolic biofactors are also intrinsically tied with the recovery and response to viral infection, with immune-regulating lipids, pro-inflammatory lipids, and lipid mediators plausibly modulating the immune response during COVID-19, as one example. The immune system's physiology is also reliant on its metabolic function, whether from a development, proliferation, activation, or memory perspective. Immunity is shaped and guided by humoral factors, which we address in the next section, as to the SARS-CoV-2 viral influence on these factors and the effects on the body.

### Understanding virus-host interactions in tissues [^111iRVtK]. Nature Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Although virus-host interactions are usually studied in a single cell type using in vitro assays in immortalized cell lines or isolated cell populations, it is important to remember that what is happening inside one infected cell does not translate to understanding how an infected cell behaves in a tissue, organ or whole organism. Infections occur in complex tissue environments, which contain a host of factors that can alter the course of the infection, including immune cells, non-immune cells and extracellular-matrix components. These factors affect how the host responds to the virus and form the basis of the protective response. To understand virus infection, tools are needed that can profile the tissue environment. This Review highlights methods to study virus-host interactions in the infection microenvironment.

### Innate recognition of viruses [^111sxp5b]. Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

Virus infection elicits potent responses in all cells intended to contain virus spread before intervention by the adaptive immune system. Central to this process is the virus-elicited production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines. The sensors involved in coupling recognition of viruses to the induction of the type I IFN genes have only recently been uncovered and include endosomal and cytosolic receptors for RNA and DNA. Here, we review their properties and discuss how their ability to recognize the unusual presence of atypical nucleic acids in particular subcellular compartments is used by the body to detect virus presence.

### Nature nominee quercetin's anti-influenza combat strategy-demonstrations and remonstrations [^113Zy9UQ]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Nature's providences are rather the choicest remedies for human health and welfare. One such is quercetin, which is nature's nominee for cancer cure and recently demonstrated against influenza attack. Quercetin is highly recognized for its anticancer applications. This review emphasizes on yet another gift that this compound has to offer for mankind, which is none other than combating the deadly evasive influenza virus. The chemistry of this natural bioflavonoid and its derivatives and its modus operandi against influenza virus is consolidated into this review. The advancements and achievements made in the anti-influenza clinical history are also documented. Further, the challenges facing the progress of this compound to emerge as a predominant anti-influenza drug are discussed, and the future perspective for breaking its limitations through integration with nanoplatforms is envisioned.

### Yin and Yang of interferons: lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [^113BR3DH]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The host immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 includes the induction of a group of natural antiviral cytokines called interferons (IFNs). Although originally recognized for their ability to potently counteract infections, the mechanistic functions of IFNs in patients with varying severities of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have highlighted a more complex scenario. Cellular and molecular analyses have revealed that timing, location, and subtypes of IFNs produced during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection play a major role in determining disease progression and severity. In this review, we summarize what the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us about the protective and detrimental roles of IFNs during the inflammatory response elicited against a new respiratory virus across different ages and its longitudinal consequences in driving the development of long COVID-19.

### Current strategies to circumvent the antiviral immunity to optimize cancer virotherapy [^114HETki]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The immune system is exceptionally equipped to identify and destroy pathogens, and when successfully directed against cancer-derived antigens, can elicit powerful anticancer effects. Accordingly, the discovery that bacterial infection led to tumor regression in some sarcoma patients laid the foundation for cancer immunotherapy. A similar principle underlies the use of tumor-selective viruses today. In response to viral infections, the intracellular interferon (IFN) response triggers innate immune responses, including activation of natural killer (NK) cells and phagocytes. Viral antigens transported to the lymph nodes by antigen presenting cells elicit robust adaptive cellular immune responses, activating virus-specific naïve and memory B-cells and T-cells. Activated B-cells secrete antibodies that interfere with the viral life cycle, including internalization into target cells and intracellular translocation of viral proteins.T-cells exert cytotoxic effects on virus infected cells. Thus, the broad target spectrum of the innate immunity steers the deployment of a shaped, virus-specific adaptive immune response for specific and long-term protection against viral infections.

### Herpes simplex virus-based nerve targeting gene therapy in pain management [^111kWFRv]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Due to the natural biology of the parent virus, HSV-based vectors injected into the dermal layer of the skin will infect the sensory nerves innervating that area. Thus, by selecting the correct dermatome for direct vector inoculation, one can specifically target the sensory neurons in which one wants to express the therapeutic product. This restricts the "therapy" to the most appropriate region of the body, both minimizing the possibility of side effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy.

### Immunity and immunopathology to viruses: what decides the outcome? [^114sUysx]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2010). Medium credibility.

Many viruses infect humans and most are controlled satisfactorily by the immune system with limited damage to host tissues. Some viruses, however, do cause overt damage to the host, either in isolated cases or as a reaction that commonly occurs after infection. The outcome is influenced by properties of the infecting virus, the circumstances of infection and several factors controlled by the host. In this Review, we focus on host factors that influence the outcome of viral infection, including genetic susceptibility, the age of the host when infected, the dose and route of infection, the induction of anti-inflammatory cells and proteins, as well as the presence of concurrent infections and past exposure to cross-reactive agents.

### Interferons and viruses: an evolutionary arms race of molecular interactions [^114psgHE]. Trends in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Over half a century has passed since interferons (IFNs) were discovered and shown to inhibit virus infection in cultured cells. Since then, researchers have steadily brought to light the molecular details of IFN signaling, catalogued their pleiotropic effects on cells, and harnessed their therapeutic potential for a variety of maladies. While advances have been plentiful, several fundamental questions have yet to be answered and much complexity remains to be unraveled. We explore the current knowledge surrounding four main questions: are type I IFN subtypes differentially produced in response to distinct pathogens? How are IFN subtypes distinguished by cells? What are the mechanisms and consequences of viral antagonism? Lastly, how can the IFN response be harnessed to improve vaccine efficacy?

### Innate antiviral immunity in the skin [^114ZXExC]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Barrier sites such as the skin play a critical role in immune defense. They must maintain homeostasis with commensals and rapidly detect and limit pathogen invasion. This is accomplished in part through the production of endogenous antimicrobial peptides and proteins, which can be either constitutive or inducible. Here, we focus particularly on the control of innate antiviral proteins and present the basic aspects of their regulation in the skin by interferons (IFNs), IFN-independent immunity, and environmental factors. We also discuss the activity and (dys-)function of antiviral proteins in the context of skin-tropic viruses and highlight the relevance of the innate antiviral pathway as a potential therapeutic avenue for vulnerable patient populations and skin diseases with high risk for virus infections.

### Innate immune response to viral infection of the lungs [^112R9eYr]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious illnesses, though they are usually self-limiting and confined to the respiratory tract. The rapid identification of viruses and their effective elimination with minimal local and systemic inflammation is a testament to the efficiency of the innate immune response within the airways and lungs. A failure of this response appears to occur in those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where viral infection is an important trigger for acute exacerbations. The innate immune response to viruses requires their early detection through pathogen recognition receptors and the recruitment of the efficient antiviral response that is centred around the release of type 1 interferons. The airway epithelium provides both a barrier and an early detector for viruses, and interacts closely with cells of the innate immune response, especially macrophages and dendritic cells, to eliminate infection and trigger a specific adaptive immune response.

### Antibodies, viruses and vaccines [^112a8Vs7]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

Neutralizing antibodies are crucial for vaccine-mediated protection against viral diseases. They probably act, in most cases, by blunting the infection, which is then resolved by cellular immunity. The protective effects of neutralizing antibodies can be achieved not only by neutralization of free virus particles, but also by several activities directed against infected cells. In certain instances, non-neutralizing antibodies contribute to protection. Several viruses, such as HIV, have evolved mechanisms to evade neutralizing-antibody responses, and these viruses present special challenges for vaccine design that are now being tackled.

### ISG15 in antiviral immunity and beyond [^112ap8mf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The host response to viral infection includes the induction of type I interferons and the subsequent upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is an interferon-induced protein that has been implicated as a central player in the host antiviral response. Over the past 15 years, efforts to understand how ISG15 protects the host during infection have revealed that its actions are diverse and pathogen-dependent. In this Review, we describe new insights into how ISG15 directly inhibits viral replication and discuss the recent finding that ISG15 modulates the host damage and repair response, immune response and other host signalling pathways. We also explore the viral immune-evasion strategies that counteract the actions of ISG15. These findings are integrated with a discussion of the recent identification of ISG15-deficient individuals and a cellular receptor for ISG15 that provides new insights into how ISG15 shapes the host response to viral infection.

### Cytokine synergy: an underappreciated contributor to innate anti-viral immunity [^11471EX2]. Cytokine (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and the members of the interferon family, are potent mediators of the innate anti-viral immune response. The intracellular anti-viral states resulting from treatment of cultured cells with each of these molecules independently has been well studied; but, within complex tissues, the early inflammatory response is likely mediated by simultaneously expressed mixtures of these, and other, protective anti-viral cytokines. Such cytokine mixtures have been shown to induce potently synergistic anti-viral responses in vitro which are more complex than the simple summation of the individual cytokine response profiles. The physiological role of this 'cytokine synergy', however, remains largely unappreciated in vivo. This brief commentary will attempt to summarize the potential effects and mechanisms of anti-viral cytokine synergy as well as present several 'real-world' applications where this phenomenon might play an important role.

### Regulation of antiviral innate immune signaling and viral evasion following viral genome sensing [^112fkhWm]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A harmonized balance between positive and negative regulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-initiated immune responses is required to achieve the most favorable outcome for the host. This balance is crucial because it must not only ensure activation of the first line of defense against viral infection but also prevent inappropriate immune activation, which results in autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shown how signal transduction pathways initiated by PRRs are positively and negatively regulated by diverse modulators to maintain host immune homeostasis. However, viruses have developed strategies to subvert the host antiviral response and establish infection. Viruses have evolved numerous genes encoding immunomodulatory proteins that antagonize the host immune system. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge regarding key host factors that regulate innate immune signaling molecules upon viral infection and discusses evidence showing how specific viral proteins counteract antiviral responses via immunomodulatory strategies.

### Constitutive immune mechanisms: mediators of host defence and immune regulation [^117XPVRa]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2021). High credibility.

The immune system enables organisms to combat infections and to eliminate endogenous challenges. Immune responses can be evoked through diverse inducible pathways. However, various constitutive mechanisms are also required for immunocompetence. The inducible responses of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive immune system are highly effective, but they also have the potential to cause extensive immunopathology and tissue damage, as seen in many infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. By contrast, constitutive innate immune mechanisms, including restriction factors, basal autophagy and proteasomal degradation, tend to limit immune responses, with loss-of-function mutations in these pathways leading to inflammation. Although they function through a broad and heterogeneous set of mechanisms, the constitutive immune responses all function as early barriers to infection and aim to minimize any disruption of homeostasis. Supported by recent human and mouse data, in this Review we compare and contrast the inducible and constitutive mechanisms of immunosurveillance.

### Nonviral protein cages as tools to decipher and combat viral threats [^11538kMo]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the complex realm of microorganisms, viruses stand out as enigmatic entities, existing at the intersection of life and non-life. Viruses consist of a minimal genome containing the necessary information for replication, which is encapsulated in a protein shell called a capsid, and in some cases, also a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane, studded with viral glycoproteins that mediate host recognition and entry.

Viral infection begins with a multistep entry process, where the virus first attaches to host cell surface receptors and penetrates the cell through membrane fusion or endocytosis (Fig. 1). Virions that enter endosomes escape in response to environmental signals such as pH changes or enzyme activation. Once inside the cytosol, the viral capsid undergoes uncoating, releasing its genetic material for replication. Subsequent stages in the life cycle include the synthesis of viral components, followed by virion assembly and release. As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the host cell's machinery for propagation. Understanding which host factors are recruited throughout the viral life cycle is crucial, as these interactions drive viral pathogenicity and can inform therapeutic strategies to combat emerging threats. However, studying these mechanisms using live viruses presents significant challenges. Viral entry often involves multiple receptors and attachment factors, making it difficult to isolate specific interactions. Moreover, modifying viral surface properties to study these processes can be inherently limited by strict biosafety regulations, which further restrict research accessibility when handling highly pathogenic viruses.

### Intracellular detection of viral nucleic acids [^113woWrN]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Successful clearance of a microbial infection depends on the concerted action of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Accurate recognition of an invading pathogen is the first and most crucial step in eliciting effective antimicrobial defense mechanisms. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made towards understanding the molecular details of how the innate immune system recognizes microbial signatures, commonly called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). For viral pathogens, nucleic acids-both viral genomes and viral replication products-represent a major class of PAMPs that trigger antiviral host responses via activation of germline-encoded innate immune receptors. Here we summarize recent advances in intracellular innate sensing mechanisms of viral RNA and DNA.

### Systemic responses during local viral infections: type I IFNs sound the alarm [^117PtZWG]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Type I IFNs are well known for their role in controlling virus replication and spread. Type I IFNs produced by the infected tissue also signal beyond the boundaries of the infection to regulate different elements of the anti-viral immune response. Recent reports show that type I IFNs directly condition naive monocytes residing in the distal bone marrow (BM) and induce the expression of effector molecules in memory T cells, before their recruitment to the infected site. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were shown to enter the cell cycle in response to systemically distributed type I IFNs. These discoveries expand our understanding of the pleiotropic effects of type I IFNs during infection and highlight the critical role of systemic signals in the development of an effective response to a localized viral infection.

### Regulating the adaptive immune response to respiratory virus infection [^112Kv7HZ]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Recent years have seen several advances in our understanding of immunity to virus infection of the lower respiratory tract, including to influenza virus infection. Here, we review the cellular targets of viruses and the features of the host immune response that are unique to the lungs. We describe the interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells in the induction, expression and control of antiviral immunity, and discuss the impact of the infected lung milieu on moulding the response of antiviral effector T cells. Recent findings on the mechanisms that underlie the increased frequency of severe pulmonary bacterial infections following respiratory virus infection are also discussed.

### Innate immune sensing of coronavirus and viral evasion strategies [^112RiNYn]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and future perspectives

Since the beginning of the 2000s, outbreaks of betacoronaviruses have continually occurred approximately every ten years. Today, we are facing an unprecedented public health threat and world economic crises due to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, another betacoronavirus. Although it has been almost one year since SARS-CoV-2 was first reported, the virus is still spreading rapidly on the globe, exponentially creating large patient populations.

What makes these viruses highly pathogenic and deadly? There are distinct features of these coronaviruses that are associated with viral virulence and pathogenicity. First, all three highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses are zoonotic and thought to originate from bats or pangolins. Thus, our immune system is 'naïve' and has not been prepared for 'never-before-seen' invaders. Second, as we discussed intensively, betacoronaviruses possess multiple mechanisms targeting various innate immune responses to evade host antiviral defense programs. Failure of timely and appropriate innate immune activation may lead to robust viral propagation and is directly associated with disease severity and mortality. Last, coronaviruses can cause elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines via uncontrolled host immune responses, termed the cytokine storm.

The main measures currently in effect are preventing the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the movement of people and maintaining a social distance from others. However, these are only symptomatic measures and do not provide a fundamental solution. Current healthcare systems treat patients with limited respiratory management using existing treatments used for other diseases. However, the mechanism of action of the existing therapies being used for the treatment of the diseases is not clear and needs to be elucidated. Thus, understanding the underlying immune escape mechanisms of coronaviruses is essential for developing specific treatments for coronavirus-derived diseases, such as COVID-19.

Since coronaviruses possess multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms and can cause excessive immune responses by abnormal activation of the complex host immune system, targeting a single viral factor may not be effective for controlling viral pathogenesis. Therefore, either preventing the onset of a viral infection by reducing the chance of being in contact with a potential reservoir of zoonotic origin or protecting against virus-induced diseases through effective vaccination would be ideal for avoiding an unprecedented disaster. A continuous effort to understand the underlying mechanisms of host-virus interactions is necessary to overcome the current pandemic of COVID-19 and prepare for the potential pandemic that may occur in the future.

### Innate immunity [^1136iWbd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Recent years have witnessed an explosion of interest in the innate immune system. Questions about how the innate immune system senses infection and empowers a protective immune response are being answered at the molecular level. These basic science discoveries are being translated into a more complete understanding of the central role innate immunity plays in the pathogenesis of many human infectious and inflammatory diseases. It is particularly exciting that we are already seeing a return on these scientific investments with the emergence of novel therapies to harness the power of the innate immune system. In this review we explore the defining characteristics of the innate immune system, and through more detailed examples, we highlight recent breakthroughs that have advanced our understanding of the role of innate immunity in human health and disease.

### The world goes bats: living longer and tolerating viruses [^116RkWXx]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

For centuries, people believed that bats possessed sinister powers. Bats are thought to be ancestral hosts to many deadly viruses affecting humans including Ebola, rabies, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, bats themselves tolerate these viruses without ill effects. The second power that bats have is their longevity. Bats live much longer than similar-sized land mammals. Here we review how bats' ability to control inflammation may be contributing to their longevity. The underlying mechanisms may hold clues to developing new treatments for age-related diseases. Now may be the time to use science to exploit the secret powers of bats for human benefit.

### Influenza virus activation of the interferon system [^116npDNv]. Virus Research (2015). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

The influenza viruses are a leading cause of respiratory illness in humans and are responsible for annual seasonal outbreaks that have serious economic impact. In addition, the wide host range of the virus and the potential for genome reassortment between human influenza viruses and those of other species mean these viruses present a pandemic threat. To establish a productive infection and thus cause disease, influenza viruses must overcome host innate immune responses that are very rapidly activated during infections. The interferon (IFN) family of antiviral cytokines play a major role in these responses and are critical in restricting the early stages of virus infections prior to the activation of the adaptive immune system. The IFNs and other innate immune mediators have serious implications for the outcome of influenza virus infections in terms of disease severity, since highly pathogenic viruses are often associated with excessive cytokine responses. In this review, we summarise recent developments in our understanding of how influenza viruses activate the IFN system and highlight areas in which this understanding is still incomplete.

### Interferon-λ treatment accelerates SARS-CoV-2 clearance despite age-related delays in the induction of T cell immunity [^114PueJ1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, has led to a pandemic that has resulted in > 5.8 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of variants and the possibility of breakthrough infections, it is widely believed that SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic virus. Consequently, finding safe and effective treatments for COVID-19 remains a priority to prevent hospitalizations and deaths, and to expedite recovery in unvaccinated individuals or breakthrough infections.

Interferons (IFNs) are a crucial part of the innate antiviral immune response and drive the expression of a wide array of genes with antiviral and immunoregulatory properties, collectively known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Two families of IFNs contribute directly to the innate antiviral response at mucosal barriers in humans- type I (eg. IFN-α, IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λs). The broad pleiotropic effects of ISGs can overcome antiviral resistance, making type I or III IFNs potential therapeutics for new and/or highly diverse viruses. Recent studies have found a link between severe COVID-19 and deficiencies in, or autoantibodies to, type I IFN, while stronger type I IFN responses have been associated with asymptomatic infection, highlighting the critical role of IFNs in disease evolution –. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes proteins to antagonize IFN responses –, however supplementing the natural IFN response with IFN treatment has been found to be effective against the virus.

### Innate immune sensing of coronavirus and viral evasion strategies [^115boUJn]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The innate immune system is the first line of the host defense program against pathogens and harmful substances. Antiviral innate immune responses can be triggered by multiple cellular receptors sensing viral components. The activated innate immune system produces interferons (IFNs) and cytokines that perform antiviral functions to eliminate invading viruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a broad range of animal hosts. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple means to evade host antiviral immune responses. Successful immune evasion by coronaviruses may enable the viruses to adapt to multiple species of host organisms. Coronavirus transmission from zoonotic hosts to humans has caused serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), resulting in global health and economic crises. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host sensing of and innate immune responses against coronavirus invasion, as well as host immune evasion strategies of coronaviruses.

### Interferons (IFNs) are key cytokines in both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses – and viruses counteract IFN action [^112sbbC8]. Microbes and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Interferons (IFNs) are transcriptionally regulated cytokines and key players in the innate antiviral immune response. Upon recognition of a virus, or its molecular patterns, by the Toll-like receptors of dendritic cells (DCs), high levels of IFNs are expressed by these cells. This in turn stimulates DC maturation and the subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, leading to the transition to an adaptive antiviral immunity. Conversely, viruses have developed diverse strategies to counterattack host defenses in order to generate their progenies.

### Innate immunity to influenza virus infection [^1136Pxai]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Influenza viruses are a major pathogen of both humans and animals. Recent studies using gene-knockout mice have led to an in-depth understanding of the innate sensors that detect influenza virus infection in a variety of cell types. Signalling downstream of these sensors induces distinct sets of effector mechanisms that block virus replication and promote viral clearance by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we discuss the various ways in which the innate immune system uses pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to influenza virus infection. We consider whether the outcome of innate sensor stimulation promotes antiviral resistance or disease tolerance, and propose rational treatment strategies for the acute respiratory disease that is caused by influenza virus infection.

### Viral subversion mechanisms in chronic kidney disease pathogenesis [^116w5jix]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Viruses cannot autonomously replicate but must rely on the host cellular machinery to support their life cycle. Through natural selection, viruses have evolved strategies to co-opt the host organism to be a better site for their propagation. Some of these strategies are directed at the cellular machinery and involve complicated and ingenious solutions to optimize infection, replication, viral gene expression, and new virion assembly and shedding. Other strategies are directed at the host's innate and adaptive immune systems that permit the virus to evade clearance mechanisms. The more common pathogenic viral infections in nephrology-cytomegalovirus, HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, polyomavirus BK, and parvovirus B19-all have acquired subversion strategies that benefit the virus but because they interfere with normal cellular and immune processes also have become pathogenic to the host. In addition, the highly prevalent viruses cytomegalovirus, BK, and B19 cause severe disease only in the setting of immunosuppression, revealing the very delicate balance that some viruses have achieved with their host's immune system. Thus, selective pressure for survival drives both the evolution of more sophisticated viruses and the host immune system as it evolves to combat the environment of adapting and emerging infectious agents. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these viral subversion strategies may reveal new targets for the development of highly specific antiviral therapies and also aid vaccine development.

### Innate immune response to viral infection [^1146yhKa]. Cytokine (2008). Low credibility.

In viral infections the host innate immune system is meant to act as a first line defense to prevent viral invasion or replication before more specific protection by the adaptive immune system is generated. In the innate immune response, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are engaged to detect specific viral components such as viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products and to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines in the infected cells and other immune cells. Recently these innate immune receptors and their unique downstream pathways have been identified. Here, we summarize their roles in the innate immune response to virus infection, discrimination between self and viral nucleic acids and inhibition by virulent factors and provide some recent advances in the coordination between innate and adaptive immune activation.

### Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 induced by infection or vaccination [^116RQsS7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Durability of immunity after natural infection

How long immunological protection lasts after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is a critical metric that strongly impinges upon how the pandemic will play out, epidemiologically and in terms of public policy, since immune protection is sensitive to the emergence of viral immune escape variants. Moreover, many previously infected individuals would like to know their risk of acquiring COVID‐19 a second time, and others would like to know how long the protective effect of their vaccination will last. Past‐controlled human infection experiments with seasonal CoVs have demonstrated that infection‐induced antibodies correlate with protection to re‐challenge, although re‐infection was possible. Indeed, it is important to appreciate that immunity represents a spectrum of protection that is dependent upon numerous cell types (e.g. B and T cells, NK cells and macrophages) physical barriers that are more or less effective in different individuals, along with differences in environmental influences (e.g. medications with side‐effects on the immune system), general health status and age. Therefore, it is more useful to consider infection‐induced immunity as a measure of reduced risk upon re‐infection, similar to that induced by current SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines that are highly effective at preventing severe COVID‐19, but not necessarily viral transmission. It is hoped that the coming years will yield important advancements in quantitative immune profiling at population levels so that the relative contribution of different protective barriers and environmental factors can be estimated.

### The interferon antiviral response: from viral invasion to evasion [^115z5L4Y]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

One of the initial responses of an organism to infection by pathogenic viruses is the synthesis of antiviral cytokines such as the type I interferons (interferon-alpha/beta), interleukins, and other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interferons provide a first line of defence against virus infections by generating an intracellular environment that restricts virus replication and signals the presence of a viral pathogen to the adaptive arm of the immune response. Interferons stimulate cells in the local environment to activate a network of interferon-stimulated genes, which encode proteins that have antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities. The present review focuses on recent reports that describe the activation of multiple signalling pathways following virus infection, new candidate genes that are implicated in the establishment of the antiviral state, and the strategies used by viruses and their specific viral products to antagonize and evade the host antiviral response.

### Coronavirus infections and immune responses [^11248RQa]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive-sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.

### The human virome: assembly, composition and host interactions [^111QYty3]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

The human body hosts vast microbial communities, termed the microbiome. Less well known is the fact that the human body also hosts vast numbers of different viruses, collectively termed the 'virome'. Viruses are believed to be the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet, with an estimated 10 31 particles on Earth. The human virome is similarly vast and complex, consisting of approximately 10 13 particles per human individual, with great heterogeneity. In recent years, studies of the human virome using metagenomic sequencing and other methods have clarified aspects of human virome diversity at different body sites, the relationships to disease states and mechanisms of establishment of the human virome during early life. Despite increasing focus, it remains the case that the majority of sequence data in a typical virome study remain unidentified, highlighting the extent of unexplored viral 'dark matter'. Nevertheless, it is now clear that viral community states can be associated with adverse outcomes for the human host, whereas other states are characteristic of health. In this Review, we provide an overview of research on the human virome and highlight outstanding recent studies that explore the assembly, composition and dynamics of the human virome as well as host-virome interactions in health and disease.

### Innate immunity against HIV-1 infection [^1135Nftj]. Nature Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

During acute HIV-1 infection, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) of infected cells, which triggers a signaling cascade that initiates innate intracellular antiviral defenses aimed at restricting the replication and spread of the virus. This cell-intrinsic response propagates outward via the action of secreted factors such as cytokines and chemokines that activate innate immune cells and attract them to the site of infection and to local lymphatic tissue. Antiviral innate effector cells can subsequently contribute to the control of viremia and modulate the quality of the adaptive immune response to HIV-1. The concerted actions of PRR signaling, specific viral-restriction factors, innate immune cells, innate-adaptive immune crosstalk and viral evasion strategies determine the outcome of HIV-1 infection and immune responses.

### The importance of the innate immune system in controlling HIV infection and disease [^117Bd9XG]. Trends in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and is particularly important in warding off bacterial and viral infections presenting at the mucosal cell surface. From this primitive immune response, the more sophisticated adaptive immune system was derived. Despite nearly two decades of research directed at inducing adaptive immune responses to HIV, no successful immunological therapy or vaccine has been developed. On the basis of recent observations, it is suggested that instead emphasis should now be placed on the alternative arm of the immune system, the innate immune response. Novel approaches should be developed to elicit this rapidly responding immune activity in HIV infection.

### Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: what do we need to know? [^1179HTWm]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The virus is transmitted by exhaled virus-laden droplets that are inhaled by susceptible individuals; these droplets enter the nose and throat, and the virus attacks the cell-surface receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen to this individual, the immune cells do not recognize it and it escapes the defense system of the body and replicates itself to invade new host cells. These host cells are destroyed in this process, and these pathological changes alert the immune system to begin fighting the diseased cells as well as the virus. A recent study indicated that the genes involved in innate immunity are coexpressed in nasal epithelial cells with viral-entry–associated genes. Thus, if the early immune response can suppress enough viral replication to prevent it from continuing into the lungs, the infected individual could have no or only mild symptoms. Another ex vivo study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 induced significantly less host interferon and proinflammatory response than SARS-CoV, and the low degree of innate immune activation could account for the mild or even lack of symptoms in many COVID-19 patients. To date, the exact reasons for no or only mild symptoms in many COVID-19 patients remain unclear, and further research is urgently needed to explore the causes and transmission of asymptomatic infections.

### Progress and prospects: immune responses to viral vectors [^115cQ1q2]. Gene Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Viral vectors are potent gene delivery platforms used for the treatment of genetic and acquired diseases. However, just as viruses have evolved to infect cells efficiently, the immune system has evolved to fight off what it perceives as invading pathogens. Therefore, innate immunity and antigen-specific adaptive immune responses against vector-derived antigens reduce the efficacy and stability of in vivo gene transfer. In addition, a number of vectors are derived from parent viruses that humans encounter through natural infection, resulting in preexisting antibodies and possibly in memory responses against vector antigens. Similarly, antibody and T-cell responses may be directed against therapeutic gene products that often differ from the endogenous nonfunctional or absent protein that is being replaced. As details and mechanisms of such immune reactions are uncovered, novel strategies are being developed, and vectors are being specifically engineered to avoid, suppress or manipulate the response, ideally resulting in sustained expression and immune tolerance to the transgene product. This review provides a summary of our current knowledge of the interactions between the immune system adeno-associated virus, adenoviral and lentiviral vectors, and their transgene products.

### Viral manipulation of the host immune response [^11462JUk]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that require a host for essential machinery to replicate and ultimately be transmitted to new susceptible hosts. At the same time, the immune system has evolved to protect the human body from invasion by viruses and other pathogens. To counter this, viruses have developed an arsenal of strategies to not only avoid immune detection but to actively manipulate host immune responses to create an environment more favorable for infection. Here, we describe recent advances uncovering novel mechanisms by which viruses skew host immune responses through modulation of cytokine and chemokine signaling networks, interference with antigen presentation and T cell responses, and preventing antibody production.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 2: host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111SBsfs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

### Antibodies against viruses: passive and active immunization [^112gBw5B]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Antibodies, through passive or active immunization, play a central role in prophylaxis against many infectious agents. While neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses, the relative contribution of Fc-dependent and complement-dependent anti-viral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies. The multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses, and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses, in addition to virus size, influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization. These new findings will improve our strategies in therapeutic antibody engineering and rational vaccine design.

### Is it time for microbiome-based therapies in viral infections? [^114tB4bh]. Virus Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases related to viruses, as well as bacterial pathogens, abound in all parts of the world, burdening health and economy. Thus, there is a dire need to find new prevention and treatment strategies to improve clinical practices related to viral infections. Human gut contains trillions of bacteria which have regulatory roles in immune development, homeostasis, and body metabolism. Today, it is difficult to find any prominent viral infection that hasn't had any link with the human gut microbiota. In this opinion-based review article, I argued the significance of manipulating human gut microbiota as novel therapeutics through probiotics or FMT in alleviating complexities related to viral infections, and pinpointed bottlenecks involved in this research.

### Correlates of protection against influenza infection in humans – on the path to a universal vaccine? [^112MwhMe]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Influenza is an acute respiratory viral infection with high mutation rate and pandemic potential. Vaccination is an effective means of prevention and control of influenza, but the challenges of vaccine mismatches for the next influenza seasons and adequate global supply of influenza vaccines limit its effectiveness. Protective immunity in vaccination or natural infection is primarily mediated by antibody responses against surface proteins of influenza including haemagglutinin (HA) as the major neutralizing target, whereas strong T cell responses to internal viral proteins are associated with reduced disease severity. Recently, identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies against the conserved stem region of HA from influenza infected individuals has invigorated interest in development of a universal vaccine against different subtypes of influenza. Moreover, because of the cross-reactive nature of T cell recognition and more conserved internal antigens of influenza, strategies that boost memory T cell responses to these internal antigens may provide not only help for antibody-mediated protection but also limit the cell damage caused by viral infection directly. This is particularly important in acute infection with new pandemic viruses or antibody-escape variants where there are no pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. Here, we review the protective immune correlates against human influenza infection and discuss current status of universal influenza vaccine development.

### Viral evasion of natural killer cells [^1129tgbP]. Nature Immunology (2002). Medium credibility.

Viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid the host immune system, including means of escaping detection by both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Natural killer (NK) cells are a central component of the innate immune system and are crucial in defense against certain viruses. To attain a state of chronic infection, some successful viruses have developed specific mechanisms to evade detection by and activation of NK cells. These NK cell-specific evasion mechanisms fall into distinct mechanistic categories used in numerous virus families.

### Combining antivirals and immunomodulators to fight COVID-19 [^114ZoYHx]. Trends in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected individuals remain paucisymptomatic, contrasting with a minority of infected individuals in danger of death. Here, we speculate that the robust disease resistance of most individuals is due to a swift production of type I interferon (IFNα/β), presumably sufficient to lower the viremia. A minority of infected individuals with a preexisting chronic inflammatory state fail to mount this early efficient response, leading to a delayed harmful inflammatory response. To improve the epidemiological scenario, we propose combining: (i) the development of efficient antivirals administered early enough to assist in the production of endogenous IFNα/β; (ii) potentiating early IFN responses; (iii) administering anti-inflammatory treatments when needed, but not too early to interfere with endogenous antiviral responses.

### Bat flight and zoonotic viruses [^1126D73C]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Bats are sources of high viral diversity and high-profile zoonotic viruses worldwide. Although apparently not pathogenic in their reservoir hosts, some viruses from bats severely affect other mammals, including humans. Examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Nipah and Hendra viruses. Factors underlying high viral diversity in bats are the subject of speculation. We hypothesize that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this host-virus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant of the fever response and less virulent to their natural hosts.
