## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for an avulsion fracture off the dorsal base of the distal phalanx of the third finger with intra-articular extension, i.e., a suspected bony mallet finger injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about correctly identifying the injury pattern and classification. Then, I should verify key decision factors that dictate operative versus nonoperative care. Next, I will check what imaging and measurements are required. After that, I will outline nonoperative splinting details and, if indicated, surgical options. Finally, I will consider follow-up, complications, and special scenarios such as pediatric or open injuries [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE].

> Let me first confirm the injury type. A dorsal avulsion fragment at the base of the distal phalanx with intra-articular extension is a bony mallet finger, initially described here as "Doyle Type III". Wait, let me verify the Doyle classification; I realize that's incorrect for a closed bony mallet. Doyle Type III refers to an open mallet with skin loss; bony mallet fractures are Doyle Type IV, with IVB indicating an epiphyseal fragment in adults and IVC often used when there is DIP subluxation, so I should correct that to Doyle Type IV, not Type III [^114dn63M] [^115CSzgE].

> I need to check the critical treatment decision factors next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; management hinges on three parameters: percent articular surface involved by the fragment (commonly a 30–33% threshold), the presence of volar subluxation of the distal phalanx, and the degree of displacement or articular step-off. I should confirm these because they drive whether splinting alone is appropriate or whether reduction and fixation are indicated, noting that even fractures > 1/3 surface can sometimes do well nonoperatively if the DIP is reduced, which tempers the "absolute" threshold concept [^115CSzgE] [^113aN9G9] [^112vSMiN].

> Next, I should review what imaging is required. Let me first confirm that we have high-quality AP, true lateral, and oblique views, because accurate lateral imaging is essential to measure fragment size and detect subtle volar subluxation of the distal phalanx; if the lateral is off, I could miss subluxation or misjudge the articular percentage. I will now examine whether additional imaging is necessary; CT is rarely required for mallet fractures but, if plain films are equivocal, further imaging may clarify articular involvement, though standard radiographs usually suffice for DIP injuries [^1178s5KG] [^116GxTEs].

> If there is no volar subluxation and the fragment involves less than roughly one-third of the articular surface with minimal displacement, I should recommend continuous DIP extension immobilization with the PIP free. Wait, I need to ensure I specify the regimen: strict continuous immobilization in full extension or slight hyperextension for 6–8 weeks, followed by nighttime splinting for another 2–4 weeks; any unintended DIP flexion "resets the clock", so compliance and careful hygiene are key. Let me reconsider splint choices: many designs exist and outcomes are generally similar, but consistency and comfort drive adherence, and delayed splinting can still be effective in many cases [^114dn63M] [^1163jhHC] [^1128yWwh] [^113QVsdK].

> I should double-check splint selection and skin risk. A recent randomized trial found that a Quickcast orthosis resulted in fewer skin complications and less pain than a custom thermoplastic splint, with no differences in extensor lag or need for surgery, which could matter for patient comfort and adherence. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to both bony and soft-tissue mallets; it does, with a stronger pain benefit in soft-tissue cases, but the skin complication reduction is relevant across mallet types, supporting Quickcast when available [^113FHkMa].

> But wait, what if the fragment is larger or the DIP is unstable. I need to ensure I indicate escalation thresholds: volar subluxation of the distal phalanx or a fragment typically exceeding about one-third of the articular surface with a significant step-off are common indications to proceed with reduction and fixation, often via percutaneous extension-block pinning to restore joint congruity and allow protected immobilization in extension. Let me verify technique support and outcomes; modified extension-block K-wire methods have shown excellent alignment and minimal extensor lag in series, though evidence quality varies, and comparative data suggest that in selected larger-fragment cases without marked subluxation, nonoperative results can still rival surgical outcomes, so shared decision-making is important [^115hTnWM] [^113aN9G9] [^115CSzgE].

> I will now examine alternative fixation strategies if the fragment is too small or comminuted for screws and percutaneous pinning is not feasible. Hook plates can capture small avulsion fragments at phalangeal insertions and have achieved union with good motion in series, enabling stable fixation that may permit earlier motion, but I should confirm that data quality is lower and that implant irritation or removal can occur; thus, these are typically reserved for specific scenarios or failures of closed methods [^114irBzr] [^115jPb8t].

> Let me think about follow-up and rehabilitation. I should confirm a schedule of early checks at 1–2 weeks to assess skin integrity, splint fit, and radiographic alignment, with repeat imaging if symptoms change; for splinted patients, maintain strict DIP extension while keeping the PIP mobile to avoid stiffness, and for pinned patients, follow hardware protocols and initiate motion per stability once safe. Hold on, I should verify expected extensor lag; a small residual lag is common and not necessarily functionally limiting, and gradual weaning with nighttime splinting helps prevent recurrence [^114dn63M] [^113QVsdK].

> I need to consider complications and longer-term sequelae. If undertreated or poorly aligned, mallet injuries may progress to swan neck deformity due to PIP hyperextension and DIP flexion, and while corrective options exist (including DIP fusion in refractory cases), prevention via early, appropriate management is preferable. I should confirm that comparative data show no clear superiority of routine surgery over splinting for many mallet fractures, reinforcing that indications should be individualized based on instability and articular incongruity rather than fragment size alone in isolation [^114dn63M] [^116M9kyv] [^113aN9G9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what if this is pediatric or there is a nail-bed injury. I need to ensure we exclude a Seymour-type open physeal injury if a child presents with a mallet-like deformity and nail plate disruption; in that scenario, urgent irrigation and debridement, nail-bed repair, antibiotics, and often K-wire stabilization are indicated to prevent infection and growth disturbance, which differs from closed adult bony mallet management [^112LmtLE].

> Putting it all together, my conditional plan is as follows: if true lateral radiographs show no volar subluxation and articular involvement is about one-third or less with minimal step-off, proceed with continuous DIP extension splinting for 6–8 weeks and careful skin surveillance, favoring a comfortable, low-complication orthosis like Quickcast when available; if there is volar subluxation, a large or displaced fragment, or failure of splinting, discuss percutaneous extension-block pinning as first-line fixation, with hook plate fixation considered selectively for small-fragment or complex avulsions, all with close follow-up to monitor alignment, healing, and extensor function [^1178s5KG] [^114dn63M] [^113FHkMa] [^115hTnWM] [^113aN9G9] [^114irBzr].

---

For a dorsal avulsion fracture at the base of the distal phalanx with intra-articular extension, **nonoperative management is first-line** [^115CSzgE] [^114dn63M] if the fragment is small (< 30% of the articular surface), minimally displaced (< 2 mm), and there is no volar subluxation. Use a **stack or custom thermoplastic splint** [^113FHkMa] [^113QsNrG] to immobilize the DIP joint in slight hyperextension [^1128yWwh] for 6–8 weeks, then wean over 2–4 weeks with early motion [^112vSMiN]. Surgery is indicated for larger fragments, displacement > 2 mm, or volar subluxation, with extension block pinning [^115hTnWM] or hook plate fixation [^114irBzr] [^115jPb8t] as options. Early motion [^1163jhHC] and hand therapy are essential to minimize stiffness and extensor lag [^113aN9G9].

---

## Indications for nonoperative management

When the following criteria are present, **nonoperative management** is appropriate [^114dn63M]:

- **Fragment size**: < 30% of the articular surface [^1178s5KG].
- **Displacement**: < 2 mm [^1163jhHC].
- **Subluxation**: No volar subluxation of the distal phalanx.
- **Patient factors**: Reliable, compliant, and able to adhere to splinting [^115CSzgE].

---

## Nonoperative management protocol

### Initial management

Perform gentle closed reduction if needed [^1128yWwh], then **immobilize the DIP joint** in slight hyperextension with a stack or custom thermoplastic splint [^113FHkMa], keeping the PIP free. Maintain **continuous immobilization for 6–8 weeks** [^114dn63M].

---

### Follow-up and rehabilitation

Obtain **radiographs at 1 and 2 weeks** to confirm alignment [^1178s5KG] [^114dn63M]. Wean the splint gradually over 2–4 weeks with night splinting, and **begin early active ROM** with hand therapy to prevent stiffness and extensor lag [^112vSMiN] [^1163jhHC].

---

## Indications for surgical management

When any of the following are present, **surgical intervention** is indicated [^114dn63M]:

- **Fragment size**: > 30% of the articular surface [^1163jhHC].
- **Displacement**: > 2 mm.
- **Subluxation**: Volar subluxation of the distal phalanx.
- **Failure**: Nonoperative management fails or patient is noncompliant [^115CSzgE].

## Surgical techniques

| **Attribute** | **Extension block pinning** | **Hook plate fixation** |
|-|-|-|
| Technique | Percutaneous K-wire to maintain reduction | Small hook plate for stable fixation |
| Indications | Displacement > 2 mm or volar subluxation [^114dn63M] | Larger fragments or failed nonoperative care [^114irBzr] [^115jPb8t] |
| Outcomes | Good union and function with early motion [^115hTnWM] | Stable fixation allowing early motion and good function [^114irBzr] [^115jPb8t] |

---

## Potential complications

### Nonoperative management

Nonoperative management may result in persistent **extensor lag** [^1163jhHC] or mallet deformity [^1128yWwh] and can cause **DIP joint stiffness** [^112vSMiN]. **Nonunion is rare** [^113aN9G9], but skin irritation or breakdown from splinting can occur [^113FHkMa].

---

### Surgical management

- **Infection**: Pin tract or wound infection [^115hTnWM].
- **Hardware issues**: Irritation or prominence [^115jPb8t].
- **Stiffness**: DIP joint stiffness [^1163jhHC].
- **Nonunion**: Rare [^114irBzr].

---

## Prognosis and functional outcomes

Nonoperative management generally yields good results [^112vSMiN] with minimal lag and high satisfaction when criteria are met. In contrast, **surgical** management also achieves good outcomes with stable fixation and early motion [^114irBzr] but carries a higher complication risk than nonoperative care.

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Fragment size** | **Displacement** | **Subluxation** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 30% | < 2 mm | None | Nonoperative (splinting) [^114dn63M] |
| > 30% | > 2 mm | Present | Surgical (extension block pinning or hook plate) [^115hTnWM] [^114irBzr] |

---

For small, minimally displaced dorsal avulsion fractures with intra-articular extension, **nonoperative management** is preferred [^114dn63M]; surgery is reserved for larger fragments, significant displacement, or volar subluxation [^115hTnWM]. Early motion [^1163jhHC] and **hand therapy** are critical to optimize function and limit stiffness.

### Effectiveness of Quickcast versus custom-fabricated thermoplastic orthosis immobilization for the treatment of mallet fingers: A randomized clinical trial [^113FHkMa]. Hand (2022). High credibility.

Mallet finger is a common injury involving a detachment of the terminal extensor tendon from the distal phalanx. This injury is usually treated with immobilization in a cast or splint. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of mallet fingers treated with either a cast (Quickcast) or a traditional thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis.
- **Methods**: Our study was a prospective, assessor-blinded, single-center randomized clinical trial involving 58 consecutive patients diagnosed with either bony or soft tissue mallet finger treated with immobilization. Patients were randomized to receive either an Orfilight thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis or a Quickcast orthosis. They were evaluated at 3, 6, and 10 weeks for bony mallets and 4, 8, and 12 weeks for soft tissue mallets. Skin complications, pain with orthosis, compliance, need for surgical intervention, and extensor lag were compared between the two groups.
- **Results**: Both bony and soft tissue mallet finger patients experienced significantly fewer skin complications (33% vs. 64%) and less pain (11.2 vs. 21.6) when using Quickcast compared to an Orfilight thermoplastic custom-fabricated orthosis. The soft tissue mallet group revealed a greater difference in pain, favoring Quickcast (6.2 vs. 22). No significant difference in final extensor droop or need for secondary surgery was found between the two groups.
- **Conclusions**: Quickcast immobilization for the treatment of mallet finger demonstrated fewer skin complications and less pain when compared with Orfilight custom-fabricated splints.

### The hook plate technique for fixation of phalangeal avulsion fractures [^114irBzr]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). High credibility.

Avulsion fractures of the phalanges involve small osseous fragments that are usually attached to structures necessary for the stability or movement of the joint. Satisfactory healing of the fracture to preserve joint function may require open reduction and internal fixation, which can be challenging because of the small size of the fragments.
- **Methods**: We used a hook plate fashioned from a 1.3-mm Synthes titanium plate in thirteen patients with a phalangeal avulsion fracture. Four patients had an avulsion fracture of the volar plate with dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation; four had a dorsal avulsion fracture of the extensor central slip from the middle phalanx; three had a flexor digitorum profundus avulsion fracture from the distal phalanx; and two had an avulsion fracture of the phalangeal insertion of the collateral ligament.
- **Results**: Union without complications was achieved in all cases. After an average duration of follow-up of seventeen months, all patients had a good to excellent result, and the average total interphalangeal motion was 149°.
- **Conclusions**: This indirect fixation technique produces stable fixation allowing early active finger motion.

### Nonsurgical treatment of closed mallet finger fractures [^112vSMiN]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical repair of closed mallet finger fractures has been favored for displaced injuries involving more than one-third of the articular surface and for injuries with palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx. This study analyzed the results of nonsurgical treatment for closed and displaced mallet finger fractures with greater than one-third articular surface damage, comparing cases with and without concomitant terminal joint subluxation.
- **Methods**: Twenty-two closed mallet finger fractures in 21 patients who were treated nonsurgically and involving more than one-third of the articular surface were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were treated by continuous extension splinting of the distal interphalangeal joint for a mean of 5.5 weeks. The average patient age at the time of injury was 35.2 years, with a mean delay to treatment of 21 days. Nine cases showed a reduced distal interphalangeal joint at presentation (type IB), and 13 cases showed palmar subluxation of the distal phalanx (type IIB). Complications from splinting were limited to 2 cases of transient skin irritation. All patients returned for new finger radiographs and completed a survey to assess pain, function, and satisfaction at an average of 24.5 months after injury.
- **Results**: Patients expressed negligible pain, minimal difficulties with activities of daily living and work, relatively high satisfaction with finger function and treatment outcome, but only marginal satisfaction with finger appearance. The differences between type IB and type IIB cases were not significant.

### The diagnosis and management of mallet finger injuries [^115CSzgE]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Mallet finger is a common injury of the extensor tendon insertion, causing an extension lag of the distal interphalangeal joint.
- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of mallet finger injuries, focusing on the indications and outcomes of surgical intervention.
- **Results**: Nonoperative management has been advocated for almost all mallet finger injuries; however, complex injuries are usually treated surgically. There is still controversy regarding the absolute indications for surgical intervention.
- **Conclusions**: Although surgery is generally indicated in the case of mallet fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface, as well as in all patients who develop volar subluxation of the distal phalanx, a significant advantage of surgical management even in those complicated cases has yet to be clearly proven.

### Modification of the extension block Kirschner wire technique for mallet fractures [^115hTnWM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

A modification of the extension block Kirschner wire technique that is used for closed reduction of mallet fractures is described. Eighteen mallet avulsion fractures of the distal phalanx treated with this modification were included in this prospective study. The fingers affected were nine small fingers, eight ring fingers, and one long finger. Surgical indications included fractures involving more than 33% of the articular surface and fractures associated with subluxation of the distal phalanx that could not be corrected by closed reduction. The average joint surface involvement was 39.8%. At follow-up, only one patient had pain, and that was graded as minimal. Objectively, congruous and satisfactory joint surfaces were present in 17 patients. No patient had pseudarthrosis. The average active flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint was 81.1 degrees, and the average extensor lag was 1.6 degrees. Neither pin tract infections nor migration of the pins occurred. The average follow-up was 27.3 months. This modification increased the range of motion at the distal interphalangeal joint and showed a trend toward reduced permanent extensor lag when compared with the original method. This technique should be considered when treatment of the mallet fracture is being planned using the extension block Kirschner wire technique.

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^113nkXjE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Toe injuries are common in the emergency department, and most are treated conservatively. In some circumstances, these injuries can present as a physeal fracture with concomitant soft-tissue injury affecting the nail bed, resulting in a hidden open fracture. To adequately treat these patients, a high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose and treat the open fractures and to prevent complications such as infection, osteomyelitis, malunion, and premature physeal arrest.

We report a case of a patient admitted to the hospital with a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the distal phalanx of the hallux. After confirming the diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started, and the fracture was reduced and fixed.

The literature on this entity is sparse, and most management protocols are based on its hand equivalent — the Seymour fracture — emphasizing the low threshold for treating these lesions as an open fracture.

### Repair of chronic mallet finger deformity using Mitek micro ARC bone anchor [^116rsuke]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Surgical correction of chronic mallet finger caused by terminal tendon disruption was carried out in 22 patients. The distal stump of the tendon was fixed to the base of the distal phalanx with a Mitek micro arc bone anchor. In all patients, the mallet finger deformity was corrected. There were 15 patients with excellent results, 5 with good results, and 2 with fair results, with none experiencing a poor outcome. No further treatment was needed. The Mitek micro arc bone anchor system is a reliable alternative for the treatment of chronic mallet finger deformity without proximal interphalangeal hyperextension.

### Trans-web approach for fixation of avulsion fractures of the proximal phalangeal base: Report of two cases [^115vrzgK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Although displaced fractures of the lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx can be treated surgically, previously described approaches to the fracture are not necessarily easily performed. We describe a trans-web approach to the metacarpophalangeal joint and report 2 clinical cases. This technique allows the fracture fragments to be reduced and fixed with minimal risk of damage to the adjacent structures.

### Hand fractures: Indications, the tried and true and new innovations [^116UZC5z]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Hand fractures are the second most common fracture of the upper extremity, and management of patients with these injuries is common for most hand surgery practices. In this article, we outline the principles of management with a special focus on injuries that are either common or complex. We also highlight recent innovations relevant to these injuries. From this cross-section of contemporary evidence on phalangeal and metacarpal fracture treatment, a trend toward minimally invasive surgery with immediate postoperative mobilization has been noted. Additionally, there is an increased use of wide-awake anesthesia, along with ongoing investigation and innovation in the biomechanics and treatment of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations.

### Chronic recurrent dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger: Case report [^115QBprt]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

We present a case of chronic redislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint of the little finger following traumatic dislocation. Intraoperative findings revealed a complete avulsion of the volar plate from the base of the distal phalanx, accompanied by laxity of the ulnar collateral ligament. The volar plate was reattached using the suture anchor technique and further reinforced with the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon.

### Outcomes after surgically managed oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures: A comparison of closed-reduction percutaneous pinning and open-reduction internal fixation with lag screws [^116gnxZQ]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures are common orthopedic injuries. When unstable and without substantial comminution, treatment options include closed-reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) and open-reduction internal fixation using lag screws (ORIF-screws). The aims of this study are primarily to compare the functional outcomes and complication rates between these techniques and secondarily to assess potential factors affecting outcomes after surgery.
- **Methods**: All patients with long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures treated surgically within a single orthopedic institution from 2010 to 2017 were identified. Outcome measures and complications were assessed at the final follow-up.
- **Results**: Sixty patients were included in the study with a mean time to the final follow-up of 41 weeks (range: 12–164 weeks). Thirty-four patients (57%) were treated with CRPP and 26 patients (43%) with ORIF-screws. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score across both fixation types was 8 (range: 0–43) and did not differ significantly between the two groups. Mean proximal interphalangeal extension at the final follow-up was 9° short of full extension after CRPP and 13° short of full extension after ORIF-screws. The rates of flexion contracture and extensor lag were 15% and 41% in the CRPP group compared with 12% and 68% in the ORIF-screws group. Reoperation rates and complication rates did not differ significantly between fixation strategies.
- **Conclusions**: Acceptable outcomes can be achieved after surgical fixation of long oblique extra-articular proximal phalanx fractures using either CRPP or ORIF-screws.

### Extension block pinning for the treatment of a dorsal fracture dislocation of the distal interphalangeal joint: Case report [^117KtKq2]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

A relatively rare case of dorsal dislocation of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint associated with a compression fracture of the volar base of the distal phalanx is presented. An extension block pin was used to maintain the reduction of the DIP joint during active flexion and extension exercises after surgery. At the 49-month follow-up, the clinical results and radiographic findings were satisfactory.

### Pediatric phalanx fractures: unique challenges and pitfalls [^1168ASxM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

The hand is the most frequently injured part of the body in children. Most pediatric hand fractures can be treated by nonoperative means with good results. However, a subset of fractures requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention. This paper reviews several pediatric phalangeal fracture types that must be recognized and treated appropriately to minimize complications and disability. These injuries challenge the general conception that pediatric fractures universally do well with minimal intervention.
- **Important concepts**: (1) Phalangeal fractures in children can differ considerably from other pediatric fractures; (2) Phalangeal fractures in children can be very different from those in adults. Tolerance of displacement may be small in juxtaarticular or intraarticular fractures, and healing is rapid in phalangeal fractures. This allows displaced fractures to develop into malunions in a short period, resulting in deformity and dysfunction.

Careful clinical examination of any suspected phalanx fracture in children is essential to appropriate treatment of these potentially problematic injuries. This includes adequate radiographic evaluation with multiple views of the suspected fracture site and a thorough examination of possible open injuries.

### Common finger fractures and dislocations [^1178s5KG]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Finger fractures and dislocations are common injuries that are often managed by family physicians. A systematic physical examination is imperative to avoid complications and poor outcomes following these injuries. Radiography, commonly anteroposterior, true lateral, and oblique views, is required in the evaluation of finger fractures and dislocations. Dorsal dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint is the most common type of finger dislocation. Finger dislocations should be reduced as quickly as possible, and soft tissue injuries should be treated appropriately. Referral to a hand specialist is needed if a dislocation cannot be reduced, is unstable following reduction, or involves significant ligament, tendon, or soft tissue injury. Some common finger fractures can be treated conservatively with appropriate reduction and immobilization. Referral to a hand specialist is required if a fracture is unstable, involves a large portion (greater than 30 percent) of the intra-articular surface, or has significant rotation.

### Current concepts: Mallet finger [^114dn63M]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Loss of the extensor mechanism at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint leads to mallet finger, also known as baseball finger or drop finger. This condition can result from either a tendon substance disruption or a bony avulsion.

- **Soft tissue mallet finger**: This occurs due to a rupture of the extensor tendon in Zone 1.
- **Bony mallet finger**: This is the result of an avulsion of the extensor tendon from the distal phalanx, with a small fragment of bone attached to the avulsed tendon.

Mallet finger causes an imbalance in the distribution of the extensor force between the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and DIP joints. If left untreated, mallet finger may lead to a swan neck deformity due to PIP joint hyperextension and DIP joint flexion. Most mallet finger injuries can be managed non-surgically, although surgery is occasionally recommended for either an acute or a chronic mallet finger, or for salvage of failed prior treatment.

### Do computerized tomography scans change management in carpometacarpal dislocations and fracture-dislocations [^114hVMVV]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

The treating physician must maintain a high index of suspicion for this injury, as such cases are frequently missed; a delayed diagnosis can result in substantial dysfunction and worse surgical outcomes. There is no consensus on the use of advanced imaging for characterizing potentially operative concomitant injuries in the setting of CMCD/FD. Previous studies have shown that the sensitivity of X-rays for diagnosing concomitant carpal injuries is lacking, with up to 50% of initial wrist injuries being undiagnosed with plain films. These findings suggest that CT is a useful adjunct if there is clinical suspicion of additional injury.

This study aims to answer the question: Is obtaining a CT scan in a patient with a CMCD/FD likely to change that patient's management? We demonstrate that one should have a high suspicion for concomitant injuries in both low- and high-velocity mechanisms that cause a CMCD/FD in the hand. In comparison to plain films alone, obtaining a preoperative CT scan frequently led to new bony injury diagnoses and changed operative management just over half of the time. These diagnoses ranged from fractures and fracture-dislocations of surrounding metacarpals to fractures of the carpal bones. These findings suggest that CT scans are a useful adjunct to identify clinically relevant injuries in patients with CMCD/FD, even in the setting of low-velocity trauma. In particular, damage to the second and third CMCJ was associated with a high proportion of concomitant injuries, suggesting that injuries capable of disrupting these highly stable joints are likely to occur.

### The versatile hook plate in avulsion fractures of the hand [^115jPb8t]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Avulsion fractures can pose technical difficulties for surgical fixation. The fragments are often small and around finger joints, with access being difficult due to the attachment of ligaments or tendons. Traditionally, these have been treated using K wires, lag screws, or pullout sutures. Hook plates were originally described for the operative management of mallet fractures. We have been using hook plates in our unit for over 10 years. However, over the years, we have extended their use to other avulsion fractures in the hand, such as proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, central slip avulsions, flexor digitorum profundus avulsions, and collateral ligament avulsions. The aim of this article is to describe the technique of fabricating a hook plate and using it for avulsion fractures in the hand. A few illustrative cases are discussed along with a review of the literature.
- **Methods**: In a retrospective review of our use of hook plates in hand fractures from 2008 to 2014, a total of 63 cases were identified from the hospital database. There were 35 cases of mallet fractures, 16 cases of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, 5 cases of flexor digitorum profundus avulsion fractures, 5 cases of central slip avulsions, and 2 collateral ligament avulsions.
- **Results**: All fractures healed well with this technique, with no biomechanical failures and a good functional outcome. Plates needed removal in a total of 25 cases, of which 14 were in mallet fractures. Thirteen (21%) cases suffered complications, with the majority again related to mallet fractures.

### Open physeal fracture of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^112oX8mB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Open physeal fractures of the distal phalanx of the hallux are the less frequently described counterpart to similar fractures of the finger, known by the eponym "Seymour fracture". Displaced Salter-Harris phalangeal fractures often present with an accompanying nailbed or soft tissue injury. These fractures frequently occur during the summer months when open-toe footwear is worn; however, they can also occur indoors. The injury typically results from a direct axial load on the toe, or "stubbing", which causes the fracture and associated soft tissue injury.

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent negative outcomes, such as osteomyelitis, malunion, nonunion, or premature growth arrest. In this article, we present a case of a 12-year-old male who sustained an open physeal fracture of the distal phalanx after "stubbing" his great toe on a bedpost. His injury was initially misdiagnosed at an urgent care facility, causing a delay in appropriate intervention and necessitating a surgical procedure. Additionally, we review existing literature discussing these infrequently reported injuries and present key points regarding the diagnosis and management of this injury in the emergency department.

### Posttraumatic thumb reconstruction [^112TXDrL]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

After reading this article, the reader should be able to:

- **Discuss the critical anatomic features of the thumb**: These features affect reconstructive decision-making.
- **Define the goals of reconstruction**.
- **Discuss an algorithm for thumb reconstruction**: This is according to the level of amputation.
- **Understand the role of prosthetics in thumb reconstruction**.

The function of the thumb is critical to overall hand function. Uniquely endowed with anatomic features that allow circumduction and opposition, the thumb enables activities of pinch, grasp, and fine manipulation essential in daily life. The destruction of the thumb secondary to trauma represents a much more significant loss than would result from the loss of any other digit. Therefore, significant effort has been focused on thumb reconstruction. Numerous techniques have been described, ranging from simple osteoplastic techniques to complex microsurgical procedures. With an appreciation of the unique anatomic properties of the thumb, the hand surgeon is better able to understand the goals of thumb reconstruction and to develop an algorithm for thumb reconstruction. With such an understanding, an individualized reconstructive plan can be developed for each patient.

A great many options are available for posttraumatic thumb reconstruction. Optimal results are obtained by pursuing an organized and logical approach to reconstruction based upon the level of tissue loss. Reconstruction methods depend on the location of the amputation and range from homodigital and heterodigital flaps to par…

### Double-strand suturing fixation technique for treatment of acute volar plate avulsion fracture of the base of the middle phalanx [^114UbENA]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

A new suturing technique for the treatment of acute volar plate avulsion fracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint is reported. Because this technique, which consists of a double-strand suture, is rigid enough and does not obstruct joint motion, early motion exercise can be initiated. This approach only demands simple skills similar to conventional K-wire fixation. Furthermore, the removal of fixation material is not necessary.

### Complication rates in patients with classic and radiographic variants of Seymour fractures [^112YggtY]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Low credibility.

At a tertiary-care, level 1 pediatric trauma center, we have observed fractures of the distal phalanx involving the physis, accompanied by nail bed injuries, that are distinct from the classic description of the Seymour fracture. We investigated the time to definitive management and the associated morbidity of these Seymour fracture variants compared with classically described Seymour fractures. We hypothesize that these Seymour variants are similarly problematic in terms of complications and delays to definitive treatment and thus warrant increased awareness.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with distal phalanx fractures involving the physis and associated nail bed injuries treated with operative intervention at a single pediatric specialty institution over a 9-year period. Radiographs and clinical photographs were reviewed to determine if the patient presented with a classic Seymour fracture or variant. Primary outcomes included time from injury to definitive treatment and complication rate.

- **Results**: Of the 66 Seymour fractures identified in the chart review, 36 (55%) were identified as classic Seymour fractures and 30 (45%) were identified as variants. The mean time to operative intervention in the classic and variant groups was 7.3 days versus 12.7 days (P = 0.216). The complication rates in the classic and variant groups were 11.1% versus 23.3% (P = 0.185), with infections accounting for nearly all complications identified. Overall infection rates for the classic and variant cohorts were 8.3% and 20.0% (P = 0.169).

### Intramedullary screw fixation of proximal phalangeal fractures: Short- to medium-term outcomes [^11713QN6]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Hand fractures are common and account for up to a third of all fractures presenting to emergency departments, with phalangeal fractures occurring more commonly than those involving the metacarpals. Injury to the proximal phalanx comprises 39% of all phalangeal fractures and poses a significant financial and health burden to both the individual and the community; thus, optimal management is key.

The treatment objective once the proximal phalanx is fractured is to ensure sufficient stability in a satisfactorily reduced position to allow early mobilization, thus preventing the formation of adhesions that may limit range of motion and function. Many of these fractures are stable and can be treated nonoperatively. However, fracture pattern and mechanism, as well as patient characteristics and functional requirements, may necessitate surgical intervention. Rigid fixation constructs are generally preferred to nonrigid fixation as they facilitate precise alignment and earlier mobilization. Stable fixation is only one determinant of outcome, with invasiveness, degree of soft tissue dissection, and cost also important considerations.

Intramedullary screw fixation of phalangeal and metacarpal fractures has gained popularity as a method of providing rigid internal fixation with minimum tendon disturbance, allowing early mobilization and rehabilitation. Novel methods of instrumentation are broadening the indications. Screws may be inserted via retrograde intra-articular, antegrade intra-articular, and antegrade transarticular routes, with the choice determined by specific case factors.

### Current concepts in treatment of fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^115mVNdo]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocations are common injuries that require expedient and attentive treatment for the best outcomes. Management can range from protective splinting and early mobilization to complex surgery. Concepts surrounding the management of these injuries are reviewed in this article.
- **Methods**: A literature review was performed on all recent articles pertaining to proximal interphalangeal joint fracture-dislocation, with a specific focus on middle phalangeal base fractures. Where appropriate, older articles or articles on closely related injury types were included for completeness. The methodology and outcomes of each study were analyzed.
- **Results**: When small avulsion fractures are present, good results are routinely obtained with reduction and early mobilization of stable injuries. Strategies for managing unstable dorsal fracture-dislocations have evolved over time. A variety of techniques have been developed to provide early stability, including closed, percutaneous, external, and internal fixation methods. Although each of these techniques can be successful in skilled hands, none has been subjected to rigorous, prospective, comparative trials. Volar dislocations fare less well, with significant loss of motion reported in many studies. Pilon fractures represent the most complicated injuries, and the return of normal motion is not expected.

### The central slip fracture: Results of operative treatment of volar fracture subluxations/dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^115y2Dkn]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Fractures of the base of the middle phalanx are particularly challenging. Dorsal fracture-subluxations/dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are relatively common, but the volar fracture-subluxation/dislocation, the so-called "central slip fracture", is quite rare. This study presents our experience with surgically treated patients with central slip fracture subluxation/dislocation with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. We hypothesized that the majority of patients with a central slip fracture-subluxation/dislocation have poor outcomes.
- **Methods**: Thirteen patients with central slip fracture-subluxations/dislocation were identified from departmental billing records between 2003 and 2013. Nine patients completed the study follow-up examination and 8 were included in the final analysis. Clinical data assessed included age at injury, sex, mechanism of injury, injured digit, type of treatment, additional intervention(s), complications, length of follow-up, and range of motion follow-up. Fluoroscopic images and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand surveys were obtained at study follow-up.
- **Results**: All patients underwent at least 1 surgery and 7 of 8 underwent open reduction. The average age at the time of injury was 41 years (range, 25–60 years). All injuries were closed. The average follow-up was 43 months (range, 17–67 months). Average passive and active range of motion of the PIP joint at follow-up were 62° and 54°, respectively. Six of 8 patients developed radiographic evidence of arthritic change and 4 experienced an outcome that…

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^115h3HE9]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

**Methods**: A retrospective chart review from 2010 to 2020 (IRB 1–1504538–1) was performed at two institutions for cases with acute presentation of dorsal fracture-dislocations of the middle phalanx (P2) with an intact dorsal cortex and disrupted volar articular surface. Pilon fractures of P2 with complete disruption of the articular surface from the shaft, which were surgically treated with an internal joint stabilizer, were also included. Cases with chronic presentation and acute injuries that were surgically treated with other fixation constructs were not included. Range of motion (ROM) at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint was collected for each patient. Complications were compiled, including infection, device loosening or failure, and secondary procedures including revision surgery and device removal.

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^113wdLoT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The original description of this injury was initially highlighted by Pinckney et al. They describe it as a compound injury of a Salter Harris type I fracture that, when mistreated, evolves into an infection process of the toe.

These injuries result from a forced hyperflexion of the distal phalanx, suggesting that the vector of tension disrupts the dorsal toe structures. In fact, the layer of skin between the nail and bone is thinnest directly above the physis, where the germinal matrix of the nail (specialised inner layers of epidermis) and a shallow layer of dermis at the base of the nail easily disrupt, allowing the occurrence of an open physeal fracture.

These lesions may be hidden from view because the skin and toenails of the paediatric population are often very soiled. For this reason, the risk of contamination and infection is enhanced. Additionally, late recognition and treatment make it prone to complications such as cellulitis and osteomyelitis.
- **Signs to raise concern**: Longer nail length or longer length of the lunula compared with the contralateral side, indicating that the nail is positioned over the nail fold. Bleeding around the nail at the time of injury and laceration proximal to the nail fold can also be indicators. A physeal fracture on the distal phalanx should suggest an open fracture unless proven otherwise. Clinicians should be aware that lacerations of the nail and nail bed with an apparently normal radiograph, in the scenario of a hyperflexion mechanism, are manifestations of a possible Salter Harris type I fracture.

### Avulsion injuries of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon [^1153EcMx]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). High credibility.

Avulsions of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon may involve tendon retraction into the palm and fractures of the distal phalanx. Although various repair techniques have been described, none has emerged as superior. A review of the literature provides evidence-based premises for treatment: multi-strand repairs perform better; gapping may occur with pullout suture-dorsal button repairs; and failure due to bone pullout remains a concern with suture anchor methods. Clinical prognostic factors include the extent of proximal tendon retraction, chronicity of the avulsion, and the presence and size of associated osseous fragments. Patients must be counseled appropriately regarding anticipated outcomes, the importance of postoperative rehabilitation, and potential complications. Treatment alternatives for chronic avulsion injury remain patient-specific and include nonsurgical management, distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis, and staged reconstruction.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^113mboak]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Once this method has been selected, the surgeon decides whether the device will be placed on the radial or the ulnar side of the digit. Placing the incision on the external aspect of a border digit is both technically easier and avoids wound irritation against the adjacent finger during rehabilitation. Conversely, there is the possibility of developing an undesired or dysesthetic scar on the exposed border of the index or small finger.

The injured joint is anatomically reduced (Figure 2). Reduction can be achieved in either a closed or an open fashion. Temporary fixation is applied with a small K-wire — usually 0.028 inch. This wire is typically placed through the dorsum of P2 and into the condyles of the proximal phalanx (Figure 3a). In the proximal phalanx, the desired K-wire position is either slightly dorsal or slightly volar to the PIP axis to prevent interference with the axis pin.
- **Figure 2**: Lateral fluoroscopy of a comminuted unstable fracture of the base of the middle phalanx, with applied longitudinal traction.
- **Figure 3**: Lateral fluoroscopy of (a) provisional fixation with Kirschner wires following closed reduction and (b) insertion of the axis pin through the condylar section of the proximal phalanx.

Before or after obtaining reduction, a mid-axial incision is made, spanning the length of P2 and the distal third of the proximal phalanx. After dissection and retraction of the volar and dorsal skin flaps, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve must be mobilized and should be preserved. Access to both the fracture and the PIP joint is attained by releasing the flaps.

### Quantitative 3-dimensional CT analyses of fractures of the middle phalanx base [^117XdU8W]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Quantitative 3-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) analyses can provide a more detailed understanding of fracture morphology. For fracture-dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint, the extent of fragmentation of the volar lip of the middle phalanx — a factor that might influence treatment — is not always apparent from radiographs. We hypothesized that there is no correlation between the number of fracture fragments and the percentage of articular surface area involved in intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx using quantitative 3DCT analyses.
- **Methods**: We used 13 computed tomography scans with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm or less to create 3-dimensional models of 15 intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx in 13 patients. We resized 3-dimensional models of a non-fractured middle phalanx of the same hand to fit the fractured middle phalanx in order to approximate the size and shape of the fractured middle phalanx in its pre-injury state. We created a heatmap to demonstrate the location of the fractured articular surface.
- **Results**: With the number of scans available, we did not find a significant correlation between the percentage of articular surface area involved and the number of fracture fragments. The median percentage of articular surface area involved was 46% (range, 21–90%). The heatmap demonstrated that the radio-volar side of the articular surface seems to be more involved than the ulnar-volar side in intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx.
- **Conclusion**: Quantitative 3DCT analysis of fractures provides detailed insight into fracture morphology and potential treatment pathways.

### Fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx in children: Remodeling of malunion in the radioulnar plane with a diaphyseal axis-metacarpal head angle of 156° to 163° [^1112bTKm]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The diaphyseal axis-metacarpal head angle (DHA) measures the angle between the axis of the proximal phalanx and the center of the metacarpal head. In unfractured fingers, the normal DHA ranges from 177.1° to 180.0°. The angle may be used to quantify the degree of lateral displacement of pediatric fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx. Previous authors have shown that if the postreduction x-rays show an angle greater than 169°, remodeling with normalization of the DHA is expected to occur in children. The degree of remodeling of more severe angulations is unknown.
- **Patients and methods**: This is a retrospective study over the last five years that identified eight late referrals (4–6 weeks after injury) of inadequately reduced pediatric fractures of the base of the proximal phalanx with a postreduction DHA of 156° to 163°. At the time of presentation to the author, there was lateral deviation of the finger, and the fracture site was not tender, indicating malunion. All patients were offered surgery, but this was refused by the parents. Follow-up appointments to the clinic were made, and the DHAs were serially measured to investigate the degree of remodeling.
- **Results**: Seven patients had normalization of the DHA (i.e. an angle > 177°) between 9 and 18 months. In the remaining patient, the DHA was 175.7° at 2 years.
- **Conclusions**: The study shows adequate remodeling of severe residual angular deformities (DHA of 156°-163°). The clinical implication of this finding is regarding late referrals with no tenderness at the fracture site. In these cases, refracturing can be reconsidered if further intervention is required.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes [^114UF4ui]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric phalangeal neck fractures can be challenging to treat. Displaced fractures are often unstable, and the potential exists for nonunion and poor remodeling. Many authors recommend percutaneous pin fixation of these fractures with either open or closed reduction to reduce those risks. Delayed presentation of these fractures provides additional challenges as a closed reduction may not be sufficient to achieve adequate alignment, and open reduction increases the risk for postoperative stiffness and other complications.

Two previous authors have described AVN (avascular necrosis) complications as a result of open reduction. To mitigate this risk, some surgeons avoid open treatment until no other alternative is viable. Waters et al. described their treatment of eight patients with percutaneous osteoclasis through the dorsal callus for malunions. They reported good results with no cases of AVN. Nearly all reports discuss AVN in the setting of closed injuries with open treatment, and few reports exist regarding the rate after open injuries. Our results show that opening the fracture either surgically or at the time of injury increases the postoperative risk of AVN compared with closed treatment. The OI and COR study groups had higher proportions of high-energy mechanisms, including crush injuries and concomitant injuries, than the CCR group. This supports that the differences in outcomes are related to the higher amount of initial trauma that each finger sustains. Soft tissue injury from the initial mechanism, as well as the surgical procedure, increases the risk for stiffness.

### The impact of microsurgery on the treatment of ring avulsion injuries [^117H8bQz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Treating ring avulsion injuries continues to challenge the reconstructive hand surgeon. The complex operation draws from plastic surgery and orthopedic surgery principles to provide soft-tissue coverage, skeletal fixation, tendon repair, and neurovascular reconstruction. Furthermore, the application of microsurgical techniques has enabled the revascularization and replantation of completely avulsed fingers.
- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 22 consecutive ring avulsion injuries — seven amputations, five replantations, and 10 revascularizations — from 1987 to 2015 was performed by a single senior surgeon (D.T.W.C.).
- **Results**: Of these 22 ring avulsions, 10 revascularizations, five replantations, and seven amputations (five because of clinical factors, and two because of patient request) were performed. None of the 15 replantations and revascularizations resulted in loss of the ring finger or necrosis of the revascularized tip.
- **Conclusions**: With proper patient selection, appropriate level of injury identification, and meticulous surgical execution, the restoration of form and function to the hand is feasible in ring avulsion injuries.
- **Clinical question/level of evidence**: Therapeutic, IV.

### Operative fractures of the phalangeal head and neck in children-does open reduction affect outcomes [^1118BxFC]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Low credibility.

Hand fractures are common in the pediatric population, comprising an estimated 15% of fractures seen in the emergency department, and of these fractures, most occur in the phalanges. Ten percent to 15% of pediatric phalangeal fractures are phalangeal head or neck sub-types.

Pediatric phalangeal neck fractures are described as inherently unstable with poor remodeling potential because they occur at the distal end of the phalanges, away from the physis. Al-Qattan originally described and developed a classification and treatment algorithm for phalangeal neck fractures, with Type I being nondisplaced, Type II displaced with bony contact, and Type III displaced without any bony contact (see Figure 1). He recommended pin fixation for unstable, displaced Type II and all Type III fractures, with a strong preference for open reduction. Most displaced phalangeal head and neck fractures in children are treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP), but if healing and early callus render closed reduction impossible, these fractures require anatomic reduction with either open or percutaneous osteoclasis and percutaneous pinning. Additional indications for open reduction include the failure of conservative treatment, unsuccessful closed reduction, and delayed presentation with impending malunion.

### Hook plate as a treatment for flexor digitorum profundus avulsion types II and III [^1118RA61]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Avulsion fracture types II and III of flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), also called Jersey Finger, in flexor zone 1, are an uncommon pathology requiring surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether hook miniplates were an accessible and reliable option to repair FDP avulsion types II and III. Between July and August 2018, we treated two consecutive patients with zone 1 Leddy-Packer type II and III FDP injuries using hook plates and 1.2 × 7 mm screws included in the Medartis Aptus Hand fixation system set. The patients were aged 37 and 39 years, a man and a woman, respectively.

At the end of the follow-up, we evaluated the Visual Analog Scale, range of motion, grip strength, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand. Both patients completed 12 months of follow-up with excellent functional and radiological results. Neither presented complications or residual disability. This injury has been treated with a wide range of surgical techniques, including anchor suture, pullout button sutures, screws, and plates. However, due to the difficulty in surgical fixation of fragments around finger joints, limited access to ligaments and tendons, and the lack of cases, none of the techniques have emerged as a clear option above others. Hook plates placed in the distal phalanx emerge as a surgical treatment for FDP avulsion types II and III in flexor zone 1 with excellent clinical outcomes.

### Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint [^1113bcSc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). High credibility.

Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint encompass a spectrum of injury severity, ranging from those requiring minimal intervention to those necessitating advanced reconstructive surgery for optimal outcomes. Three fracture-dislocation patterns are recognized: dorsal, volar, and pilon. An acceptable outcome depends on achieving and maintaining a well-aligned and well-reduced joint, re-establishing normal joint kinematics, and restoring motion. While anatomic articular surface reduction is desirable, it is not absolutely necessary for a good outcome. Treatment depends on both the type of injury and patient-specific factors. An optimal outcome for a specific injury is predicated on the expedient diagnosis and recognition of injury severity, which enables the initiation of appropriate management.

### Delayed extended "midthenar" flap for reconstruction of total fingertip avulsion injury and a proposal of ideal postoperative immobilization for a palmar flap [^1166mXVn]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

An avulsion injury through the base of the distal phalanx of the ring finger, with a large projecting tip of exposed bone, was treated using a delayed extended midthenar flap. The midthenar flap, when delayed at the first stage of a consecutive two-stage operation, can provide extended flap length to wrap around the large projecting tip of the exposed bone at the second stage. This flap is particularly useful for middle and ring fingertip injuries because all thumb joint motions are unrestricted during the immobilization period.

To reduce discomfort during immobilization between the two stages of the palmar flap operation, the authors also introduced a "relaxed flexion position" immobilization technique.

### Severe mutilating injuries with complex macroamputations of the upper extremity - is it worth the effort [^1133x6zU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

- **Preoperative condition**: The study discusses a case involving a 26-year-old male with an amputated left hand at the wrist level due to a multilevel and avulsion injury through a plastic pellet machine. The injuries included a subtotal amputation of the index finger and complete amputations of the middle and ring fingers. The thumb remained uninjured, while the little finger had a radial soft tissue defect. Terms used include (PP) = black/white plastic pallets, (DRUJ) = distal radio-ulnar joint, (FT) = flexor tendons, and (M) = N. medianus.

- **Medical imagery and findings**: Preoperative X-rays depicted a complete fracture of the distal radius and ulna, with the distal radio-ulnar joint lying transverse. The condition of the left lower upper extremity, along with the amputated hand, was analyzed using terms like (D1) = digit 1 and (D5) = digit 5. A notable fracture was observed in the radius (R) and ulna (U).
- **Postoperative observations**: Post-surgery, the replanted hand showed preservation of the thumb (D1) and little finger (D5), while the index, middle, and ring fingers were not replantable. The remaining defect was initially covered by a negative pressure wound dressing and later, after five days during a second operation, with split-skin grafts.
- **Recovery and function**: Nine months postoperatively, the replanted hand allowed the patient minimal flexion and adduction of the thumb, enabling them to grip objects. An X-ray taken at the same time showed (U) = ulna, (R) = radius, and (RSL) = an atypical RSL-arthrodesis of the left wrist.

### Proximal phalanx fracture management [^117KtizW]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of proximal phalangeal fracture management is to allow for fracture healing to occur in acceptable alignment while maintaining gliding motion of the extensor and flexor tendons.
- **Methods**: We reviewed the most current literature on various treatment methods for proximal phalanx fractures, focusing on the indications and outcomes of both nonoperative and operative interventions.
- **Results**: Stable fractures can be successfully treated nonoperatively, whereas unstable injuries benefit from surgery. Regardless of the surgical intervention employed, the overriding goal is to restore anatomy and impart enough stability to allow for early motion. The surgical dissection contributes to soft tissue scarring and should be minimized.
- **Conclusions**: Clinical success is achieved when acceptable fracture alignment and stability occur in the setting of unobstructed tendon gliding and early active range of motion.

### Consequences of avulsion fracture of the proximal phalanx caused by a technical failure of hallux valgus surgery [^112BbU32]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Several cases of avulsion fracture of the proximal phalanx of the big toe during the lateral capsular release procedure were observed; however, these fractures have not been reported as a complication of hallux valgus surgery. The purpose of the present study was to report the proximal phalanx base fracture as an unrecognized complication and to evaluate the clinical and radiographic consequences of this issue.

We retrospectively reviewed 225 feet that had undergone hallux valgus surgery involving proximal chevron osteotomy and distal soft tissue release from May 2009 to December 2012. Out of these 225 feet (198 patients), 12 (5.3%) developed proximal phalanx base fracture postoperatively. These patients were assigned to the fracture group, while the remaining patients were assigned to the nonfracture group. Patients were followed to observe whether the fractures united and whether degenerative changes developed at the first metatarsophalangeal joint because of this fracture.

The mean follow-up period was 36 months (range 12 to 72 months). All subjects in the fracture and nonfracture groups underwent weightbearing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the foot at the initial presentation and final follow-up point. The two groups were compared with respect to the hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, range of motion, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score, satisfaction, and degenerative changes. No significant differences were found in age, follow-up period, hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score.

### Surgical management of swan neck deformity following mallet finger injury: A review of 25 patients over 20 years [^116M9kyv]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Swan neck deformity develops as a sequela of chronic mallet finger. Surgical management can include soft tissue reconstruction or distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) fusion. Studies examining the incidence and management of posttraumatic swan neck deformity following mallet fracture are limited.
- **Methods**: A retrospective, single-institution review of patients undergoing surgical management of swan neck deformity following a traumatic mallet finger from 2000 to 2021 was performed. Patients with preexisting rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. Injury, preoperative clinical, and surgical characteristics were recorded along with postoperative outcomes and complications.
- **Results**: Twenty-five patients were identified who had surgical intervention for swan neck deformity. Sixty-four percent of mallet fingers were chronic. The median time to development of mallet finger was 2 months. Twelve (48%) mallet fingers were Doyle class I, 6 (24%) were class III, and 7 (28%) were class IVB. Forty percent of injuries failed nonoperative splinting trials. Sixteen (64%) underwent primary DIPJ arthrodesis, 8 (32%) underwent DIPJ pinning, and 1 underwent open reduction and internal fixation of mallet fracture. The complication rate was 50% overall, with 33% of surgeries experiencing major complications. The overall reoperation rate was 33%. Proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension improved by 11° on average. The median follow-up was 61.2 months.
- **Conclusions**: The development of symptomatic swan neck deformity following traumatic mallet finger injury is rare. All patients warrant an atte

### Epidemiology and management of 10,486 pediatric fractures in Shenzhen: Experience and lessons to be learnt [^111ngSCP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Fractures of the phalanges of fingers are a common type of pediatric fracture resulting from trauma in emergency departments and outpatient clinics, with a high annual incidence. A survey found a very low annual incidence of hand fractures among toddlers in the United Kingdom (34/100,000 children); nevertheless, this figure increases approximately 20-fold after the age of 10 years, reaching 663/100,000 in children aged 11–18 years. Many previous studies revealed that hand fractures were more common in boys than in girls, with 65–75% of fractures occurring in boys and a peak occurring around 9–14 years. However, among the 1112 cases of fractured phalanges of fingers in this study, which included 696 boys and 416 girls, the peak and trough ages of fracture occurrence were 3–6 years (469 cases) and 12–19 years (120 cases), respectively. This finding differed from those previously reported in the literature in other countries.

Epiphyseal fractures are a unique type of pediatric fracture, accounting for 15–30% of all pediatric fractures. The incidence of epiphyseal fractures is higher in boys than in girls and is more common in the upper limbs. Komura et al. found that, of all epiphyseal fractures, those of the distal radius are relatively common. Steinberg et al. showed that about 50% of epiphyseal fractures occurred in the proximal radius. Peterson et al. found that the most common site of epiphyseal fracture was the phalanges of the fingers. In the present study, epiphyseal fractures occurred in 1209 cases, accounting for 8.65% of the total number of fractures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute hand and wrist trauma [^112DVeLW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal radius fracture, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining one of the following imaging studies in adult patients with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma when radiographs indicate an acute wrist fracture:

- **Magnetic resonance arthrography**: This is a preferred imaging technique for detecting fine details in the wrist structure, crucial for identifying tendon or ligament injuries.
- **MRI without IV contrast**: MRI without contrast provides clear images of soft tissues, making it a viable method for evaluating ligament and tendon integrity without additional contrast agents.
- **CT arthrography**: This technique involves the injection of a contrast material into the joint, followed by CT scanning to provide detailed visualization of the wrist joint and surrounding structures.
- **Ultrasound**: A non-invasive and readily available option, ultrasound can be used to assess tendon and ligament conditions in the wrist, offering dynamic imaging capabilities.

### Irreducible fracture dislocation of a finger metacarpophalangeal joint: A case report [^1151t4bX]. Hand (2008). Low credibility.

A case of unusual displacement in a finger, with an avulsion fragment from the dorsal metacarpal head of the finger displaced in the palmar direction under the volar plate, is described. An 18-year-old woman presented with a complaint of difficulty flexing the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint of the right little finger following a fall onto the outstretched hand. Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was useful for diagnosing this condition. The use of both palmar and dorsal approaches was needed to reduce the displacement and to fix the bones with a single screw. Bone union was achieved, and the patient has been asymptomatic for more than 10 months.

### The outcomes of extension block pinning and nonsurgical management for mallet fracture [^113aN9G9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic results of patients with a mallet fracture involving more than one-third of the articular surface, but without a high degree of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint subluxation, treated with extension block pinning or nonsurgical management.
- **Methods**: Forty-nine patients with a mallet fracture involving more than one-third of the articular surface were reviewed. Twenty-six cases were treated using extension block pinning (surgery group), and 23 were treated nonsurgically (nonsurgical group). At the final follow-up, extension lag and flexion of the DIP joint of the affected digit were measured. Distal interphalangeal joint pain was rated using a visual analog scale, and the overall clinical outcomes were graded using Crawford's criteria. Complications, including nail deformity and dorsal prominence, were also assessed. The rate of DIP joint subluxation and fracture fragment size were radiographically evaluated.
- **Results**: Mean extension lag, flexion of the DIP joint, and mean visual analog pain scores were not significantly different in the two groups. Outcomes, as assessed using Crawford's criteria, were excellent in 5, good in 12, fair in 6, and poor in 3 in the surgery group; excellent in 2, good in 11, fair in 8, and poor in 2 in the nonsurgical group. Moreover, the frequency of nail deformity or dorsal prominence was similar in both groups. The rate of DIP subluxation and mean fracture fragment size were similar between the two groups. All the fractures had united by three months after injury in both groups.

### Do computerized tomography scans change management in carpometacarpal dislocations and fracture-dislocations [^114h8sH8]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Computed tomography scans significantly increased the overall number of diagnoses, χ² (1, N = 211) = 206.88, P < .001, with 40 additional diagnoses made by CT that were not seen on plain films. Nineteen patients (70.4%) who received a CT scan obtained a new diagnosis. The number of additional diagnoses found on CT did not change significantly by velocity of injury mechanism (P = .35).

The most clinically significant of these additional diagnoses included 10 additional CMCD/FD, 3 additional scaphoid fractures, and 1 additional hook of hamate fracture. A CMCD/FD of the ring and small fingers significantly changed the odds of having a carpal fracture, such that the odds of having any carpal fracture were 5.33 times greater with the ring finger CMCD/FD (B = 1.67, SE = 0.51, P = .001) and 0.23 times less with a small finger CMCD/FD (B = −1.46, SE = 0.71, P = .04).

In addition, CMCD/FD of the long finger trended toward significance, such that the odds of having any carpal fracture were 3.15 times greater when patients had this injury (B = 1.15, SE = 0.65, P = .08). Patients who sustained high-velocity trauma were significantly more likely to have trapezial, trapezoid, and hook of hamate fractures than those in the low-velocity injury cohort (P = .006, .004, and .043, respectively).

### Salter-Harris type III fracture of the distal phalanx: A rare juxtaphyseal variant [^114AkAuH]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

Juxtaphyseal fractures of the distal phalanges of upper extremity digits are most commonly of the Salter-Harris II variety and occur primarily in the thumb. The diagnosis of this injury is essential, as it may present as an open fracture with a nailbed injury ("Seymour fracture"). However, an intra-articular, epiphyseal fracture may also occur and mimic a mallet deformity or Seymour fracture.

Prompt diagnosis is crucial to rule out an open fracture and obtain anatomical alignment and stability, which is necessary to reduce complications such as physeal arrest. Here, we present a patient with a displaced Salter-Harris type III fracture of his thumb distal phalanx and review his management and early-term outcome. We present this case to highlight this rare and unique injury, review the available literature, and discuss management and outcomes.

### Use of osteobiologics for fracture management: The when, what, and how [^117MAYDS]. Injury (2021). Low credibility.

Osteobiologics are defined as a group of natural and synthetic materials used to augment bone healing. The selection of the most appropriate osteobiologic from the growing list of available options can be a challenging task. In selecting a material, surgeons should weigh a variety of considerations, including the indication for their use (the when), the most suitable substance (the what), and the correct mode of application (the how). This summary reviews these considerations and seeks to provide the surgeon with a basis for informed, evidence-based decision-making in their choice of a successful option.

### The Kleinert modified dorsal finger splint for mallet finger fracture [^113QsNrG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Injuries to the hand and digits are commonly seen in the emergency department. Lacerations, contusions, puncture wounds, and fractures comprise the bulk of these injuries. A fracture to the dorsum of the distal phalanx can result in a mallet finger deformity. These fractures must be accurately diagnosed, and the proper initial treatment must begin. There is some disagreement over the best treatment approach, and multiple different splints have been described in the literature. Conservative treatment with a finger splint is most commonly effective. We recommend a modified dorsal finger splint for these injuries.

- **Splint description**: We describe a splint to properly treat the fracture, prevent complications, maximize patient comfort during rehabilitation, and prevent mallet finger deformity.

### Stability of fixation of proximal phalanx unicondylar fractures of the hand: A biomechanical cadaver study [^112RFEd4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative stability of various fixation methods for proximal phalanx intra-articular unicondylar fractures during simulated early active motion.

- **Methods**: We created proximal phalangeal intra-articular unicondylar fractures in 13 fresh-frozen human cadaveric hands. Using a saw through a dorsal approach, we performed an osteotomy beginning in the intercondylar notch and extending proximally at a 45° angle to the radial border of the proximal phalanx. We fixed each of the fingers on each hand with one of the following methods: a 1.5-mm headless compression screw, a 1.5-mm lag screw, two 1.1-mm smooth K-wires, or one 1.1-mm smooth K-wire. The order of constructs was rotated randomly for each hand. A custom-loading device was used to simulate active range of motion at 0.25 Hz from full finger extension to full flexion for 2,000 cycles, and displacement was measured by a differential variable reluctance transducer.

- **Results**: We found no significant differences in displacement at the fracture site among the four methods of fixation. Movement in the control specimen with no osteotomy fixation was significantly higher than with each of the other fixation methods.

- **Conclusions**: Biomechanical stability did not differ among the fixation methods for proximal phalanx unicondylar fractures in a flexion-extension active range of motion model.

- **Clinical relevance**: Fixation of these fractures with any of the methods tested may provide sufficient stability to withstand postoperative therapy when there is no substantial resistance to active motion.

### Treatment options for mallet finger: a review [^1163jhHC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Mallet finger is a common injury. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the different treatment options for mallet injuries, their indications, outcomes, and potential complications.
- **Methods**: A literature-based study was conducted using the PubMed database, comprising world literature from January 1980 until January 2010. The search terms used were "mallet" and "finger".

- **Results**: There are many variations in the design of splints; however, only a few studies compare the types of splints with one another. Splinting appears to be effective in both uncomplicated and complicated cases. Equal results have been reported for early and delayed splinting therapy. Many techniques have been reported to internally fixate a mallet finger; however, none of these studies examined their comparisons in a controlled setting. In chronic mallet injuries, a tenodermodesis followed by splinting or a tenotomy of the central slip is usually performed. If pain and impairment persist despite previous surgical corrective attempts, an arthrodesis of the distal interphalangeal joint should be performed.
- **Conclusions**: Uncomplicated cases of mallet injuries are best treated with splinting therapy; cases that do not respond to splinting therapy are best treated with surgical interventions. Controversy remains about whether mallet injuries with a larger dislocated bone fragment are best treated by surgery or by external splinting.

### Seymour fractures: Retrospective analysis and therapeutic considerations [^112LmtLE]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the management of Seymour fractures — juxta-epiphyseal fractures of the terminal phalanx of the finger, which occur in conjunction with flexion deformity at the fracture site, laceration of the nail bed, and frequently ungual subluxation. The objective is to determine clinical and radiographic results following operative or conservative treatment.

- **Methods**: Clinical and radiological results of 24 skeletally immature patients (comprising 7 girls and 17 boys; mean age 8.5 years) with Seymour fractures were evaluated. An assessment conducted following a mean follow-up of 10 years (with a range of 1–18 years) included the range of motion, the modified Kapandji index, growth disturbance of the affected digit and nail, pain according to the visual analog scale, and patients' satisfaction.

- **Results**: Nine patients received nonoperative treatment. Operative management included debridement, open reduction, and fixation in nine cases. Due to instability, an additional K-wire passing across the distal interphalangeal joint was used in five cases. In one patient, the nail was removed. All surgically treated patients received a splint and perioperative cephalosporin. Twenty-three out of 24 patients gained full motion (mean, 80°; range, 65°-90°). The average modified Kapandji index was 5.0 for extension and 4.8 for flexion. Long-term minor growth disturbances of the distal phalanx and nail (seen on radiographs at high amplification only) were noted in five patients, and solitary nail dystrophies were observed in six patients. Nine of the 11 nail growth irregularities were not a relevant cosmetic problem for the patients. Patients' satisfaction assessment revealed high levels of contentment.

### Adequate union rates for the treatment of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures [^1135R6j3]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

Non-displaced acute tuberosity (zone 1) avulsion fractures are preferably treated conservatively. Comparable union rates and clinical outcomes were found regardless of the chosen management, and fracture healing is typically uncomplicated. The ideal management of displaced zone 1 fractures remains unclear due to the small number of cases identified. However, available evidence suggests that both conservative and surgical treatment demonstrate comparable union rates.

Acute zone 2 fractures were found to have higher union rates and faster time to union when managed surgically, which the literature supports as the treatment of choice for all such injuries. Acute zone 3 fractures continue to be rarely reported in the literature. Therefore, treatment outcomes remain insufficiently documented and thus preclude any formal management recommendation. Higher level of evidence research on proximal fifth metatarsal fractures will be necessary to provide more definitive conclusions.

### Fingertip injuries [^113QVsdK]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The family physician often provides the first and only medical intervention for fingertip injuries. Proper diagnosis and management of these injuries are vital to maintaining hand function and preventing permanent disability. A subungual hematoma is a painful condition that involves bleeding beneath the nail, usually after trauma. Treatment requires subungual decompression, which is achieved by creating small holes in the nail. A nail bed laceration is treated by removing the nail and suturing the injured area.

Closed fractures of the distal phalanx may require reduction but usually are minimally displaced and stable, allowing for splinting. Open or intra-articular fractures of the distal phalanx may warrant referral. Patients with mallet finger cannot extend the distal interphalangeal joint due to a disruption of the extensor mechanism. Radiographs assist in differentiating between tendinous and bony mallet types. Most mallet finger injuries heal with six to eight weeks of splinting, though some require referral. Flexor digitorum profundus avulsion always necessitates referral. Dislocations of the distal interphalangeal joint are rare and usually occur dorsally.

### What is the relative effectiveness of the various surgical treatment options for distal radius fractures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hu5o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). High credibility.

Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.
- **Questions/purposes**: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

- **Methods**: Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. The mean (range) patient age was 59 years.

### Pinckney fracture: Do not underestimate trauma of the distal phalanx of the hallux [^116Hrjk2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Toe injuries are common in the emergency department, and most are treated conservatively. In some circumstances, these injuries can present as a physeal fracture with concomitant soft-tissue injury affecting the nail bed, resulting in a hidden open fracture. To adequately treat these patients, a high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose and treat the open fractures and prevent complications such as infection, osteomyelitis, malunion, and premature physeal arrest. We report a case of a patient admitted to the hospital with a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the distal phalanx of the hallux. After confirming the diagnosis, antibiotic treatment was started, and the fracture was reduced and fixed. The literature on this entity is sparse, and most management protocols are based on its hand equivalent, the Seymour fracture, emphasizing the low threshold for treating these lesions as open fractures.

### Closed reduction percutaneous pinning versus open reduction with plate and screw fixation in management of unstable proximal phalangeal fractures: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Trhba]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Proximal phalanx fractures are common, with surgical fixation indicated for unstable fractures. Traditionally, closed reduction percutaneous pinning (CRPP) resulted in decreased stiffness and tendon irritation compared to open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). We hypothesized that more recent studies would have more similar outcomes to CRPP. The purpose of this study was to compare CRPP and ORIF in terms of range of motion, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores, and complications.
- **Methods**: Four electronic databases were queried from 2010 to present. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, two independent reviewers performed a two-step review process to identify relevant articles. Patient demographics, total active motion (TAM), DASH, and complications were extracted. The methodological quality of each study included was assessed independently. Meta-analysis was performed for comparative trials.
- **Results**: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria, including four comparative studies. Thirteen studies included TAM. The weighted average TAM was 228 ± 34° for CRPP and 223 ± 32° for ORIF (P = .07 with 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.5 to 10.5). Seven studies evaluated DASH scores; the weighted average was 8.2 ± 8.9 for CRPP and 11.7 ± 6.5 for ORIF (P < .01 with 95% CI, 1.8–5.2). Two studies directly compared CRPP to ORIF, favoring ORIF for both TAM with d = 1.07 and DASH with d = 0.23. Rates of tenolysis or hardware removal were higher for ORIF (P < .01).
- **Conclusions**: New literature suggests more equal outcomes between CRPP and ORIF for unstable proximal phalangeal fractures.

### Fracture-dislocation about the finger joints [^111eVYia]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Fracture-dislocations in the small joints of the fingers are challenging injuries. The surgeon must choose an appropriate treatment based on fracture pattern, joint stability, and injury chronicity. Fracture-dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are notoriously unforgiving, with potential long-term sequelae of residual pain and stiffness. Similar injuries in the distal interphalangeal joint are more tolerant of fracture displacement and even joint subluxation. Dorsal dislocations of the metacarpophalangeal joint may be associated with shearing fractures of the metacarpal head but are most notable for the volar plate interposition that may block closed reduction.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on: the treatment of distal radius fractures [^111LB3gd]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2011). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for distal radius fractures, specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, the AAOS 2011 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against:

- **Any specific operative method**: For fixation of distal radius fractures (DRFs).
- **Locking plates in elderly patients**: Usage in patients over 55 years of age.
- **Use of supplemental bone grafts or substitutes**: When using locking plates.
- **Bone grafts (autograft or allograft) and substitutes**: For filling a bone void as an adjunct to other operative treatments.
- **Surgical treatment of distal radioulnar joint instability**: Due to lack of sufficient evidence.
- **Fixation of ulnar styloid fractures**: Associated with DRFs.
- **External fixation alone**: Specifically if there is a depressed lunate fossa or a four-part fracture with a sagittal split.

### Unstable middle phalanx base fractures treated with an internal joint stabilizer: Preliminary results [^114fAKeJ]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

The concept of an internal joint stabilizer has been previously described for elbow instability. When constructing it for the treatment of an unstable P2 PIP injury, a rotating pin is placed along the axis of PIP motion to maintain joint reduction and guide proper joint kinematics. It is affixed to the lateral aspect of P2 by a longitudinal section capable of accepting screws. The surgeon creates the device intraoperatively by shaping an appropriately sized K-wire. The wire is bent close to a right angle at its proximal aspect to allow the axis pin to be inserted along the anatomical PIP rotational axis. The distal longitudinal section requires the creation of two loops to accept screw fixation to P2.

### Interventions for treating mallet finger injuries [^1128yWwh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Mallet finger, also known as drop or baseball finger, is a condition where the end of a finger cannot be actively straightened due to injury to the extensor tendon mechanism. Treatment commonly involves splinting the finger for six or more weeks. Less frequently, surgical fixation is employed to correct the deformity.
- **Objectives**: To examine the evidence for the relative effectiveness of different methods of treating mallet finger injuries.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group Trials Register (November 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 2, 2004), EMBASE (1988 to 2004 week 8), other databases, reference lists of articles, and various conference proceedings.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials evaluating different interventions, including no intervention, for treating mallet finger injuries.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently performed study selection, quality assessment, and data extraction. Study authors were contacted for additional information.
- **Main results**: Four trials were included, involving a total of 278, mainly adult participants with 283 mallet finger injuries. All four trials were methodologically flawed, including inadequate outcome assessment. Three trials compared different types of finger splints versus a standard Stack splint. One trial found a lower incidence of treatment failure in participants treated with a perforated custom-made splint.
