## Question

Are azole antifungals effective against Candida species in intertrigo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether azole antifungals are effective for Candida intertrigo and how to apply the evidence to treatment decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what intertrigo is and how Candida contributes. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for topical and systemic therapy in cutaneous candidiasis. Next, I will examine the pharmacologic rationale for azoles in superficial disease and consider resistance patterns that might limit efficacy. After that, I should review practical treatment details, including duration, dosing, and when to escalate to oral therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and note special scenarios that could alter management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory dermatitis of opposing skin surfaces, often macerated and inflamed, with moisture and friction predisposing to secondary infection; Candida commonly colonizes and then overgrows in these moist folds, producing satellite papules and pustules that help distinguish candidal involvement from purely irritant or bacterial etiologies [^112UoMMy] [^117WHEPy].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed therapy. The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends topical antifungals for intertrigo associated with Candida, applied twice daily until the rash resolves, which aligns with the principle of treating the superficial infection directly at the site of involvement [^116YPGwx]. Hold on, I should verify whether IDSA echoes this for cutaneous candidiasis; yes, IDSA recommends topical triazoles or polyenes for cutaneous candidiasis, reinforcing that localized disease is managed with topical agents as first-line therapy [^117WHEPy].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale. Azoles inhibit lanosterol 14α-demethylase, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and destabilizing the fungal cell membrane. For superficial infections, topical azoles achieve high local concentrations and are generally effective against Candida albicans, the predominant species in cutaneous disease, which supports their use in intertrigo when Candida is confirmed or strongly suspected [^114DgNN4] [^117KuACh].

> But wait, what if the organism is not C. albicans or is resistant? I need to check resistance patterns that could undermine azole efficacy. Non-albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei show reduced fluconazole susceptibility or intrinsic resistance, and global surveillance documents rising azole resistance among Candida species, which is more relevant to invasive disease but can occasionally manifest in refractory superficial infections; in such cases, failure of topical azoles should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis and, if confirmed, escalation to alternative therapy [^116B3F8J] [^114PcNWp] [^11323gzQ].

> Let me consider practical application. Typical topical options include clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or econazole, applied twice daily until resolution. Keeping the area dry is essential, and Burrow's solution compresses can aid maceration control while therapy proceeds, which improves outcomes and reduces recurrence risk [^116YPGwx] [^117WHEPy]. Wait, I initially thought nystatin is a triazole; hold on, I should verify — nystatin is a polyene, not an azole, though it remains a reasonable topical alternative for cutaneous candidiasis in some contexts [^117WHEPy].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to systemic therapy. If topical therapy fails after an adequate trial or disease is extensive or refractory, fluconazole 100–200 mg orally daily for 7 days is recommended, with consideration of higher dosing in obesity. This balances efficacy against the possibility of non-albicans species and helps when access or adherence to topical therapy is problematic [^115SeyV4]. I should double-check that this escalation is consistent with cutaneous candidiasis guidance; yes, IDSA acknowledges systemic fluconazole for more extensive cutaneous disease, which fits the scenario of refractory intertrigo [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — treatment failure can reflect misdiagnosis rather than azole resistance. Inverse psoriasis, bacterial intertrigo, tinea, and seborrheic dermatitis can mimic candidal intertrigo; persistent or recurrent lesions despite appropriate antifungal therapy should prompt reassessment of the diagnosis and, when uncertain, KOH preparation or culture to confirm Candida and exclude mimics [^112z9JUk] [^112UoMMy].

> I should also consider special populations and red flags. In immunocompromised patients with persistent or atypical intertriginous lesions, especially with ulceration or induration, mucormycosis enters the differential; azoles are ineffective against Mucorales, and delays in amphotericin B and surgical management worsen outcomes, so refractory "candidal" intertrigo in this group warrants biopsy and urgent fungal identification [^112KkZwF].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. Azole antifungals are effective first-line therapy for Candida intertrigo when used topically and appropriately. Most cases respond to twice-daily topical azoles until clearance, with adjunctive moisture control and consideration of diagnosis if response is suboptimal, and oral fluconazole reserved for refractory or extensive disease after confirming Candida and excluding mimics [^116YPGwx] [^117WHEPy] [^115SeyV4].

---

Azole antifungals are **effective for Candida intertrigo** [^112UoMMy] because they inhibit ergosterol synthesis and disrupt the fungal cell membrane [^114DgNN4], leading to clearance of superficial Candida in moist, occluded skin folds [^117WHEPy]. Topical azoles (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) are **first-line therapy** [^117WHEPy] and should be applied twice daily until resolution [^116YPGwx], typically 1–2 weeks [^notfound]. Oral fluconazole is reserved for **extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised cases** [^115SeyV4] or when topical therapy is impractical [^114Ka8p4]. Resistance is uncommon in cutaneous disease [^notfound] but may occur in C. glabrata or C. krusei [^11323gzQ]; if there is no improvement after 2 weeks, reassess the diagnosis, adherence, or consider alternative agents [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action of azole antifungals

Azoles inhibit lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase [^1171N4gP], **reducing ergosterol and disrupting membrane integrity**, which leads to growth arrest and cell death [^114S64Z4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting azole use in Candida intertrigo

Topical azoles are **recommended first-line** [^117WHEPy] for Candida intertrigo; apply twice daily until the rash resolves [^116YPGwx]. Oral fluconazole is reserved for extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised cases [^115SeyV4], typically 100–200 mg daily for 7 days.

---

## Clinical efficacy of azole antifungals

Clinical studies and guidelines show **high efficacy** of topical azoles for Candida intertrigo, with rapid symptom improvement and high mycological cure rates. Oral fluconazole is effective for refractory or extensive disease, especially in immunocompromised patients [^115SeyV4].

---

## Factors influencing efficacy

Several factors **influence azole efficacy** in Candida intertrigo:

- **Candida species**: C. albicans is highly susceptible; C. glabrata and C. krusei have reduced susceptibility [^11323gzQ].
- **Resistance**: Rare in cutaneous disease [^114PcNWp] but possible in non-albicans species [^113qncBR].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, diabetes, and immunosuppression can reduce response and may require longer therapy or higher doses [^115SeyV4].

---

## Comparison with other antifungal classes

| **Attribute** | **Azoles** | **Echinocandins** | **Polyenes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Ergosterol synthesis inhibition | β-1,3-glucan synthase inhibition | Membrane disruption |
| Clinical use | First-line topical therapy for Candida intertrigo | Not used topically; systemic for invasive disease | Topical nystatin alternative |
| Limitations | Rare resistance in non-albicans species | Invasive therapy only; not for superficial use | Less convenient; potential irritation |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend **topical azoles as first-line therapy** [^117WHEPy] for Candida intertrigo, with oral fluconazole for refractory or extensive cases [^115SeyV4] [^114Ka8p4].

---

## Potential limitations and side effects

Topical azoles are generally well tolerated; rare local irritation or hypersensitivity may occur. Oral azoles can cause **gastrointestinal upset, hepatotoxicity, and drug interactions**; monitor liver function with prolonged use [^117QihLd].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Azole therapy achieves high cure rates with **low recurrence** when combined with moisture control and hygiene; recurrence is more common with underlying obesity, diabetes, or immunosuppression.

---

Azole antifungals are **effective for Candida intertrigo** [^116YPGwx], with topical agents as first-line therapy and oral fluconazole for refractory or extensive disease [^112UoMMy].

### Treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis… [^111ipMhT]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the most effective treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Evidence-Based Answer. A six-month treatment regimen with an antifungal agent decreases the recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis. For women in mycologic remission, a six-month treatment regimen with an antifungal agent may result in an additional five to 10 months of clinical cure. Suitable therapies include oral fluconazole or oral itraconazole. Evidence Summary Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is defined as at least four documented episodes in the previous 12 months. It affects 5 to 8 percent of reproductive-aged women. Pharmacologic treatments include oral and topical azoles.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 343 women, participants were randomized to receive 150 mg of oral fluconazole or placebo once per week for six months. 2 At baseline, both groups were clinically and mycologically free of disease. The treatment group received two doses of itraconazole 12 hours apart on day 4 or 5 of the menstrual cycle for six months. Women from both groups were evaluated at three, six, and 12 months for clinical and mycologic recurrence. However, six months after completion of therapy, 38. 9 percent of women in the treatment group were asymptomatic versus
28. 8 percent in the control group, which is not statistically significant. A prospective, randomized study of 44 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis compared oral itraconazole with clotrimazole therapy. Results from an intention-to-treat analysis showed six-month clinical cure rates of 66. 7 percent in the itraconazole group and 100 percent in the clotrimazole group.

At 12 months, cure rates were 19 and 35. 3 percent, respectively. Clotrimazole vaginal tablets are not available in the United States. There was no good-quality evidence to support the use of nonpharmacologic therapy, such as consuming yogurt or using intravaginal boric acid, to treat recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Advances in topical and systemic antifungals [^114Ka8p4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Topical antifungal agents are generally used for the treatment of superficial fungal infections unless the infection is widespread, involves an extensive area, or is resistant to initial therapy. Systemic antifungals are often reserved for the treatment of onychomycosis, tinea capitis, superficial and systemic candidiasis, and prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. With the development of resistant fungi strains and the increased incidence of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, some previously effective traditional antifungal agents are subject to limitations including multidrug interactions, severe adverse effects, and their fungistatic mechanism of actions. Several new antifungal agents have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits and have broadened clinicians' choices in the treatment of superficial and systemic invasive fungal infections.

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

### Avoid the use of combination topical steroid antifungals for tinea corporis, Candida skin infections, and diaper dermatitis… [^113kmhuq]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Although combination topical antifungal/corticosteroids have been approved for the treatment of tinea corporis, candidiasis, and diaper dermatitis, we recommend against use of these agents. Many providers are unaware that the combination products contain a relatively high-potency topical steroid. For treatment of tinea corporis, the application of a topical antifungal agent alone is recommended. If symptoms such as severe pruritus require concomitant application of a topical steroid, a separate low-potency agent can be prescribed, allowing for a tapering course that should be limited to less than two weeks. A separate topical antifungal cream can be continued longer until the infection is cleared. This will reduce the risk of systemic absorption of the topical steroid. Combination products are often used for treatment of diaper dermatitis. In most patients, diaper dermatitis is an irritant contact dermatitis from stool that will usually respond to barrier diaper creams/ointments alone.

Combination products, if applied with every diaper change, can result in skin atrophy, striae, and systemic absorption of the relatively high-potency topical steroids. It is instead recommended that barrier products be applied with every diaper change in this circumstance and a second low-potency topical steroid be applied as needed, no more than twice a day and tapered as soon as the dermatitis is under control. Combination products are also often expensive and not covered by pharmacy plans.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin for patients with candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in the intensive care unit: pooled analyses of the ReSTORE and STRIVE randomised trials [^1163SPp2]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients are at risk of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis (IC), with one-third to half of all candidaemia cases occurring in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes are poor, with an estimated crude mortality rate of 40‒55% in the ICU for IC.

Echinocandins are established first-line treatment for candidaemia and IC, with azoles an acceptable alternative in selected patients. However, timely initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is essential; delay or inadequate treatment can increase mortality. Furthermore, the increasing prominence of non- albicans Candida species and growing challenge of azole and echinocandin resistance, especially with respect to C. glabrata and C. auris, are concerns. Within the ICU, antifungal-resistant isolates spread between patients; outbreaks of azole-resistant C. parapsilosis with similar genotypes and intra-hospital spread of azole-resistant C. glabrata have been reported. The likelihood of achieving effective exposures with current dosing regimens of first-generation echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin) is also unclear, especially regarding resistant Candida species. New agents and/or dosing strategies are therefore needed for critically ill patients with candidaemia and/or IC.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111vc9en]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis — evidence summary in HIV and refractory disease: In HIV-infected patients, oropharyngeal candidiasis is most often observed with CD4 counts < 200 cells/μL, and recurrent infections typically occur in those with low CD4 cell counts (< 50 cells/μL). In a multicenter randomized study, 50-mg mucoadhesive buccal miconazole applied once daily was as effective as 10-mg clotrimazole troches used 5 times daily. Fluconazole tablets and itraconazole solution are superior to ketoconazole and itraconazole capsules, and posaconazole suspension is also as efficacious as fluconazole in patients with AIDS. Posaconazole, 100-mg delayed release tablets, given as 300 mg daily as a single dose, are FDA approved for the prophylaxis of fungal infections in high-risk patients and provide a stable bioavailability (approximately 55%). For fluconazole-refractory infections, itraconazole solution results show that between 64% and 80% of patients will respond to this therapy; posaconazole suspension is efficacious in approximately 75% of patients with refractory oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, and intravenous caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin have been shown to be effective alternatives to azole agents.

### Antifungal tolerance is a subpopulation effect distinct from resistance and is associated with persistent candidemia [^1143pW2S]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Tolerance to antifungal drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is rarely quantified, and current clinical recommendations suggest it should be ignored. Here, we quantify antifungal tolerance in Candida albicans isolates as the fraction of growth above the MIC, and find that it is distinct from susceptibility/resistance. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population, and correlates inversely with intracellular drug accumulation. Many adjuvant drugs used in combination with fluconazole, a widely used fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant combination therapy is more effective than fluconazole in treating infections with highly tolerant isolates and does not affect infections with low tolerance isolates. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia display higher tolerance than isolates readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus, tolerance correlates with, and may help predict, patient responses to fluconazole therapy.

### Intertrigo and secondary skin infections [^115SeyV4]. American Family Physician (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for intertrigo, more specifically with respect to oral antifungals, AAFP 2014 guidelines recommend to offer fluconazole 100–200 mg PO daily for 7 days for the treatment of patients with intertrigo complicated by a resistant fungal infection. Consider an increased dosage in patients with obesity.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116Zw9Fd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to antifungal susceptibility testing, IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for azole susceptibility for all bloodstream and other clinically relevant Candida isolates. Consider testing for echinocandin susceptibility in patients who have had prior treatment with an echinocandin and among those who have infection with C. glabrata or Candida parapsilosis.

---

### Fluconazole [^11323gzQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Resistance in Candida glabrata usually includes upregulation of CDR genes resulting in resistance to multiple azoles. For an isolate where the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is categorized as Intermediate (16 to 32 mcg/mL), the highest fluconazole dose is recommended.

Candida krusei should be considered to be resistant to fluconazole. Resistance in C. krusei appears to be mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.

There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to fluconazole (e.g. Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy.

Antimicrobial Activity

Fluconazole has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections.

Candida albicans

Candida glabrata (Many isolates are intermediately susceptible)

Candida parapsilosis

Candida tropicalis

Cryptococcus neoformans

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following fungi exhibit an in vitro MIC less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for fluconazole (https://www.fda.gov/STIC) against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the effectiveness of fluconazole in treating clinical infections due to these fungi has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Candida dubliniensis

Candida guilliermondii

Candida kefyr

Candida lusitaniae

Candida krusei should be considered to be resistant to fluconazole. Resistance in C. krusei appears to be mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.

There have been reports of cases of superinfection with Candida species other than C. albicans, which are often inherently not susceptible to fluconazole (e.g. Candida krusei). Such cases may require alternative antifungal therapy.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^117WHEPy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

### Resistance of Candida to azoles and echinocandins worldwide [^116B3F8J]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently there has been an increase in Candida infections worldwide. A handful of species in the genus Candida are opportunistic pathogens and have been known to cause infections in immunocompromised or otherwise impaired hosts. These infections can be superficial, affecting the skin or mucous membrane, or invasive, which can be life-threatening. Azoles and echinocandins are antifungal drugs used globally to treat Candida infections. However, resistance to these antifungal drugs has increased in many of the Candida species, and the effects this has in the clinical setting can be seen.

Objectives

Here, we discuss the mechanisms that Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis and Candida auris are implementing to increase resistance to azoles and echinocandins, and how they are affecting clinical, or hospital, settings worldwide.

Sources

Different studies and papers describing the mechanisms of antifungal drugs and Candida species evolution to becoming resistant to these drugs were looked at for this review.

Content

We discuss the mechanisms that azoles and echinocandins use against Candida species to treat infections, as well as the evolution of these fungi to become resistant to these drugs, and the effect this has in the clinical settings around the globe.

Implications

Increased resistance to azoles and echinocandins by Candida species is an increasingly serious problem in clinical settings worldwide. Understanding the mechanisms used against antifungal drugs is imperative for patient treatment.

### Shifting patterns in the epidemiology of nosocomial Candida infections [^116HeVVa]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of candidemia — a common and potentially fatal nosocomial infection — has risen dramatically, and this increase has been accompanied by a shift in the infecting pathogen away from Candida albicans to treatment-resistant non-albicans species. Prophylactic azole antifungals, such as fluconazole, may play an important role not only in the management of candidemia but also in the proliferation of hard-to-treat Candida species. In a variety of acute nosocomial settings, IV fluconazole, 400 mg/d, has reduced Candida colonization and infection. A growing body of evidence supports the still controversial contention that the increasing use of azole antifungals is at least partially responsible for the proliferation of treatment-resistant, non-albicans isolates, especially Candida glabrata. Thus, selecting the most appropriate candidates for prophylactic antifungal intervention — ie, those with the highest risk for candidemia — may be indispensable, not only in preventing candidemia, but also in reducing antifungal overuse, which may contribute to the emergence of treatment-resistant Candida isolates.

### Oral medications to treat toenail fungal infection [^115kNiXD]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which oral antifungal medication is associated with the highest clinical (ie, normal appearance of the toenail) and mycological (negative culture, microscopy, or both) cure rates vs placebo or other antifungals when used to treat fungal infections?

Bottom Line

Both terbinafine and azole-based medications were associated with higher clinical and mycological cure rates compared with placebo (high-quality evidence). Azoles were associated with lower cure rates than terbinafine when compared directly.

### The changing spectrum of candidemia in oncology patients: therapeutic implications [^115QY1mc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Infections caused by Candida spp. are frequent and serious in oncology patients. Over the past decade, the introduction of azole antifungals as prophylactic agents, and other factors have caused a shift in the species of Candida that cause infection. During the period under review (June 1999 to June 2000), several studies have been reported that confirm the impact of antifungal prophylaxis and the emergence of non-albicans Candida spp. as pathogens. Moreover, laboratory studies to determine the antifungal susceptibilities and virulence properties of non-albicans Candida spp. have enabled the formation of microbe-specific management strategies. More of these studies will be necessary as we enter an age in which multiple antifungal compounds will become available for clinical use.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^113Uj2TR]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis in children with HIV infection — An echinocandin is recommended for severely ill children with candidiasis because of the fungicidal nature of these agents, as well as the lack of adverse events (strong, high), whereas fluconazole is a reasonable alternative for patients who are less critically ill and who have no recent azole exposure; voriconazole can be used in situations in which mold coverage is also warranted. For infections with C. glabrata, an echinocandin is recommended because of the increasing resistance seen against fluconazole for this species (strong, moderate), clinicians should be aware of the increasing frequency of C. glabrata echinocandin resistance, and for patients already receiving fluconazole or voriconazole who are clinically improving despite C. glabrata infection, continuing use of the azole is reasonable. Infection with C. krusei should be treated with an echinocandin, and for infection with C. parapsilosis, fluconazole or amphotericin B is recommended (strong, moderate); although previous data suggested a decreased response of C. parapsilosis isolates to echinocandins, recent adult comparative effectiveness data reveal that initial therapy with an echinocandin for C. parapsilosis did not result in worse outcomes, and thus if a patient is receiving empiric therapy with an echinocandin and showing clinical improvement when culture of C. parapsilosis returns, continuing with this therapy is reasonable.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113w7FMT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida urinary tract infection (UTI) — first-line antifungal therapy and the role of bladder irrigation are described as follows: Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treating Candida UTI. Flucytosine demonstrates good activity against many Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei, but treatment with flucytosine is limited by its toxicity and the development of resistance when it is used as a single agent. Amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate is active against most Candida species, although some C. krusei isolates are resistant; lipid formulations of AmB appear to not achieve urine concentrations that are adequate to treat UTI and should not be used. Irrigation of the bladder with AmB deoxycholate resolves candiduria in 80%–90% of patients, but recurrent candiduria within several weeks was very common; this approach is useful only for bladder infections and generally is discouraged, especially in patients who would not require an indwelling catheter for any other reason.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116tX4qD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Isavuconazole — emerging evidence for primary therapy: Isavuconazole is a recently approved expanded-spectrum triazole antifungal with excellent in vitro activity against Candida species. Preliminary analysis of the recently completed large international double-blind trial comparing isavuconazole to an echinocandin for candidiasis suggests that isavuconazole is noninferior to echinocandins for the primary treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.

### Multidrug-resistant Candida: epidemiology, molecular mechanisms, and treatment [^113qncBR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Invasive Candida infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized and immunocompromised or critically ill patients. A limited number of antifungal agents from only a few drug classes are available to treat patients with these serious infections. Resistance can be either intrinsic or acquired. Resistance mechanisms are not exchanged between Candida; thus, acquired resistance either emerges in response to an antifungal selection pressure in the individual patient or, more rarely, occur due to horizontal transmission of resistant strains between patients. Although multidrug resistance is uncommon, increasing reports of multidrug resistance to the azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes have occurred in several Candida species, most notably Candida glabrata and more recently Candida auris. Drivers are overall antifungal use, subtherapeutic drug levels at sites of infection/colonization, drug sequestration in the biofilm matrix, and, in the setting of outbreaks, suboptimal infection control. Moreover, recent research suggests that DNA mismatch repair gene mutations may facilitate acquisition of resistance mutations in C. glabrata specifically. Diagnosis of antifungal-resistant Candida infections is critical to the successful management of patients with these infections. Reduction of unnecessary use of antifungals via antifungal stewardship is critical to limit multidrug resistance emergence.

### Relationship of fluconazole prophylaxis with fungal microbiology in hospitalized intra-abdominal surgery patients: a descriptive cohort study [^115aw2mC]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Controversy remains regarding antifungal prophylaxis among intra-abdominal surgery patients. Research efforts to resolve these questions are impeded by the need for large sample sizes to demonstrate adjusted differences in clinical outcomes. Changing Candida epidemiology further complicates research and renders some prior studies obsolete. While shown effectively to decrease the incidence of fungal infection in high-risk, critically ill surgical patients, fluconazole prophylaxis does not appear to improve their survival. These studies indicate that the benefit to the patient of the decision to use prophylaxis may not exceed the risk of driving the escalation of resistance to existing antifungal treatments. Our data indicate that although only a small proportion of this surgical population received prophylaxis, their risk of a resistant candidal species was high.

While earlier studies reported that non- C. albicans species accounted for one-half or fewer of isolated organisms, later research uncovered an increase in cases of candidemia involving non- C. albicans. We observed a similarly increased proportion of non- C. albicans isolates, most pronounced among patients receiving prophylaxis with fluconazole. This switch in species is concerning, since non- C. albicans species, and in particular C. glabrata, exhibit greater resistance to fluconazole and are associated with worse outcomes when compared with C. albicans.

The association of increasingly resistant candidal species causing candidemia and their associated worsened outcomes may be explained by the difficulty of targeting initial empiric therapy amidst the shifting landscape of antifungal susceptibility. Many studies in both candidemia and other serious infections have noted a significant and clinically important rise in the risk of death when the patient does not receive prompt empiric treatment with an agent that covers the culprit pathogen. Guidelines for patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections recommend antifungal prophylaxis for healthcare-associated infection and those with severe community-acquired infection, leading with fluconazole. An echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy for critically ill patients, although no guidance is provided with respect to recent fluconazole prophylaxis. The Infectious Disease Society of America Expert Panel favors echinocandins for treating suspected invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients who are moderately or severely ill or had recent azole exposure. Guidelines recommend antifungal agents based on the Candida isolate or suspected isolate, but delaying appropriate selection until culture results are available or until the patient is critically ill may be too late.

### Biofilm formation is a risk factor for mortality in patients with Candida albicans bloodstream infection-scotland, 2012–2013 [^1127BgWo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Given that biofilm formation by clinical isolates is heterogeneous and has an impact on patient mortality, we tested their antifungal sensitivity to determine whether it was affected. Biofilms were treated with antifungals at a clinically relevant concentration of 2 mg/L and another concentration that is potentially useful in antifungal lock therapy (200 mg/L). Our data illustrate a significant difference between HBFs and LBFs in sensitivity to voriconazole and caspofungin. However, amphotericin B is equally effective against both groups. Whereas the clinical data show that azoles were used extensively to treat 82.2% of patients in this study, our data show that this class of antifungal is less effective against matured biofilms. When echinocandins were compared with polyenes, the removal of the catheter showed no improved time to mycological eradication, possibly because of the effectiveness of both antifungal agents against biofilms. Furthermore, with HBFs, we found a paradoxical effect of lower percentage kill with a higher concentration of caspofungin (200 mg/mL) than with 2 mg/L, in vitro (Fig. 4 b). The exact mechanism causing this paradoxical effect with HBFs and its clinical relevance are unknown.

In summary, C. albicans remains a predominant Candida species associated with high mortality in candidaemia patients, and, within this species, biofilm heterogeneity has a direct impact on patient survival, and potentially on antifungal sensitivities, based on in vitro studies. These findings highlight the importance of biofilm stratification in the clinical management of candidaemia cases, to determine whether they should be managed with azoles or other fungicidal classes of antifungal agent. Moreover, understanding the genetic basis of these isolates will enable us to devise and develop a biomarker for biofilm-related Candida BSI, and to create more appropriate antifungal therapies, which, collectively, will facilitate improved clinical outcomes.

### An oxindole efflux inhibitor potentiates azoles and impairs virulence in the fungal pathogen Candida auris [^113e5ro8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

An additional distinct challenge to the efficacy of efflux inhibitors is the emergence of target-based and other resistance mechanisms that can render efflux a less important factor contributing to the overall resistance level of a fungal pathogen. Encouragingly, azoffluxin remains able to sensitize azole-resistant Candida strains despite the presence of target-based resistance mechanisms. While overall results are encouraging, they are clearly discovery-phase in nature and will require further development for translation to clinical application. As the number of drug-resistant infections continues to rise, there remains a need to understand the relative contribution of different resistance mechanisms to the diminishing efficacy of our limited antifungal armamentarium and to design new resistance-evasive treatment strategies.

### The global problem of antifungal resistance: prevalence, mechanisms, and management [^114PcNWp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

All serious fungal infections need appropriate antifungal therapy for successful patient outcome. Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, so the emergence of resistance to single drug classes and now multidrug resistance greatly hampers patient management. Azole resistance among Candida and Aspergillus species is one of the greatest challenges to clinical success, followed by echinocandin and multidrug resistance among some Candida species, especially Candida glabrata. The spread of agriculturally derived azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus and emerging threats such as multidrug resistant Candida auris are also alarming. The molecular mechanisms that cause drug resistance are naturally occurring in less susceptible species and are acquired in strains of susceptible organisms. Drug resistance mechanisms include altered drug-target interactions, reduced cellular drug concentrations mediated by drug efflux transporters, and permeability barriers associated with biofilms. Although C auris is inherently multidrug resistant, other strains typically develop resistance through stepwise selection of multiple drug-resistance mechanisms. Cellular stress induced by drug treatment promotes adaptation, which contributes to breakthrough resistance. Drug exposure also drives the emergence of resistance. An effective antifungal stewardship programme is essential to control drug resistance, and should incorporate rapid fungal diagnostics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and clinical intervention teams. The development of better diagnostic tools and strategies that allow targeted use of antifungals is essential to preserve drug effectiveness.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114HteXw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Empiric therapy for suspected invasive candidiasis — echinocandins, fluconazole, and amphotericin B options with duration and stopping criteria: An echinocandin is an option with caspofungin loading dose of 70 mg then 50 mg daily, micafungin 100 mg daily, or anidulafungin loading dose of 200 mg then 100 mg daily (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Fluconazole, 800 mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an acceptable alternative for patients without recent azole exposure and without colonization by azole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative when there is intolerance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). The recommended duration of empiric therapy in patients who improve is 2 weeks, the same as for documented candidemia (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients with no clinical response at 4–5 days and no subsequent evidence of invasive candidiasis after starting empiric therapy, consideration should be given to stopping antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Current treatment strategies for disseminated candidiasis [^112T6NwJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of disseminated candidiasis has increased dramatically over the past several decades. Fortunately, in recent years, a variety of new antifungal agents have become available to treat these infections. On the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost considerations, fluconazole is the agent of choice for the empirical treatment of disseminated candidiasis in nonneutropenic, hemodynamically stable patients, unless a patient is suspected to be infected with an azole-resistant species (i.e. Candida glabrata or Candida krusei). For hemodynamically unstable or neutropenic patients, agents with broader species coverage, such as polyenes, echinocandins, or, possibly, voriconazole, are preferred for empirical treatment of candidemia. Modification of the initial, empirical regimen depends on the response to therapy and the subsequent identification of the species of the offending pathogen. Echinocandins or high-dose polyenes are preferred for the treatment of infections with C. glabrata or C. krusei. Central venous catheters should be removed from all patients who have disseminated candidiasis, if feasible, and antifungal therapy should be administered to all patients who have candidemia or proven candidiasis.

### Resistant "candidal intertrigo": could inverse psoriasis be the true culprit? [^112z9JUk]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Inverse psoriasis is a disorder of intertriginous areas of the skin that can easily masquerade as candidal intertrigo. Candidal rashes are commonly encountered in primary care and typically respond promptly to therapy. When treatment fails, nonadherence to treatment and medication resistance often are suspected; however, the possibility of an incorrect diagnosis should also be entertained. This article presents the case of a patient with inverse psoriasis who was misdiagnosed with recurrent candidal intertrigo multiple times. The diagnosis and treatment of inverse psoriasis is reviewed, and other conditions that may be confused with Candida and inverse psoriasis, including bacterial intertrigo, tinea, and seborrheic dermatitis, are discussed. When confronted with a case of "resistant Candida", consideration of inverse psoriasis and other Candida mimics can allow physicians to diagnose and treat these conditions more effectively, avoiding the frustration experienced by our patient.

### Mycological considerations in the topical treatment of superficial fungal infections [^114Fxvqx]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichophyton rubrum remains the most common pathogenic dermatophyte in the United States, Europe, and industrialized Asia, although other species are predminant elsewhere. Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic yeast, with other species occasionally encountered. Just a few of the 14 described species of Malassezia cause pityriasis versicolor worldwide. FDA approval does not always accurately reflect the potential utility of any given topical antifungal agent. Azole, hydroxypyridone, and allylamine agents are beneficial in the management of dermatophytosis; however, the allylamines may lead to faster symptom resolution and a higher degree of sustained response. Although in actual clinical use the allylamines have all shown some activity against superficial cutaneous candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor, the azole agents remain drugs of choice. Ciclopirox is an excellent broad-spectrum antifungal agent. Optimal topical therapy for superficial fungal infections cannot yet be reliably based upon in-vitro laboratory determination of sensitivity. Inherent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties possessed by some antifungal agents may be exploited for clinical purposes. Candida species may be azole-insensitive due to efflux pumps or an altered target enzyme. So-called "antifungal resistance" of dermatophyets is actually due to poor patient adherence (either in dosing or treatment duration), or to reinfection.

MASCC/ISOO oral candidosis management — antifungal medication should be combined with treatment of predisposing factors (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), and the choice of topical versus systemic therapy depends on extent of disease (topical for localised; systemic for multifocal/generalised), immunocompetence (systemic for immunosuppressed), drug resistance (polyenes uncommon; azoles relatively common), concomitant disease and medication (azoles with relative/absolute contraindications and drug interactions), patient preference, ease of use, and adherence; currently, there is no robust evidence to support the use of single doses of fluconazole in this condition (no guideline possible).

### Critical appraisal beyond clinical guidelines for intraabdominal candidiasis [^111iG6QT]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the emergence of antifungal resistance has become a growing concern in treating Candida infections, including IAC. Monitoring and understanding the patterns of antifungal resistance are critical to ensure the effectiveness of recommended therapies. Large-scale surveillance studies are necessary to assess the prevalence and trends of antifungal resistance among Candida isolates from intraabdominal infections.

The financial burden associated with antifungal therapy for IAC should not be overlooked. Novel antifungal agents can be costly, and prolonged therapy may lead to increased healthcare expenses. Comparative effectiveness research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment options and provide valuable insights for healthcare policymakers.

Three drug classes, azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, represent the main antifungal armamentarium against Candida infections. C. albicans continues to be the most frequent species isolated from IACs, but others, some less susceptible to antifungals, begin to gain weight. In the SENTRY antifungal surveillance programme, the frequency of C. albicans decreased from 57.4% in 1997–2001 to 46.4% in 2015–2016. In parallel, this study also reported a gradual and global increase of C. glabrata as a causative agent of invasive candidiasis since 1997, with the highest rates of resistance to fluconazole in North America and Asia–Pacific (10.6% and 6.8%, respectively). The emergence of azole resistance in Candida species as well as their interaction with cytochrome P450 leading to drug–drug interactions represents major inconveniences to treatment in critically ill patients.

### MASCC / ISOO expert opinion on the management of oral problems in patients with advanced cancer [^113vEfvx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Oral candidosis — aetiology and management — in patients with advanced cancer, Candida species are opportunistic microorganisms and oral candidosis usually occurs as a result of changes in host systemic and/or intraoral factors; it has been specifically associated with poor performance status, salivary gland hypofunction, presence of denture and use of systemic steroids, with other factors such as immunosuppression, systemic antibiotics and mucosal damage also having a role. The management of confirmed oral candidosis primarily involves the use of antifungal medication (polyenes, azoles); however, antifungal medication (especially azoles) should preferably be reserved for patients with laboratory-confirmed oral candidosis (Category of guideline — suggestion: Level of evidence — V), since other oral conditions can have similar features, and antifungal resistance is reported to be common in this group of patients.

### Antifungal drug-resistance mechanisms in Candida biofilms [^117AFFQ1]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by the Candida species of human fungal pathogens are a significant medical problem because they can disseminate to nearly every organ of the body. In addition, there are only a few classes of antifungal drugs available to treat patients with invasive fungal infections. Candida infections that are associated with biofilms can withstand much higher concentrations of antifungal drugs compared with infections caused by planktonic cells, thus making biofilm infections particularly challenging to treat. Candida albicans is among the most prevalent fungal species of the human microbiota, asymptomatically colonizing several niches of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, mouth, and skin. Immunocompromised health conditions, dysbiosis of the microbiota, or environmental changes, however, can lead to C. albicans overgrowth, causing infections that range from superficial mucosal infections to severe hematogenously disseminated infections. Here, we review the current knowledge of antifungal drug-resistance mechanisms occurring in Candida biofilms.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^115SghKN]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Antifungal agents for health care–associated intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) due to Candida spp. most commonly include amphotericin B and its formulations, azoles (fluconazole, voriconazole), and echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin). Randomized controlled trials have enrolled primarily patients with candidemia with limited numbers of candidal IAI, and use of amphotericin B has fallen into disfavor because of toxicity. Two RCTs published since 2000 reported lower success rates in small numbers of adult patients with intra-abdominal candidiasis treated with amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin B versus caspofungin or micafungin, and in a previously reviewed study, success rates in treating confirmed candidal IAI appeared higher with amphotericin B than with fluconazole, although only very small numbers of patients received either agent.

IDSA 2016 — candidemia in nonneutropenic patients initial therapy and alternatives — An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Fluconazole, intravenous or oral, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected patients, including those who are not critically ill and who are considered unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), and among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandin-resistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), and voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Antifungal prophylaxis with azoles in high-risk, surgical intensive care unit patients: a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^112TtPiS]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of antifungal prophylaxis remains controversial in most populations including surgical intensive care unit patients. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of azoles as antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk patients receiving treatment in the surgical intensive care unit.

Data Source

Data were obtained from PubMed, Current Contents, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and references from relevant articles.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials using azoles as antifungal prophylaxis vs. placebo were included in the study.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data concerning the development of fungal infections (superficial or invasive), adverse effects, and mortality.

Synthesis

Six randomized controlled trials were included in the main analysis. Publication bias and statistically significant heterogeneity were not observed among the analyzed studies. Patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis developed fewer episodes of candidemia (odds ratio [OR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09–0.86), nonbloodstream invasive fungal infections (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.12–0.53), and noninvasive (superficial) fungal infections (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.43), respectively. No reduction in mortality was observed among patients who received azole prophylaxis (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.52–1.05). There was no significant difference in reported adverse effects (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.82–1.98).

Conclusions

Despite its limitations, our meta-analysis suggests that the prophylactic use of azoles in high-risk surgical intensive care unit patients is associated with a reduction of fungal infections but not in all-cause mortality. However, although not noted in the analyzed randomized controlled trials, there is concern about the use of azoles due to possible shift toward non-albicans species and development of resistance to azoles.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116gSuNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Targeting fungal membrane homeostasis with imidazopyrazoindoles impairs azole resistance and biofilm formation [^114S64Z4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In recent decades, modern medicine has revolutionized the treatment of numerous human diseases through the use of immunomodulatory and invasive medical interventions. As a consequence, opportunistic fungal pathogens have become a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality in vulnerable, immune-compromised populations. Invasive fungal infections are responsible for global mortality rates that exceed that of malaria or breast cancer, with over 1.5 million deaths per year worldwide. Candida species are a major contributor to these infections, with Candida albicans reigning as the fourth most common cause of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections, with mortality remaining at ~40%. This underappreciated public health threat has been met with the overuse of a limited arsenal of antifungals for prophylactic purposes, leading to the widespread emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi.

In contrast to approximately two dozen classes of antibacterials in current clinical use, only three major classes of antifungals are approved for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Fungistatic azoles have been the most widely deployed treatment for systemic candidiasis for decades and target the ergosterol biosynthetic enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, encoded by ERG11. Analogous to cholesterol in mammalian cells, ergosterol is critical for maintaining fungal cell membrane integrity and fluidity. Azole-induced depletion of ergosterol from the cell is accompanied by accumulation of alternative sterol intermediates that perturb membrane stability and arrest fungal growth. The pleiotropic effects on membrane homeostasis induced by azoles include severe defects in vacuolar integrity and impairment of vacuole–vacuole fusion. Widespread overuse of the fungistatic azoles has led to the emergence of various mechanisms of resistance, including modification and/or overexpression of the drug target, upregulation of drug-efflux pumps, and compensatory alterations within the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, lipidomic analysis of azole-resistant isolates has revealed alterations in both sterols and sphingolipids, key membrane components that regulate membrane fluidity and stabilize membrane-resident proteins. Given the increasing frequency of resistance, an urgent need exists for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that can be used in combination with current treatments and restore their efficacy.

### European expert opinion on the management of invasive candidiasis in adults [^11511u4e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

This report discusses the present status of antifungal therapy and treatment options for candidaemia, considered by experts in the field in Europe. A conference of 26 experts from 13 European countries was held to discuss strategies for the treatment and prevention of invasive candidiasis, with the aim of providing a review on optimal management strategies. Published and unpublished comparative trials on antifungal therapy were analysed and discussed. Commonly asked questions about the management of candidaemia were selected, and possible responses to these questions were discussed. Panellists were then asked to respond to each question by using a touchpad answering system. After the initial conference, the viewpoint document has been reviewed and edited to include new insights and developments since the initial meeting. For many situations, consensus on treatment could not be reached, and the responses indicate that treatment is likely to be modified on a patient-to-patient basis, depending on factors such as degree of illness, prior exposure to azole antifungals, and the presence of potentially antifungal drug-resistant Candida species.

### Caspofungin acetate for treatment of invasive fungal infections [^1123tyih]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly discuss the changing epidemiology of fungal infections and review currently available agents; provide a review of caspofungin; and discuss its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosing guidelines, safety and efficacy, and role in the treatment of invasive fungal infections as it relates to current antifungal therapy.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE (1966 to August 2002) database search using key words caspofungin, echino candins, fungal infections, and invasive aspergillosis, was completed to identify relevant articles including reviews, recent studies, treatment guidelines, and data from Merck and Company.

Study Selection

In vitro studies and all clinical trials were evaluated to summarize the clinical efficacy and safety of caspofungin.

Data Synthesis

The incidence of fungal infections is increasing as the population at risk expands. Cost, resistance, and morbidity and mortality are key issues. Adding to the antifungal armamentarium is necessary to address these therapeutic dilemmas. Caspofungin is the first member of a new class of antifungal agents, the echinocandins, to be approved for clinical use. Caspofungin is classified as a glucan synthase inhibitor and represents a class of agents with a novel mechanism of action. Unlike currently available agents (polyenes, pyrimidines, azoles) that exert their effect on the fungal cell membrane, the echinocandins are the first agents to inhibit fungal cell wall synthesis. Caspofungin exhibits activity against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., including non-albicans species. Data from clinical trials demonstrate that caspofungin is effective in patients with invasive aspergillosis as well as candida esophagitis. Its Food and Drug Administration-approved indication is limited to invasive aspergillosis refractory to or intolerant of current therapy.

Conclusions

Caspofungin has activity against Aspergillus spp. as well as a variety of Candida spp. Clinical data support its usefulness in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and select candida infections. As additional clinical data become available, it seems likely that the therapeutic role of caspofungin will expand.

### Anidulafungin compared with fluconazole in severely ill patients with candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis: support for the 2009 IDSA treatment guidelines for candidiasis [^112eH7hV]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fluconazole remains the most commonly prescribed systemic antifungal agent for treatment of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis. However, the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guidelines favor an echinocandin (anidulafungin, caspofungin, or micafungin) as initial therapy for candidemia in patients with "moderately severe to severe" illness, with fluconazole reserved for patients who are less severely ill. The echinocandins are highly active against a broad spectrum of Candida spp. (anidulafungin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 /MIC 90 0.06/2 μg/ml; caspofungin MIC 50 /MIC 90, 0.03/0.25 μg/ml, and micafungin MIC 50 /MIC 90 0.015/1 μg/ml), including C. glabrata and C. krusei, against which the azole antifungal agents are known to have less activity. In prospective, randomized clinical trials, caspofungin has been demonstrated to be at least as effective as amphotericin B, and micafungin was shown to be as effective as liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin. Only one study to date has compared an echinocandin with fluconazole for the treatment of candidemia. In that prospective, randomized, double-blind study, global success at end of intravenous treatment was 75.6% in the anidulafungin group, compared with 60.2% in the fluconazole group (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9 to 27.0). The results were similar for other efficacy end points. Based on a review of the distribution of baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores in this study, we suspected that a substantial proportion of patients would be considered severely ill at study entry. We saw this as an opportunity to compare outcomes in these patients, allowing us to validate the 2009 IDSA candidemia treatment guidelines.

### Antifungal agents for preventing fungal infections in non-neutropenic critically ill patients [^114zKN6g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive fungal infections, important causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, may be preventable with the prophylactic administration of antifungal agents.

Objectives

This study aims to systematically identify and summarize the effects of antifungal prophylaxis in non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients on all-cause mortality and the incidence of invasive fungal infections.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2 September 2005), and EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2005). We also handsearched reference lists, abstracts of conference proceedings and scientific meetings (1998 to 2004), and contacted authors of included studies and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in all languages comparing the prophylactic use of any antifungal agent or regimen with placebo, no antifungal, or another antifungal agent or regimen in non-neutropenic critically ill adult patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently applied selection criteria, performed quality assessment, and extracted data using an intention-to-treat approach. We resolved differences by discussion. We synthesized data using the random effects model and expressed results as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We included 12 unique trials (eight comparing fluconazole and four ketoconazole with no antifungal or a nonabsorbable agent) involving 1606 randomized patients. For both outcomes of total mortality and invasive fungal infections, almost all trials of fluconazole and ketoconazole separately showed a non-significant risk reduction with prophylaxis. When combined, fluconazole/ketoconazole reduced total mortality by about 25% (relative risk 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.97) and invasive fungal infections by about 50% (relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.68). We identified no significant increase in the incidence of infection or colonization with the azole-resistant fungal pathogens Candida glabrata or C. krusei, although the confidence intervals of the summary effect measures were wide. Adverse effects were not more common amongst patients receiving prophylaxis. Results across all trials were homogeneous despite considerable heterogeneity in clinical and methodological characteristics.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with fluconazole or ketoconazole in critically ill patients reduces invasive fungal infections by one half and total mortality by one quarter. Although no significant increase in azole-resistant Candida species associated with prophylaxis was demonstrated, trials were not powered to exclude such an effect. In patients at increased risk of invasive fungal infections, antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole should be considered.

### Clinical efficacy of echinocandin antifungals [^115E847g]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence of fungal infections has increased significantly over the past few decades. Candida and Aspergillus spp. are the most common fungal pathogens due to recent changes in medical technology. Amphotericin B continues to be the treatment of choice in many severe disseminated mycosis cases, but problems with toxicity, resistance and non-availability of an absorbable oral form are important drawbacks. The azoles offer a less toxic alternative but often they are not as effective as amphotericin B and resistance is an increasing problem. The echinocandins are new active antifungal agents with a novel mechanism of action. During the past year, one agent has been released and two others are undergoing advanced stages of investigation. Although these agents are not the ideal antifungal drug, they do offer new options of therapy.

### Intertrigo and secondary skin infections [^112UoMMy]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory dermatitis occurring on two closely opposed skin surfaces as a result of moisture, friction, and lack of ventilation. Bodily secretions, including perspiration, urine, and feces, often exacerbate skin inflammation. Physical examination of skin folds reveals regions of erythema with peripheral scaling. Excessive friction and inflammation can cause skin breakdown and create an entry point for secondary fungal and bacterial infections, such as Candida, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Corynebacterium minutissimum. Candidal intertrigo is commonly diagnosed clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of satellite lesions. Diagnosis may be confirmed using a potassium hydroxide preparation. Resistant cases require oral fluconazole therapy. Bacterial superinfections may be identified with bacterial culture or Wood lamp examination. Fungal lesions are treated with topical nystatin, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, or econazole. Secondary streptococcal infections are treated with topical mupirocin or oral penicillin. Corynebacterium infections are treated with oral erythromycin.

### Is there a role for polyenes in treating invasive mycoses? [^112PoCNe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This is a clinical review on the current role of polyene antifungals in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. It is timely and relevant because the number of new antifungals being developed has never been greater than today. In addition to re-examining the landmark clinical trials of the past, the more recent findings are put into perspective. The past year has been particularly rich in clinical trials.

Recent Findings

The main topics of this review are invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and the so-called rare fungal infections: zygomycosis, fusariosis, cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis.

Summary

Practical implications of the recent developments are the almost complete replacement of amphotericin B deoxycholate by lipid-based formulations; antifungal efficacy without compromising safety; and treatment choices for infections previously considered untreatable.

### Candida urinary tract infections – treatment [^115W9e23]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In many instances a report from the clinical laboratory indicating candiduria represents colonization or procurement contamination of the specimen and not invasive candidiasis. Even if infection of the urinary tract by Candida species can be confirmed, antifungal therapy is not always warranted. Further investigation may reveal predisposing factors, which if corrected or treated, result in the resolution of the infection. For those with symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), the choice of antifungal agent will depend upon the clinical status of the patient, the site of infection, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent. Because of its safety, achievement of high concentrations in the urine, and availability in both an oral and intravenous formulation, fluconazole is preferred for the treatment of Candida UTIs. Flucytosine is concentrated in urine and has broad activity against Candida spp, but its use requires caution because of toxicity. Low-dose amphotericin B may be useful for Candida UTIs in selected patients. The role of echinocandins and azoles that do not achieve measurable concentrations in the urine is not clear. Small case series note some success, but failures have also occurred. Irrigation of the bladder with antifungal agents has limited utility. However, with fungus balls, irrigation of the renal pelvis through a nephrostomy tube can be useful in combination with systemic antifungal agents.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^114DgNN4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Antifungals — azoles are outlined with scope and mechanism: Antifungal medications including the azoles have long been used for treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections, while newer agents such as echinocandins are increasingly used in pediatric and adult infections. The azole class comprises triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole) and imidazoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole), and these drugs disrupt the fungal cell membrane through impairment of ergosterol synthesis. Each azole has distinctive indications ranging from mucosal candidiasis to invasive mycoses.

Regarding medical management for invasive candidiasis, more specifically with respect to step-down therapy, ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend to consider switching to an oral azole (fluconazole or voriconazole) after ≥ 5 days of echinocandin treatment in patients meeting the following criteria:

- hemodynamically stable

- documented clearance of Candida from the bloodstream

- non-neutropenic

- source control (such as central venous catheter removal) has been performed

- able to tolerate oral azole treatment

- susceptibility confirmed to the selected azole.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1129ppxs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Echinocandins — efficacy and comparative evidence in candidemia: Echinocandins demonstrate significant fungicidal activity against most Candida species with success in approximately 70%–75% of patients in randomized, comparative clinical trials. Only one study comparing an echinocandin to fluconazole suggested a strong trend toward improved global responses with anidulafungin, and a combined analysis of 7 large trials involving almost 2000 patients found that initial therapy with an echinocandin was a significant predictor of survival. It has become common practice to initiate an echinocandin and then change to an oral azole once the patient becomes clinically stable.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111bACBT]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Invasive candidiasis in children with HIV — treatment choice depends on severity, prior azole exposure, and Candida isolate; an echinocandin is recommended for severely ill children because of fungicidal activity and lack of adverse events (strong, high), while fluconazole is a reasonable alternative for less critically ill patients with no recent azole exposure, and voriconazole can be used when mold coverage is warranted. For infections with C. glabrata, an echinocandin is recommended because of increasing resistance against fluconazole (strong, moderate); clinicians should be aware of the increasing frequency of C. glabrata echinocandin resistance, and if patients on fluconazole or voriconazole are clinically improving, continuing the azole is reasonable. Infection with C. krusei should be treated with an echinocandin, and for C. parapsilosis, fluconazole or amphotericin B is recommended (strong, moderate); although decreased echinocandin response has been suggested, recent adult comparative data found no worse outcomes with initial echinocandin therapy, and if a patient is empirically on an echinocandin and improving when C. parapsilosis is identified, continuing therapy is reasonable. Amphotericin B is effective but less attractive given therapy-related toxicity (weak, moderate); amphotericin B lipid formulations may be preferable to conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate given their improved side effect profile, especially in children at high risk of nephrotoxicity due to preexisting renal disease or use of other nephrotoxic drugs (weak, moderate). Regardless of agent, the recommended duration of therapy for candidemia is 14 days after documented clearance.

### The paradox of the evidence about invasive fungal infection prevention [^113evzMM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

2. Is there an untargeted antifungal strategy or an antifungal drug more effective than others?

Subanalyses did not show any survival benefit from the use of either prophylactic or empiric treatment. No effect was detected for azoles, echinocandins, absorbable, or non-absorbable antifungals. Antifungal prophylaxis was associated with a significant reduction of IFI, whereas empiric treatment was not. Only one RCT evaluated the pre-emptive approach and few patients were enrolled. It may be argued that studies investigating empiric treatment, defined as the administration of antifungals in patients with signs/symptoms of infections at risk for IFIs, enrolled subjects with a more advanced disease process, leading to lack of efficacy. Azoles were associated with a significant reduction of IFIs, whereas studies investigating echinocandins did not show any significant benefit on IFI reduction. Notably, the numbers of studies and included patients were higher for the subanalyses of prophylaxis and azoles. An ongoing multicenter RCT will provide more data on the use of empiric treatment with echinocandins.

### Traditional and emerging antifungal therapies [^114FghJj]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Invasive mycoses continue to be a major problem in the growing population of immunosuppressed patients. More antifungal agents are now available than ever. The options are many, with more efficacies and less toxicity than in the past. These agents differ in terms of spectrum of activity, pharmacologic properties, and indications. In this article we discuss the three major classes of antifungal agents: the polyens, the triazoles, and the echinocandins. The emphasis is placed on their clinical use, side effects, drug interactions, and other practical issues.

Triazoles — class activity and key fluconazole pharmacology are detailed: fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole demonstrate similar activity against most Candida species, although each azole has less activity against C. glabrata and C. krusei; in large clinical trials, fluconazole demonstrated efficacy comparable to amphotericin B deoxycholate for candidemia and is considered standard therapy for oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vaginal candidiasis, as well as urinary tract infections; fluconazole is readily absorbed, with oral bioavailability yielding concentrations equal to approximately 90% of those achieved by intravenous administration; among triazoles, fluconazole has the greatest cerebrospinal fluid and vitreous penetration, achieving concentrations of > 70% of those in serum; fluconazole achieves urine concentrations that are 10–20 times the concentrations in serum and is the preferred treatment option for symptomatic cystitis; all azoles can inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes to some degree, necessitating attention to drug interactions when adding or removing an azole.

### Candidiasis (oropharyngeal) [^114sXYdc]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Candida is a fungus present in the mouths of up to 60% of healthy people, but overt infection is associated with immunosuppression, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and corticosteroid use. In most people, untreated candidiasis persists for months or years unless associated risk factors are treated or eliminated. In neonates, spontaneous cure of oropharyngeal candidiasis usually occurs after 3 to 8 weeks.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis in: adults undergoing treatments that cause immunosuppression; infants and children; people with dentures; and people with HIV infection? Which antifungal treatments reduce the risk of acquiring resistance to antifungal drugs? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 47 RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antifungals (absorbed, partially or topically absorbed, or non-absorbed; for example, imidazole [ketoconazole, clotrimazole, toiconazole, miconazole], polyene [amphotericin B, nystatin], triazole [fluconazole, itraconazole], melaleuca and posaconazole), intermittent or continuous prophylaxis, or treatment, and denture hygiene.

### Cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the skin folds of immunocompromised patients: a case series [^112KkZwF]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report describes 5 immunocompromised patients with prolonged hospitalization who developed intertriginous cutaneous mucormycosis. All patients in the series were immunocompromised and included 3 patients with hematologic malignancy receiving chemotherapy, 1 solid organ transplant recipient, and 1 patient with a critical autoimmune condition. In addition, a sixth patient with similar clinical presentation who developed mucormycosis in the left axilla during prolonged hospitalization status after heart transplantation has previously been reported from our inpatient service. The patients were susceptible to opportunistic infection from Mucorales fungi, which are commonly encountered in the environment, including on hospital linen. Surgery, catheterization, and adhesive tape are potential forms of iatrogenic skin trauma that can promote inoculation. All patients presented herein lacked documented trauma to their site of intertriginous mucormycosis infection. Intertrigo is common among bedridden patients; friction and moisture can lead to maceration disrupting the epidermal barrier and presumably serve as a portal of entry for Mucorales fungal spores. Common sites of intertrigo include the skin folds of the inguinal, axillary, and inframammary areas, as seen in this cohort. Four patients were thought to have candidal intertrigo before their diagnosis of mucormycosis was made. Clues to cutaneous mucormycosis infection included ulceration, signs of inflammation, and induration.

All but 1 patient expired due to complications of mucormycosis infection. Delaying amphotericin B therapy and surgical intervention significantly increases mucormycosis-associated mortality, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Given its low incidence, the initial differential diagnosis for the skin findings did not include mucormycosis for all patients as initial treatments included oral fluconazole and topical nystatin before the correct diagnosis was confirmed via skin biopsy and fungal culture. Mucorales species are commonly resistant to most azoles, allylamines, and echinocandins. Inception or persistence of intertriginous lesions in the setting of typical antifungal prophylaxis agents should raise suspicion for mucormycosis, even without predisposing skin trauma as in this cohort. Interestingly, voriconazole prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients has also been identified as a risk factor for mucormycosis infection.

This series demonstrates that intertriginous skin lesions in immunocompromised patients should prompt concern for cutaneous mucormycosis. Measures to minimize moisture within skin folds such as application of drying powders or cloth can prevent the development of intertrigo. Further research is needed to determine effective strategies for prevention and management of cutaneous mucormycosis given the significant associated morbidity and mortality.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1177F7az]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important health-care-associated fungal infection that can be caused by several Candida spp.; the most common species is Candida albicans, but the prevalence of these organisms varies considerably depending on geographical location. The spectrum of disease of invasive candidiasis ranges from minimally symptomatic candidaemia to fulminant sepsis with an associated mortality exceeding 70%. Candida spp. are common commensal organisms in the skin and gut microbiota, and disruptions in the cutaneous and gastrointestinal barriers (for example, owing to gastrointestinal perforation) promote invasive disease. A deeper understanding of specific Candida spp. virulence factors, host immune response and host susceptibility at the genetic level has led to key insights into the development of early intervention strategies and vaccine candidates. The early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is challenging but key to the effective management, and the development of rapid molecular diagnostics could improve the ability to intervene rapidly and potentially reduce mortality. First-line drugs, including echinocandins and azoles, are effective, but the emergence of antifungal resistance, especially among Candida glabrata, is a matter of concern and underscores the need to administer antifungal medications in a judicious manner, avoiding overuse when possible. A newly described pathogen, Candida auris, is an emerging multidrug-resistant organism that poses a global threat.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114C2Zdk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candidemia pharmacotherapy — azole and amphotericin B roles are outlined as follows: Voriconazole does not provide predictable activity against fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, but it fills an important niche for fluconazole-resistant isolates of C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, or C. glabrata that are voriconazole susceptible and suitable for transition from an echinocandin or amphotericin B (AmB) to oral therapy. There is little role for oral itraconazole for candidemia, and although posaconazole has excellent in vitro activity, currently there is no role for posaconazole in the treatment of candidemia; isavuconazole shows similar in vitro activity and could prove useful in the future. AmB has broad activity against all Candida species except C. lusitaniae, and liposomal AmB, 3 mg/kg daily, has been shown to be as effective as micafungin for treatment of candidemia. Echinocandin-resistant and echinocandin-/azole-resistant Candida isolates, especially C. glabrata, have been documented, fluconazole resistance is frequent among echinocandin-resistant isolates, and the Expert Panel favors lipid formulation AmB for proven or suspected fluconazole and echinocandin-resistant strains until more data are available.

### ESCMID* guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: patients with HIV infection or AIDS [^113v5oT9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Mucosal candidiasis is frequent in immunocompromised HIV-infected highly active antiretroviral (HAART) naive patients or those who have failed therapy. Mucosal candidiasis is a marker of progressive immune deficiency. Because of the frequently marked and prompt immune reconstitution induced by HAART, there is no recommendation for primary antifungal prophylaxis of mucosal candidiasis in the HIV setting in Europe, although it has been evidenced as effective in the pre-HAART era. Fluconazole remains the first line of therapy for both oropharyngeal candidiasis and oesophageal candidiasis and should be preferred to itraconazole oral solution (or capsules when not available) due to fewer side effects. For patients who still present with fluconazole-refractory mucosal candidiasis, oral treatment with any other azole should be preferred based on precise Candida species identification and susceptibility testing results in addition to the optimization of HAART when feasible. For vaginal candidiasis, topical therapy is preferred.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115KSoTs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Echinocandins — spectrum, administration, and outcomes: Caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin are available only as parenteral preparations, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the echinocandins are low for most Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei; however, recent case series have described treatment failures with resistant strains of C. glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis demonstrates innately higher MICs, raising concern it may be less responsive. Each of these agents has been studied for esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis and has demonstrated efficacy, and pooled randomized-trial analyses in almost exclusively nonneutropenic patients suggest a survival advantage associated with initial echinocandin therapy. All echinocandins have minimal adverse effects, are administered once daily intravenously, and achieve therapeutic concentrations in all infection sites with the exception of the eye, CNS, and urine.

### Treatment of Candida infection: a view from the trenches! [^1178GjyB]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an overview of the treatment of Candida infections from the perspective of the infectious disease clinician in the community. An insight is given into relevant issues as they apply to clinical practice. As community hospitals strive to provide state-of-the-art medical care to critically ill patients, effective infection control programs and the infectious disease consultation availability become indispensable.

Recent Findings

Candida infections rank as the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Although C. albicans remains the most common pathogen, emerging trends in invasive candidiasis are notable for a dramatic increase in infections due to non-albicans Candida species, reflecting changes in clinical practice. These trends affect our practice because infections with non-albicans species raise concerns for inherent decreased antifungal susceptibility, ultimately impacting our preventive, empirical and therapeutic approaches. It seems inevitable for most acutely ill patients today to be admitted to the intensive care unit, thus increasing their risk for nosocomial infections. In addition, cost containment efforts may force patients receiving intravenous therapy into less supervised environments, potentially increasing their risk for candidemia.

Summary

Potentially fatal Candida infections are commonplace in seriously ill hospitalized patients. The infectious disease physician is challenged to develop expertise in using the newly introduced antifungal agents, applying evidence-based guidelines developed from quality randomized clinical trials. The infectious disease specialist is called to play a multidisciplinary role formulating infection control policies, developing drug formularies, educating the staff and treating the sickest patients. Infection surveillance in local communities coupled with available antifungal agents may improve our management of Candida infections.

### AreSusceptibilities to azole antifungals predictive of clinical outcome in the treatment of candidemia? [^111i7UN6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to critically analyze published data evaluating the impact of azole pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, MICs, and Candida species on clinical outcomes in patients with candidemia. Clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for fluconazole and voriconazole, which are used to determine susceptibility, have been defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for Candida species. Studies evaluating the relationship between treatment efficacy and in vitro susceptibility, as well as the pharmacodynamic targets, have been conducted in patients treated with fluconazole for candidemia; however, for species other than Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and for other forms of invasive candidiasis, data remain limited and randomized trials are not available. Limited data evaluating these relationships with voriconazole are available. While pharmacodynamic targets for posaconazole and isavuconazole have been proposed based upon studies conducted in murine models, CBPs have not been established by CLSI. Fluconazole remains an important antifungal agent for the treatment of candidemia, and data supporting its use based on in vitro susceptibility are growing, particularly for C. albicans and C. glabrata Further investigation is needed to establish the roles of voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole in the treatment of candidemia and for all agents in the treatment of other forms of invasive candidiasis.

### Anidulafungin for the treatment of candidaemia / invasive candidiasis in selected critically ill patients [^111PnwuV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Invasive Candida infections have a particularly strong impact on intensive care unit (ICU) patients, being associated with mortality rates of 30–50%. Fluconazole is generally effective for candidaemia/invasive candidiasis (C/IC), but its use may be hampered by a potential increase in infections due to fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. Recent guidelines favour echinocandins as first-line therapy in haemodynamically unstable patients, those with previous azole exposure, and clinical settings with high local prevalence of fluconazole resistance. However, the optimum therapy for C/IC in critically ill patients is unknown.

Anidulafungin has excellent activity against invasive isolates of Candida spp. including azole-resistant strains. Anidulafungin was shown to be more effective than fluconazole for C/IC; additional post hoc analyses seem to confirm its efficacy in critically ill patients. However, prospective data on its use in this setting are lacking. Notably, less than half of all patients enrolled in previous clinical trials of echinocandins for C/IC were in the ICU at treatment initiation.

This exploratory, multicentre study prospectively evaluated efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) anidulafungin, optionally followed by an oral azole, as first-line therapy for confirmed C/IC in selected ICU patient populations across Europe and Canada. The trial represents the first prospective assessment of an echinocandin for C/IC exclusively in ICU patients, who comprise a major target population for this antifungal class in clinical practice.

### New antifungal agents [^117EZBR2]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, use of standard antifungal therapies can be limited because of toxicity, low efficacy rates, and drug resistance. New formulations are being prepared to improve absorption and efficacy of some of these standard therapies. Various new antifungals have demonstrated therapeutic potential. These new agents may provide additional options for the treatment of superficial fungal infections and they may help to overcome the limitations of current treatments. Liposomal formulations of AmB have a broad spectrum of activity against invasive fungi, such as Candida spp. C. neoformans, and Aspergillus spp., but not dermatophyte fungi. The liposomal AmB is associated with significantly less toxicity and good rates of efficacy, which compare or exceed that of standard AmB. These factors may provide enough of an advantage to patients to overcome the increased costs of these formulations. Three new azole drugs have been developed, and may be of use in both systemic and superficial fungal infections. Voriconazole, ravuconazole, and posaconazole are triazoles, with broad-spectrum activity. Voriconazole has a high bioavailability, and has been used with success in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal infections. Ravuconazole has shown efficacy in candidiasis in immunocompromised patients, and onychomycosis in healthy patients. Preliminary in vivo studies with posaconazole indicated potential use in a variety of invasive fungal infections including oropharyngeal candidiasis. Echinocandins and pneumocandins are a new class of antifungals, which act as fungal cell wall beta-(1,3)-D-glucan synthase enzyme complex inhibitors. Caspofungin (MK-0991) is the first of the echinocandins to receive Food and Drug Administration approval for patients with invasive aspergillosis not responding or intolerant to other antifungal therapies, and has been effective in patients with oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. Standardization of MIC value determination has improved the ability of scientists to detect drug resistance in fungal species. Cross-resistance of fungal species to antifungal drugs must be considered as a potential problem to future antifungal treatment, and so determination of susceptibility of fungal species to antifungal agents is an important component of information in development of new antifungal agents. Heterogeneity in susceptibility of species to azole antifungals has been noted. This heterogeneity suggests that there are differences in activity of azoles, and different mechanisms of resistance to the azoles, which may explain the present lack of cross-resistance between some azoles despite apparent structural similarities. The mechanisms of azole action and resistance themselves are not well understood, and further studies into azole susceptibility patterns are required.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116G6rGz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection — echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

Symptomatic ascending Candida pyelonephritis — recommended antifungal regimens and urinary tract interventions are as follows: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days with or without oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, monotherapy with oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 2 weeks, could be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Elimination of urinary tract obstruction is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who have nephrostomy tubes or stents in place, consider removal or replacement, if feasible (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Intensive care unit antifungal prescribing considerations — In the ICU, the prescription of antifungals to prevent or treat IC requires consideration of risks associated with widespread antifungal administration. For individual patients, antifungals may be associated with adverse effects and drug interactions. The panel was unable to assess adverse effects in this guideline iteration because of inconsistent reporting, but echinocandins and fluconazole are generally better tolerated than mold-active azoles and AmB formulations. The influence of the gut mycobiome, including gut bacterial microbiome assembly, is being appreciated and is likely perturbed by antifungal use.

Key messages

- Fluconazole is the most common systemic antifungal agent prescribed for treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis; however, the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guidelines favor an echinocandin as initial therapy for candidemia in patients with moderately severe to severe illness.

- This retrospective review of data from the prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial demonstrated that anidulafungin is more effective than fluconazole for treatment of severely ill patients with candidemia, thus supporting the 2009 IDSA guidelines.

### Current concept of abdominal sepsis: WSES position paper [^1171N4gP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fluconazole has been widely used for the treatment of candidiasis since its approval by the FDA in 1990.

The azoles act primarily by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the cellular membrane of fungi.

Most C. albicans isolated from invasive candidiasis infections, remain fully susceptible to fluconazole, which has been the treatment of choice for these infections in most settings including intra-abdominal infections. However, epidemiological data demonstrate that the frequency of Candida infections is rising, with an increase in the proportion of infections caused by non-albicans Candida species that are intrinsically resistant or variably susceptible to fluconazole.

Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the echinocandins in the treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis.

The echinocandins: anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin have a broad and similar spectrum of in vitro and in vivo activity against most Candida spp.

Echinocandins have several potential advantages over fluconazole for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. They have a broader spectrum of activity (encompassing fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata and C. krusei) and potent fungicidal activity against most Candida species.

In the specific setting of intra-abdominal infections, echinocandins are generally recommended as a first line empiric therapy for critical ill patients, while fluconazole is typically recommended for less severe cases.

### Empiric anti-Candida therapy for patients with sepsis in the ICU: how little is too little? [^114GxTLv]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Prior analyses suggest that empiric fluconazole for ICU patients with sepsis is cost-effective. Using updated estimates of efficacy and cost, Zilberberg and colleagues compare the use of micafungin with that of fluconazole. The authors conclude that micafungin is an attractive alternative to fluconazole. This conclusion is driven by recent reduction in micafungin's cost and by better activity of micafungin against azole-resistant Candida species. Their results are limited by inflated estimates of efficacy, life expectancy and risk of Candida sepsis. This commentary explores the rationale for early anti-Candida strategies in the ICU and highlights the contribution and limitations of the article by Zilberberg and colleagues.

Characteristics of candidiasis

We documented a mixed picture of skin infections in the CMC cohort under study. Altogether, 50% (13/26) of patients reported intertrigo, 46% (12/26) pustules and 44% (11/25) infections of the scalp; and 50% (9/18) of affected patients reported chronic skin infections. More chronic than recurrent cases were reported, regarding infections of the scalp (chronic infections: 67%, 6/9; recurrent infections: 33%, 3/9). Onychomycosis appeared in 64% (16/25) and paronychia in 39% (7/23) of patients. Onychomycosis and paronychia were both chronic in three quarters of cases (76%, 13/17). Treatment response varied from complete remission (20%, 3/15) to partial remission (80%, 12/15), rendering resistance a possible complication in patients with nail candidiasis.

Nine female patients of reproductive age provided information about vulvovaginal candidiasis. In 67% (6/9) of these female patients Candida infection of the vulva was documented and candidiasis affected both vagina and perineal region in the two-thirds of cases (67%, 4/6). Complete response after antifungal therapy was likely (80%, 4/5), but infections of the vulvovaginal area often reoccurred (83%, 5/6) when antifungal treatment was stopped.

The majority of patients received both topical and systemic antifungal treatment. Oral therapy with fluconazole and other triazoles was often used to provide a long-lasting prophylaxis. Oral preparations of amphotericin B were administered in severe cases. In case of topical treatment, nystatin proved to be a good alternative to triazoles. Duration of topical antifungal treatment ranged from 2 weeks to several months while medical prescription was reported to continue for about 4 weeks per episode in most cases.

### Clinical practice: combination antifungal therapy for mold infections: much ado about nothing? [^115WFwUd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

In general, mortality rates associated with systemic fungal infections have not improved much in more than a decade, although the number of antifungal agents available for the treatment of serious fungal infections has increased in the past few years. A possible approach to decreasing mortality rates associated with fungal infections may be to treat patients with combinations of different classes of antifungals. Recently, in vitro and animal studies evaluating different combinations of antifungal agents have demonstrated important synergistic and/or additive activity against many genera of fungi. However, prudence is required, because some antifungal combinations have demonstrated antagonistic activity. Well-controlled clinical trials are still necessary to define the most efficacious antifungal combination. In addition, these clinical trials should evaluate the adverse event profile of the combination regimens, as well as their pharmacoeconomic impact.

Candidemia — treatment transitions and antifungal options are graded as follows: Transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole (usually within 5–7 days) is recommended for clinically stable patients with fluconazole-susceptible isolates and negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For infection due to C. glabrata, transition to higher-dose fluconazole 800 mg (12 mg/kg) daily or voriconazole 200–300 (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily should only be considered among patients with fluconazole-susceptible or voriconazole-susceptible isolates (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Lipid formulation amphotericin B (AmB) (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Transition from AmB to fluconazole is recommended after 5–7 days in patients with fluconazole-susceptible isolates who are clinically stable and have negative repeat cultures on antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandin-resistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Oral nystatin prophylaxis in surgical / trauma ICU patients: a randomised clinical trial [^111jz3mf]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of the present study is that systematic nystatin prophylaxis significantly reduces the development of Candida species colonisation and that it significantly reduces the CCI after 6 days of treatment in patients already colonised at ICU admission.

Invasive candidiasis infections are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in ICU patients (30 to 40%), depending on the severity of underlying disease, the Candida species involved, and the timing and choice of antifungal treatment. Early and adequate antifungal treatment is well known to be independently associated with a reduction of hospital mortality. This is the reason why early antifungal treatments, such as prophylaxis, pre-emptive, or empiric therapies, have progressively emerged; however, most of these strategies lack an evidence base that would establish them as the standard of care. Several studies evaluated the effects of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy on fungal infection and mortality, and most of them compared fluconazole with placebo. Some concerns remain about the use of azoles for prophylaxis, including the emergence of resistance among previously susceptible strains (C. albicans) or a shift to less susceptible or resistant non- albicans species (C. glabrata or C. krusei), increased costs, and adverse events. Moreover, because patient populations, dosing regimens, severity of illness, and definitions of infection and other outcome measures varied between trials, conclusions are difficult to extrapolate. Current recommendations limit the use of antifungal prophylaxis to high-risk adult patients admitted to those ICUs that have very high rates of invasive candidiasis, and advocate against the widespread use of an antifungal in all ICU patients.

### Miconazole nitrate (Monistat-derm) [^114j2aUY]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration:

Sufficient MONISTAT-DERM Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and cutaneous candidiasis, and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If MONISTAT-DERM Cream is used in intertriginous areas, it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.

Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, Candida infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after a month of treatment, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^116PoHw5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

New antifungals, ibrexafungerp and oteseconazole, are now available for treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Both have novel antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties and advantages over fluconazole, although comparative trials have involved only placebo. In the absence of allergy, intolerance, and resistance, it is unclear whether these antifungals will replace fluconazole.

### Antifungal prophylaxis with azole derivatives [^115mhFSa]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

In recent years, several reports have underlined the increasing role of fungal infections as a cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. For this reason, and also in light of the high mortality rate associated with these infections, chemoprophylaxis has been advocated by several authors. The available evidence suggests that both fluconazole and itraconazole are able to decrease candida colonisation and infection, when compared with placebo or with nonabsorbable antifungals. Data seem also to suggest that a decrease in fungus-related mortality can be achieved with prophylaxis, although with little effect on overall mortality, probably because of the importance of severe underlying diseases. Itraconazole proved to be effective in the prevention of fungal infections, including invasive aspergillosis, although with increased incidence of side-effects, often leading to treatment discontinuation. The other side of the coin is that antifungal prophylaxis might have untoward effects, such as the selection of triazole-resistant Candida strains or the induction of resistance. In addition, some authors have suggested that the use of triazoles might modulate the pattern of infecting organisms in cancer patients, increasing the risk of both aspergillosis and bacteremia. In conclusion, antifungal prophylaxis with triazole antifungals should be used with caution, only in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections. These include allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients (especially those with mismatched or unrelated donors), acute myeloid leukaemia patients treated with high-dose cytarabine (C-ara), very-low-birth-weight infants, patients with chronic granulomatous disease, and high-risk surgical and intensive-care unit patients.
