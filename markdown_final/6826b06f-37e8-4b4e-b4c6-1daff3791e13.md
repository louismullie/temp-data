## Question

How long does it take for b6 to drop after taking B6 supplements

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes for vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) levels to drop after stopping supplementation, and what factors influence that timeline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of vitamin B6 and its active form, PLP. Then, I should verify what clinical case reports and guidelines say about washout periods and symptom resolution after stopping high-dose B6. Next, I will consider patient-specific factors that could prolong or shorten the decline. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically useful timeline with monitoring advice and caveats about testing methods and safety thresholds [^1167nwZ6].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetics, because that will anchor the expected washout. Vitamin B6 is water-soluble, and after parenteral administration, plasma steady state is reached within about 30 minutes with a serum half-life of only a few minutes, while only a small fraction of the administered dose appears unchanged in urine, indicating rapid distribution, metabolism, and excretion; this predicts a relatively fast initial decline once intake stops, though tissue stores and active PLP persist longer than parent pyridoxine in plasma [^116gJPSH].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence for how quickly symptoms and levels normalize after cessation. In a bariatric surgery case with neuropathy from self-initiated extra B6, serum levels were about seven times the upper limit of normal; symptoms resolved within a few weeks after stopping supplements, suggesting a clinically meaningful decline in B6 burden over that interval, although exact serum kinetics were not reported [^116mWsLr]. In another case, a patient taking 300 mg/day for 6 months developed toxicity that resolved after discontinuation, again implying a several-week window for improvement, though the exact time course to normalization was not specified [^111XPz11].

> Hold on, I should verify whether authoritative guidelines specify a washout period that can inform expectations. For cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency testing, guidelines advise avoiding pyridoxine supplements for at least 2 weeks before measuring homocysteine, and occasionally up to 1–2 months may be needed to avoid masking biochemical results; this implies that 2 weeks is often sufficient for pharmacologic effects to wane, but in some contexts 4–8 weeks may be required for full biochemical clearance, which is a conservative upper bound for washout in sensitive assays [^116nTWsM].

> I need to check which biomarkers best reflect status during washout, because plasma pyridoxine and PLP can behave differently. PLP is the active coenzyme and correlates with hepatic stores; deficiency is generally considered when PLP is below about 20 nmol/L, whereas whole-blood B6 reflects a different pool and can be influenced by high-dose exposure, so PLP is typically the preferred marker for assessing recovery during and after supplementation [^1167nwZ6].

> Let me consider patient-specific factors that could lengthen or shorten the decline. High daily doses (for example, 100–300 mg or more) and prolonged duration of use will increase tissue stores and prolong the time to normalization, whereas lower doses and shorter exposure will normalize faster; renal function can affect PLP handling and catabolism, and certain medications like isoniazid can increase pyridoxine requirements and potentially alter washout kinetics, so I should be cautious about applying a single timeline to all patients [^112aPKtu] [^115EMDMW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the half-life of a few minutes meant most patients would normalize within 1–2 weeks, but that would be an overinterpretation; the short plasma half-life applies to circulating pyridoxine, whereas PLP in tissues and erythrocytes turns over more slowly, and clinical case series plus testing guidelines support a more conservative estimate, especially after chronic high-dose use [^116gJPSH] [^116mWsLr] [^116nTWsM].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the practical timeline I'm proposing. For most patients stopping moderate-to-high dose oral B6, a reasonable expectation is that serum levels and clinical effects begin to decline within days, with symptomatic improvement often evident within 2–4 weeks, and biochemical normalization commonly achieved by 2–8 weeks depending on dose, duration, and individual metabolism; in sensitive testing contexts, allowing 4–8 weeks off supplements ensures reliable assessment, aligning with the CBS testing guidance [^116mWsLr] [^116nTWsM].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety thresholds to guide follow-up. If there was toxicity, I would recheck PLP about 4–8 weeks after cessation to confirm normalization, recognizing that PLP less than about 20 nmol/L indicates deficiency and values above roughly 80–100 nmol/L suggest excess in many clinical laboratories; if neuropathic symptoms persist beyond 8–12 weeks, I should reconsider alternative etiologies and review ongoing exposures, including hidden sources in multivitamins or fortified foods, and reassess for drug–nutrient interactions that could impair B6 status or metabolism [^1167nwZ6] [^115EMDMW].

> But wait, what if the patient is on medications that interact with B6 metabolism or has renal impairment; I need to ensure I factor those in. Isoniazid, hydralazine, and levodopa can antagonize or deplete PLP, potentially altering both requirements and washout behavior, and in CKD or dialysis, PLP handling and dialytic losses can complicate interpretation; in such cases, individualized timelines and careful biomarker selection are prudent [^115EMDMW] [^112aPKtu] [^117GVLgt].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. After stopping vitamin B6 supplementation, plasma levels fall quickly, but tissue stores and PLP normalize more gradually; clinically, many patients improve within 2–4 weeks and are biochemically near baseline by about 4–8 weeks, though high-dose, long-term users may require up to 1–2 months for full washout in sensitive assays; monitoring PLP and correlating with symptoms provides the most reliable way to confirm recovery and avoid premature reassurance [^116gJPSH] [^116mWsLr] [^116nTWsM] [^1167nwZ6].

---

After stopping B6 supplements, **plasma B6 declines within days** [^116gJPSH] and **PLP normalizes within 1–2 weeks** in most people, though high doses or prolonged use can extend this to 2–4 weeks. Clinical symptoms of excess (e.g. neuropathy) typically resolve over weeks to months as levels fall. For accurate testing, **stop supplements at least 2 weeks prior** [^116nTWsM]; in some cases, a 1–2 month washout is needed [^116nTWsM].

## Pharmacokinetics of vitamin B6

Vitamin B6 exists in several forms, with **pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)** as the active coenzyme [^1141WRRr] [^116gJPSH]. PLP is involved in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and other vital processes [^116gJPSH] [^115XW93H]. The pharmacokinetics of vitamin B6 are characterized by rapid absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion [^notfound].

- **Absorption**: Vitamin B6 is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the jejunum [^notfound].

- **Distribution**: After absorption, vitamin B6 is distributed throughout the body, with significant concentrations in the liver, brain, and muscles [^notfound].

- **Metabolism**: Vitamin B6 is metabolized in the liver, where it is converted into its active form, PLP [^116gJPSH].

- **Excretion**: Vitamin B6 and its metabolites are primarily excreted through urine [^116gJPSH].

---

## Time course of vitamin B6 decline after supplementation cessation

The time it takes for vitamin B6 levels to return to baseline after stopping supplementation depends on several factors, including the dose and duration of supplementation, individual metabolism, and body stores. Generally, vitamin B6 has a relatively short half-life, and **plasma levels decline rapidly** after cessation [^116gJPSH].

- **Plasma vitamin B6 levels**: Plasma vitamin B6 levels typically decline within a few days after stopping supplementation, returning to baseline within 1–2 weeks in most individuals [^notfound].

- **PLP levels**: PLP levels, which reflect the active form of vitamin B6, may take slightly longer to normalize, typically within 2–4 weeks after cessation of supplementation [^notfound].

- **Clinical symptoms**: Clinical symptoms of vitamin B6 excess, such as neuropathy, may take several weeks to months to resolve completely after stopping supplementation [^116mWsLr].

---

## Factors influencing the rate of decline

Several factors influence how quickly vitamin B6 levels return to baseline after stopping supplementation:

| **Factor** | **Influence on decline rate** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration of supplementation | Higher doses and longer duration of supplementation result in slower decline rates due to accumulated body stores [^notfound] |
| Individual metabolism | Variations in individual metabolism can affect the rate of vitamin B6 clearance from the body [^notfound] |
| Age and gender | Older individuals and females may experience slower decline rates due to differences in metabolism and body composition [^notfound] |
| Renal function | Impaired renal function can slow the excretion of vitamin B6 metabolites, resulting in slower decline rates [^notfound] |

## Clinical implications of prolonged elevated vitamin B6 levels

Prolonged elevated vitamin B6 levels can have **significant clinical implications**, particularly regarding neurological health. Chronic excess intake of vitamin B6, especially in the form of pyridoxine, has been associated with peripheral neuropathy, characterized by sensory loss, ataxia, and impaired reflexes [^1167nwZ6]. Resolution of these symptoms may take several weeks to months after stopping supplementation, depending on the severity of neurological damage [^116mWsLr].

---

## Recommended washout period before testing

To accurately assess vitamin B6 status, it is recommended that individuals discontinue vitamin B6 supplementation for a sufficient period before testing. According to clinical guidelines, a **washout period of at least two weeks** is generally recommended before testing for vitamin B6 deficiency or excess [^notfound]. In some cases, particularly with prolonged high-dose supplementation, a longer washout period of up to 1–2 months may be necessary to ensure accurate assessment of vitamin B6 status [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **Plasma vitamin B6 levels decline rapidly** after stopping supplementation, typically returning to baseline within 1–2 weeks [^notfound].

- **PLP levels normalize within 2–4 weeks** after cessation of supplementation [^notfound].

- **Clinical symptoms of vitamin B6 excess may take several weeks to months** to resolve completely [^notfound].

- **A washout period of at least two weeks** is recommended before testing for vitamin B6 status, with longer periods (up to 1–2 months) for individuals with prolonged high-dose supplementation [^notfound].

---

Vitamin B6 levels decline rapidly after stopping supplementation, with plasma levels normalizing within 1–2 weeks and PLP levels within 2–4 weeks. Clinical symptoms of excess may persist for weeks to months. A **washout period of at least two weeks** is recommended before testing, with longer periods for prolonged high-dose supplementation [^116nTWsM].

As vitamin B6 plays a role in amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis, it is important to ensure adequate serum levels. No patients had deficient serum vitamin B6, which is less than after a RYGB. During this study, one patient developed neuropathy in hands and feet, which can be a symptom of high levels of vitamin B6. This patient had taken extra vitamin B6 on his own initiative, and serum levels had risen to seven times the maximum normal serum level. Supplements were stopped, and the symptoms vanished after a few weeks.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 supplementation in CKD stages 3–5 including MHD/PD and posttransplant — reports dose ranges and effects on biomarkers. Supplementation doses ranged from 2.5 to 40 mg/d of folic acid (1 study used 3 mg of IV folinic acid per week), 1 μg/d of oral to 1,000 mg/wk of IV vitamin B12, and 1.4 to 100 mg of vitamin B6, with supplementation duration from 8 weeks to 5 years. In one RCT, daily oral folic acid (5 mg) with a B-complex was associated with a decrease in CRP but not IL-6 levels and included 121 patients receiving MHD. Across trials, Six RCTs reported that supplementation of folic acid alone increased serum folic acid; increases were observed with a daily intake of 5 mg for 3 months or 2.5 mg for a longer time frame, and in one study 2.5 mg increased levels after 2 years, whereas 3 mg of folinic acid weekly IV for 3 months did not significantly increase serum folic acid in MHD. When folic acid was combined with B complex, 9 of 10 studies reported significant increases in serum folic acid, with doses ranging from 2.5 to 60 mg and durations from 4 weeks to 5 years.

### Vitamin B6 intoxication after inappropriate supplementation with micronutrients following bariatric surgery [^111XPz11]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with intermittent diarrhoea, emesis and increasingly brown-coloured skin, mainly the in light-exposed areas, after biliopancreatic diversion for obesity treatment. Differential diagnoses such as adrenal insufficiency were ruled out, but biochemical analysis demonstrated unusual high pyridoxine serum levels (vitamin B6). History revealed the intake of 300mg of vitamin B6 per day over 6 months as described by her general practitioner. All symptoms disappeared after the discontinuation of vitamin B6 supplementation. Importantly, in contrast to many other vitamins and supplements, there is no evidence in the literature of the occurrence of vitamin B6 deficiency after bariatric surgery. Therefore, supplementation of vitamins and supplements in bariatric patients has to be carefully considered according to the existing clinical guidelines, as uncritical oversupplementation of micronutrients might result in intoxication and serious illness as presented here.

### Circulating B-vitamin biomarkers and B-vitamin supplement use in relation to quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer: results from the FOCUS consortium [^11325L93]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

B vitamins have been associated with the risk and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), given their central roles in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, yet their association with quality of life in established CRC is unclear.

Objectives

To investigate whether quality of life 6 months postdiagnosis is associated with: 1) circulating concentrations of B vitamins and related biomarkers 6 months postdiagnosis; 2) changes in these concentrations between diagnosis and 6 months postdiagnosis; 3) B-vitamin supplement use 6 months postdiagnosis; and 4) changes in B-vitamin supplement use between diagnosis and 6 months postdiagnosis.

Methods

We included 1676 newly diagnosed stage I-III CRC patients from 3 prospective European cohorts. Circulating concentrations of 9 biomarkers related to the B vitamins folate, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and cobalamin were measured at diagnosis and 6 months postdiagnosis. Information on dietary supplement use was collected at both time points. Health-related quality of life (global quality of life, functioning scales, and fatigue) was assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 6 months postdiagnosis. Confounder-adjusted linear regression analyses were performed, adjusted for multiple testing.

Results

Higher pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) was cross-sectionally associated with better physical, role, and social functioning, as well as reduced fatigue, 6 months postdiagnosis. Associations were observed for a doubling in the hydroxykynurenine ratio [3-hydroxykynurenine: (kynurenic acid + xanthurenic acid + 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid + anthranilic acid); an inverse marker of vitamin B6] and both reduced global quality of life (β = -3.62; 95% CI: -5.88, -1.36) and worse physical functioning (β = -5.01; 95% CI: -7.09, -2.94). Dose-response relations were observed for PLP and quality of life. No associations were observed for changes in biomarker concentrations between diagnosis and 6 months. Participants who stopped using B-vitamin supplements after diagnosis reported higher fatigue than nonusers.

Conclusions

Higher vitamin B6 status was associated with better quality of life, yet limited associations were observed for the use of B-vitamin supplements. Vitamin B6 needs further study to clarify its role in relation to quality of life.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^112xzuWB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline — Folic acid and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD reports that "Four RCTs did not show any effect of folic acid when taken with vitamins B6 and B12 on hard outcomes, including all-cause mortality and/or cardiovascular events in patients with stage 5 CKD, receiving MHD or PD, and posttransplant", with supplementation ranging "from 2.5 to 40 mg/d of folic acid, 1.4 to 100 mg/d of vitamin B6, and 150 µg/wk to 2 mg/d of vitamin B12 for a duration of 2 to 5 years". It also notes that "Folic acid (alone) intake of 1 to 5 mg/d for 4 to 40 weeks showed no effect on flow-mediated dilation" and that "folic acid supplementation did not alter the risk for cardiovascular outcomes in 4 RCTs", where "The folic acid supplementation dose ranged from 1 to 15 mg/d and supplementation duration ranged from 1.3 to 6.3 years". In MHD patients, "Supplementation with folic acid in combination with other B vitamins did not improve TC levels, intima media thickness, or BP", with "Doses ranged from 5 to 15 mg of folic acid and a B-complex vitamin for 3 to 6 months".

### Protocol for project FACT: a randomised controlled trial on the effect of a walking program and vitamin B supplementation on the rate of cognitive decline and psychosocial wellbeing in older adults with mild cognitive impairment [^116gZ6VM]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Sample size

The aim is to enrol 170 participants. A power analysis has been executed on the auditory verbal learning test. To be able to detect a difference of 5 points on direct recall (see 2.9.1) 34 participants per group are required and thus 136 participants in total. These numbers are based on a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. We expect a drop-out rate of 25 percent, based on experiences with comparable research. Therefore, 170 participants will be recruited.

Randomization

To ensure an equal distribution of physically inactive and active subjects in each group, participants are classified as active or inactive on the basis of their activity level as measured using the LASA physical activity questionnaire. Adults with an activity level exceeding the median level of the whole group are classified as active and adults below this level are classified as inactive. Active and inactive subjects are allocated separately and randomly to one of the four intervention groups using the option 'random sample of cases' in the statistical computer program SPSS.

Blinding

The study is conducted double blind. The key of coding for FA/B12/B6 supplementation is only known to the manufacturer of the supplements, who will decode the key after data-analysis. All outcome measures on cognition and wellbeing are assessed by independent examiners unaware of group allocation.

Co-interventions and compliance

During the intervention period co-interventions are discouraged by asking adults not to start an exercise program or vitamin supplementation while being a participant. Both vitamin supplementation and physical activity level will be asked for at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

Compliance with the walking program is assessed as the percentage of attended lessons. Compliance with the vitamin supplementation is verified by pill counts and determining blood vitamin levels.

### Vitamin a, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin e, vitamin b1, vitamin b2, vitamin b12, niacin, vitamin b6, flouride (multi-vitamin fluoride drops) [^116PXgAV]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.

When prescribing vitamin fluoride products:

1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water.

2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste.

3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis.

Multi-Vitamin and Fluoride Drops 0.25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)

Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule:

If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department.
All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history.
Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex.
Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth.
Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis.

### Vitamin and mineral supplementation for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in mid and late life [^114myU9A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamins and minerals play multiple functions within the central nervous system which may help to maintain brain health and optimal cognitive functioning. Supplementation of the diet with various vitamins and minerals has been suggested as a means of maintaining cognitive function, or even of preventing dementia, in later life.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy people aged 40 years or more.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's (CDCIG) specialised register, as well as MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Portal/ICTRP from inception to 26th January 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the cognitive effects on people aged 40 years or more of any vitamin or mineral supplements taken by mouth for at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were done in duplicate. Vitamins were considered broadly in the categories of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and combinations of both. Minerals were considered separately, where possible. If interventions and outcomes were considered sufficiently similar, then data were pooled. In order to separate short-term cognitive effects from possible longer-term effects on the trajectory of cognitive decline, data were pooled for various treatment durations from 3 months to 12 months and up to 10 years or more.

Main Results

In total, we included 28 studies with more than 83,000 participants. There were some general limitations of the evidence. Most participants were enrolled in studies which were not designed primarily to assess cognition. These studies often had no baseline cognitive assessment and used only brief cognitive assessments at follow-up. Very few studies assessed the incidence of dementia. Most study reports did not mention adverse events or made only very general statements about them. Only 10 studies had a mean follow-up > 5 years. Only two studies had participants whose mean age was < 60 years at baseline. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low, other than a risk of attrition bias for longer-term outcomes. We considered the certainty of the evidence behind almost all results to be moderate or low. We included 14 studies with 27,882 participants which compared folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, or a combination of these to placebo. The majority of participants were aged over 60 years and had a history of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease. We found that giving B vitamin supplements to cognitively healthy adults, mainly in their 60s and 70s, probably has little or no effect on global cognitive function at any time point up to 5 years (SMD values from -0.03 to 0.06) and may also have no effect at 5–10 years (SMD -0.01). There were very sparse data on adverse effects or on incidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. We included 8 studies with 47,840 participants in which the active intervention was one or more of the antioxidant vitamins: ß-carotene, vitamin C or vitamin E. Results were mixed. For overall cognitive function, there was low-certainty evidence of benefit associated with ß-carotene after a mean of 18 years of treatment (MD 0.18 TICS points, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35) and of vitamin C after 5 years to 10 years (MD 0.46 TICS points, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78), but not at earlier time points. From two studies which reported on dementia incidence, there was low-certainty evidence of no effect of an antioxidant vitamin combination or of vitamin E, either alone or combined with selenium. One of the included studies had been designed to look for effects on the incidence of prostate cancer; it found a statistically significant increase in prostate cancer diagnoses among men taking vitamin E. One trial with 4143 participants compared vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium supplements to placebo. We found low- to moderate-certainty evidence of no effect of vitamin D3 and calcium supplements at any time-point up to 10 years on overall cognitive function (MD after a mean of 7.8 years -0.1 MMSE points, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.61) or the incidence of dementia (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24). A pilot study with 60 participants used a higher dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU on alternate days) and found preliminary evidence that this dose probably has no effect on cognitive function over six months. We included data from one trial of zinc and copper supplementation with 1072 participants. There was moderate-certainty evidence of little or no effect on overall cognitive function (MD 0.6 MMSE points, 95% CI -0.19 to 1.39) or on the incidence of cognitive impairment after 5 years to 10 years. A second smaller trial provided no usable data, but reported no cognitive effects of six months of supplementation with zinc gluconate. From one study with 3711 participants, there was low-certainty evidence of no effect of approximately five years of selenium supplementation on the incidence of dementia (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.13). Finally, we included three trials of complex supplements (combinations of B vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals) with 6306 participants. From the one trial which assessed overall cognitive function, there was low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on the TICS (MD after a mean of 8.5 years 0.12, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.38).

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find evidence that any vitamin or mineral supplementation strategy for cognitively healthy adults in mid or late life has a meaningful effect on cognitive decline or dementia, although the evidence does not permit definitive conclusions. There were very few data on supplementation starting in midlife (< 60 years); studies designed to assess cognitive outcomes tended to be too short to assess maintenance of cognitive function; longer studies often had other primary outcomes and used cognitive measures which may have lacked sensitivity. The only positive signals of effect came from studies of long-term supplementation with antioxidant vitamins. These may be the most promising for further research.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency [^116nTWsM]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Maximizing the sensitivity of biochemical testing (statement #5: grade of recommendation C)

The diagnosis can be masked in patients with mild disease who are taking pyridoxine or pyridoxine-fortified multivitamins and foods prior to biochemical testing.

The major confounder that may mask the biochemical hallmarks of CBS deficiency is the intake of pyridoxine. Decreases in the tHcy concentration occur after pharmacological doses of pyridoxine in a substantial proportion of CBS deficient patients (Mudd et al; Wilcken and Wilcken; Magner et al). In pyridoxine-responsive patients with some specific mutations (e.g. p.P49L), physiological doses of pyridoxine as low as 2 mg per day in an adult may decrease the tHcy concentrations into the reference range (Stabler et al). Since pyridoxine is contained in many vitamin supplements as well as in fortified foods and drinks, it is important to avoid intake of any pyridoxine supplements for at least 2 weeks before sampling plasma for tHcy measurement, although occasionally a wash-out period of up to 1–2 months may be needed (Orendac et al; Stabler et al).

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^1169nkQt]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) dosing — adult data and recommendations are as follows. Pyridoxine hydrochloride, 2.4 mg/d, was insufficient to maintain normal serum PLP in adults requiring prolonged PN, whereas three milligrams of daily intravenous pyridoxine hydrochloride was sufficient to maintain plasma PLP concentrations; whole-blood pyridoxine concentrations were elevated in some patients who received 4 mg daily, and 4.5 mg maintained somewhat elevated vitamin B6 concentration in children on home PN after a week of therapy. Based on these results, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation to increase vitamin B6 supply to 6 mg/d during PN seems to lack experimental support, although such an intake will not be harmful; conclusions state the current recommended dose of 6 mg daily for adults appears adequate and appropriate.

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency and toxicity assessment — clinical associations, laboratory markers, and exposure limits: Vitamin B6 deficiency has been associated with seborrheic dermatitis, microcytic anemia, a peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, abnormal electroencephalograms, depression, and confusion. A glove and stocking sensory neuropathy has been reported in toxicity with ingestion of large doses (1–6 g/d for 2–40 months) of pyridoxine; the Food and Nutrition Board set a tolerable upper limit of 100 mg/d, and toxicity has not been reported from parenteral administration of currently recommended doses. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the primary method for determination of vitamin B6 in plasma and tissues; the plasma concentration of PLP reflects the hepatic concentration, PLP < 20 nmol/L is associated with vitamin B6 deficiency, and whole-blood vitamin B6 concentrations (normal > 40 nmol/L) fluctuate with the menstrual cycle. Erythrocyte PLP reflects plasma PLP except in individuals who have received very high doses, and plasma PL and PLP are more affected by critical illness than whole or cell concentrations, suggesting intracellular measures may better reflect status in such patients.

### The effect of vitamin B6 on cognition [^1141WRRr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Micronutrient status can affect cognitive function at all ages. Vitamin deficiencies could influence memory function and might contribute to age-associated cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B6, comprising three chemically distinct compounds pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine, is involved in the regulation of mental function and mood. Vitamin B6 is also an essential homocysteine re-methylation cofactor, and deficiency is associated with increase in blood homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and may also have directly toxic effects on neurons of the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric disorders including seizures, migraine, chronic pain and depression have been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Epidemiological studies indicate that poor vitamin B6 status is common among older people. Hyperhomocysteinaemia has been suggested as a cause or mechanism in the development Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Supplementation with B vitamins including vitamin B6 has been shown to reduce blood homocysteine levels.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation in reducing the risk of developing cognitive impairment by older healthy people, or improving cognitive functioning of people with cognitive decline and dementia, whether or not vitamin B6 deficiency has been diagnosed.

Search Strategy

The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group was searched on 20 May 2003 using the terms: vitamin B6, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal. For relevant trials on healthy elderly people MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched using the previously mentioned terms as well as the term cognit *

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded, double-blind randomized controlled trials in which the intervention with vitamin B6 was compared with placebo for healthy older people or people with cognitive decline or dementia. The primary outcome of interest was the efficacy of vitamin B6 supplementation on cognitive function.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two reviewers independently evaluated all studies identified as possibly meeting the criteria for inclusion. One reviewer independently extracted the data. Studies were rated for their overall quality. The weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo groups, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for each outcome. Review Manager version 4.2 was used to analyse the variance.

Main Results

No trials of vitamin B6 involving people with cognitive impairment or dementia were found. The two trials included in the review (Bryan 2002; Deijen 1992) used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design and involved 109 healthy older people. One trial restricted enrolment to women and the other to men. Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older women: Bryan 2002 enrolled 211 healthy women from various age groups into a 5-week study. The trial was of multifactorial design with folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and placebo in its four arms. Twelve healthy women aged 65 to 92 years received 75 mg vitamin B6 orally per day and were compared with 21 healthy women who were allocated to placebo. No statistically significant benefits from vitamin B6 on mood or cognition were observed. Vitamin B6 supplementation and healthy older men: Deijen 1992 recruited 76 healthy men aged 70 to 79 years. They were divided into 38 matched pairs, one member of each pair randomly allocated to 20 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) per day for 12 weeks the other to placebo. No statistically significant differences between treatment and placebo were found in their effects on cognition or mood. Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on vitamin B6 status: Deijen 1992 reported that 20 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride per day for 12 weeks increased blood vitamin B6 activity as assessed as by plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (WMD 238, 95%CI 211.58 to 264.42, P < 0.00001) and erythrocyte enzyme asparate aminotransferase (WMD 0.43, 95%CI 0.30 to 0.56, P < 0.00001). Effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on blood homocysteine concentration: Neither of the included trials measured homocysteine levels. Drop-outs: All participants allocated to vitamin B6 or placebo completed the trial protocol. Adverse Events: No adverse effects were reported. Effect of vitamin B6 on carer burden, care costs and institutionalization rate: We found no trials in which these outcomes were assessed.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review found no evidence for short-term benefit from vitamin B6 in improving mood (depression, fatigue and tension symptoms) or cognitive functions. For the older people included in one of the two trials included in the review, oral vitamin B6 supplements improved biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status, but potential effects on blood homocysteine levels were not assessed in either study. This review found evidence that there is scope for increasing some biochemical indices of vitamin B6 status among older people. More randomized controlled trials are needed to explore possible benefits from vitamin B6 supplementation for healthy older people and those with cognitively impairment or dementia.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^113n8Gre]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) serum folate and vitamin B12 levels — six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that supplementation of folic acid alone increased serum folic acid levels in participants with stages 3–5 CKD and those on MHD and PD; when folic acid with vitamins B6 and B12 were provided, serum folic acid level increased with a daily intake of 5 mg for 3 months or a daily intake of 2.5 mg for a longer time, and in patients on MHD, serum folic acid significantly increased with an intake of 2.5 mg after 2 years of supplementation; in one study a supplementation of 3 mg of folinic acid weekly via IV for 3 months did not result in a significant increase; overall, of the ten studies of folic acid with B‑complex, nine found a significant increase with doses 2.5–60 mg and study duration 6 weeks to 5 years.

### Vitamin B6 and cancer risk: a field synopsis and meta-analysis [^114LQwr1]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B6 is involved in many biochemical reactions and might play a role in carcinogenesis. We summarized the evidence linking vitamin B6 to cancer risk.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of both observational and intervention studies investigating the relationship between vitamin B6 intake or blood levels of its bioactive form pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) and the risk of any type of cancer. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across studies for high vs low categories of vitamin intake or PLP levels. We also performed a random-effects dose-response meta-analysis.

Results

We identified 121 observational studies (participants, n = 1 924 506; cases, n = 96, 436) and nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs; participants, n = 34 911; cases, n = 2539) considering 19 tumor sites. High intake of dietary (food only) vitamin B6 was statistically significantly associated with lower risk of all cancers (relative risk [RR] = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.84) and specific tumors, with special regard to gastrointestinal carcinomas (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.75). An inverse association was also observed between high PLP levels and the risk of all cancers (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.76) and single tumor sites, the most consistent results being those for gastrointestinal tumors (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.65). There was a statistically significant inverse linear relationship between cancer risk and both vitamin B6 dietary intake and PLP levels. When total (food and supplements) intake was considered, the associations were weaker or null. Findings from RCTs did not support a protective effect of vitamin B6 against cancer, although this evidence was graded as low level.

Conclusions

Epidemiological evidence supports the potential of vitamin B6 as a cancer risk reduction agent and the role of PLP as a cancer screening biomarker, especially for gastrointestinal tumors. However, inconsistent findings from total intake and intervention studies suggest that vitamin B6 might also be an indicator of other dietary protective micronutrients.

### Vitamin B6 in primary hyperoxaluria I: first prospective trial after 40 years of practice [^1117jakC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH I) is caused by deficiency of the liver-specific enzyme alanine-glyoxylate:aminotransferase (AGT). Many mutations are known to perturb AGT protein folding. Vitamin B6 (B6) is the only specific drug available for treatment. Although B6 has been used for > 40 years, controlled data on B6 efficacy are lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the absolute and relative change of urinary oxalate (Uox) excretion under increasing dosages of B6, the first prospective trial to do so.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

B6 response was studied in 12 patients (7 male patients) with genetically confirmed PH I (3 Gly170Arg homozygous, 5 compound Gly170Arg and/or Phe152Ile heterozygous, and 4 negative for Gly170Arg and/or Phe152Ile mutations) and noncompromised renal function. Efficacy was defined as a 30% relative reduction in Uox excretion. B6 was administered orally starting at 5 mg/kg body weight per day and given in increments of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks, up to a final dosage of 20 mg/kg per day at week 24. Uox and serum B6 levels were measured every 6 weeks.

Results

Mean relative Uox reduction was 25.5%. Uox declined from 2.09 ± 0.55 (mean ± SD) at baseline to 1.52 ± 0.60 mmol/1.73 m(2) per day (P = 0.01) at week 24. Serum B6 levels increased from 22.5 ± 8.7 to 1217 ± 776 ng/ml (P < 0.001). Six patients showed a ≥ 30% relative reduction of Uox at week 24.

Conclusion

This first prospective trial confirmed B6 efficacy in 50% of patients (three of three homozygous, one of five heterozygous, and two of four patients negative for the Gly170Arg and/or Phe152Ile mutations). Interestingly, no complete biochemical remission was observed, even in the homozygous Gly170Arg study participants. Future trials are necessary to learn more about genotype-related B6 response and B6 metabolism.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^113JGsRt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

In contrast to their levels of other water-soluble vitamins, patients on extended hours dialysis had higher levels of PLP than patients on conventional dialysis (23 vs. 11 mg/ml, p = 0.03), perhaps because dialysis losses were offset by higher dietary intake of this nutrient. In this study, none of the patients on extended-hours dialysis, but 35% of patients on conventional dialysis, had levels considered deficient. Patients were taking a multivitamin containing 0.7 mg pyridoxine daily.

Higher levels of supplementation of B6 may be required at times of erythropoietin-driven red cell synthesis. Erythrocyte B6 levels fell after the initiation of erythropoietin despite supplements of 5 mg of pyridoxine daily, but were normalized by 3 months of further treatment with pyridoxine 20 mg daily.

Dissociation between B6 and PLP Levels

Because most studies have measured either B6, or PLP, but not both, we do not know if the finding of marked discrepancy between PLP and B6 levels observed in one small study of patients on peritoneal dialysis is reproducible. In this study, none of 11 patients were deficient by B6 and all were found deficient by PLP. The investigators speculated that uremic patients might have specific problems with synthesis or PLP from B6 or with excess degradation, perhaps by circulating alkaline phosphatase.

Biochemical and Surrogate Outcomes

Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for the production of glycine from glyoxalate, reducing the availability of glyoxalate as a substrate for degradation into oxalate. Vitamin B6 supplementation lowered oxalate levels in a small study of patients on peritoneal dialysis who were receiving ascorbate supplementation. The clinical utility of this approach has not been further studied.

Coadministration of thiamine and pyridoxine did not affect blood levels of advanced glycation end products or markers of oxidative stress in patients on HD. However, in uremic rats treated with peritoneal dialysis, pyridoxamine improved structural and functional abnormalities thought to be induced by advanced glycation end products or by carbonyl stress.

Peripheral Neuropathy

PLP levels correlated with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in elderly unsupplemented patients on PD, and improved in 8 of 12 most symptomatic patients after 1 month's treatment with 30 mg daily. In a blinded randomized trial of 26 patients on high-flux HD who had peripheral neuropathy, B6 50 mg/day compared with B12 500 mg/day resulted in improvement in peripheral neuropathy scores (effect shown graphically, p < 0.05, effect size not reported).

### Bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^116XufmA]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency — background and bariatric surgery: Vitamin B6/pyridoxine is a water-soluble nutrient important for nutrient metabolism and neurologic function; after bariatric surgery, vitamin B6 deficiency is rarely reported, can be mitigated with appropriate nutrition and a high-quality multivitamin supplement, and post-operative pyridoxine levels are usually monitored only if signs and symptoms of deficiency are present.

### High-dose vitamin-B6 reduces sensory over-responsivity [^113KbHmf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Sensory reactivity differences are experienced by between 5% and 15% of the population, often taking the form of sensory over-responsivity (SOR), in which sensory stimuli are experienced as unusually intense and everyday function is affected. A potential mechanism underlying over-responsivity is an imbalance between neural excitation and inhibition in which inhibitory influences are relatively weakened. Therefore, interventions that boost neural inhibition or reduce neural excitation may reduce SOR; Vitamin-B6 is the coenzyme for the conversion of excitatory glutamate to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and in animal models, it both increases the concentration of GABA and reduces glutamate.

Aims:

To discover whether taking a high dose of Vitamin-B6 reduces SOR and other aspects of sensory reactivity.

Methods:

We recruited 300 adults (249 females) from the general population who completed the Sensory Processing 3-Dimensions Scale (SP-3D) first at baseline, and again following randomisation to either 1 month's supplementation with 100 mg Vitamin-B6, or one of two control conditions (1000 µg Vitamin-B12 or placebo). To focus on individuals who experience SOR, we analysed the effects of supplementation only on individuals with high baseline SOR scores (above the 87th percentile).

Results:

In individuals with SOR at baseline, Vitamin-B6 selectively reduced SOR compared to both placebo and Vitamin-B12. We also found that Vitamin-B6 selectively reduced postural disorder in individuals with high scores on this subscale at baseline, but there were no effects on the four remaining SP-3D subscales.

Conclusions:

Clinical trials and mechanistic studies should now be conducted in autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other groups with SOR.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: delayed response to pyridoxine in pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy [^116o1xeq]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inborn errors of metabolism are a diverse group of genetic disorders including many that cause neonatal-onset epilepsy such as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE). PDE occurs secondary to biallelic pathogenic variants in ALDH7A1 and can present with refractory neonatal seizures and status epilepticus. Neonatal seizures and encephalopathy are modifiable with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation. However, the clinical response to pyridoxine supplementation can be delayed. We present the case of a full-term neonate with PDE in which seizure cessation was seen a few hours after intravenous pyridoxine load, but the improvement in EEG background and level of clinical encephalopathy occurred 5 days later. We share this case to provide an example in which clinical improvement in PDE was gradual and required continuation of treatment for several days illustrating the necessity of continuing vitamin B6 supplementation in suspected cases until confirmatory genetic testing is obtained or an alternate cause is found.

### Vitamin B6 deficiency and anemia in pregnancy [^112DCSVF]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. Pregnant women with anemia are, in general, exclusively treated with iron supplementation. We observed that several pregnant women with anemia who were nonresponsive to iron supplementation also had vitamin B6 deficiency, and that anemia in these cases improved with the administration of vitamin B6. Our prospective study in healthy pregnant women showed that blood levels of iron, ferritin and vitamin B6, in particular, fell to the lower limit of the nonpregnant reference range by the third trimester. We conclude that it is important to take into account the deficiency of vitamin B6 besides iron in the evaluation of anemia during pregnancy.

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) in adolescents undergoing weight loss surgery — DRI, adult adequacy data, and supplementation guidance are noted: The DRI for vitamin B6 is 1.2 mg/day for girls ages 14 to 18 years and 1.3 mg/day for boys ages 14 to 18 years. Adults after gastroplasty, intake of vitamin B6 at, or current adult DRI (1.6 mg) is inadequate to maintain coenzyme saturation of erythrocyte aminotransferases. It is recommended that individuals undergoing WLS take a multivitamin that includes vitamin B6.

### High-dose vitamin-B6 reduces sensory over-responsivity [^113z2tC4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

The larger project, of which the data reported here are a subset, was conducted in six phases by successive cohorts of BSc and MSc students (phases 1–5) and a doctoral student (phase 6). Participants were recruited in exchange for course credit via adverts, word of mouth and social media. Participants in phase 6 only were paid £30 to complete the study. In this way, a total of 649 were randomised to receive either placebo tablets (198 participants), Vitamin-B6 (229 participants), or Vitamin-B12 (222 participants). To provide some flexibility in the scheduling of follow-up laboratory visits, the period of supplementation was allowed to vary between 30 and 40 days. While the experimental manipulation remained constant throughout the project, no single outcome measure was included in all phases of data collection: the SP-3D questionnaire data reported here were collected in phases 4–6, from a total of 300 participants (249 females, 51 males; aged 18–60 years, mean 25.8, median 21.8, SD 9.6). Of these, 81 were randomised to receive a placebo, 113 to Vitamin-B6 and 106 to Vitamin-B12. For more detailed information about the tablets used, the double-blinding methods and the full set of outcomes measured across the phases of the project, see, who report on this in detail for phases 1–5 (phase 6 procedures were identical to phase 5 procedures: 171 participants took part in phase 6). Note that phases 1–4 were conducted in person, while phases 5–6 were carried out online, which required posting supplements to participants. Data collected from participants who took part in phases 4 and 5 are reported both here and in, but the outcome measures reported are different: SP-3D questionnaire scores are only reported here.

To take part, participants had to confirm that they were not lactose intolerant, diabetic, epileptic or taking medications known to interfere with Vitamin-B absorption. They were also asked if they were taking supplements that contained Vitamin-B and were excluded unless they agreed to stop taking them for the duration of their participation in the study. The study was approved by the University of Reading Ethics Committee (2018–128-DF). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and an online tick box replaced the requirement for a signature in phases 5 and 6.

### Vitamin B [^1142nVEF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Plasmatic homocysteine response to vitamin supplementation in elderly people [^112Cu7Vx]. Thrombosis Research (2000). Low credibility.

Homocysteine (Hcy) increase is now widely accepted as a risk factor for vascular disease. The effects of folic acid (FA) and vitamins B12 and B6 in lowering Hcy have been extensively studied, but there is still little data on the response to FA dietary administration. Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of the diet and the degree of response to different doses of pharmacological FA supplementation. In a prospective, randomized, and simple blind study, 50 elderly subjects were given a 400-microg/day FA diet and were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: Group I = placebo tablet; Group II = tablet containing 1-mg folic acid, 1-mg B12, and 25-mg B6; and Group III = tablet containing 2.5-mg folic acid and same B6 and B12 doses as Group II. Forty-four subjects completed the study, and their plasmas were evaluated. Hcy concentration significantly decreased even in patients with normal basal values, and there were no differences in the response between individuals receiving diet plus placebo and those receiving diet plus pharmacological supplementation. After the treatment, the mean decrease of plasmatic Hcy levels was 10.8 (9.4, 12.5) micromol/l, geometric mean [95% confidence interval (95% CI)], and particularly, the values for Group I were 10.6 (7.4, 14.8) micromol/l. In 31% of the subjects, the post-treatment Hcy levels were less than or = 5 micromol/l. These results show that a special diet, with or without pharmacological FA and B12 and B6 supplementation, significantly decreases the Hcy levels in elderly people. Therefore, a diet with high contents of FA might have an enormous impact on the morbidity and mortality of atherothrombosis.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D.

Multi-Vitamin Fluoride Drops 0.25 mg also provide fluoride for caries prophylaxis.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3–6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Multi-Vitamin Fluoride 0.25 mg drops. (see Dosage and Administration).

Multi-Vitamin Fluoride 0.25 mg drops supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride.

### Vitamin supplementation can markedly reduce the homocysteine elevation induced by fenofibrate [^114iDSc4]. Atherosclerosis (2001). Low credibility.

Elevated homocysteine concentrations are a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Recently it was reported that lipid lowering with fibrates increases homocysteine by up to 40%. Since elevated homocysteine concentrations can readily be lowered by vitamin supplementation, a randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed to investigate the effect of fenofibrate plus folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 versus fenofibrate plus placebo in hyperlipidemic men. The crossover study comprised a run-in period of 6 weeks, a first treatment phase of 6 weeks, a washout phase of 8 weeks and a second treatment phase of 6 weeks. Vitamins were given at doses of 650 microg folic acid, 50 microg vitamin B12 and 5 mg vitamin B6 per day for a period of 6 weeks. After fenofibrate plus placebo the increase in homocysteine concentration was 44 ± 47%. After fenofibrate plus vitamins it was 13 ± 25%, being significantly lower than without vitamins. The increase in homocysteine in response to fenofibrate may counteract the cardioprotective effect of lipid lowering. The addition of vitamins involved in homocysteine metabolism can prevent most of the homocysteine increase seen after fenofibrate plus placebo. Addition of these vitamins to fenofibrate may therefore be warranted for routine use.

### Deprescribing vitamin B6 in a Singapore community hospital [^1173skfT]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Lessons and limitations

The deprescribing of vitamin B6 in a community hospital presents several valuable insights into the challenges and benefits of deprescribing protocols. One of the key lessons learnt is the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between the medical and pharmacy teams. Through education of clinicians on the risks of unnecessary vitamin B6 supplementation and providing clear deprescribing criteria was essential to achieving buy-in and promoting adherence to the new guideline. This multidisciplinary approach is well supported by existing literature on healthcare improvement. The diverse perspectives brought by each discipline contributed to a more robust intervention design. This synergy of expertise not only improved the effectiveness of our deprescribing initiative but also fostered a culture of shared responsibility for patient safety.

Another lesson was the importance of standardisation in reducing variation in clinical practice. Our implementation of standardised guidelines for vitamin B6 deprescribing led to more consistent and evidence-based decision making among healthcare providers. This observation aligns with the existing literature on quality improvement in healthcare. For instance, a study by Panteli et al demonstrated that clinical practice guidelines can effectively improve care processes and patient outcomes by reducing unwarranted variations in practice. In our case, the standardised approach not only streamlined the deprescribing process but also enhanced patient safety by ensuring a uniform, evidence-based approach to managing vitamin B6 deprescribing across our community hospital setting.

### Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation during pregnancy or labour for maternal and neonatal outcomes [^114uaJaZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B6 plays vital roles in numerous metabolic processes in the human body, such as nervous system development and functioning. It has been associated with some benefits in non-randomised studies, such as higher Apgar scores, higher birthweights, and reduced incidence of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Recent studies also suggest a protection against certain congenital malformations.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effects of vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy and/or labour.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (31 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin B6 administration in pregnancy and/or labour with: placebos, no supplementations, or supplements not containing vitamin B6.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. For this update, we assessed methodological quality of the included trials using risk of bias and the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Four trials (1646 women) were included. The method of randomisation was unclear in all four trials and allocation concealment was reported in only one trial. Two trials used blinding of participants and outcomes. Vitamin B6 as oral capsules or lozenges resulted in decreased risk of dental decay in pregnant women (capsules: risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.98; one trial, n = 371, low quality of evidence; lozenges: RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; one trial, n = 342, low quality of evidence). A small trial showed reduced mean birthweights with vitamin B6 supplementation (mean difference -0.23 kg; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.04; n = 33; one trial). We did not find any statistically significant differences in the risk of eclampsia (capsules: n = 1242; three trials; lozenges: n = 944; one trial), pre-eclampsia (capsules n = 1197; two trials, low quality of evidence; lozenges: n = 944; one trial, low-quality evidence) or low Apgar scores at one minute (oral pyridoxine: n = 45; one trial), between supplemented and non-supplemented groups. No differences were found in Apgar scores at five minutes, or breastmilk production between controls and women receiving oral (n = 24; one trial) or intramuscular (n = 24; one trial) loading doses of pyridoxine at labour. Overall, the risk of bias was judged as unclear. The quality of the evidence using GRADE was low for both pre-eclampsia and dental decay. The other primary outcomes, preterm birth before 37 weeks and low birthweight, were not reported in the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There were few trials, reporting few clinical outcomes and mostly with unclear trial methodology and inadequate follow-up. There is not enough evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy and/or labour other than one trial suggesting protection against dental decay. Future trials assessing this and other outcomes such as orofacial clefts, cardiovascular malformations, neurological development, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia and adverse events are required.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^116DKJ4k]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation, without neurological involvement, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for the treatment of patients with serum levels of subclinical deficiency on 2 occasions. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Reassess cobalamin levels after 3 months, and obtain second-line tests if there is no improvement.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^113U2eT6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level, which is associated with cardiovascular events. The impact of homocysteine-lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To determine whether homocysteine-lowering interventions, provided in patients with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as all-cause mortality and evaluate their safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (1986 to February 2014). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 7 February 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects model.

Main Results

In this second updated Cochrane Review, we identified no new randomised controlled trials. Therefore, this new version includes 12 randomised controlled trials involving 47,429 participants. In general terms, 75% (9/12) trials had a low risk of bias. Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (1743/23,590 (7.38%) versus 1247/20,190 (6.17%); RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I(2) = 0%, high quality evidence), stroke (968/22,348 (4.33%) versus 974/18,957 (5.13%); RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.0, I(2) = 11%, high quality evidence) or death from any cause (2784/22,648 (12.29%) versus 2502/19,250 (10.64%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, I(2) = 6%, high quality evidence). Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect serious adverse events (cancer) (1558/18,130 (8.59%) versus 1334/14,739 (9.05%); RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; I(2) = 0%, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This second update of this Cochrane Review found no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination should be used for preventing cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions are associated with an increased risk of cancer.

### Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation in pregnancy [^115WqoZo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B6 plays vital roles in numerous metabolic processes in the human body, such as nervous system development and functioning. It has been associated with some benefits in non-randomised studies, such as higher Apgar scores, higher birthweights, and reduced incidence of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Recent studies also suggest a protection against certain congenital malformations.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effects of vitamin B6 supplementation during pregnancy and/or labour.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (30 December 2005).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin B6 administration in pregnancy and/or labour with: placebos, no supplementations, or supplements not containing vitamin B6.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for methodological quality. We used relative risk and weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Five trials (1646 women) were included. Four trials used blinding. One had adequate method of randomisation and allocation concealment; four did not report this. Three trials had large losses to follow up. Vitamin B6 as oral capsules or lozenges resulted in decreased risk of dental decay in pregnant women (capsules: relative risk (RR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.98; one trial, n = 371; lozenges: RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; one trial, n = 342). A small trial showed reduced mean birthweights with vitamin B6 supplementation (weighted mean difference -0.23 kg; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.04; n = 33; one trial). We did not find any statistically significant differences in the risk of eclampsia (capsules: n = 1242; three trials; lozenges: n = 944; one trial), pre-eclampsia (capsules n = 1197; two trials; lozenges: n = 944; one trial) or low Apgar scores at one minute (oral pyridoxine: n = 45; one trial), between supplemented and non-supplemented groups. No differences were found in Apgar scores at one or five minutes, or breastmilk production between controls and women receiving oral (n = 24; one trial) or intramuscular (n = 24; one trial) loading doses of pyridoxine at labour.

Authors' Conclusions

There were few trials, reporting few clinical outcomes and mostly with unclear trial methodology and inadequate follow up. There is not enough evidence to detect clinical benefits of vitamin B6 supplementation in pregnancy and/or labour other than one trial suggesting protection against dental decay.

### Vitamin B6 as add-on treatment in chronic schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111GsHKo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, plays an intrinsic role in the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters that take part in development of psychotic states. Several reports indicate that vitamin B6 may be a factor in a number of psychiatric disorders and related conditions, such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, hyperactivity, learning disability, anxiety disorder, and depression. Moreover, there are anecdotal reports of a reduction in psychotic symptoms after vitamin B6 supplementation of psychopharmacologic treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia or organic mental disorder. The aim of this study was to examine whether vitamin B6 therapy influences psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

Method

The effects of the supplementation of vitamin B6 to antipsychotic treatment on positive and negative symptoms in 15 schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients (DSM-IV criteria) were examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study spanning 9 weeks. All patients had stable psychopathology for at least 1 month before entry into the study and were maintained on treatment with their prestudy psychoactive and antiparkinsonian medications throughout the study. All patients were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia on a weekly basis. Patients randomly received placebo or vitamin B6, starting at 100 mg/day in the first week and increasing to 400 mg/day in the fourth week by 100-mg increments each week.

Results

PANSS scores revealed no differences between vitamin B6- and placebo-treated patients in amelioration of their mental state.

Conclusion

Further studies with larger populations and shorter duration of illness are needed to clarify the question of the possible efficacy of vitamin B6 in treatment of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^112xg5Zt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Dietary Intake and Levels

In 36 unsupplemented patients on high-flux thrice weekly hemodialysis, PLP levels were low in 56% and in the low normal range in a further 38%, with clinically important dialytic losses documented (Table 3). PLP levels fell when patients who were receiving B6 10 mg daily were changed from low-flux to high-flux dialysis, but were still judged to be sufficient by the investigators (Table 3). From their primary data and a review of previous literature of supplemented and unsupplemented patients, the authors concluded that 10 mg/day supplementation was likely adequate, even for patients undergoing high-flux hemodialysis. In patients on high-flux hemodialysis who had not previously received supplementation, mean values were grossly deficient at 1.6 ± SD 1.3 mcg/l. B6 12–17 mg/day normalized PLP and one of two measures of PLP-sufficiency at the red cell level: the other measure required the much higher dose of 43–64 mg/day for normalization.

In a study of 11 unsupplemented patients on peritoneal dialysis, mean dietary intake was 50% and 59% on the RDA on two separate occasions, and were correlated with protein intake. In this study, despite normal plasma B6 levels in all patients, PLP levels were low (< 40 nmol/l) in all patients. PLP was not correlated with dietary intake. In another study of patients on PD who received B6 5–20 mg daily supplementation, B6 levels were in the normal range and higher than those of controls; losses in dialysate were small (Table 3). PLP was not measured in this study.

In unselected prevalent patients on PD, who had not been receiving supplements, all of whom had been found to be PLP-deficient (levels < 40 nmol/l) at baseline, supplementation of 5 mg daily normalized PLP levels in 8 of 11 patients, and the remaining 3 normalized during a more prolonged period of supplementation at a dose of 10 mg.

### The role of vitamin supplementation in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^116LuLR7]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The production, sale, and consumption of multiple vitamins is a multibillion-dollar industry. Most Americans take some form of supplement ostensibly for prevention of cardiovascular disease. It has been claimed that vitamin A retards atherogenesis. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is thought to possibly decrease free radical-induced endothelial injury, which can lead to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Vitamin E has been extensively studied for its possible effects on platelet function as well as inhibition of foam-cell formation. Low levels of vitamin D have been thought to negatively impact myocardial structure and increase the risk for cardiovascular events. Increased intake of vitamin B6, B12, and folate has been associated with reduction of homocysteine levels; elevated homocysteine blood levels have been associated with the occurrence of stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. The purpose of this study was to review the currently available literature for vitamin supplementation with respect to prevention of cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, the current evidence suggests no benefit exists with vitamin supplementation in the general US population. Further research is needed to evaluate whether there are specific populations that might benefit from vitamin supplementation.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^115EMDMW]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Drug and nutrient interactions with vitamin B6 — cofactors, antagonists, and excretion. PL kinase requires zinc as a cofactor, and niacin, folate, and carnitine require vitamin B6 for biosynthesis and metabolism. Vitamin B6 is antagonized by hydralazine, gentamicin, isoniazid, levodopa and other medicines, and ethanol; isoniazid and hydralazine cause increased urinary excretion of pyridoxine, and requirements in such individuals are probably higher than healthy-population recommendations, but data are not available to identify the requirement more precisely.

### A systematic review of the potential consequences of abnormal serum levels of vitamin B6 in people living with Parkinson's disease [^113oYLyB]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalences of polyneuropathy and epilepsy are higher in people living with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) when compared to older adults. Vitamin B6 is widely available and affordable. PwPD are at higher risk of having abnormal serum levels of vitamin B6, which are associated with polyneuropathy and epilepsy that are potentially preventable and treatable. Potential contributors to abnormal B6 levels in PwPD include age, dietary habits, vitamin supplement misuse, gastrointestinal dysfunction and complex interactions with levodopa. The literature on the potential consequences of abnormal B6 levels in PwPD is limited by a small number of observational studies focused on polyneuropathy and epilepsy. Abnormal B6 levels have been reported in 60 of 145 PwPD (41.4% relative frequency). Low B6 levels were reported in 52 PwPD and high B6 levels were reported in 8 PwPD. There were 14 PwPD, polyneuropathy and low B6. There were 4 PwPD, polyneuropathy and high B6. There were 4 PwPD, epilepsy and low B6. Vitamin B6 level was low in 44.6% of PwPD receiving levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel and in 30.1% of PwPD receiving oral levodopa-carbidopa. In almost all studies reporting low B6 in PwPD receiving oral levodopa-carbidopa, the dose of levodopa was ≥ 1000 mg/day. Rigorous epidemiological studies will clarify the prevalence, natural history and clinical relevance of abnormal serum levels of vitamin B6 in PwPD. These studies should account for diet, vitamin supplement use, gastrointestinal dysfunction, concurrent levels of vitamin B12, folate, homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, formulations and dosages of levodopa and other medications commonly used in PwPD.

### Efficacy of multivitamin supplementation containing vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid as adjunctive treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor in Alzheimer's disease: a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Taiwanese patients [^113LQXXr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum homocysteine levels have been associated with the development of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The combined use of a mecobalamin capsule preparation, which contains vitamin B12 0.5 mg with an active methyl base, and an over-the-counter nutritional supplement that contains folic acid 1 mg and pyridoxine hyperchloride 5 mg may be effective as a homocysteine-lowering vitamin regimen.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether oral multivitamin supplementation containing vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid would improve cognitive function and reduce serum homocysteine levels in patients with mild to moderate AD.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial was conducted at En Chu Kong Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Male and female patients aged > 50 years with mild to moderate AD and normal folic acid and vitamin B12 concentrations were enrolled. All patients received treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and were randomized to receive add-on mecobalamin (B12) 500 mg + multivitamin supplement, or placebos, PO QD for 26 weeks. The multivitamin contained pyridoxine (B6) 5 mg, folic acid 1 mg, and other vitamins and iron. Serum homocysteine level was measured and cognitive tests were conducted at baseline and after 26 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was change in cognition, measured as the change in score from baseline to week 26 on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 11-item Cognition subscale. Secondary efficacy outcomes included changes in function in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs) and concentrations of homocysteine, B12, and folic acid. Tolerability was assessed by comparing the 2 study groups with respect to physical examination findings, including changes in vital signs, laboratory test abnormalities, concomitant medication use, and compliance of study medication was assessed using an interview with the patient's caregiver, as well as the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) throughout the study.

Results

Eighty-nine patients (45 men, 44 women; all Taiwanese; mean [SD] age, 75 [7.3] years) were enrolled and randomized. Overall, there were no significant differences in cognition or ADL function scores between the 2 groups. At week 26, the mean (SD) between-group difference in serum homocysteine concentration versus placebo was -2.25 (2.85) micromol/L (P = 0.008), and the mean serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and folic acid were significantly higher (but within normal range) in the multivitamin group compared with placebo (., +536.9 [694.4] pg/mL [P < 0.001] and +13.84 ng/mL [11.17] [P = 0.012] at 26 weeks, respectively). The 2 most common AEs were muscle pain (11.1% and 6.8%) and insomnia (8.9% and 9.1%) in the multivitamin and placebo groups, respectively.

Conclusions

In this population of patients with mild to moderate AD in Taiwan, a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins B(6) and B(12) and folic acid for 26 weeks decreased homocysteine concentrations. No statistically significant beneficial effects on cognition or ADL function were found between multivitamin and placebo at 26 weeks.

### Subclinical cobalamin deficiency [^116v4XQe]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on recent developments and controversies in the diagnosis, consequences, and management of subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), which affects many elderly persons.

Recent Findings

Diagnosis of SCCD depends exclusively on biochemical tests whose individual limitations suggest that combinations of tests are needed, especially in epidemiologic research. The causes of SCCD are unknown in more than 60% of cases, which limits prognostic predictions and identification of health consequences. After years of varying, often inconclusive associations, new clinical trials suggest that homocysteine reduction by high doses of folic acid, cobalamin, and pyridoxine may reduce progression of structural brain changes and cognitive impairment, especially in predisposed individuals. The causative or contributory roles, if any, of SCCD itself in cognitive dysfunction require direct study. If the findings are confirmed, high-dose supplementation with three vitamins will probably be more effective than fortification of the diet.

Summary

The story of SCCD, which is severalfold times more common in the elderly than clinical cobalamin deficiency but also differs from it in arising only infrequently from severe malabsorption and thus being less likely to progress, continues to evolve. Preventive benefits need to be confirmed and expanded, and will require fuller understanding of SCCD pathophysiology, natural history, and health consequences.

### High-dose vitamin-B6 reduces sensory over-responsivity [^115XW93H]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given that the concentration of the activated form of Vitamin-B6, PLP, is an important determinant of the rate of production of GABA, it is interesting to note that there are substantial differences between individuals in the ability to metabolise inactive dietary Vitamin-B6 into the active form. This may be caused by genetically determined variation in the binding affinity of enzymes such as pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine-5′-phosphate oxidase that participate in the Vitamin-B6 salvage pathway. Furthermore, studies of Vitamin-B6 status in autism have found either reduced PLP levels or dramatic variability in PLP levels between autistic individuals relative to non-autistic individuals; we speculate that this is connected to the high prevalence of SOR in autism. Furthermore, significant individual differences in Vitamin-B6 metabolism have also been demonstrated in the general population by pharmacokinetic studies. It is likely that those individuals whose ability to convert dietary Vitamin-B6 into active PLP is lower are at greater risk of not being able to regulate GABA production effectively, and it is these individuals that are most likely to benefit from the high-dose Vitamin-B6 intervention tested here.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### Protocol for project FACT: a randomised controlled trial on the effect of a walking program and vitamin B supplementation on the rate of cognitive decline and psychosocial wellbeing in older adults with mild cognitive impairment [^112hPTQ1]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The literature provides promising results on the beneficial effect of exercise and folic acid/vitamin B12/vitamin B6 supplementation on cognitive function and wellbeing both in cognitive healthy as well as in the demented elderly. However, to our knowledge, no large intervention study has been conducted yet on the effect of these interventions on cognitive decline in subjects with MCI. In the present study, the effects on cognitive function and psychosocial health will be examined in a population sample of community dwelling elderly adults aged 70 to 80 years. A factorial design is used and it is assumed that the interventions have an independent effect. We hypothesize that both exercise and FA/B12/B6 supplementation beneficially influence cognitive function and psychosocial health in this particular group of elderly.

The results of this trial will provide clinicians in the field of aging with more knowledge about treatment of older persons with cognitive decline. If proven effective, exercise and vitamin supplementation are an additional intervention method for this target group.

Implementation of the walking program in the Netherlands is relatively easy, since infrastructure for group based exercise programs for the elderly already exists.

Vitamin supplementation is easy to implement as well. The most difficult aspect might be long term compliance in case of severe cognitive decline. However, compliance can be sustained by providing methods to remember taking the vitamin supplements.

An additional important advantage of both interventions is that involvement of the clinician is limited to prescribing exercise and vitamin supplementation and possibly to evaluate compliance at future medical check-ups.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^111giLr2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor for cardiovascular disease is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level. The impact of homocysteine-lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events has been investigated. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009, 2013, and 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether homocysteine-lowering interventions, provided to patients with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as reducing all-cause mortality, and to evaluate their safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to 1 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 2017 week 22) and LILACS (1986 to 1 June 2017). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 1 June 2017). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB). We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. We used a random-effects model. We conducted trial sequential analyses, Bayes factor, and fragility indices where appropriate.

Main Results

In this third update, we identified three new randomised controlled trials, for a total of 15 randomised controlled trials involving 71,422 participants. Nine trials (60%) had low risk of bias, length of follow-up ranged from one to 7.3 years. Compared with placebo, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions on myocardial infarction (homocysteine-lowering = 7.1% versus placebo = 6.0%; RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I² = 0%, 12 trials; N = 46,699; Bayes factor 1.04, high-quality evidence), death from any cause (homocysteine-lowering = 11.7% versus placebo = 12.3%, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06, I² = 0%, 11 trials, N = 44,817; Bayes factor = 1.05, high-quality evidence), or serious adverse events (homocysteine-lowering = 8.3% versus comparator = 8.5%, RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14, I² = 0%, eight trials, N = 35,788; high-quality evidence). Compared with placebo, homocysteine-lowering interventions were associated with reduced stroke outcome (homocysteine-lowering = 4.3% versus comparator = 5.1%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, I² = 8%, 10 trials, N = 44,224; high-quality evidence). Compared with low doses, there were uncertain effects of high doses of homocysteine-lowering interventions on stroke (high = 10.8% versus low = 11.2%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22, I² = 72%, two trials, N = 3929; very low-quality evidence). We found no evidence of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In this third update of the Cochrane review, there were no differences in effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo on myocardial infarction, death from any cause or adverse events. In terms of stroke, this review found a small difference in effect favouring to homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination comparing with placebo. There were uncertain effects of enalapril plus folic acid compared with enalapril on stroke; approximately 143 (95% CI 85 to 428) people would need to be treated for 5.4 years to prevent 1 stroke, this evidence emerged from one mega-trial. Trial sequential analyses showed that additional trials are unlikely to increase the certainty about the findings of this issue regarding homocysteine-lowering interventions versus placebo. There is a need for additional trials comparing homocysteine-lowering interventions combined with antihypertensive medication versus antihypertensive medication, and homocysteine-lowering interventions at high doses versus homocysteine-lowering interventions at low doses. Potential trials should be large and co-operative.

Awaiting the results of studies to come, what should we do with our high-risk patient? Clearly, an evidence-based recommendation is impossible. The evidence collected so far allows for just a single conclusion: high-dose B-vitamin therapy in all patients at high risk of CVD does not reduce events after 5 years. In view of what we have discussed, the following policy may be considered:
Do not screen for hyperhomocysteinemia routinely in high-risk patients, but only if: An inborn error of 1-carbon metabolism is suspected based on the clinical phenotype CVD occurs prematurely (i.e. < 50 years, cutoff depending on conventional risk-factor profile) in the patient or his/her family B-vitamin depletion is suspected based on history or comorbidity
Do not treat mild hyperhomocysteinemia routinely, but only if fasting levels exceed a certain threshold of, for example, 20–25 μmol/l
Upon decision to treat, do not use high-dose B-vitamin preparations routinely, but start with a multivitamin containing moderate amounts of folate, B 12, and B 6.
Switch to high-dose B vitamins only if homocysteine remains clearly elevated
Keep an eye on the literature

### Vitamins for chronic disease prevention in adults: clinical applications [^1151yggf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin deficiency syndromes such as scurvy and beriberi are uncommon in Western societies. However, suboptimal intake of some vitamins, above levels causing classic vitamin deficiency, is a risk factor for chronic diseases and common in the general population, especially the elderly. Suboptimal folic acid levels, along with suboptimal levels of vitamins B(6) and B(12), are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, and colon and breast cancer; low levels of vitamin D contribute to osteopenia and fractures; and low levels of the antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A, E, and C) may increase risk for several chronic diseases. Most people do not consume an optimal amount of all vitamins by diet alone. Pending strong evidence of effectiveness from randomized trials, it appears prudent for all adults to take vitamin supplements. The evidence base for tailoring the contents of multivitamins to specific characteristics of patients such as age, sex, and physical activity and for testing vitamin levels to guide specific supplementation practices is limited. Physicians should make specific efforts to learn about their patients' use of vitamins to ensure that they are taking vitamins they should, such as folate supplementation for women in the childbearing years, and avoiding dangerous practices such as high doses of vitamin A during pregnancy or massive doses of fat-soluble vitamins at any age.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency [^117Mprmm]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Pyridoxine in non-responsive patients (statement #19: grade of recommendation D)

There is no evidence that long-term pyridoxine is beneficial if there is no biochemical response in a properly conducted test.

There is no evidence that pyridoxine has beneficial effects independent of lowering Hcy concentrations. Though there can be a delay in seeing the full response, some response (i.e. > 20% decrease) should be seen within two weeks in patients who are not deficient in vitamin B 12 or folate.

Role of vitamin B 12 and folate supplementation (statement #20: grade of recommendation D)

All patients should receive adequate folate supplementation. Vitamin B 12 should be monitored and supplemented if deficient.

There are several reports of vitamin B 12 and folate deficiencies in patients with CBS deficiency (Smolin et al; Ishida et al). This may be due to increased flux through the remethylation pathway and use of the cofactors, or inadequate intake of the vitamins in patients on restricted diets. We recommend giving all patients low-dose folate supplements and monitoring their vitamin B 12 levels. High dose folate therapy may lead to an additional benefit through enhancing the remethylation pathway but may have side effects (Wang et al). Though it is clear that folate deficiency must be avoided, there is little evidence concerning the optimal dose of folate supplementation. In patients on dietary treatment, folate and vitamin B 12 supplements are generally included in the Met-free L-AA supplement, and it is not clear whether additional supplements are routinely required.

Dietary management

Approaches to dietary treatment (statement #21: grade of recommendation C-D)

Dietary treatment should be considered for all patients with CBS deficiency unless target Hcy levels are achieved entirely by pyridoxine supplementation. Diet may be used either as a sole treatment or adjunctive therapy along with pyridoxine and / or betaine. Most pyridoxine-unresponsive patients require a diet that is very low in natural protein, with supplements of a Met-free L-AA mixture. Lifelong treatment is required.

Dietary management of CBS deficiency can be highly successful. It should be considered for all pyridoxine unresponsive patients and as additional treatment in individuals who are partially pyridoxine responsive (Komrower et al; Perry et al; Mudd et al; Pullon; Walter et al; Yap and Naughten; Lutteri et al; Kabra; Keating et al; Schiff and Blom; Adam et al; de Lonlay et al).

### Vitamin B6 and vitamin D deficiency co-occurrence in geriatric memory patients [^116HtwTt]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous studies suggest that both vitamins B6 and D are important for cognition, a finding supported by this study. A deficiency of either vitamin B6 or D was found to be associated with significantly lower MMSE scores. A prior study of memory clinic patients in northern Wisconsin reported a significant positive correlation between vitamin D levels and MMSE scores. This significant MMSE score difference is remarkable, and to our knowledge is unreported for any reversible factor affecting cognition.

A primary limitation of this cross‐sectional retrospective study design is that it does not allow for causal inferences or provide further insight into the association between vitamin levels and cognitive disturbances. In addition, patients were not fasted prior to vitamin level assessment because fasting would not be desirable to do prior to a cognitive assessment should hypoglycemia be produced. Lack of fasting could have impacted vitamin B6 levels, which is ideally tested after an 8 hour fast. Because we were looking for a deficiency rather than toxic vitamin B6 levels, this could have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of B6 deficiency, and, therefore, does not detract from the significance of our findings. Another limitation of the study is the lack of diversity within the population; 96% of the population reported their ethnicity as White.

Routine testing for vitamin B6 and D deficiencies could lead to repletion that would potentially improve cognitive performance and increase the likelihood of effective medical treatment. This is particularly relevant now, since the MMSE score is used to qualify patients with AD for treatment with the new disease‐modifying therapies, and patients with a vitamin B6 or D deficiency could fall below the allowable MMSE score for treatment in part due to this deficiency.

### The gastric sleeve: losing weight as fast as micronutrients? [^115DkjGu]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become popular as a single-stage procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity and its co-morbidities. However, the incidence of micronutrient deficiencies after LSG have hardly been researched.

Methods

From January 2005 to October 2008, 60 patients underwent LSG. All patients were instructed to take daily vitamin supplements. Patients were tested for micronutrient deficiencies 6 and 12 months after surgery.

Results

Anemia was diagnosed in 14 (26%) patients. Iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12 deficiency was found in 23 (43%), eight (15%), and five (9%) patients, respectively. Vitamin D and albumin deficiency was diagnosed in 21 (39%) and eight (15%) patients. Hypervitaminosis A, B1, and B6 were diagnosed in 26 (48%), 17 (31%), and 13 (30%) patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Due to inadequate intake and uptake of micronutrients, patients who underwent LSG are at serious risk for developing micronutrient deficiencies. Moreover, some vitamins seem to increase to chronic elevated levels with possible complications in the long-term. Multivitamins and calcium tablets should be regarded only as a minimum and supplements especially for iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calcium should be added to this regimen based on regular blood testing.

### Optimizing multivitamin supplementation for sleeve gastrectomy patients [^111irYZq]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Whereas no vitamin B6 deficiencies were observed, hypervitaminosis for vitamin B6 was highly prevalent in both groups (39%). This is in line with previous research reporting a low prevalence of vitamin B6 deficiency (0–0.5%) but excess vitamin B6 levels in up to 50% of the patients. Excessive serum levels of vitamin B6 can cause neuropathic symptoms, but the toxicity of vitamin B6 may depend on which form of vitamin B6 is used in a supplement. Vrolijk et al. found that the neuropathy observed after taking a relatively high dose of vitamin B6 supplements is due to pyridoxine. They suggested to replace pyridoxine by pyridoxal or pyridoxal-phosphate in vitamin B6 supplements, since they are much less toxic. Therefore, the vitamin B6 vitaminer was changed from pyridoxine in Optimum 1.0 to pyridoxal-phosphate in Optimum 2.0. This could also explain why we found a higher increase in serum vitamin B6 level in the Opt 2.0 group than in the Opt 1.0 group. Unlike pyridoxine, pyridoxal-phosphate is the active coenzyme form of vitamin B6 which can be directly utilized by the body without conversion. In order to decrease the risk of adverse effects from excess vitamin B6 serum levels, the level of vitamin B6 in WLS Optimum should be decreased to 1.5 mg pyridoxal-phosphate.

The prevalence of phosphate deficiencies was significantly higher in the Opt 1.0 group than in the Opt 2.0 group at T6 (20.4% vs. 4.8%, P = 0.028). This significant difference might be explained by a change in the reference value for phosphate halfway during the VITAAL I RCT. The reference value for phosphate was changed from 0.87–1.45 mmol/L to 0.80–1.40 mmol/L because of a new assay. However, all patients in the VITAAL I RCT were analyzed by using the old reference value. When using the correct reference value for each individual patient in the VITAAL I RCT, prevalence of phosphate deficiency was 21% at T0, 8.2% at T6, and 10.9% at T12 in the Opt 1.0 group. These rates are no longer significantly different from those in the Opt 2.0 group.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^113sca58]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Homocysteine and Cardiovascular and Mortality Outcomes

Because the intrinsic factor pathway is saturable and independent of intrinsic factor absorption has limited capacity, leading to the absorption of about 1% of an oral dose, intravenous therapy has the potential to raise B12 levels to a larger extent than achievable with oral therapy. It has been suggested that these pharmacologic effects may lead to more dramatic homocysteine lowering than therapeutic or near-therapeutic replacements. Intravenous hydroxycobalamin given to vitamin B12-replete patients on dialysis led to 14-fold increases in B12 and 23% reductions in homocysteine. In a randomized crossover trial, hydroxycobalamin 1 mg intravenously every 4 weeks resulted in a 40-fold increase in serum B12 levels in patients on hemodialysis, whereas cyanocobalamin levels increased 10-fold; however, reduction in homocysteine was similar with both treatments, around 33%. Oral vitamin B12 combined with folic acid and pyridoxine has been shown, in randomized controlled trials, to reduce total homocysteine levels by 30–50% in patients with low glomerular filtration rate or end-stage renal disease.

In a recent, multicenter, randomized trial, 650 patients with end-stage renal disease who had average homocysteine levels of 28.2–30.0 μmol/l were randomized to two B vitamin regimens given postdialysis. The active regimen consisted of 5 mg folic acid, 50 μg cobalamin, and 10 mg vitamin B6, whereas the placebo regimen consisted of 0.2 mg folic acid, 4 μg cobalamin, and 1 mg vitamin B6. Homocysteine levels fell significantly with active treatment (−10.4 μmol/l vs. −1.8 μmol/l). However, there was no difference in all-cause mortality (31% vs. 28%) or cardiovascular events (25% vs. 30%). Interestingly, the change in cobalamin levels from baseline was similar in both groups despite differing doses of cobalamin supplementation (100–125 pmol/l rise).

Multiple studies have demonstrated similar effects of vitamin B12 therapy on homocysteine levels and a lack of efficacy with regard to cardiovascular outcomes in patients with low glomerular filtration rate and on dialysis–.

Cognitive Effects

As in the nonrenal population, supplementation has not been shown to improve cognitive outcomes. A 1-year study involving patients with low glomerular filtration rate and patients on dialysis found that supplementation with a vitamin B complex reduced homocysteine levels in the treatment group, but had no beneficial outcomes on cognitive functioning in comparison with placebo.

### A comparison of complementary measures of vitamin B6 status, function, and metabolism in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study [^1117kuMY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. The EPIC cohort only includes participants from Europe, a region in which insufficient vitamin B6 intake is rare. Therefore, we were not able to thoroughly evaluate the 5 markers at low levels of vitamin B6 intake or low PLP concentrations, and there is both empirical and theoretical evidence to suggest that the linear trends do not extend to these lower ranges. Additionally, this cohort includes primarily middle-aged adults, and therefore a relatively small number of premenopausal women were included, and we were not able to make inferences about the interactions with menopausal status due to a lack of precision in the estimates. A further limitation is the lack of repeat measures over time — while EPIC is a prospective cohort, questionnaires and specimens used in this analysis were collected at a single baseline visit. However, PAr was shown in a longitudinal study to be stable in individuals across time, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75 for samples drawn 28 d apart. The same study also found reasonably high temporal stability for PLP, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.67. Further studies of long-term reproducibility of these markers are needed to understand the utility of single measures in investigation of disease risk.

We were limited to including markers that can be measured in frozen plasma samples, and therefore we could not assess the potential functional markers related to PLP-dependent transaminase activity. While there is a long list of potential markers related to vitamin B6 (due to having multiple forms and involvement in a wide range of reactions), the 5 markers included in this analysis represent aspects of vitamin B6 availability, function, and metabolism which are likely to be of interest for analyses of the role of vitamin B6–related pathways and risk of disease.

Self-reported dietary intake assessments may be prone to response bias and food composition tables to measurement errors, which could potentially attenuate the results. We were able to investigate only intake from food because detailed data on supplement use was not available. This limitation is of particular interest for countries with the highest rates of overall supplement use (Denmark and the United Kingdom) and where vitamin B6 is a popular supplement ingredient (the Netherlands); however, sensitivity analyses showed minimal change when adjusting for supplement use. Our analysis of the linear trend of alcohol intake did not allow for exploration of possible variation by alcoholic status, which may be associated with altered homocysteine metabolism.

### Modification of vitamin B6 on the associations of blood lead levels and cardiovascular diseases in the US adults [^116vc1N7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Previous literature has found that suboptimal level or mild deficiency of vitamin B6 could be associated with a higher risk of many chronic diseases, including CVDs. For example, in a multicentre case-control study in Europe, vitamin B6 concentrations were significantly lower in patients with vascular disease than in healthy controls. Another case-control study in the United States found a strong independent association between low PLP and stroke. Underlying mechanisms may involve homocysteine metabolisms, in which the synthesis of cystathionine requires vitamin B6 in the form of PLP. Vitamin B6 was also inversely related to inflammatory markers such as CRP and fibrinogen, which may induce a higher risk of CVDs.

However, there has not been a consensus on the effect of vitamin B6 supplementation on the prevention or treatment of CVDs. A Japan study showed that vitamin B6 supplement has the potential to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. However, some large-scale clinical trials reported negative results on the effect of Vitamin B6 in reducing cardiovascular risk in humans. For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 2 Study found no effect of vitamin B6 supplementation in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with vascular disease. The Norwegian Vitamin trial reported no association between vitamin B6 supplement and benefit for myocardial infarction and stroke. These negative results may suggest that vitamin B6 does not work well in patients with CVDs but cannot preclude a protective effect in primary prevention. It was also pointed out that some neglected confounding factors and inappropriate designs may implicate the negative evidence in previous studies. Therefore, further studies are needed to find the role of vitamin B6 in CVD prevention and the optimal dose and combination.

### Effect of combined diclofenac and B vitamins (thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin) for low back pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fR8bh]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We compiled all available published and unpublished evidence and used premature discontinuation of medication due to complete pain relief as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included decreased pain intensity according to a visual analog scale (VAS) measure, the occurrence of adverse events (i.e.g.astrointestinal events), and participant satisfaction, based on the number of patients who described subjective improvement at the end of the study. We assessed the quality of the obtained results using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We conducted this systematic review of RCTs in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses declaration criteria and the current recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. We carried out searches up to June 2018 using the search terms "pain", "thiamine", "vitamin B1", "pyridoxine", "vitamin B6", "cyanocobalamin", "vitamin B12", "vitamin B complex", "Neurobion", and "diclofenac" in the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database (LILACS), International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). No language, date of publication, or completion status filters were used. In addition, we carried out a search of the references for review articles, relevant clinical trials, textbooks, and conference summaries to identify more RCTs. In all cases, we read the full-text versions of these articles. We systematically contacted the corresponding authors by e-mail if the publication contained incomplete data (i.e. data on adverse events). Although the focus of this review is LBP, we searched for pain in general, with the intention of increasing the sensitivity of the search strategy, considering that there are a lot of terms with the same meaning (i.e. back pain, lumbago, spine pain, sciatica, and dorsalgia, among others).

The search equation is found in Appendix 1. Likewise, we made additional efforts to identify RCTs that were potentially relevant to the topic using the following data sources: 1) gray literature (theses, internal reports, non-peer-reviewed journals) and 2) other unpublished sources known to experts in the specialty (obtained via personal communication).

### Peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors paradoxically induce aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase [^117EsCxF]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

One possible underlying or contributing factor might be chronic (partial) vitamin B6 depletion. Chronic treatment with levodopa and PDIs is associated with (1) partial vitamin B6 depletion, since PDIs bind irreversibly to PLP, the active form of vitamin B6, and (2) with a dysfunctional methionine metabolism, which is characterized by an increased methylmalonic acid, increased homocysteine, and deficiencies of vitamin B6, folate (vitamin B11), and vitamin B12. Exogenous pyridoxine (vitamin B6) enhances peripheral levodopa degradation. Based on plasma levodopa levels and its metabolites, this enhancing effect of exogenous pyridoxine on peripheral levodopa degradation seems extra strong in patients with chronic levodopa use. This could be explained by chronic (partial) vitamin B6 depletion, AADC induction, or both.

The paradoxical induction of AADC activity could hypothetically necessitate a gradual increase in required levodopa dosage, due to increased conversion into dopamine in blood, and negatively affect levodopa's efficacy, inducing response fluctuations and causing side effects. PD patients in advanced disease stages may need up to tenfold higher daily levodopa doses than PD patients in early disease stages. It is widely assumed that this is due to more comprehensive dopaminergic neuronal cell death, creating a larger dopamine deficit. However, since at disease onset already 50–80% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated, it is difficult to understand that a relatively small further increase in dopaminergic cell death is solely responsible for this dramatic loss of drug efficacy. In this study, patients with high AADC activity used higher doses of levodopa and more frequently used dopamine agonists and COMT inhibitors, perhaps to compensate for the relative loss of levodopa efficacy. In line with our findings, a recent study has demonstrated that gut microbiota may also convert levodopa into dopamine even before resorption. Thus, peripheral conversion of levodopa into dopamine, both in the gut and in blood, might compromise bioavailability and diminish the therapeutic efficacy of levodopa over time. There are preliminary indications that higher doses of PDI may increase the treatment effect of levodopa.

### Pemetrexed in relapsed small-cell lung cancer and the impact of shortened vitamin supplementation lead-in time: results of a phase II trial [^111CosN2]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

We undertook a phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent pemetrexed (P) in relapsed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients.

Methods

Patients had limited- or extensive-stage SCLC, performance status 0 to 2, and one prior chemotherapy regimen. Initial P dose was 500 mg/m every 21 days. Planned sample sizes were 36 sensitive (S) patients in a two-stage sequential fashion with early stopping rule, and 25 refractory (R) patients in a single-stage design without stopping rule. Patients received folic acid and Vitamin B12 prior to P, and B12 could be given up until P treatment. Primary outcome measure was response rate.

Results

Enrollment occurred from July 2004 to March 2006. The stopping rule was invoked when < 3 of 14 S patients responded. The protocol was amended to evaluate P 900 mg/m in cohorts of 40 S and 40 R patients. Overall, 121 patients were enrolled, with 116 patients treated. S (n = 53) and R (n = 63) patients were analyzed separately at both dose levels. Across the 4 treatment groups (S500, S900, R500, R900), 1 patient (2.63%) in the S900 group had a partial response. Overall, 18 patients (16%) had stable disease. Eighty-seven patients (75%) had progressive disease. Responses were not evaluable in 10 patients (8.6%). Overall response rate was 0.9%. Across treatment groups, disease control rates (partial response + stable disease) were 20%, 15.8%, 21.7%, and 12.5%, respectively. Median time to progression ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 months, median survival times ranged from 2.5 to 6.1 months, and 1-year survival rates ranged from 5.6 to 25.8%. Common grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities (at 500 and 900 mg/m) were neutropenia (16%; 9%) and leukopenia (11%; 8%), and nonhematologic toxicities were dyspnea (11%; 10%) and fatigue (16%; 9%). Retrospective analysis of cycle 1 events by timing of B12 administration showed no trend toward more frequent serious toxicities when B12 was given < 7 days prior to P.

Conclusions

Single-agent P 500 mg/m shows minimal activity in relapsed SCLC patients. P can be given at 900 mg/m without significant increase in serious toxicities, but does not seem to increase efficacy. B12 given < 7 days before P does not seem to be associated with increased serious toxicities.

### Vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid for onset of depressive symptoms in older men: results from a 2-year placebo-controlled randomized trial [^114godWq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether use of vitamins B(12), B(6), and folate was associated with reduced severity of depressive symptoms and 2-year incidence of clinically significant depression.

Method

The investigators recruited 299 men aged 75 years and older free of clinically significant depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score < 18). They were randomly assigned to treatment with 400 microg B(12) + 2 mg folic acid + 25 mg B(6) per day (N = 150) or placebo (N = 149). The BDI was the primary outcome measure of the study. Follow-up assessments took place 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after baseline. Analyses were intention-to-treat. The study was conducted from June 2001 to June 2004.

Results

118 and 123 men treated with vitamins and placebo, respectively, completed this 2-year trial (19.4% dropout rate). Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that there was no difference between the groups (F = 0.76, df = 1, p = .384) nor was there a significant change of BDI scores over time (F = 1.26, df = 4, p = .284). Cox regression revealed that participants treated with vitamins were 24% more likely to remain free of depression during the trial, although the difference between groups was not significant (95% CI = 0.68 to 2.28). At the end of the study, 84.3% of men treated with vitamins and 79.1% of those treated with placebo remained free of clinically significant depressive symptoms. The number of people needed to treat to show benefit was 21.

Conclusion

The results of this study showed that treatment with B(12), folic acid, and B(6) is no better than placebo at reducing the severity of depressive symptoms or the incidence of clinically significant depression over a period of 2 years in older men.

### Vitamin B6 supplementation increases immune responses in critically ill patients [^111bV7rd]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether vitamin B6 supplementation has a beneficial effect on immune responses in critically ill patients.

Design

A single-blind intervention study.

Setting

The study was performed at the Taichung Veterans General Hospital, the central part of Taiwan.

Subjects

Fifty-one subjects who stayed over 14 days in the intensive care unit completed the study. Subjects were not treated with any vitamin supplement before the intervention.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups, control (n = 20), a daily injection of 50 mg vitamin B-6 (B6–50, n = 15), or 100 mg vitamin B-6 (B6–100, n = 16) for 14 days.

Main Outcome Measures

Plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal (PL), 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA), erythrocyte alanine (EALT-AC) and aspartate (EAST-AC) aminotransaminase activity coefficient, and urinary 4-PA were measured. The levels of serum albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and immune responses (white blood cell, neutrophils, total lymphocytes count (TLC), T- (CD3) and B-(CD19) lymphocytes, T-helper (CD4) and suppressor (CD8) cells) were determined.

Results

Plasma PLP, PL, 4-PA and urinary 4-PA concentrations significantly increased in two treated groups. T-lymphocyte and T-helper cell numbers and the percentage of T-suppressor cell significantly increased on day 14 in the B6–50 group. Total lymphocyte count, T-helper and T-suppressor cell numbers, the percentage of T-lymphocyte cells and T-suppressors significantly increased in the B6–100 group at the 14th day. There were no significant changes with respect to immune responses in the control group over 14 days.

Conclusions

A large dose of vitamin B6 supplementation (50 or 100 mg/day) could compensate for the lack of responsiveness of plasma PLP to vitamin B6 intake, and further increase immune response of critically ill patients.

### Associations of serum vitamin B6 status and catabolism with all-cause mortality in patients with T2DM [^111LV2H8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Serum Level of Pyridoxal 5′-Phosphate and All-Cause Mortality

The relationship between the log-normalized serum PLP level and all-cause mortality is displayed using unadjusted restricted cubic splines. The risk of all-cause mortality dropped sharply as the serum PLP level increased, displaying a reversed J-shaped pattern (Fig. 2A). After multivariate adjustment (lifestyle factors, BMI, PIR, HbA 1c level, DM duration, use of DM medication, presence of chronic diseases, 4-PA level, and use of vitamin B 6 supplements), a higher serum PLP concentration was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (Table 2). The multivariate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs from lowest to highest serum levels of PLP (< 21.4, 21.4–35.8, 35.7–63.6, and > 63.6 nmol/L) were 1.00 (reference), 0.93 (0.71–1.23), 0.85 (0.64–1.13), and 0.74 (0.55–0.99), respectively, for all-cause mortality (P trend = .035).

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^116msQ6f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Folate and vitamin B12 are essential in one‐carbon metabolism and are the main determinants of homocysteine; a low status of either vitamin leads to elevated plasma homocysteine. Higher homocysteine concentrations, in turn, have been linked with lower BMD and higher fracture risk in older adults. Other evidence suggests an independent role for vitamin B12 in bone health. Notably, the Framingham Osteoporosis Study reported that deficient plasma B12 concentrations (< 148 pmol/L) were associated with lower BMD. Likewise, among celiac disease patients in Northern Ireland, serum vitamin B12 was found to be a significant determinant of hip BMD in males. Furthermore, vitamin B12 deficiency commonly occurs in older people, primarily owing to food‐bound B12 malabsorption related to atrophic gastritis and widespread use of proton‐pump inhibitor medications (PPIs), rather than as a result of low dietary B12 intakes in higher‐income countries. We recently reported high rates of vitamin B12 deficiency in older Irish adults, most notably among those with atrophic gastritis or, to a lesser extent, taking PPIs. With regard to folate, analysis of the Hordaland Homocysteine Study showed that lower plasma folate was associated with low BMD and increased fracture risk among Norwegian women. Although much less well studied compared with folate and B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin are also required for one‐carbon metabolism, with some evidence of their potential role in bone health. Vitamin B6 deficiency has also been associated with poor bone health, with reports of greater mean bone loss in B6‐deficient older American adults, whereas higher dietary B6 intakes were linked with reduced osteoporotic fracture risk. In addition, large cohort studies have shown that low dietary riboflavin is associated with lower BMD and higher fracture risk when it occurs in combination with the variant 677TT genotype in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key folate‐metabolizing enzyme that requires riboflavin (FAD) as a co‐factor for its activity.

Despite the observational evidence linking low status of one or more of these interrelated B‐vitamins with an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture and/or lower BMD, there are few randomized trials examining these associations, and no previous study has investigated the effect of all four aforementioned B‐vitamins. The aim of this trial was to investigate the effect of combined low‐dose B‐vitamin supplementation for 2 years on BMD in community‐dwelling adults. We hypothesized that intervention to optimize B‐vitamin status would benefit bone, particularly in those with lower baseline status of vitamin B12 and/or related B‐vitamins.

### Water-soluble vitamins in people with low glomerular filtration rate or on dialysis: a review [^117GVLgt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

People with low glomerular filtration rate and people on dialysis are spontaneously at risk for vitamin deficiency because of the potential for problems with decreased appetite and decreased sense of smell and taste, leading to decreased intake, and because decreased energy or decreased cognitive ability results in difficulties in shopping and cooking. Imposed dietary restrictions because of their renal dysfunction and because of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes exacerbate this problem. Finally, particularly for water-soluble vitamins, loss may occur into the dialysate. We did not identify any randomized trials of administering daily doses close to the recommended daily allowances of these vitamins. In people who are eating at all, deficiencies of B5 and B7 seem unlikely. It is unclear whether supplements of B2 and B3 are necessary. Because of dialyzability and documented evidence of insufficiency in dialysis patients, B1 supplementation is likely to be helpful. B6, B9, and B12 are implicated in the hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients on dialysis. These vitamins have been studied in combinations, in high doses, with the hope of reducing cardiovascular outcomes. No reductions in patient-important outcomes were seen in adequately powered randomized trials. Because of their involvement in the homocysteine pathway, however, supplementation with lower doses, close to the recommended daily allowances, may be helpful. Vitamin C deficiency is common in patients on dialysis who are not taking supplements: low-dose supplements are warranted. Vitamins for dialysis patients contain most or all of the B vitamins and low-dose vitamin C. We are not aware of any medical reasons to choose one over another.

### Vitamin / mineral / micronutrient supplement for autism spectrum disorders: a research survey [^111f2bwN]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dietary supplements are commonly used in autism, with one study reporting 54% of children with ASD taking dietary supplements, primarily multi-vitamin/mineral supplements. That study also reported that although intake of several vitamins and minerals from diet alone was insufficient, the supplements used often failed to treat some deficiencies while providing excessive amounts of other nutrients.

Various vitamin/mineral/micronutrient supplements for people with autism have been investigated in multiple clinical trials. These include folinic acid/vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and iron, with most of them demonstrating some positive benefit in correcting insufficiency and/or improving symptoms. Several other studies have highlighted how pregnancy levels of micronutrients may also influence the risk of offspring developing autism. Low levels of folic acid during pregnancy may be a risk factor for autism, and low or excessive levels of folic acid and B12 may increase the risk. Cumulatively, such data suggest that a carefully designed vitamin/mineral supplement may therefore be beneficial for people with autism.

Effects of intervention on B‐vitamin biomarkers and change in

B‐vitamin intervention over the 2‐year period resulted in significant increases in serum folate, serum vitamin B12, and plasma PLP, and corresponding decreases in EGRac, serum MMA, and serum tHcy concentrations (Table 5).

Regardless of treatment allocation, BMD at all three sites decreased by approximately 1% (ranging from −0.7% to −1.4%) over the 2‐year intervention (Table 6). Overall, there was no significant effect of intervention with B‐vitamins on BMD at any site, either in the cohort as a whole or when examined in males and females separately, albeit BMD was lower at both time points at all sites in females (Supplemental Table S1). However, when the 2‐year change in BMD was examined among participants with lower baseline vitamin B12 status (< median serum B12 of 246 pmol/L or ≥ median MMA of 0.22 μmol/L), B‐vitamin intervention compared with placebo significantly decreased the rate of BMD decline at the total hip (Fig. 2) and at the femoral neck (Fig. 3) after adjustments for age and sex.

### Vitamin B and its derivatives for diabetic kidney disease [^111Hbvo4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) mainly due to development and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). In absence of definitive treatments of DKD, small studies showed that vitamin B may help in delaying progression of DKD by inhibiting vascular inflammation and endothelial cell damage. Hence, it could be beneficial as a treatment option for DKD.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of vitamin B and its derivatives in patients with DKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 29 October 2012 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin B or its derivatives, or both with placebo, no treatment or active treatment in patients with DKD. We excluded studies comparing vitamin B or its derivatives, or both among patients with pre-existing ESKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratio (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model.

Main Results

Nine studies compared 1354 participants randomised to either vitamin B or its derivatives with placebo or active control were identified. A total of 1102 participants were randomised to single vitamin B derivatives, placebo or active control in eight studies, and 252 participants randomised to multiple vitamin B derivatives or placebo. Monotherapy included different dose of pyridoxamine (four studies), benfotiamine (1), folic acid (1), thiamine (1), and vitamin B12 (1) while combination therapy included folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 in one study. Treatment duration ranged from two to 36 months. Selection bias was unclear in three studies and low in the remaining six studies. Two studies reported blinding of patient, caregiver and observer and were at low risk of performance and detection bias, two studies were at high risk bias, and five studies were unclear. Attrition bias was high in one study, unclear in one study and low in seven studies. Reporting bias was high in one study, unclear in one study, and low in the remaining seven studies. Four studies funded by pharmaceutical companies were judged to be at high risk bias, three were at low risk of bias, and two were unclear. Only a single study reported a reduction in albuminuria with thiamine compared to placebo, while second study reported reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) following use of combination therapy. No significant difference in the risk of all-cause mortality with pyridoxamine or combination therapy was reported. None of the vitamin B derivatives used either alone or in combination improved kidney function: increased in creatinine clearance, improved the GFR; neither were effective in controlling blood pressure significantly compared to placebo or active control. One study reported a significant median reduction in urinary albumin excretion with thiamine treatment compared to placebo. No significant difference was found between vitamin B combination therapy and control group for serious adverse events, or one or more adverse event per patient. Vitamin B therapy was reported to well-tolerated with mild side effects in studies with treatment duration of more than six months. Studies of less than six months duration did not explicitly report adverse events; they reported that the drugs were well-tolerated without any serious drug related adverse events. None of the included studies reported cardiovascular death, progression from macroalbuminuria to ESKD, progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, regression from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria, doubling of SCr, and quality of life. We were not able to perform subgroup or sensitivity analyses or assess publication bias due to insufficient data.

Authors' Conclusions

There is an absence of evidence to recommend the use of vitamin B therapy alone or combination for delaying progression of DKD. Thiamine was found to be beneficial for reduction in albuminuria in a single study; however, there was lack of any improvement in kidney function or blood pressure following the use of vitamin B preparations used alone or in combination. These findings require further confirmation given the limitations of the small number and poor quality of the available studies.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^116gJPSH]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) in parenteral nutrition — form, metabolism, and kinetics: In parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations, pyridoxine is supplied as pyridoxine hydrochloride because it is more stable than other forms and is phosphorylated to its active form, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), by the liver. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is an inactive compound that is metabolized in the liver to pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP), and PLP undergoes oxidation in the liver to 4-pyridoxic acid, which is excreted. After infusion in normal volunteers, plasma steady-state concentration was reached within 30 minutes, the serum half-life was only a few minutes, and only 6.7% of the administered dose was detected unmetabolized in the urine, with urine amounts somewhat greater when active metabolites were included. PLP functions as a coenzyme for aminotransferases, is the coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase with roles in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and PLP-dependent δ-aminolevulinate synthase is important for heme biosynthesis.

### SLC25A38 is required for mitochondrial pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) accumulation [^115hqUh2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To test if SLC25A38 loss has an effect on cellular or mitochondrial vitamin B6 levels, we isolated mitochondria using the Mito-IP approach, and measured PLP levels by LC-MS (Supplementary Fig. 3C, E). For these experiments, we cultured cells in B6-depleted media supplemented with 10 nM Pyridoxine ("B6-physiol".) to match physiologically-relevant plasma levels. Notably, PLP levels were reduced in mitochondria isolated from SLC25A38-KO cells compared to wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 3E) even though levels were not depleted at the whole cell level (Supplementary Fig. 3F). The mitochondrial PLP levels of SLC25A38-KO cells cultured in an excess of Pyridoxine ("B6-high": B6-depleted media supplemented with 1000 nM PN) still showed a mild reduction compared to WT cells (~3.9× reduction in "B6-physiol" versus 1.5x reduction in "B6-high" Supplementary Fig. 3E) indicating that lack of SLC25A38 affects PLP in the mitochondria at physiological B6 levels (e.g. 10 nM PN), but that in excess B6 conditions, SLC25A38 - independent mechanisms may partially compensate to support mitochondrial PLP levels. Mitochondrial PLP levels did not decrease in cells lacking SLC25A39 under any conditions. Instead, glutathione (GSH) was specifically depleted in mitochondria but not in the whole cell lysates from SLC25A39-KO cells as expected, (Supplementary Fig. 3G, H).

### Vitamin B6 status in hypophosphatasia: association with clinical severity, diagnostic utility, and effects on vitamin B6 metabolism by supplementation and enzyme replacement therapy [^114w53C7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

This study reports the concentrations of major vitamin B6 (VB6) vitamers (pyridoxal 5'-phospate [PLP], pyridoxal [PL], and 4-pyridoxic acid [PA]) in over 100 hypophosphatasia (HPP) cases to explore clues for clinical severity, to improve diagnostic sensitivity, and to examine VB6 changes by supplementation and enzyme replacement therapy. Serum samples were collected from HPP and non-HPP patients. When available, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were also analyzed to determine PLP, PL, and PA concentrations. Serum PLP concentrations, PLP-to-PL ratios, and PLP-to-PA ratios were higher in untreated HPP patients compared to non-HPP patients and reflected clinical severity. Perinatal severe HPP showed lower PL concentrations than perinatal benign HPP and the lowest PA concentrations among all clinical forms. Combining PLP-to-PL ratios with PLP concentrations improved diagnostic sensitivity. Under VB6 therapy, PLP concentrations and PLP-to-PL ratios remained higher in HPP patients than in non-HPP patients. VB6 changes produced by ERT were most clearly reflected by the reduction of PLP-to-PL ratios. CSF PLP concentrations and PLP-to-PL ratios were higher in untreated HPP patients than in non-HPP patients, while CSF PL concentrations were higher in patients on ERT compared to those not on ERT. Co-evaluation of serum PLP, PL, and PA concentrations may help understand clinical severity, can improve diagnostic sensitivity, and can demonstrate the effect of ERT on VB6 metabolism more effectively than the assay of PLP concentrations alone. Altered VB6 status in the CSF suggests that tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase plays a key role in VB6 transport from peripheral blood to the brain via the blood-CSF barrier.

### Impact of the increased recommended dosage of isoniazid on pyridoxine levels in children and adolescents [^111Yu73r]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Isoniazid exposure causes dose-dependent pyridoxine deficiency. Recently, the recommended dosage of isoniazid in children was increased from 5 (4–6) to 10 (10–15) mg/kg/day. We aimed to analyze longitudinally pyridoxine levels in a cohort of previously healthy children and adolescents treated with isoniazid. Mild symptom-free pyridoxine deficiency was observed in 4/75 (5.6%) and 3/40 (7.5%) at baseline and at 3-month follow-up, respectively. Classical age-related risk factors identified patients at risk of pyridoxine deficiency. Our preliminary results support current recommendations regarding pyridoxine supplementation in healthy children.
