## Question

CMV and C. Diff can there be cross reactivity to testing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Clostridioides difficile diagnostic tests cross-react and cause false positives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "cross-reactivity" means in the context of virologic versus bacteriologic assays. Then, I should verify the specific targets and methods used for CMV and for C. difficile testing to assess biological plausibility. Next, I will review the available documents for any direct evidence of cross-reactivity or lack thereof. After that, I should separate the issue of true coinfection from test interference. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and note pitfalls such as colonization, algorithm choice, and rare assay-related false positives unrelated to cross-reactivity.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism of cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity in diagnostics usually implies that antibodies or primers detect a non-target due to shared epitopes or sequence homology, thereby yielding a false positive; in the CDI space, reference assays distinguish detection of free toxin versus toxigenic organisms, which underscores how target choice rather than cross-reactivity often drives discordance and misclassification, not true cross-reactivity with unrelated pathogens like CMV [^112zDsEp].

> Now, I need to consider biological plausibility. CMV is a double-stranded DNA herpesvirus detected by CMV-specific nucleic acid tests and tissue immunohistochemistry, whereas C. difficile is an anaerobic bacterium whose disease phenotype is toxin-mediated; their antigens and nucleic acid targets are fundamentally unrelated, making immunologic or molecular cross-reactivity highly implausible between these organisms; wait, let me verify test specifics to be sure I'm not missing a shared assay component such as a common antibody backbone or primer region, but CMV load assays quantify CMV DNA and CDI assays target C. difficile toxins or toxin genes, which are distinct systems without shared epitopes or sequences [^114vserh] [^115qirmV].

> Next, I should review the testing methodologies to ensure I'm aligning targets correctly. For CMV, clinical labs rely on blood or tissue NAATs/quantitative PCR, antigenemia, and immunohistochemistry on colonic biopsies when CMV colitis is suspected, particularly in severe ulcerative colitis flares; I should confirm that these tests are designed against CMV-specific targets and do not include bacterial antigens, which is correct [^114vserh] [^114hhpmW]. For C. difficile, stool NAAT detects toxin genes, EIAs detect toxins A/B or GDH, and multistep algorithms combining sensitive and specific steps are guideline-preferred; none of these target viral sequences or antigens, further arguing against cross-reactivity with CMV [^115qirmV] [^112AX8oK].

> Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions; I should explicitly check for cross-reactivity statements in assay validation. Ultrasensitive toxin assays for CDI report no cross-reactivity with common gastrointestinal pathogens, and while CMV is not a typical enteric pathogen in healthy hosts, this specificity claim supports that the CDI toxin assay is not picking up non-C. difficile targets; likewise, CMV PCR interassay variability is well described, but not cross-reactivity with bacterial targets such as C. difficile, which would be biologically incongruent for a CMV-specific NAAT [^115MP4Gh] [^114vserh]. I should also acknowledge rare false positives from assay defects or workflow issues, but those represent lot problems or testing practices rather than pathogen cross-reactivity, as pseudo-outbreaks linked to faulty toxin assay lots demonstrate [^116JDmDj].

> I will now examine the literature for co-infection because clinicians often conflate co-detection with cross-reactivity. Several reports and guidelines highlight that patients with IBD can have both CMV colitis and CDI concurrently, reflecting true coinfection in an immunologically vulnerable host population, not test interference; this is why guidelines recommend evaluating for both in severe UC flares and IBD exacerbations with diarrhea, which I should emphasize to avoid misinterpretation of dual positives as assay artifact [^1136k8n5] [^111cWk74] [^113zaSLm] [^114hhpmW].

> But wait, what if a C. difficile NAAT is positive and the toxin assay is negative — could that be "cross-reactivity" from CMV? I should double-check the evidence; discordant NAAT+/toxin− patterns are largely explained by colonization or low-level toxin activity and by test performance differences rather than interference from unrelated viruses; stewardship frameworks and outcome studies consistently show that NAAT detects colonization and may overdiagnose CDI, while toxin positivity aligns better with clinically significant disease, again arguing against CMV-driven cross-reactivity as the mechanism for discordance [^112AX8oK] [^111DhrVg] [^116Ugyhb]. Additionally, host immune marker studies can help distinguish true CDI from colonization or other diarrheal causes, further reducing the temptation to attribute discrepancies to cross-reactivity [^115SPrR7].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a corner case. The targets for CMV (viral DNA and antigens) and for C. difficile (bacterial toxins and toxin genes) are orthogonal, validation data for CDI toxin assays indicate no cross-reactivity with other GI pathogens, and the published guidance and studies do not report any CMV↔C. difficile diagnostic cross-reactivity; when both are positive, think coinfection and evaluate each on its own clinical and laboratory merits rather than assuming assay interference [^115MP4Gh] [^116MaJNg] [^114hhpmW].

> Final answer: No, CMV and C. difficile tests do not cross-react; positive results for either pathogen reflect detection of that specific target, whereas simultaneous positivity represents true coinfection risk in susceptible hosts and requires independent assessment and management for each infection; ensure appropriate diagnostic algorithms for CDI to avoid overdiagnosis from colonization and use guideline-directed CMV testing in IBD flares to accurately identify CMV colitis [^115MP4Gh] [^116MaJNg] [^113zaSLm] [^114hhpmW].

---

There is **no cross-reactivity** between CMV and C. difficile diagnostic tests because they target distinct analytes (CMV DNA/proteins vs C. difficile toxins/genes) and use different specimen types (blood/tissue vs stool) [^116MaJNg]. However, **co-infection is common in immunocompromised or IBD patients** [^1136k8n5], so clinicians should test for both pathogens when clinically indicated [^114hhpmW] [^113zaSLm] and interpret results in the clinical context to avoid misdiagnosis or overtreatment [^112AX8oK].

## Diagnostic methods for CMV and C. difficile

### CMV diagnostic methods

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Detects CMV DNA in blood, plasma, or tissue; high sensitivity and specificity [^114vserh].

- **Antigenemia assays**: Detect CMV pp65 antigen in leukocytes; moderate sensitivity, high specificity [^115e597x].

- **Serology**: Detects CMV IgM/IgG; limited utility for acute infection in immunocompromised hosts [^115e597x].

- **Histopathology**: Identifies CMV inclusions in tissue; specificity improved with immunohistochemistry (IHC) [^115e597x].

---

### C. difficile diagnostic methods

- **Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs)**: Detect toxins A/B in stool; rapid, moderate sensitivity, high specificity [^116MaJNg] [^115qirmV].

- **Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)**: Detect toxin genes in stool; high sensitivity, moderate specificity due to colonization detection [^116MaJNg] [^111DhrVg].

- **Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) assays**: Sensitive screening for C. difficile antigen; not specific for toxigenic strains [^115qirmV].

- **Toxigenic culture**: Detects toxigenic C. difficile; slow, high specificity [^112zDsEp].

---

## Potential for cross-reactivity between CMV and C. difficile tests

Cross-reactivity occurs when a test reacts with non-target analytes, causing false results. For CMV and C. difficile, **cross-reactivity is unlikely** because CMV assays target viral DNA/proteins, whereas C. difficile assays target bacterial toxins/genes; the specimen types also differ (blood or tissue vs stool), and there are no known shared epitopes between CMV and C. difficile toxins.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

There is **no evidence of cross-reactivity** between CMV and C. difficile tests. Available data indicate that CMV PCR/antigenemia do not cross-react with C. difficile toxins/genes, and C. difficile EIAs/NAATs do not cross-react with CMV DNA/proteins; although co-infection is common in immunocompromised or IBD patients, these tests remain specific.

---

## Clinical implications of co-infection

Co-infection can **worsen outcomes**, especially in IBD or immunocompromised patients. It is associated with higher risks of severe colitis, colectomy, and complications [^1136k8n5]. Overlapping symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain create diagnostic challenges and require targeted testing [^113zaSLm]. Management should treat both infections when confirmed while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics or antivirals.

---

## Recommendations for clinicians

- **Test selection**: Use appropriate tests for each pathogen (CMV PCR/antigenemia; C. difficile EIAs/NAATs) [^115e597x] [^116MaJNg].

- **Interpretation**: Consider clinical context and co-infection risk to avoid misdiagnosis [^112AX8oK].

- **Co-infection**: Test for both pathogens in immunocompromised or IBD patients with severe colitis [^114hhpmW] [^111cWk74].

- **Avoid overtreatment**: Do not treat asymptomatic C. difficile colonization or latent CMV without evidence of active disease [^116MaJNg] [^112AX8oK].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no cross-reactivity** between CMV and C. difficile diagnostic tests due to distinct targets and specimens. Co-infection is common in high-risk patients, so clinicians should test for both when indicated and interpret results in the clinical context to guide appropriate therapy [^116MaJNg] [^115e597x].

### Increased rates of Clostridium difficile infection and poor outcomes in patients with IBD with cytomegalovirus [^1136k8n5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation are associated with disease exacerbations and poor outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, we assessed the association between these organisms in patients with IBD and the impact on colectomy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to assess CDI prevalence in patients with IBD with a tissue diagnosis of CMV compared with matched IBD controls without CMV from 2005 to 2011. We also assessed the impact of coinfection on colectomy risk for patients coinfected with CMV and CDI compared with IBD patients with CMV alone (CMV controls) or matched IBD patients with CDI alone (CDI controls). Colectomy-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods, and statistical significance was determined using Log-rank analysis for unmatched comparisons and by generalized estimating equations in Cox regression for matched comparisons.

- **Results**: CDI was more common in IBD patients with CMV (n = 12/68; 17.6%) than in matched IBD controls (n = 12/144; 8.25%) (P = 0.046). A nonsignificant increase in high-grade disease (5 or more CMV inclusions by immunohistochemistry) was detected in coinfected patients compared with CMV controls (P = 0.15). Colectomy-free survival at 1 year was 30% (95% confidence interval, 12.0–74.7) for coinfected patients and was significantly less compared with 71.5% (95% confidence interval, 58.0–88.2) of CDI controls (P < 0.001) and was numerically less than 57.1% (95% confidence interval, 44.1–74.0) of CMV controls (P = 0.095).

- **Conclusions**: The study indicates a higher prevalence of CDI in IBD patients with CMV, and coinfection adversely impacts colectomy-free survival.

### Overdiagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection in the molecular test era [^111DhrVg]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is a major cause of health care-associated infection, but disagreement between diagnostic tests is an ongoing barrier to clinical decision-making and public health reporting. Molecular tests are increasingly used to diagnose C. difficile infection (CDI), but many molecular test-positive patients lack toxins that historically defined the disease, making it unclear if they need treatment.

- **Objective**: To determine the natural history and need for treatment of patients who are toxin immunoassay negative and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive (Tox-/PCR+) for CDI.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A prospective observational cohort study at a single academic medical center included 1,416 hospitalized adults tested for C. difficile toxins 72 hours or longer after admission, between December 1, 2010, and October 20, 2012. The analysis was conducted in stages with revisions from April 27, 2013, to January 13, 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patients undergoing C. difficile testing were grouped by US Food and Drug Administration-approved toxin and PCR tests as Tox+/PCR+, Tox-/PCR+, or Tox-/PCR-. Toxin results were reported clinically, while polymerase chain reaction results were not reported. The main study outcomes were the duration of diarrhea during up to 14 days of treatment, the rate of CDI-related complications (i.e. colectomy, megacolon, or intensive care unit care), and CDI-related death within 30 days.

- **Results**: Twenty-one percent (293 of 1,416) of hospitalized adults tested for C. difficile were positive by PCR, but 44.7% (131 of 293) had toxins detected by the tests.

### Differences in outcome according to Clostridium difficile testing method: A prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study of C difficile infection [^11478dyL]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In the UK, the long-standing policy is to take samples from all patients with diarrhoea, even after only one or two episodes, and more tests for C difficile infection are done than in other European countries. Outcome data were nearly complete, and although the data available for secondary endpoints such as treatment were available in 60–70% of cases, the results seem robust. As an observational study, the strong associations shown here do not confirm causality. However, the fact that patients who were cytotoxigenic culture positive but cell cytotoxin assay negative had good outcomes, despite not receiving any specific treatment for C difficile infection, strongly suggests a causal link between outcome and cell cytotoxin assay positivity.

For convenience, most diagnostic laboratories do not use reference methods. However, the performance of routine C difficile diagnostic tests is established by comparing them to reference methods. Our data emphasise the need to choose the appropriate reference method for each test. This multicentre study draws attention to geographical variation in test performance and confirms previous study findings of poor positive predictive values for toxin enzyme immunoassays.

### How to: diagnose infection caused by Clostridium difficile [^116Ugyhb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is recognized as the major agent responsible for nosocomial diarrhea. In the context of the recent increase in incidence and severity of C. difficile infections (CDI), an accurate diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment and prevention but continues to be challenging.

- **Aims**: The present article reviews each key step of CDI diagnosis, including stool selection, methods and strategies used, and interpretation of the results.

- **Sources**: The most recent guidelines for CDI diagnosis published by scientific societies were reviewed.

- **Content**: CDI diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory tests confirming the presence of a toxigenic strain or toxins in stools. Stool selection is crucial and can be improved by implementing rejection criteria and a strict policy for appropriate testing. Multiple laboratory tests detecting different targets (free toxin or the presence of a potentially toxigenic strain) are commercially available. However, none of these tests combine high sensitivity and specificity to diagnose CDI, low hands-on time, and low cost. An optimized diagnosis can be achieved by implementing a two- or three-step algorithm. Algorithms currently recommended by the ESCMID comprise a screening test with high sensitivity followed by a more specific test to detect free toxins. The presence of free toxins in stools has been shown to better correlate with severe outcomes, whereas nucleic acid amplification tests may lead to an over-diagnosis by detecting asymptomatic carriers of a toxigenic strain.

### An international multicenter performance analysis of cytomegalovirus load tests [^114vserh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

One central issue that has emerged with the use of different CMV PCR tests is the significant interassay quantification variability, as demonstrated in multicenter studies with standardized panels. This lack of assay agreement complicates the management of individual patients who may have testing performed in different laboratories and has hampered the establishment of broadly applicable quantitative cutoff values that can be used in clinical decision-making, potentially negatively impacting the management and long-term outcomes of patients at risk of the direct and indirect effects of CMV replication. Therefore, in the clinical management of CMV after transplantation, there is a significant unmet medical need for the development of standardized nucleic acid tests that deliver comparable quantitative data across different laboratories.

The first international standard for CMV QNAT has recently been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. This CMV standard should help improve interassay agreement. However, assay-specific variability is still expected due to underlying differences in test constituents, including varying nucleic acid extraction methods, target-specific amplification efficiencies, assay biochemistries, and operator-dependent variability. As recently suggested, these residual quantification disparities could be solved through the widespread availability of commercial PCR tests that encompass all assay steps (nucleic acid preparation, reaction setup, calibration, amplification, and detection).

### Determination of the performance of a novel diagnostic test for toxins A and B using latent class analysis [^114Q94MU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains challenging. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) targeting the C. difficile (CD) toxin B gene suffer from suboptimal specificity for CDI due to CD asymptomatic colonization. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) that detect the presence of CD toxins are more specific for CDI but suffer from low sensitivity.

To address this challenge, assays detecting CD toxins were developed using single-molecule array (SIMOA) technology, which have much lower limits of toxin detection than conventional EIAs. In this study, stool specimens from 708 symptomatic patients were aliquoted for testing by cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA), toxigenic culture, NAAT, conventional CD toxin EIA, and SIMOA CD toxin EIAs.

Using latent class analysis, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each of these diagnostic tests for detecting, separately, the presence of CD bacterium, CD toxin gene, and CD toxin. We estimated that the prevalence of CDI in our cohort was 14% (95% credible interval [CI]: 0.11–0.17). While the specificity of NAAT for detecting the presence of CD toxin was 95% (95% CI: 0.94–0.97), its positive predictive value was poor due to the low prevalence of CDI. The specificity of the conventional CD toxin EIA for CDI was excellent, but the sensitivity was only 48% (95% CI: 0.41–0.55).

In comparison, the sensitivities of the SIMOA toxins A and B EIAs were 76% (95% CI: 0.67–0.84) and 77% (95% CI: 0.67–0.84), respectively, while maintaining excellent specificity. We conclude that SIMOA CD toxin EIAs are significantly more effective in detecting CDI.

### Clinical significance of toxin EIA positivity in patients with suspected infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111WqLWV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI) is controversial. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and toxin enzyme immunoassays (EIA) are most widely used, often in combination. However, the interpretation of a positive NAAT and negative toxin immunoassay (NAAT+/EIA−) is uncertain.

PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting clinical outcomes in NAAT+/EIA− versus NAAT+/EIA+ patients. Forty-six studies comprising 33,959 patients were included in this meta-analysis. All-cause mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80–1.15), attributable mortality (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.20–1.91), fulminant CDI (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.57–1.20), radiographic evidence of CDI (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.65–1.16), total CDI complications (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59–1.53), colectomies (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.34–1.79), and ICU admission (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84–1.30) did not significantly differ between NAAT+/EIA− and NAAT+/EIA+ patients. However, rates of recurrent (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50–0.77) or severe (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63–0.88) CDI were significantly lower in NAAT+/EIA− patients than in NAAT+/EIA+ patients.

The pooled prevalence of NAAT+/EIA− patients who were treated with antibiotics for CDI was 73.4% (pooled proportion 0.72, 95% CI 0.52–0.88). NAAT+/EIA− patients have lower rates of recurrence and are at reduced risk for severe CDI compared with NAAT+/EIA+ patients but have a risk of CDI-related complications and mortality comparable to that of NAAT+/EIA+ patients. Toxin results cannot rule in or rule out CDI, and the decision whether to treat symptomatic NAAT+/EIA− patients for CDI should be carefully considered.

### Making sense of differing guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection [^114wQjNc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and to improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available, summarizing best diagnostic practices, including two-step diagnostic testing. Therapeutically, guideline recommendations have more recently favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations evolve, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have changed and to comprehend best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### Ultrasensitive detection of Clostridioides difficile toxins in stool by use of single-molecule counting technology: Comparison with detection of free toxin by cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay [^1153emB6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) rely on the detection of free toxin or molecular detection of toxin genes. The Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay is a rapid, automated, and ultrasensitive assay that detects C. difficile toxins A and B in stool. We compared CDI assays across two prospective multicenter studies to set a cutoff for the Clarity assay and to independently validate the performance compared with that of a cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCCNA).

The cutoff was set by two sites testing fresh samples from 897 subjects with suspected CDI and then validated at four sites testing fresh samples from 1,005 subjects with suspected CDI. CCCNA testing was performed at a centralized laboratory. Samples with discrepant results between the Clarity assay and CCCNA were retested with CCCNA when the Clarity result agreed with that of at least one comparator method. Toxin enzyme immunoassays (EIA), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) detection, and PCR were performed on all samples. The cutoff for the Clarity assay was set at 12.0 pg/ml.

Compared to results with CCCNA, the Clarity assay initially had 85.2% positive agreement and 92.4% negative agreement. However, when samples with discrepant results between the Clarity assay and CCCNA in the validation study were retested by CCCNA, 13/17 (76.5%) Clarity-negative but CCCNA-positive samples (Clarity + /CCCNA -) became CCCNA -, and 5/26 (19.2%) Clarity + /CCCNA - samples became CCCNA +, resulting in a 96.3% positive agreement and 93.0% negative agreement between Clarity and CCCNA.

### Stool toxin concentration does not distinguish Clostridioides difficile infection from colonization in children less than 3 years of age [^114aFPVZ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

In a prospective cohort study, stools from children under 3 years of age, both with and without diarrhea, who tested positive for Clostridioides difficile nucleic acid amplification underwent ultrasensitive and quantitative toxin measurement. Among the 37 cases and 46 controls, toxin concentration distributions overlapped substantially. Toxin concentration alone does not distinguish C. difficile infection from colonization in young children.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^116MaJNg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Clostridioides difficile infection, specifically concerning stool testing, the IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) alone or using a multistep algorithm for testing. This could involve glutamate dehydrogenase plus toxin, glutamate dehydrogenase plus toxin arbitrated by NAAT, or NAAT plus toxin. Using these methods is preferred over toxin testing alone when there are pre-agreed institutional criteria for patient stool submission.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^112L9jjm]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is the most important infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased, with 20,000 cases now reported annually, also posing indirect educational and economic consequences. In contrast to infection in adults, CDI in children is more frequently community-associated, accounting for three-quarters of all cases. A wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea, can occur and varies by age. Fulminant disease, although rare in children, is associated with high morbidity and even fatality.

Diagnosis of CDI can be challenging as currently available tests detect either the presence of the organism or the disease-causing toxin but cannot distinguish colonization from infection. Since colonization can be high in specific pediatric groups, such as infants and young children, biomarkers to aid in accurate diagnosis are urgently needed. Similar to disease in adults, recurrence of CDI in children is common, affecting 20% to 30% of incident cases. Metronidazole has long been considered the mainstay therapy for CDI in children. However, new evidence supports the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin as additional treatment options, while fecal microbiota transplantation is gaining popularity for reinfection. Recent advancements in understanding emerging epidemiologic trends and the management of CDI unique to children are highlighted.

### Searching for a potential algorithm for Clostridium difficile testing at a tertiary care hospital: Does toxin enzyme immunoassay testing help [^117NFJH9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the United States. Methods for identifying the organism in stool include molecular platforms, enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for toxin, and culture. Controversy persists over whether molecular tests are too sensitive in identifying C. difficile, and there are questions about how additional laboratory information could inform clinical management and reduce overtreatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether clinical factors are related to the toxin status of patients and whether information about toxin status could potentially inform clinical management of patients.

A total of 201 PCR-positive C. difficile stool samples from adult patients at our institution underwent EIA toxin testing. Clinical and laboratory data were collected, and the percentage of PCR-positive/EIA-positive (PCR+/EIA+) patients and PCR-positive/EIA-negative (PCR+/EIA-) patients was calculated. Of the 201 samples, 47% were EIA positive and 53% were EIA negative. Although PCR+/EIA+ patients were more likely to have had a prior C. difficile infection (P = 0.015), there was no statistical difference between the additional data collected that correlated with a positive EIA result. We were unable to show that patients with an EIA positive result had worse clinical parameters than those with EIA negative results and concluded that establishing a testing algorithm that included both PCR and EIA testing would not change the clinical management of patients at our hospital.

### Clostridioides difficile in transplant patients: Early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112u1GYC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is common in solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These populations are also underrepresented in clinical trials, making optimal management difficult. Because of this, management of these populations follows national guideline recommendations. This review aims to summarize the recent relevant literature pertaining to the clinical management of C. difficile infection in transplant patients, with a particular focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

- **Recent findings**: Early diagnosis of C. difficile colonization may mitigate both horizontal and vertical transmission (progression from colonization to colitis) of infection. Once diagnosed, recent literature suggests antibiotic treatment should align with that recommended by national guidelines. Fecal microbiota transplant is an emerging therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection, and recent data have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Prevention strategies, including antimicrobial stewardship, probiotic administration, antibiotic administration, and bezlotoxumab, may be beneficial in transplant populations, but more data are needed to confirm recent findings.

- **Summary**: Studies evaluating C. difficile infection in transplant patients are only recently starting to emerge. Further research is needed to identify optimal treatment and prevention strategies, and to examine novel strategies such as microbiome manipulation.

### High agreement between an ultrasensitive Clostridioides difficile toxin assay and a C. difficile laboratory algorithm utilizing GDH-and-toxin enzyme immunoassays and cytotoxin testing [^116sNrKr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

The Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B (Clarity) assay is an automated, ultrasensitive immunoassay for the detection of Clostridioides difficile toxins in stool. In this study, the performance of the Clarity assay was compared to that of a multistep algorithm using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and toxins A and B, arbitrated by a semiquantitative cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA).

The performance of the assay was evaluated using 211 residual deidentified stool samples. These samples were tested with a GDH-and-toxin EIA (C. Diff Quik Chek Complete; Techlab), with GDH-and-toxin discordant samples further tested with CCNA. Stored at -80°C before testing, these samples were then assessed with the Clarity assay. For samples discordant between Clarity and the standard-of-care algorithm, additional testing with PCR (Xpert C. difficile; Cepheid) and chart review was performed.

The testing algorithm resulted in 34 GDH+/toxin+, 53 GDH-/toxin-, and 124 GDH+/toxin- samples, of which 39 were CCNA+ and 85 were CCNA-. Clarity exhibited a 96.2% negative agreement with GDH-/toxin- samples, 100% positive agreement with GDH+/toxin+ samples, and 95.3% agreement with GDH+/toxin-/CCNA- samples. One sample result from Clarity was invalid. The assay agreed with 61.5% of GDH+/toxin-/CCNA+ samples, 90.0% of GDH+/toxin-/CCNA+ (high-positive) samples, and 31.6% of GDH+/toxin-/CCNA+ (low-positive) samples.

The Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay demonstrated high agreement with a testing algorithm utilizing a GDH-and-toxin EIA and CCNA.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Clostridioides difficile infection, specifically in stool testing protocols, the IDSA/SHEA 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining stool toxin testing as part of a multistep algorithm. This algorithm includes combinations such as glutamate dehydrogenase plus toxin, glutamate dehydrogenase plus toxin arbitrated by NAAT, or NAAT plus toxin, rather than using NAAT alone for all specimens received in the clinical laboratory when there are no pre-agreed institutional criteria for patient stool submission.

### Management of infection in patients with haematological malignancies and after cellular therapy: Guidelines from 10th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-10) [^113Zniv8]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus, with strains that can carry or not contain toxin genes (toxigenic and non-toxigenic). Colonization is rare in healthy adults but significantly more common in hospitalized patients, reaching 25%. In adult haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and children with haematological malignancies (HM) or HCT, asymptomatic colonization rates of up to 39% and 70%, respectively, have been reported.

C. difficile can either colonize the gastrointestinal tract without causing symptoms or lead to C. difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a toxin-mediated disease where two exotoxins, enterotoxin A (TcdA) and cytotoxin B (TcdB), are responsible for diarrhea and inflammation. The severity of CDI can vary widely, from mild diarrhea to severe conditions like pseudomembranous colitis, ileus, or toxic megacolon. Hypervirulent strains, such as NAP1/027 or 078, which produce a binary toxin, have been reported to cause outbreaks of severe colitis but have not been consistently implicated in HCT settings. The most important predisposing factor for CDI is the disruption of gut microbiota, often induced by antibiotics, which also contributes to high rates of recurrent CDI (rCDI), exceeding 30% in some immunocompromised patients. Other predisposing factors common in HM are prolonged hospital stays, immunosuppressive therapies, and mucositis.

The diagnosis of CDI in patients with HM or undergoing HCT remains challenging. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for toxin detection, while specific and relatively reliable, are not always definitive.

### Pediatric Clostridioides difficile infection: Diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship [^111fcBXn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Low credibility.

Although the pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is complex and incompletely understood, it is believed that the elaboration of C. difficile toxins is necessary for disease. A variety of tests is available for the detection of both the C. difficile organism and its toxins; however, each has limitations, and the best application of these tests to the diagnosis of CDI in children remains uncertain. Nucleic acid amplification tests are unable to reliably discriminate between CDI and C. difficile colonization, while commercially available enzyme immunoassays for toxin detection lack sensitivity. An understanding of preanalytic factors, relevant patient features, and test performance characteristics is essential to the accurate diagnosis of CDI in children.

Specific diagnostic stewardship strategies can also increase the likelihood that positive tests reflect disease rather than colonization. Ultimately, CDI remains a clinical diagnosis, and clinical judgment is essential when interpreting test results, regardless of the methods used.

### Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infections in children [^111xFvxE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The detection and diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection in pediatric populations have unique considerations compared to testing in adults. The testing methodologies — such as toxigenic culture, cell cytotoxicity, antigen detection, and more recently, molecular testing — are the same across all age groups. However, limited data exist on the specific performance characteristics in children. This review focuses on the challenges of testing in pediatric populations and assesses the available data on test performance in these groups. Additionally, a review of the existing guidance for testing is provided.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Clostridioides difficile infection, specifically in relation to stool testing protocols, the ESCMID 2016 guidelines recommend using a two-step algorithm for laboratory evaluation of CDI. The initial step should involve either a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or a glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme immunoassay. Samples with a negative result in the first test should be reported as negative. Samples yielding a positive first test result should undergo further testing with a toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay. Finally, report samples with a positive result from the second test as CDI-positive.

### Ultrasensitive Clostridioides difficile toxin testing for higher diagnostic accuracy [^113fv4sK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

Currently available diagnostic tests for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) lack specificity or sensitivity, leading to guideline recommendations for multistep testing algorithms. Ultrasensitive assays for the detection of C. difficile toxins provide measurements of disease-specific markers at very low concentrations. These assays may show improved accuracy compared to existing testing methods and offer a potential standalone solution for CDI diagnosis. However, large studies of clinical performance and accuracy are lacking.

### Mouse monoclonal antibodies against toxins TcdA and TcdB target diverse epitopes for neutralization [^111FZgZo]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium that can cause infections in subjects with weakened immune systems or following antibiotic treatment. These infections may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans. As such, C. difficile is a major cause of nosocomial illness worldwide. The major virulence factors of the bacterium are the large clostridium toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB), which are high molecular mass proteins with intrinsic glucosyltransferase activity.

Toxins bind to the intestinal epithelium and undergo endocytosis by the epithelial cells, followed by a conformational change triggered by the low pH of early endosomes. This conformational change leads to the exposure of hydrophobic segments, followed by membrane insertion, formation of pores, and translocation of the glucosyltransferase domain into the cellular cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the glucosyltransferase domain inactivates small GTPases of the Rho family of proteins, leading to the disruption of the cytoskeleton.

In the work, we describe the discovery and characterization of a panel of neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies capable of interfering with several steps of cellular intoxication by the toxins. The antibodies were produced using hybridoma technology. Neutralizing activity of the antibodies was confirmed using toxin neutralization assays, and functional assays were used to identify specific neutralization mechanisms. Binding epitopes of the antibodies were identified by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and confirmed through additional experiments.

### Diagnostic accuracy of blood-based tests and histopathology for cytomegalovirus reactivation in inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115e597x]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

It is unclear if traditional histopathology and noninvasive blood-based tests are sufficiently accurate to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of these tests compared with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

- **Methods**: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed from inception through January 2016 for observational studies comparing diagnostic tests for CMV reactivation in inflammatory bowel disease. IHC and tissue PCR were considered reference standards and were used to evaluate the accuracy of blood-based tests and hematoxylin and eosin histopathology. Weighted summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using bivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Nine studies examined the accuracy of blood-based tests for predicting colonic CMV reactivation: five studies by pp65 antigenemia and four studies by blood PCR. The overall sensitivity was 50.8% (95% CI, 19.9–81.6), the specificity was 99.9% (95% CI, 99–100), and the positive predictive value was 83.8% (95% CI, 58.6–95.0). The sensitivities of pp65 and blood PCR were 39.7% (95% CI, 27.4–52.1) and 60.0% (95% CI, 46.5–73.5), respectively. Nine studies examined the sensitivity of histopathology. The overall sensitivity was 12.5% (95% CI, 3.6–21.4), 34.6% by IHC (95% CI, 13.8–55.4), and 4.7% by tissue PCR (95% CI, 1.2–17.1).

- **Conclusions**: Although blood-based tests seem to predict colonic CMV reactivation, they are insensitive tests. Similarly, histopathology has poor sensitivity.

### Differences in outcome according to Clostridium difficile testing method: a prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study of C difficile infection [^1178i33M]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For quality assurance, every month one participating laboratory, on rotation, sent six blinded samples to the other three sites. All assays were undertaken on the samples, and results were compared for inter-laboratory variation.

We assessed tests that represent the three main targets for C difficile detection: bacterium (glutamate dehydrogenase), toxins, or toxin genes. Training was provided by assay manufacturers, and all tests were performed according to their instructions. The enzyme immunoassays were automated and conducted on DS2 instruments (Magellan Biosciences, North Billerica, MA, USA).

- **Assay evaluation**: We assessed the following assays: Meridian Premier toxins A&B enzyme immunoassay (toxin enzyme immunoassay 1; Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA); Techlab C difficile Tox A/B II toxin enzyme immunoassay (toxin enzyme immunoassay 2; Techlab, Blacksburg, VA, USA); and the Techlab C diff Chek-60 glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme immunoassay (Techlab). The nucleic acid amplification test assay used was GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

We gathered routinely available patient data as follows: blood test results obtained within 3 days of faecal samples (white cell count, and serum creatinine and albumin concentrations), dates of admission and discharge, age, sex, and 30-day all-cause mortality. Baseline serum creatinine concentrations were obtained from tests done more than 6 months before study entry.

- **Additional data recorded**: We recorded additional data, including computerized tomographic evidence of colitis, or if C difficile was mentioned on a death certificate, for patients with positive cytotoxigenic culture.

### Clostridium difficile infections in children: Impact of the diagnostic method on infection rates [^111iYMya]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays based on the detection of the toxin B gene are replacing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based toxin production detection or cell cytotoxicity assays in most laboratories. The objective was to determine the proportion of pediatric patients diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection by PCR who would have also been diagnosed by ELISA and to compare the clinical characteristics of PCR+/ELISA+ vs. PCR+/ELISA- patients.

Stool samples positive for C. difficile by PCR between October 2010 and July 2014 were identified using the microbiology laboratory information system. Subsequently, an ELISA for toxin A and B was performed on frozen stool specimens. A retrospective medical chart review was conducted to obtain demographic and clinical data. Duplicate samples were excluded.

A total of 136 PCR-positive samples underwent ELISA testing, with 54 (40%) being positive for toxin A or B. The mean age of the entire cohort was 8.5 years with a standard deviation of 6.2 years. There was no difference in age, gender, clinical manifestation, previous medical problems, and management between patients positive or negative by ELISA. However, patients positive by ELISA were more likely to have had recent exposure to antibiotics (67.9% vs. 50%); the crude odds ratio was 2.1 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.03–4.28.

In conclusion, in our pediatric population, 60% of patients with C. difficile diagnosed by PCR had no toxin detectable by ELISA. ELISA-negative patients were less likely to have received an antibiotic recently compared with ELISA-positive patients. These results highlight the need to standardize diagnostic practices.

### Differences in outcome according to Clostridium difficile testing method: A prospective multicentre diagnostic validation study of C difficile infection [^112Y8qVP]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection is controversial due to the presence of many laboratory methods, compounded by two reference methods. Cytotoxigenic culture detects toxigenic C. difficile and gives a positive result more frequently (e.g. because of colonization, which means that individuals can have the bacterium but no free toxin) than does the cytotoxin assay, which detects preformed toxin in feces. We aimed to validate the reference methods according to clinical outcomes and to derive an optimum laboratory diagnostic algorithm for C. difficile infection.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, multicentre study, we performed cytotoxigenic culture and cytotoxin assays on 12,420 fecal samples across four UK laboratories. We also conducted tests representing the three main targets for C. difficile detection: bacterium (glutamate dehydrogenase), toxins, or toxin genes. Routine blood test results, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality were used to clinically validate the reference methods. Data were categorized by reference method result: group 1, cytotoxin assay positive; group 2, cytotoxigenic culture positive and cytotoxin assay negative; and group 3, both reference methods negative.

- **Findings**: Clinical and reference assay data were available for 6,522 inpatient episodes. Univariate analysis revealed that mortality was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (72/435 [16.6%] vs. 20/207 [9.7%], p = 0.044) and in group 3 (503/5880 [8.6%], p < 0.001), but not in group 2 compared to group 3 (p = 0.4). Multivariate analysis accounting for potential confounders confirmed the mortality differences.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^115VX36d]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The laboratory diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children is challenging, as detection does not always confirm diagnosis. Several commercial tests are available, each with limitations, and there is no gold standard. Tests detecting the organism, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), are highly sensitive but cannot distinguish between colonization and infection. Tests detecting toxin, like enzyme immunoassays, are more specific but lack sufficient sensitivity for diagnosis. Detection of toxin does not correlate with symptom severity in children, nor can stool toxin concentration reliably distinguish between carriage and infection. A prospective study of asymptomatic children with cancer, cystic fibrosis, or inflammatory bowel disease showed that 21% were colonized with C. difficile, and toxin detection did not differ when compared with symptomatic CDI children. Correct interpretation of C. difficile test results requires careful consideration of patient factors. Misinterpretation can lead to unnecessary antibiotic exposure, adverse drug effects, and delays in diagnosing the true cause of diarrhea.

- **Diagnostic stewardship**: Adhering to various strategies can improve the predictive value of testing. For instance, diarrheal stool should predominantly be collected from patients with unexplained and new-onset diarrhea.

### Diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C. difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. However, over the past two decades, diagnostic techniques have changed in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C. difficile infection and the use of new therapeutic molecules.

The evolution of diagnosis highlighted the significant under- and misdiagnosis of C. difficile infection, emphasizing the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug to treat C. difficile infection, but more recently, vancomycin and other newer drugs have been shown to have higher cure rates.

Recurrence of infection represents a key parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the adapted therapeutic molecule. In cases of multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules, are already available or in the pipeline, but more data are needed to support their inclusion in practice guidelines.

This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choice in the diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile infection based on the most recent data available.

### Ultrasensitive detection of Clostridioides difficile toxins A and B by use of automated single-molecule counting technology [^115MP4Gh]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Tests for the detection of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile free toxins in feces lack sensitivity, while nucleic acid amplification tests lack clinical specificity. We have evaluated the Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay (currently in development), an automated and rapid ultrasensitive immunoassay powered by single-molecule counting technology, for detection of C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) in stool.

- **Analytical sensitivity and specificity**: The analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, repeatability, and stability of the assay were determined.

- **Clinical evaluation**: In a clinical evaluation, frozen stool samples from 311 patients with suspected C. difficile infection were tested with the Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay, using an established cutoff value. Samples were tested with the Xpert C. difficile/Epi assay, and PCR-positive samples were tested with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (C. Diff Quik Chek Complete). EIA-negative samples were further tested with a cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay.

- **Limits of detection and assay performance**: The limits of detection for TcdA and TcdB were 0.8 and 0.3 pg/ml in buffer and 2.0 and 0.7 pg/ml in stool, respectively. The assay demonstrated reactivity to common C. difficile strains, did not show cross-reactivity to common gastrointestinal pathogens, was robust against common interferents, allowed detection in fresh and frozen stool samples and in samples after three freeze-thaw cycles, and provided results with high reproducibility.

Compared to multistep PCR and toxin-testing procedures, the Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay yielded 97.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

### Host immune markers distinguish Clostridioides difficile infection from asymptomatic carriage and non-C. difficile diarrhea [^115SPrR7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Recent data indicate that Clostridioides difficile toxin concentrations in stool do not differentiate between C. difficile infection (CDI) and asymptomatic carriage. Thus, we lack a method to distinguish a symptomatic patient with CDI from a colonized patient with diarrhea from another cause. To address this, we evaluated markers of innate and adaptive immunity in adult inpatients with CDI (diagnosed per US guidelines), asymptomatic carriage, or non-CDI diarrhea.

- **Methods**: CDI-NAAT patients had clinically significant diarrhea and positive nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and received CDI treatment. Carrier-NAAT patients had positive stool NAAT but no diarrhea. NAAT-negative patients (with and without diarrhea) were also enrolled. A panel of cytokines and anti-toxin A and B immunoglobulin (Ig) were measured in serum; calprotectin and anti-toxin B Ig A/G were measured in stool. NAAT-positive stool samples were tested by an ultrasensitive toxin assay (clinical cutoff, 20 pg/mL).

- **Results**: Median values for interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IgG anti-toxin A in blood and IgA/G anti-toxin B in stool were significantly higher in CDI patients compared with all other groups (P < .05). Concentration distributions for IL-6, GCSF, TNF-α, and IgG anti-toxin A in blood, as well as IgA and IgG anti-toxin B in stool, separated CDI patients from all other groups.

- **Conclusions**: Specific markers of innate and adaptive immunity distinguish CDI from all other groups.

### Identification of a pseudo-outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effect of repeated testing, sensitivity, and specificity on perceived prevalence of CDI [^116JDmDj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The study describes a pseudo-outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) caused by a faulty toxin assay lot. It aims to determine the effect of sensitivity, specificity, and repeated testing for C. difficile on perceived CDI burden, positive predictive value, and false-positive results.

- **Design**: Outbreak investigation and criterion standard.
- **Patients**: Patients hospitalized at a tertiary care hospital, with at least one toxin assay for detection of C. difficile performed from July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2006.
- **Methods**: The run control chart method and the chi-square test were used to compare CDI rates and the proportion of positive test results before, during, and after the pseudo-outbreak. The effect of repeated testing was evaluated using three hypothetical models with a sample of 10,000 patients and various assay sensitivity and specificity estimates.
- **Results**: In November 2005, the CDI rate at the hospital increased from 1.5 to 2.6 cases per 1,000 patient-days (P < .01), and the proportion of positive test results increased from 13.6% to 22.1% (P < .01). An investigation revealed a pseudo-outbreak caused by a faulty toxin assay lot. A decrease of only 1.2% in the specificity of the toxin assay would result in a 32% increase in perceived incidence of CDI at this institution. When calculated using the manufacturer's stated specificity and sensitivity along with this institution's testing practices, the positive predictive value of the test decreased from 80.6% to 4.1% for patients who received three tests.
- **Conclusion**: Specificity is as important as sensitivity in testing practices to accurately assess the CDI burden within an institution.

### Does my patient have Clostridium difficile infection [^111sCUmb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) seems to be changing, with increasing virulence and incidence, more resistance to metronidazole, and worse outcomes. Accurate diagnosis is critical, but three common misconceptions lead to misdiagnosis: Clostridium difficile infection is considered a possibility when the patient has fewer than three loose stools per day; the glutamate dehydrogenase test for CDI is assumed to be sensitive and thus a good initial test; and repeating an insensitive laboratory test for CDI is thought to be useful.

These misconceptions can lead to missed diagnoses, for instance, when tests with low sensitivity are used, and to false diagnoses, such as when tests are conducted on patients unlikely to have CDI because they have minimal diarrhea or negative results on recent tests. Diagnoses of CDI will be more accurate if clinicians use tests with higher sensitivity, reduce the frequency of testing for a single episode of diarrhea, and pay more attention to key elements of the patient's history.

### Reference assays for Clostridium difficile infection: One or two gold standards [^112zDsEp]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is essential for optimal treatment, prevention, and control. There are two reference assays for CDI diagnosis: the cell cytotoxicity assay (CCTA) and toxigenic culture (TC). Importantly, these tests detect different targets: CCTA detects the presence of C. difficile toxins (primarily toxin B, but also toxin A), whereas TC detects the presence in the stool of C. difficile with the potential to produce toxin. Not surprisingly, studies comparing the results of these assays show imperfect agreement. Thus, a fecal sample may be CCTA negative but TC positive, raising the crucial question about the clinical significance of the presence of C. difficile with the capacity to produce toxin but no actual detectable free toxin.

A positive TC result indicates that a patient with diarrhea is potentially infectious. TC also has the advantage that the cultured isolate is available for typing and for susceptibility testing. In general, however, CCTA has been shown to be a better test for the laboratory confirmation of CDI, although additional culture may be needed to optimize sensitivity. Crucially, when these reference assays are used to determine the accuracy of alternative diagnostic tests, care should be taken to compare methods with the appropriate standard (i.e. compare tests that target equivalent endpoints). Such issues have contributed to the variable and often suboptimal performance of rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Further research is urgently needed to improve knowledge of the utility of routine diagnostic tests.

### Challenges and future solutions for detection of CDI in adults [^1112sviM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

There are no established standards for the diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), even though the importance of this infection in humans is well known. The effectiveness of commercially available techniques, which are standardized for use with human feces, is limited in terms of test accuracy. Furthermore, the approach lacks a point-of-care diagnosis with an acceptable range of sensitivity and specificity. This article reviews the challenges and possible future solutions for the detection of CDI in adults.

Existing diagnostic methods, such as enzyme-linked immunoassays and microbial culturing for the detection of toxins A and B, appear to work poorly in samples. However, they exhibit great sensitivity for glutamate dehydrogenase. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid amplification tests have been investigated in a few studies on human samples but have shown poor turnaround times. Developing a multiplex point-of-care test assay with high sensitivity and specificity is required as a bedside approach for diagnosing this emerging infection.

### Strategies to prevent infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112AX8oK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Low credibility.

Identification of patients with CDI and appropriate test utilization: Positive results of diarrheal stool tests for toxigenic C. difficile (i.e. NAAT) or its toxins (i.e. EIA) are the most common methods to identify patients with CDI. A minority of patients are diagnosed by visualizing pseudomembranes at endoscopy and/or by histopathology without stool testing. NAATs, which detect toxigenic C. difficile, are extraordinarily sensitive but do not reliably differentiate C. difficile colonization and infection. Toxin EIAs, which detect C. difficile toxins, are less sensitive than NAATs but have greater clinical predictive value for CDI.

These distinctions between test types are important because C. difficile colonization can occur in up to 20%–25% of children and adults over their hospitalization and is more likely with prolonged and/or repeated hospitalizations. Thus, the specific test used and scenarios during which patients are tested will affect the clinical predictive value of the test and the likelihood of misdiagnosis of C. difficile colonization as CDI. Several diagnostic stewardship strategies are effective for reducing misdiagnosis of CDI in individuals who are colonized with C. difficile.

The impact of CDI misdiagnosis: Frequent misdiagnosis of C. difficile colonization as CDI falsely increases institutional CDI rates, which may be publicly reported. Misdiagnosis impairs reliable interfacility comparisons of CDI rates and increases inappropriate use.

### Clostridioides difficile in children [^111zVVn1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). High credibility.

After a significant increase in pediatric Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in the United States over the past two decades, incidence has declined over the past five years. Community-associated CDI incidence is three times higher than healthcare facility-associated CDI in children, although the sources of community acquisition are poorly defined. Diagnosis of CDI is challenging due to the high frequency of colonization in infants and some groups of older children. Recent data suggest that vancomycin should be considered a first-line treatment for CDI in children, and that fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplantation are safe and effective therapies for recurrent CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^116YvFbt]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile is the most important infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide and a leading cause of healthcare-associated infection in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased, with 20,000 cases reported annually, also posing indirect educational and economic consequences. In contrast to infection in adults, CDI in children is more frequently community-associated, accounting for three-quarters of all cases.

A wide spectrum of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic carriage to severe diarrhea, can occur, varying by age. Fulminant disease, although rare in children, is associated with high morbidity and even fatality. Diagnosis of CDI can be challenging as currently available tests detect either the presence of the organism or disease-causing toxin but cannot distinguish colonization from infection. Since colonization can be high in specific pediatric groups, such as infants and young children, biomarkers to aid in accurate diagnosis are urgently needed. Similar to disease in adults, recurrence of CDI in children is common, affecting 20% to 30% of incident cases.

- **Treatment options**: Metronidazole has long been considered the mainstay therapy for CDI in children. However, new evidence supports the safety and efficacy of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin as additional treatment options, whereas fecal microbiota transplantation is gaining popularity for reinfection. Recent advancements in our understanding of emerging epidemiologic trends and management of CDI unique to children are highlighted.

### Determination of the performance of a novel diagnostic test fortoxins A and B using latent class analysis [^116UPM7f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

The diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains challenging. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) targeting the C. difficile (CD) toxin B gene suffer from suboptimal specificity for CDI due to CD asymptomatic colonization. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) that detect the presence of CD toxins are more specific for CDI but suffer from low sensitivity. To address this challenge, assays detecting CD toxins were developed using single-molecule array (SIMOA) technology, which have much lower limits of toxin detection than conventional EIAs.

In this study, stool specimens from 708 symptomatic patients were aliquoted for testing by cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA), toxigenic culture, NAAT, conventional CD toxin EIA, and SIMOA CD toxin EIAs. Using latent class analysis, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each of these diagnostic tests for detecting, separately, the presence of CD bacterium, CD toxin gene, and CD toxin. We estimated that the prevalence of CDI in our cohort was 14% (95% credible interval [CI]: 0.11–0.17). While the specificity of NAAT for detecting the presence of CD toxin was 95% (95% CI: 0.94–0.97), its positive predictive value was poor due to the low prevalence of CDI.

The specificity of the conventional CD toxin EIA for CDI was excellent, but the sensitivity was only 48% (95% CI: 0.41–0.55). In comparison, the sensitivities of the SIMOA toxins A and B EIAs were 76% (95% CI: 0.67–0.84) and 77% (95% CI: 0.67–0.84) respectively, while maintaining excellent specificity. We conclude that SIMOA CD toxin EIAs are significantly superior in terms of diagnostic performance.

### Increased clinical specificity with ultrasensitive detection of Clostridioides difficile toxins: Reduction of overdiagnosis compared to nucleic acid amplification tests [^113PrVSV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Diagnosis of CDI relies on the assessment of clinical presentation and laboratory tests. We evaluated the clinical performance of ultrasensitive single-molecule counting technology for the detection of C. difficile toxins A and B. Stool specimens from 298 patients with suspected CDI were tested with the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT; BD MAX Cdiff assay or Xpert C. difficile assay) and the Singulex Clarity C. diff toxins A/B assay. Specimens with discordant results were tested with the cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA), and the results were correlated with disease severity and outcome.

There were 64 NAAT-positive and 234 NAAT-negative samples. Of the 32 NAAT + /Clarity - and 4 NAAT - /Clarity + samples, there were 26 CCNA - and 4 CCNA - samples, respectively. CDI relapse was more common in NAAT + /toxin + patients than in NAAT + /toxin - and NAAT - /toxin - patients. The clinical specificity of Clarity and NAAT was 97.4% and 89.0%, respectively. Overdiagnosis was more than three times more common in NAAT + /toxin - than in NAAT + /toxin + patients. The Clarity assay was superior to NAATs for the diagnosis of CDI by reducing overdiagnosis, thereby increasing clinical specificity, and the presence of toxins was associated with negative patient outcomes.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^111FTKsk]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The recommended diagnostic approach has evolved over time from toxin-based assays to NAAT-based testing and currently to multistep testing. As the best-performing approach for diagnosis, the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines recommend using a stool toxin test as part of a 2-step algorithm unless institutions have developed other agreed-upon clinical and laboratory criteria for test submission, in which case detection of toxigenic C. difficile by NAAT alone is considered acceptable.

More recently, in 2021, the American College of Gastroenterologists developed guidelines for the preferred management of CDI in adults, which are similar but differ slightly from the 2017 IDSA and SHEA guidelines by recommending testing algorithms that include a highly sensitive and a highly specific testing modality to distinguish colonization from active infection.

Despite societal guidance, testing practices for the diagnosis of C. difficile in children vary considerably, suggesting further opportunities to improve diagnosis exist. Judicious testing of C. difficile ranks among the top 12 high-priority research topics in healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial stewardship by the CDC.

Incorporation of clinical decision support around test ordering in electronic health records and preauthorization of testing are additional strategies successfully implemented by some institutions to improve appropriate test ordering. Gaining in popularity, the use of multiplex gastrointestinal polymerase chain reaction panels that include C. difficile targets may unintentionally increase inap.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in children: Recent updates on epidemiology, diagnosis, therapy [^114rwCJc]. Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of CDI as a cause of diarrhea in children has increased over time, though the exact magnitude of this problem is challenging to quantify given limitations in diagnosis. CDI is classified as healthcare-associated (onset more than 3 days after hospitalization) or community-associated (onset within 3 days of hospitalization, provided no documented overnight stay in a healthcare facility in the preceding 12 weeks). While CDI is considered mostly a healthcare-associated infection in adults, it is most frequently community-associated in children. Nonetheless, community-associated CDI rates have increased in both adults and children. Population-based surveillance conducted by the CDC Emerging Infections Program estimates the incidence of community-associated CDI in children was as high as 25.8 per 100,000 in 2019, accounting for 75% of cases, compared with 9.0 per 100,000 reported as healthcare-associated. Diversion of public health resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has since led to delays in subsequent surveillance estimates.

- **The global impact**: The global impact of CDI in children is even harder to quantify given even wider variations in diagnostic approaches. Regardless, high rates of CDI in children are reported worldwide. A recent cross-sectional study conducted among children presenting with acute gastroenteritis at a tertiary children's hospital in Zhejiang, China, for example, reported 14.3% of cases solely attributed to CDI. Whereas, C. difficile was detected from 19.7% of children being evaluated for diarrhea in Perth.
