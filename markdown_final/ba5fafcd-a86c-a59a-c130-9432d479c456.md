## Question

what is the doubling time for gastric cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the doubling time for gastric cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how doubling time is defined and why it matters clinically. Then, I should verify the best available human data on gastric cancer doubling time by stage. Next, I will check for outlier cases and understand why they differ. After that, I should review cell-line and organoid data to contextualize biological plausibility. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stage-stratified answer and note limitations and clinical implications for surveillance and treatment timing.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misinterpret the numbers. Doubling time in oncology refers to the time required for a tumor to double in size, typically approximated from serial volume measurements, and it varies by cancer type and stage, which is why stage-specific estimates are more informative than a single number [^25a8cc26].

> Now, I should verify the best human evidence. The most reliable data come from a prospective cohort of 101 untreated gastric cancer patients with serial endoscopic and CT staging, which reported mean doubling times of 11.8 months for T1 and 6.2 months for T4, with progression from early to advanced disease averaging 34 months, indicating faster growth as stage advances [^fc95c0b5].

> Wait, let me verify the outlier reports before I jump to conclusions. A case report described an ulcerating gastric cancer with an estimated doubling time of 9.2 days, which is exceptionally rapid and likely reflects aggressive biology or measurement artifacts; this is not representative of typical gastric cancer kinetics and should be interpreted cautiously [^2ce5bf14]. I should also note that a separate cohort reported a median doubling time around 10.1 months, aligning with the T1 estimate and reinforcing that many gastric cancers grow slowly in early stages [^63cd6752].

> Next, I should review biological plausibility from preclinical models. Gastric cancer cell lines generally show doubling times on the order of 24–30 hours, which is much faster than in vivo human tumors due to idealized culture conditions and lack of microenvironmental constraints; this helps explain why clinical doubling times are longer than in vitro estimates [^f7deba70]. Organoid models also demonstrate heterogeneous proliferation, with slower-growing lines showing delayed in vivo growth, consistent with the idea that real-world tumors grow more slowly than cell lines [^f31a20d5].

> Hold on, I should verify whether stage modifies growth kinetics in a way that changes practice. The cohort data show a clear trend: earlier-stage tumors double more slowly than advanced-stage tumors, and the transition from stage I to II takes far longer than from III to IV, supporting the concept that acceleration accompanies progression; clinically, this underpins the rationale for timely intervention in higher-risk precancerous lesions and early-stage disease [^fc95c0b5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stage-stratified answer. For early gastric cancer (T1), the doubling time averages roughly 10–12 months, whereas for advanced disease (T4), it averages around 6 months; exceptional cases can be markedly faster, with reports as short as about 9 days, but these are outliers and not generalizable [^fc95c0b5] [^2ce5bf14]. I should double-check that I'm not overstating precision; these are mean estimates with biological variability, so ranges and clinical judgment remain essential [^fc95c0b5].

> I need to ensure I address limitations. Most doubling-time data are derived from small, untreated cohorts or case reports, and growth kinetics may differ with therapy, molecular subtype, or microenvironment; thus, these figures should guide rather than dictate clinical decisions, and surveillance intervals should be individualized to risk, stage, and histology rather than relying solely on a single doubling-time estimate [^fc95c0b5] [^e95f0bdc].

> Finally, I should consider clinical implications. The relatively slow early-stage doubling supports structured surveillance in high-risk populations, whereas the faster growth in advanced disease underscores the importance of minimizing diagnostic delays and proceeding with definitive therapy when feasible; this aligns with guideline-based surveillance strategies and the observed survival penalty from delayed treatment in upper GI cancers [^e95f0bdc] [^e2b64da2].

The doubling time of gastric cancer varies by stage and biology, with **early-stage tumors doubling about every 10–12 months** [^fc95c0b5] and **advanced tumors doubling every 6–7 months**. Rapidly aggressive cases can double in as little as 9–10 days [^2ce5bf14], but these are outliers. Doubling time is longer than many other cancers due to high cell loss from exfoliation, and it shortens as tumors advance, which is why early detection is critical for improving outcomes [^fc95c0b5].

---

## Clinical evidence on doubling time

Several studies have examined gastric cancer doubling time, providing insights into its growth dynamics:

- **Early-stage gastric cancer (T1)**: The mean doubling time is approximately 11.8 months, indicating relatively slow growth in early stages [^fc95c0b5].

- **Advanced-stage gastric cancer (T4)**: The mean doubling time is approximately 6.2 months, reflecting faster growth as the disease progresses [^fc95c0b5].

- **Extremely rapid growth cases**: Rare cases have been reported with doubling times as short as 9.2 days, highlighting the aggressive potential of certain tumors [^2ce5bf14].

---

## Factors influencing doubling time

Several factors influence the doubling time of gastric cancer:

- **Tumor stage**: Early-stage tumors tend to grow more slowly than advanced-stage tumors, which proliferate rapidly [^fc95c0b5].

- **Histological subtype**: Diffuse-type gastric cancer, characterized by signet ring cells, often exhibits more aggressive behavior and shorter doubling times compared to intestinal-type tumors.

- **Genetic mutations**: Specific genetic alterations, such as TP53 mutations, can accelerate tumor growth and proliferation [^b4633670].

- **Microenvironment**: The tumor microenvironment, including oxygen availability, nutrient supply, and immune cell infiltration, significantly impacts growth rates.

---

## Comparison with other cancers

Gastric cancer generally has a **longer doubling time** than many other cancers, such as lung or pancreatic cancer, which often double within weeks to months. This relatively slower growth is partly attributed to the high rate of cell loss through exfoliation into the gastric lumen [^2ce5bf14].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the doubling time of gastric cancer has important clinical implications:

- **Early detection**: The relatively slow growth of early-stage gastric cancer provides a window of opportunity for early detection through screening and surveillance programs [^f9c96d23].

- **Treatment planning**: Knowledge of tumor growth rates informs the timing of surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

- **Prognosis**: Shorter doubling times are associated with more aggressive disease, poorer prognosis, and increased metastatic potential [^fc95c0b5].

---

## Limitations and variability

It is important to note that doubling time estimates vary significantly across studies due to differences in methodology, patient populations, and tumor characteristics. Additionally, **doubling time is a theoretical concept** that assumes exponential growth, which may not accurately reflect real-world tumor dynamics [^1d219182].

---

The doubling time of gastric cancer varies with stage and biology, with **early-stage tumors doubling about every 10–12 months** and **advanced tumors doubling every 6–7 months**. Rapidly aggressive cases can double in as little as 9–10 days, but these are outliers. Doubling time is longer than many other cancers due to high cell loss from exfoliation, and it shortens as tumors advance, which is why early detection is critical for improving outcomes [^fc95c0b5].

### Natural history of gastric cancer: observational study of gastric cancer patients not treated during follow-up [^fc95c0b5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding the natural progression of untreated gastric cancer is critical for determining the disease prognosis as well as treatment options and timing. The aim of this study is to analyze the natural history of gastric cancer.

Patients and Methods

We included patients with gastric cancer who had not received any treatment and were staged using endoscopy/endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography on at least two follow-up visits during intervals of nontreatment. Tumor volumes were also measured in addition to the staging. Survival of each stage at diagnosis was also analyzed.

Results

A total of 101 patients were included. The mean follow-up period was 35.1 ± 34.4 months. The gastric cancer doubling time was 11.8 months for T1 and 6.2 months for T4. The progression time from early gastric cancer to advanced gastric cancer was 34 months. It decreased as the stages advanced: from 34 months between tumor-nodes-metastasis stage I and II to 1.8 months between stage III and IV. No variable was identified as a risk factor for cancer progression. The 5-year survival rates of untreated patients were 46.2% in stage I and 0% in stage II, stage III, and stage IV.

Conclusions

The progression and doubling times of gastric cancer shorten as the stages advance. Objective data reported in this study can be a critical factor in determining treatment timing and screening interval.

### Gastric cancer presenting with extremely rapid growth: unprecedented morphologic change in a short time and endoscopic estimation of its doubling time [^2ce5bf14]. Endoscopy (2000). Low credibility.

We encountered a case of gastric cancer that was initially detected as a deep hemorrhagic ulcer without surrounding irregular elevation, followed by rapid protrusion in less than 1 month. Using endoscopic images in the follow-up study, we estimated the doubling time (DT) of this unusual tumor as 9.2 days. Since the doubling time of gastric cancer is generally fairly long due to exfoliation of many cancer cells into the gastric lumen, this cancer presented with extremely rapid growth. Besides, this case reinforces that follow-up study is important in terms of clinical management of ulcerative lesions.

### The current and future incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in 185 countries, 2020–40: a population-based modelling study [^c3a127e2]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, despite declining trends, gastric cancer remains an important cause of cancer mortality contributing to 8% of all cancer-related deaths in 2020. Whilst screening strategies are important for early detection in high-risk populations, the reduction in prevalence of H. pylori infection as well as the reduction in other known risk factors is key to prevention of gastric cancer. Surveillance of trends in younger adults is needed to monitor if increases in incidence are set to continue for this group. It is important that research and government initiatives focus their efforts on preventive measures that could modify the prevalence of risk factors for long-term public health benefits.

### A case of lung metastasis from gastric cancer presenting as ground-glass opacity dominant nodules [^768cee02]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In this case, the tumor volume-doubling time of the nodule in S6 was 259 days. In previous reports, the median tumor volume-doubling time of GGO in primary lung cancer was reported 400–1800 days, and the nodule in the S6 segment in our case grew faster than the typical GGO in primary lung cancer. Because of its unusually rapid growth and previous history of gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma, we might have considered lung metastasis of gastric cancer as a differential diagnosis.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the growth rate of GGO in lung metastases from gastric cancer. Even if the nodule is GGO-dominant on the chest CT, a metastatic lung tumor should be considered as a differential diagnosis if it is growing rapidly and the patient has a history of cancer in other organs.

### Mechanistic data-informed multiscale quantitative systems pharmacology modeling framework enables the clinical translation and efficacy assessment of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors [^f7deba70]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

CLDN18.2 is significantly expressed in pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer tissues and is associated with the onset and prognosis of cancer, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Our QSP model simulations suggested that in both cancer types, the administration of CLDN18.2-targeted CAR-T can yield promising efficacy. Recently, in multicenter open-label phase I/Ib trials (NCT03874897, NCT04581473) conducted using a CLDN18.2-targeted CAR-T therapy CT041, the objective response rate in patients with gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer was reported to be 54.9%, which is generally higher than that reported in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our model sensitivity analyses revealed that the CLDN18.2 antigen density in patients with pancreatic cancer may be particularly influential in determining the anticancer CAR-T response. According to the Human Protein Atlas database, the expression of claudin family proteins (including CLDN18) in the human pancreas is generally lower than that in the gastrointestinal tract, which partly explains the relatively reduced clinical efficacy of CLDN18.2-targeted CAR-T therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. Another potential explanation is that, compared with gastric cancer cells, pancreatic cancer cells may exhibit more rapid proliferation and migration. For example, the experimentally measured doubling time of PANC-1 (a widely used pancreatic cancer cell line) is approximately 21 hours, while the doubling time for the gastric cancer cell line SNU-16 is significantly longer (29.9 hours). Other factors, such as the barrier-like dense stroma resulting from the desmoplastic reactions commonly observed in pancreatic cancer, may lead to reduced CAR-T tissue penetration and thus decreased efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

### Global burden of gastric cancer: epidemiological trends, risk factors, screening and prevention [^01f068d4]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The temporal trends for this malignancy, however, are dynamic, and reports from the past decade indicate important declines in some regions and demographic groups, as well as a few notable exceptions in which gastric cancer rates are either stable or increasing. Two main anatomical subtypes of gastric cancer exist, non-cardia and cardia, with different temporal trends and risk factors (such as obesity and reflux for cardia gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection for non-cardia gastric cancer). Shifts in the distribution of anatomical locations have been detected in several high-incidence regions. H. pylori is an important aetiological factor for gastric cancer; importantly, the anticipated long-term findings from studies examining the effect of H. pylori eradication on the risk of (re)developing gastric cancer have emerged in the past few years. In this Review, we highlight the latest trends in incidence and mortality using an evidence-based approach. We make the best possible inferences, including clinical and public health inference, on the basis of the quality of the evidence available, and highlight burning questions as well as gaps in knowledge and public health practice that need to be addressed to reduce gastric cancer burden worldwide.

### Impact of tumor progression on cancer incidence curves [^1d219182]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer arises through a multistage process, but it is not fully clear how this process influences the age-specific incidence curve. Studies of colorectal and pancreatic cancer using the multistage clonal expansion (MSCE) model have identified two phases of the incidence curves. One phase is linear, beginning about age of 60 years, suggesting that at least two rare rate-limiting mutations occur before clonal expansion of premalignant cells. A second phase is exponential, seen in early-onset cancers occurring before the age of 60 years that are associated with premalignant clonal expansion. Here, we extend the MSCE model to include clonal expansion of malignant cells, an advance that permits study of the effects of tumor growth and extinction on the incidence of colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal adenocarcinomas in the digestive tract. After adjusting the age-specific incidence for birth-cohort and calendar-year trends, we found that initiating mutations and premalignant cell kinetics can explain the primary features of the incidence curve. However, we also found that the incidence data of these cancers harbored information on the kinetics of malignant clonal expansion before clinical detection, including tumor growth rates and extinction probabilities on three characteristic time scales for tumor progression. In addition, the data harbored information on the mean sojourn times for premalignant clones until occurrence of either the first malignant cell or the first persistent (surviving) malignant clone. Finally, the data also harbored information on the mean sojourn time of persistent malignant clones to the time of diagnosis. In conclusion, cancer incidence curves can harbor significant information about hidden processes of tumor initiation, premalignant clonal expansion, and malignant transformation, and even some limited information on tumor growth before clinical detection.

### Gastrointestinal cancer stage at diagnosis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan [^ab89116d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

For colorectal cancer, there was a significant increase in the number of stage III cases. However, stage II colorectal cancer was significantly reduced, and stage II to IV colorectal cancer increased only slightly. Specifically, there is a possibility that stage II progressed to stage III because of the diagnosis delay related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Colorectal cancer is generally recognized as a slow-growing cancer, with prolonged times to doubling and progression, and years are typically needed for adenomas to become cancerous. However, the rate of progression is less clear for more advanced colorectal cancer. Several studies, including 2 systematic reviews, have evaluated the intervals from diagnosis to surgery and then to death. Among patients with colon cancer, overall survival decreases when the time from diagnosis to surgery exceeds 30 to 40 days, and overall survival among patients with rectal cancer decreases when the time from the end of neoadjuvant therapy to surgery exceeds 7 to 8 weeks. Other systematic reviews have also indicated that overall survival decreases when the time to surgery exceeds 12 weeks. Thus, 6 to 12 weeks may be a sufficient interval for colorectal cancer to progress, which would support our findings, as many Japanese patients would have had their colonoscopy delayed by more than 6 to 12 weeks because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gastric cancer has a poorer 5-year survival rate than colorectal cancer and is thought to progress more rapidly. The number of patients with stage IV gastric cancer increased by 11.36%, but there was no significant difference between the pre–COVID-19 period and the COVID-19 period, and unlike colorectal cancer, there was no increase in patients with stage III gastric cancer. This may be related to the fact that while the number of individuals with colorectal cancer is on the rise in Japan, the number of individuals with gastric cancer is on the decline due to the positive progress in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Additionally, gastric cancer is often found at stage IV instead of earlier because of the lack of subjective symptoms and a simple screening method, such as the fecal occult blood test. In this study, before COVID-19, patients with stage II gastric cancer made up only approximately one-third of those with stage II colorectal cancer. Therefore, it is highly possible that this study does not reflect the progression of gastric cancer.

### Stomach (gastric) cancer prevention (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^8544e753]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The pooled odds ratios for gastric cancer were 18. 56 for studies with matched pairs design and
3. 31 for studies with nonmatched pairs design. Magnitude of Effect: A systematic review and meta-analysis showed a 60% increase in gastric cancer in male smokers and a 20% increase in gastric cancer in female smokers compared with nonsmokers. Study Design: Evidence obtained from case-control and cohort studies. Internal Validity: Good. Consistency: Good. External Validity: Good. H. pylori infection eradication. In the initial report from a randomized clinical trial, 3, 365 participants were followed in an intention-to-treat analysis.

Short-term treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole was associated with a 39% reduction in gastric cancer incidence during a period of 15 years after randomization. With follow-up to 22 years, there was a reduction in both incidence and mortality. A single-center randomized clinical trial in China included a total of 1, 676 participants who were at higher risk of developing gastric cancer because they had a first-degree relative with gastric cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin or placebo for 7 days. After 9. 2 years, this treatment regimen resulted in a reduction in gastric cancer, from
2. 7% in the placebo group to 1. 2% in the treatment group, with a hazard ratio of 0.
45. No reduction in gastric cancer mortality was found, but the power to detect any difference was low.

A randomized controlled trial of 3, 365 participants from a nutritionally deprived population showed that short-term treatment with amoxicillin and omeprazole reduced the incidence of gastric cancer by 39% during a period of 15 years following randomization. With follow-up to 22 years.

### Inferring replication timing and proliferation dynamics from single-cell DNA sequencing data [^e717509e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

SPE approximates proliferative fitness in stable genomes

After deep exploration of replication timing with PERT, we investigated whether the proportion of S-phase cells in genetic clones could accurately approximate their proliferative fitness. Experimental attempts to approximate clone proliferation rates through cell cycle distributions have been limited due to the fact that FACS isolation of S-phase cells is challenging for solid tumors with subclonal CNAs. Unbiased scRNA-seq is capable of estimating cell cycle phase distributions through the use of cell cycle marker genes; however, these distributions can only be mapped onto genetic clones when there are many arm-level CNAs that differentiate the clones –. To determine whether S-phase cells can be used to approximate proliferative fitness in genetically stable cancer and epithelial cell lines, we ran PERT on gastric cancer cell lines with co-registered doubling times and performed time-series analysis of the aforementioned hTERT WT data. The gastric cancer data consisted of 3 unique cell lines with co-registered doubling times, 10X scWGS, and 10X scRNA measurements. Encouragingly, high PERT G1/2-phase fractions correlated with high doubling times and high scRNA G1-phase fractions (Fig. S9 a–c, Supplementary Data 2). Interestingly, the scWGS-defined cell cycle fractions had higher correlation with doubling time (r = 1.00, p = 3.3×10⁻³) than the scRNA-defined cell cycle fractions (r = 0.88, p = 3.1×10⁻¹), suggesting that direct measurement of DNA replication in scWGS might be a better proxy measurement for the proliferation rate than expression of cell cycle marker genes in scRNA (Fig. S9 a–c). To assess the relationship between S-phase enrichment and fitness in time-series data, we used the relative abundance of each clone within each cell cycle phase to compute continuous S-phase enrichment (SPE) scores for each clone (c) × timepoint (t) and compared these scores to the clone's corresponding change in abundance between timepoints t and t + 1 (Fig. 6 a–d, Methods). It was critically important to use clone × timepoint SPE scores instead of the raw S-phase fraction for this data as technical variation between different timepoints (i.e. cell confluence at time of sequencing, sample handling) could lead to dramatically different S-phase fractions. In the hTERT WT data, we found that SPE scores had a positive trend with expansion (r = 0.51, p = 2.5×10⁻¹, Fig. S9 d, e), indicating that more S-phase cells corresponded to faster proliferation in normal epithelial cells. These results suggested that quantifying the number of S-phase cells in a particular clone serves as an appropriate proxy for fitness when there is limited genomic instability.

### Inferring replication timing and proliferation dynamics from single-cell DNA sequencing data [^ea3fa55a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gastric cancer cell line data

10X Chromium single-cell DNA (10X scWGS) data of gastric cancer cell lines NCI-N87, HGC-27, and SNU-668 were downloaded from SRA (PRJNA498809). CN calling was performed using the CellRanger-DNA pipeline using default parameters. Data was aggregated from 20kb to 500kb bins for analysis with PERT. Each cell line's doubling time and fraction of G1-phase scRNA cells were extracted from Andor et al. PERT output for these sames is shown in Supplementary Data 2.

### The time to eradicate gastric cancer is now [^d256d8f4]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Worldwide gastric cancer remains one of the most common cancers, killing upwards of one million people each year. While the molecular pathogenesis remains unclear, infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is considered a "necessary but not sufficient" cause, not surprisingly as gastric cancer has long been known to be associated with atrophic gastritis. Eradication of H pylori is expected to virtually eliminate gastric cancer and H pylori associated peptic ulcer within approximately 40 years and thus reduce overall mortality. In the USA, the incidence of gastric cancer in the general population is low, reflecting the change in the pattern of gastritis from atrophic to non-atrophic and in the low and decreasing prevalence of H pylori infection in the middle and upper classes. However, the plan for eradication of this important pathogen must be considered within the context of the prevalence and outcome within specific populations.

### The current and future incidence and mortality of gastric cancer in 185 countries, 2020–40: a population-based modelling study [^9c544e77]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognosis of gastric cancer remains poor in most world regions, shown by the close correlation between incidence and mortality. The vast majority of gastric cancer cases present at late disease stage i.e. regional and distant disease in high-income countries. While the balance between benefits, harms and costs of routine screening in low-risk populations is still unclear, the implementation of population-based screening in high-risk regions has shown some promise. Studies have also shown that screening in high-risk sub-populations, e.g. certain race or ethnic groups in low-risk countries could be cost-effective. Two of the countries with the highest incidence rates globally, yet considerably lower mortality are Japan and the Republic of Korea. In 1953, gastric cancer screening using an indirect X-ray truck was started in Japan, and the number of people receiving screening increased rapidly with introduction of the Health Care Law for the Elderly in 1982. The introduction of national screening programmes in 2016 in Japan and 2002 in the Republic of Korea using either upper gastrointestinal series or endoscopy for men and women ≥ 40 years have demonstrated a shift in stage at diagnosis and relatively high survival proportions of over 60%. It is yet to be confirmed whether this will translate into true mortality reductions and how much of these survival increases are attributable to lead time and detection bias. Furthermore, recent improvements in diagnostic techniques through endoscopic imaging such as the Gastrointestinal Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis System (GRAIDS) show promise for improving the effectiveness of diagnosing gastric cancer, even in less experienced and low volume hospitals. In high-risk populations, eradication of H. pylori, is considered in combination with pepsinogen screening for gastric cancer. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy is currently being explored in several ongoing randomized controlled trials. Finally, other non-invasive markers, such as microRNA, for detection of precancerous lesions are being investigated with further validation studies needed. Despite some high-incidence countries like Japan showing low mortality rates, most high-incidence countries (such as Mongolia) continue to have high gastric cancer mortality, highlighting the need for more focus on preventive cancer control measures. Further to prevention strategies, socioeconomic disparities in the risk of gastric cancer has been reported suggesting higher incidence among low socioeconomic populations possibly due to dietary habits, obesity and smoking in this group. Disparities have also been reported elsewhere, for example Alaskan Native people had a higher incidence rate, poorer survival and younger age at diagnosis compared to Non-Hispanic people. This suggests that if the gap between socioeconomic status (SES) were to be reduced then the prevalence of SES-related risk factors would also be reduced which could ultimately impact national incidence of gastric cancer.

### Impact of straight to test pathways on time to diagnosis in oesophageal and gastric cancer [^e2b64da2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer survival in the UK has doubled in the last 40 years; however, 1-year and 5-year survival rates are still lower than other countries. One cause may be a delay between referral into secondary care and subsequent investigation. We set out to evaluate the impact of a straight to test pathway (STTP) on time to diagnosis for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer.

Methods

Six hospital Trusts across the East Midlands Clinical Network introduced a STTP enabling general practitioners to refer patients with suspected UGI cancer (oesophageal/gastric) for immediate investigation, without the need to see a hospital specialist first. Data were collected for all patients referred between 2013 and 2015 with suspected UGI cancer and stratified by STTP or traditional referral pathway. Overall time from referral to diagnosis was compared. Data from two Trusts who did not implement STTP acted as control.

Results

340 patients followed the STTP pathway and 495 followed the traditional route. STTP saved a mean of 7 days from referral to treatment (with a 95% CI of 3 to 11 days, p < 0.008) and a mean of 16 days from referral to diagnosis, when compared with a traditional referral pathway. The number of diagnostic tests performed using STTP or traditional referral pathways were similar.

Conclusion

A STTP is associated with an overall reduction of 1 week from referral to treatment for UGI cancer. The approach is feasible and did not require more resource. Larger studies are required to assess whether this time saving translates into improved cancer outcomes.

### Gastric cancer as preventable disease [^109ad180]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastric cancer, 1 of the 5 most common causes of cancer death, is associated with a 5-year overall survival rate less than 30%. A minority of cancers occurs as part of syndromic diseases; more than 90% of adenocarcinomas are considered as the ultimate consequence of a longstanding mucosal inflammation. Helicobacter pylori infection is the leading etiology of non-self-limiting gastritis, which may result in atrophy of the gastric mucosa and impaired acid secretion. Gastric atrophy establishes a field of cancerization prone to further molecular and phenotypic changes, possibly resulting in cancer growth. This well-understood natural history provides the clinicopathologic rationale for primary and secondary cancer prevention strategies. A large body of evidence demonstrates that combined primary (H pylori eradication) and secondary (mainly endoscopy) prevention efforts may prevent or limit the progression of gastric oncogenesis. This approach, which is tailored to different country-specific gastric cancer incidence, socioeconomic, and cultural factors, requires that the complementary competences of gastroenterologists, oncologists, and pathologists be amalgamated into a common strategy of health policy.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^a5b62143]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Survivorship in gastric cancer — screening and management of long-term sequelae are important, but due to a lack of large randomized trials the Panel's recommendations are based on smaller studies, clinical experience, and other consensus recommendations and guidelines; survivorship care planning should include appropriate timing of transfer of care to a primary care physician and maintenance of a therapeutic relationship, with clearly delineated roles between oncology and primary care, and routine gastric cancer-specific surveillance is not recommended for more than 5 years.

### Increased incidence of adenocarcinomas at the gastro-oesophageal junction in Dutch males since the 1990s [^25da6139]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide population-based studies suggest that the incidence of oesophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas has increased since the 1970s.

Objective and Methods

We studied time trends in mortality and incidence rates of oesophageal and gastric carcinomas according to subsite and histology in the south-east Netherlands since 1978.

Results

The age-adjusted mortality and incidence rates for oesophageal cancer doubled in males over the entire 19-year study period from 2.7 to 5.6 and from 2.4 to 4.8 per 100,000 person years, respectively. In females, a similar trend for the mortality and incidence rates was seen, but at a lower level. The age-adjusted mortality and incidence rates for gastric cancer decreased with time from 20.7 to 12.8 and from 21.6 to 15.9 per 100,000 person years in males, respectively. In females, age-adjusted mortality and incidence rates for gastric cancer also decreased. Analysis of incidence rates by subsite and subtype showed an increase in adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus and gastric cardia, largely restricted to males. In females, the rise in incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus appeared to be more marked than the rise in adenocarcinomas, whereas the incidence of gastric cardia carcinomas has remained stable over the last 10 years. Neither the decrease in the number of unspecified tumours with time, nor the increase in the use of diagnostic endoscopy and imaging techniques, is likely to explain completely the observed increases.

Conclusion

The increase in incidence of adenocarcinomas at the gastro-oesophageal junction in the south-eastern Netherlands seems, at least in part, to represent a true underlying increase that is restricted largely to males.

### Inhibition of gastric cancer by a new controlled releasing compound of TLR-7 / 8 agonist via immune activation in a gastric cancer xenograft mice model… [^22631465]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 420 Background: TLR-7/8 agonist has been suggested to be an effective immunotherapeutic agent, possible systemic side effect has forbid its clinical usage. A new controlled-releasing compound of TLR-7/8 agonist was developed to overcome the limitations, and this study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of this new compound in xenograft mouse model using cell-lines derived from triple conditional mouse which develop gastric cancer spontaneously. Methods: A cell line was established by tumor tissue in Tcon mouse which was developed by activation of Kras and suppression of E-cadherin and P53. Tcon cell line was evaluated its growth rate, sensitivity to anticancer agents and in vivo tumorigenicity. 5-FU was administered i. p in once a week and TLR-7/8 agonist was injected i. t 3 times a week. Tumor size and mouse weight were measured for drug efficacy and safety.

Immune profile of the tumor was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Results: Tcon cell-line show a rapid growth with 24 hours of doubling time, and good in vivo tumorigenicity in syngeneic mice. Cell-line showed moderate sensitivity to 5-FU and paclitaxel but resistance to oxaliplatin. Tumors in 5-FU alone group showed slight decrease in size compared with that in control group, However, TLR-7/8 agonist alone and combination significantly inhibited tumor growth. Weight loss or any significant side effect was not observed in any group. In immune profiling, TLR-7/8 mono or combination group showed increased levels of infiltrating CD4, CD8 T cells, and recruited NK cell as well as significantly increase M1/M2 ratio of macrophages compared to 5-FU alone or control group. Conclusions: A new controlled releasing system of TLR-7/8 agonist with or without 5-FU showed a excellent tumor inhibition efficacy with low toxicity in gastric cancer xenograft model.

The effect seemed to be through multiple immune activations including cell-mediated immune response, M1 macrophage polarization as well as innate NK cells.

### Tumor response predicts survival time of nivolumab monotherapy for advanced gastric cancer: a subgroup analysis of the DELIVER trial (JACCRO GC-08) [^43f7df89]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Nivolumab monotherapy is clinically effective for patients with advanced gastric cancer in routine clinical practice. No associations were found between clinical outcomes and tumor burden/tumor growth rate before nivolumab monotherapy. Increasing depth of response was associated with a longer survival time of nivolumab monotherapy at later-line setting.

### Subjective factors affecting prognosis of 469 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study of endoscopic screening [^63cd6752]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In 2020, an estimated 604,100 new cases of esophageal cancer and 544,076 deaths were reported. In 2019 in Japan, esophageal cancer was the eighth most common cancer among men and the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death, with a mortality rate of 9.4 deaths per 100,000 people. In Europe and the United States, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing and that of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is decreasing. In Japan, however, the prevalence of ESCC remains high, and approximately 90% of esophageal cancers are ESCC.

In Japan, ESCC is usually detected by upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. ESCC is an extremely malignant tumor that predominantly affects the mid to lower esophagus, and as it progresses, it causes esophageal obstruction. In the early stages of the disease, esophageal symptoms such as dysphagia may be mild. As the cancer progresses and the esophageal lumen narrows, severe dysphagia may occur. However, a detailed evaluation of the relationship between subjective symptoms and tumor progression as well as prognosis has not been performed in ESCC until now.

Although many studies have shown that age, male sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, foods containing N-nitroso compounds, hot drinks, red meat intake, and human papillomavirus are the main risk factors for ESCC, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Limited therapies are available for these patients, and their prognosis is very poor. The 5-year overall survival rate is less than 40%, and many patients die within 1 year of diagnosis despite advances in therapy. However, because the prognosis of early-stage ESCC has been shown to be very favorable, its detection at an early stage is considered to be of great clinical importance.

In Japan, there is currently no mass screening program for ESCC. This may be due to the fact that the number of patients with ESCC is relatively small compared with the number of patients with gastric, colorectal, lung, breast, and cervical cancer, for which there are organized screening programs. There is also the possibility that endoscopic screening does not improve the prognosis of ESCC because of its extremely rapid progression. The doubling time is often used as a guide to determine the rate of tumor growth. Our previous study showed that the doubling time of gastric cancer was 10.1 months, whereas that of ESCC was 3.3 months, indicating an extremely high tumor growth rate.

### Zinc-finger protein 471 suppresses gastric cancer through transcriptionally repressing downstream oncogenic PLS3 and TFAP2A [^1f43668e]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of potential prognostic factors for patients with gastric cancer

The Kaplan–Meier method was used to produce survival curves stratified by ZNF471 methylation status. High methylation level of CpG3 and 8-CpG-site median or other single CpG-site (CpG1, CpG4, and CpG7) predicted shorter survival time for gastric cancer patients (Fig. 1h, Figure S1C). After stratification by TNM stage, gastric cancer patients with high CpG3 methylation in ZNF471 promoter demonstrated significantly shorter survival in stage III/IV (P = 0.003), but not in stage I/II (Figure S1D). The prognostic value of ZNF471 methylation has also been supported by survival analysis of TCGA data (Figure S2). Taken together, hypermethylation of ZNF471 functioned as an independent marker for poor gastric cancer prognosis.

ZNF471 suppresses gastric cancer via inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest

To investigate the functional role of ZNF471 in gastric cancer, we overexpressed ZNF471 in AGS, BGC823, and MKN74. Overexpression of ZNF471 resulted in significantly reduced proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression, inhibited cell growth (Fig. 2a) as well as reduced colony formation (Fig. 2b). In contrast, knockdown of endogenous ZNF471 in GES1 and MKN1 cells by siRNA or shRNA increased cell viability (Fig. 2c) and colony formation abilities (Fig. 2d). Consistent with cell viability assay, overexpression of ZNF471 prolonged cell doubling time, while knockdown of ZNF471 shortened cell doubling time (Figure S3).

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b08493a3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Gastric cancer — epidemiology and histologic patterns are characterized by a substantial global burden, with more than 968,000 new cases and approximately 660,000 deaths in 2022, ranking as the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and showing a 15- to 20-fold difference between high- and low-incidence regions; highest incidence occurs in Northeast Asia, South and Central America, and Eastern Europe. In the United States, based on SEER data for 2024, gastric cancer is the 15th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the 15th leading cause of cancer-related death, and for 2025 an estimated 30,300 people will be diagnosed and 10,780 people are expected to die. Over 95% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas classified by anatomic location (cardia/proximal or non-cardia/distal) and histologic type (diffuse or intestinal). The diffuse type is more prevalent in low-risk areas and is mostly associated with heritable genetic abnormalities, whereas the intestinal type occurs more frequently in high-risk areas, accounts for most of the geographic variation, and is often related to environmental factors such as H. pylori infection, tobacco smoking, high salt intake, and other dietary factors; heavy alcohol use shows a positive association with gastric cancer, while light or moderate alcohol consumption shows no appreciable association. In North America and Western Europe, there has been a marked decline in intestinal type gastric cancers of the distal stomach over the past several decades, whereas incidence rates of diffuse type gastric cancer of the proximal stomach are rising. In Japan and South Korea, population screening is performed widely with early detection often resulting in improved outcomes, while in the United States survival rates remain poor as early detection continues to pose a major challenge.

### Incidence of gastric cancer among patients with gastric precancerous lesions: observational cohort study in a low risk Western population [^6e353e39]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

As opposed to the previous study, our study focused on long term risks; we applied a two year lag time, during which a large peak in incidence was observed. This peak is mainly the result of selection bias — that is, the outcome has an effect on the probability of being examined and thus recruited. Therefore, most of the gastric cancers diagnosed in the first two years were likely present — and overlooked — at the initial investigation or were in such an imminent precancerous stage that they were already symptomatic. Although dysplasia, and particularly severe dysplasia, is a powerful signal that a gastric cancer may be present (and should heighten clinical observation and prompt repeated endoscopy) the concentration of cases in the first two years may blur assessments of the long term prognosis. After two years the peak was passed, so our present data do not include the initially overlooked prevalent cases. This is probably the principal reason for the discrepancy between studies for excess incidence of gastric cancer after a diagnosis of dysplasia (less advanced lesions were much less indicative of a prevalent cancer). None the less, throughout the 15–20 years of follow-up, during which we had sufficient power to monitor the long term progression, patients with dysplasia remained at substantially increased risk. Whether this increase merits institution of scheduled surveillance programmes and, if so, how often and in which ages, must be subject to careful cost-benefit deliberations. Such analysis should ideally provide estimated costs; number of cases of gastric cancer diagnosed and deaths prevented; life years, or quality adjusted life years gained, or both; and incremental cost effectiveness ratio, in association with different screening strategies defined by a combination of, for example, starting age, screening frequency, and risk stratums.

### Efficacy and safety of trifluridine / tipiracil in patients with metastatic gastric cancer and gastrectomy… [^0bb2c215]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients were randomized 2: 1 to receive oral FTD/TPI 35 mg/m² twice daily or placebo twice daily with best supportive care on days 1 through 5 and days 8 through 12 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was overall survival. This subgroup analysis was conducted to examine potential trends and was not powered for statistical significance. Efficacy and safety end points were evaluated in the subgroups. Survival outcomes are poor for patients with metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer, with a median survival time of 3 to 5 months without chemotherapy. 1, 2 Chemotherapy extends median overall survival by nearly 7 months, 2, 3 but ultimately the disease becomes refractory to chemotherapy, and all patients experience disease progression after first-line treatment. 4–6 Duration of response to second-line treatment is short, 4–6 and there are few options for third- and later-line therapy.

In both gastrectomy subgroups, ECOG performance status was maintained longer with FTD/TPI treatment compared with placebo. For the median time to deterioration of ECOG performance status to 2 or higher in the FTD/TPI group vs placebo group, the HR was 0. 63 in the gastrectomy subgroup and
0. 74 in the no gastrectomy subgroup. The higher frequency of dose modifications in the gastrectomy subgroup was primarily because of hematologic AEs. Exposure to FTD/TPI was similar in the gastrectomy and no gastrectomy subgroups. Mean dose intensity was 145 mg/m² per week for patients in the gastrectomy subgroup and 151 mg/m² per week for patients in the no gastrectomy subgroup. Mean treatment duration was 12. 7 and
11. 6 weeks in the respective groups.

### LUM as a novel prognostic marker and its correlation with immune infiltration in gastric cancer: a study based on immunohistochemical analysis and bioinformatics [^245007fa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

GC is notorious for its ability to metastasize to regional lymph nodes, the lungs, the liver, and the peritoneal cavity, all of which always contribute to a poor patient's prognosis. Although there have been considerable developments in the molecular basis, diagnosis, and treatment of GC, most of the patients when being diagnosed have already reached the advanced stage. Exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of GC development is tremendously valuable and important for identifying new potential therapeutic targets and thus further improving the prognosis of GC.

This study combined GEO and TCGA data and showed that the levels of expression of ITGB1, LUM, and COL5A2 were considerably upregulated in both early and advanced GC tissues and correlated with a shorter survival time in GC patients. Furthermore, pathologic stage analysis revealed that when the LUM and COL5A2 genes were overexpressed, the pathologic stage of GC patients was relatively high. Numerous studies have depicted these core genes as having carcinogenic properties or acting as potential cancer surveillance biomarkers. Xu et al. found that ITGB1 acts as a cancer gene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, contributing to apoptosis reduction and promoting cell migration and invasion by activating the FAK-Rac1 pathway. Through bioinformatics analysis of RNA sequencing data, Iwatate et al. discovered that ITGB1 is linked to pancreatic cancer metastasis, progression, and prognosis. Yang et al. found that suppressing LUM increased the cell-doubling time and resulted in the suppression of cell growth in lung cancer cell lines. Zang et al. identified over-expression of LUM as a potential novel target for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Ding et al. found that increased COL5A2 expression is strongly linked to poor prognosis and renal tumor metastasis in GC patients. Zeng et al. found that COL5A2 may predict poor clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients, and its increased production is significantly linked to a lower survival rate. All these reports, together with this research, strongly suggest that ITGB1, LUM, and COL5A2 are linked to GC progression.

### Inferring replication timing and proliferation dynamics from single-cell DNA sequencing data [^57d8c8eb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantification of clone-specific SPE scores across various datasets enabled us to investigate the relationship between cell cycle dynamics and proliferative fitness. We found a strong positive correlation between SPE and proliferative fitness in genomically stable hTERT WT epithelial cells and gastric cancer cell lines. However, a similar correlation was not present in the genomically unstable TP53 −/− hTERTs and untreated TNBC PDXs. Two confounders may explain the lack of correlation. First, death rate, which SPE does not measure, may be variable across the clones from the genomically unstable samples. Without measuring the death rate, we are left with an incomplete picture of fitness, since fitness should be viewed as a composite of birth minus death rates. Second, high SPE scores are unable to distinguish between two scenarios: an increased birth rate and a longer time to complete S-phase. The duration of S-phase can be variable, especially in the context of replication stress. Future attempts to predict fitness would benefit from measuring both cell death and replication stress rates of individual clones – especially in the context of genomically unstable cancers which are prone to high clone-to-clone variation of these properties. In spite of these potential confounders, we still observed a negative correlation between SPE and fitness in cisplatin-treated TNBC PDXs. High SPE should correspond to high chemosensitivity regardless of whether higher birth rate or longer S-phase is the underlying reason behind high SPE because S-phase cells themselves are the target of platinum chemotherapies and a result of their toxicity. Our data suggests that SPE may serve as an informative biomarker for identifying treatment-resistant clones in patients receiving neoadjuvant cisplatin. Viewing the depletion of S-phase cells in highly fit WGD clones with these confounders in mind also enables us to deduce that WGD confers high fitness by reducing death rate, likely via enhanced buffering of deleterious mutations, implying that WGD cells perform slower but more robust cell division.

### ASO author reflections: survival trends in gastric adenocarcinoma [^b0cc8a38]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Past

Gastric cancer (mainly adenocarcinoma) is common and has a poor prognosis. By causing approximately 834,000 deaths annually, it is presently the third most common cancer-related death globally. Surgery is the mainstay in the curative treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma, and for locally advanced disease, perioperative chemotherapy is usually added to surgery. Gastric adenocarcinoma often is subclassified anatomically into noncardia ("distal") or cardia ("proximal") location because of the major differences in risk factor profiles and incidence trends of these locations. The prognosis in noncardia adenocarcinoma is generally better than that in cardia adenocarcinoma, but a declining survival for noncardia adenocarcinoma and an increasing survival for cardia adenocarcinoma has recently been observed. This study was designed to assess changes in survival in gastric adenocarcinoma over time by assessing overall survival, survival in patients selected for surgery, and in those who do not undergo surgery. This is important for evaluating potential changes in the detection and treatment of this tumor.

### Delayed versus immediate start of chemotherapy in asymptomatic patients with advanced cancer: a meta-analysis [^f6d08087]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis on the optimal timing of palliative chemotherapy in 919 asymptomatic patients with advanced cancer from 4 RCTs and 1 retrospective cohort study (ie, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer) showed no statistically significant difference between immediate and delayed treatment in terms of OS. QOL was evaluated in 3 out of 5 studies and suggested a better QOL of patients in the delayed treatment group.

Only one other (previously performed) systematic review assessed the timing of start of chemotherapy in asymptomatic patients with advanced cancer. This 2018 review focused on patients with colorectal cancer only, and included 3 RCTs, which are also included in our analysis. Compared to this previous review, our study included almost a doubled number of patients, as one retrospective study on gastric cancer (n = 39) and an RCT on ovarian cancer (n = 264), were also included. Pooled survival outcomes in both studies are comparable (previous review,(n = 175) HR 1.17, 95% CI, 0.93–1.46; current study, (n = 452): HR 1.05, 95% CI, 0.90–1.22). It is somewhat concerning that only 2 additional studies have been published on this topic since the previous review. This illustrates the limited evidence available. On the contrary, for other types of systemic treatment, such as immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy, more studies on timing of treatment of asymptomatic advanced cancer have been performed. In patients with asymptomatic metastatic renal cell cancer, 3 studies indicate a positive role of delayed treatment with immunotherapy or targeted therapy in terms of safety, OS, and progression-free survival. In addition, a review including 8 studies with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer showed a nonsignificant trend in favor of early hormonal treatment in terms of OS (HR 1.23, 95% CI, 0.88–1.71).

### Human gastric cancer modelling using organoids [^f31a20d5]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Human gastric cancer organoid culture

Tissue with histologically diagnosed gastric or oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma was obtained from surgical resection specimens (figure 1A). Cultures were initiated using the same organoid medium as for normal stomach tissue. To increase successful initiation of organoid cultures and minimise the advent of carrying along normal gastric glands, the tissue digestion method and time as well as processing of isolated tumour patches was optimised (described in the online supplementary methods). Overall, 20 gastric cancer organoid cultures could be initiated. We selected four organoid lines for further analyses based on their high growth rate with a splitting ratio of 1:2/1:3 twice a week. These organoid lines showed divergent morphological phenotypes, indicating different molecular genotypes (figure 1B). DD107 (originating from a corpus carcinoma) had a cystic structure with a thickened epithelium. DD109 (AEG I) demonstrated a non-coherent grape-like growth pattern. DD191 (AEG II) and DD282 (antrum carcinoma) had a compact morphology with no lumen, with DD282 being extremely resistant to dissociation. Normal gastric organoids (DD320N, DD379N, DD392N, DD399N) present a single layered epithelium and cyst-like structure. All organoid lines were continuously in culture for over 1 year without a change in growth behaviour or morphological phenotype. Also, freeze and thaw cycles did not affect or change these growth characteristics (data not shown). Gastric cancer organoids proliferated at different rates, but all with a higher percentage than normal organoids (figure 1C). In order to characterise growth factor dependency, we omitted one by one each relevant media compound for normal organoid growth (figure 1D). Overall, response differed markedly between organoid lines. Normal organoids did grow long term only in complete medium. Omission of A38-01, Fgf10 and Wnt was without phenotypical impact on the cancer lines. Noggin, Egf and the combination of Wnt plus Rspondin were important to varying degrees. Plating of organoids in 2D in plastic flasks led to an attachment of cells, but further passaging either by mechanical dissociation or enzymatic digestion was not possible (data not shown). In a xenograft transplantation experiment cancer organoid lines were subcutaneously injected on the hind legs of mice. Tumour growth was observed for all organoid lines in each mouse (figure 1E). Human origin of xenografts was proven by antinucleoli staining (online supplementary figure 1). The organoid line showing the lowest in vitro proliferation rate (DD191) also showed the slowest in vivo growth.

### Long-term course of gastric submucosal tumors: growth speed and size-increasing factors [^65551cea]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs) are treated or monitored according to GI stromal tumor guidelines, but the adequacy of the guidelines has not been thoroughly examined. We investigated the long-term course of gastric SMTs to determine the validity of guideline-based follow-up methods and the factors contributing to their size increase.

Methods

This study included gastric SMTs diagnosed as GI mesenchymal tumors (GIMTs) by using EUS and followed up with EUS. The percentage and speed of GIMT enlargement and factors associated with the enlargement were investigated by using the Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

From January 1994 to May 2022, a total of 925 gastric SMTs were evaluated with EGD, and 231 SMTs were diagnosed as GIMTs. Of the 231 GIMTs, 145 were examined by EUS more than twice and were followed up for > 6 months. The mean ± standard deviation follow-up period was 5.20 ± 4.04 years (range, 0.5–17.3 years), with 39 (26.9%) of 145 GIMTs increasing in size with a mean doubling time of 3.60 ± 3.37 years. A multivariate analysis of factors influencing tumor growth revealed that irregular extraluminal borders were an increasing factor (hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–10.52), initial tumor size ≤ 9.5 mm (hazard ratio, .23; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.77) was a nonincreasing factor, and GIMTs with calcification (n = 13) did not increase in size.

Conclusions

Tumor growth in gastric GIMTs < 9.5 mm in diameter and/or with calcification is rare. Follow-up intervals for these lesions could be extended.

### Decision model analyses of upper endoscopy for gastric cancer screening and preneoplasia surveillance: a systematic review [^394a7c0c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, systematic screening and surveillance strategies are paramount to reducing GC morbidity, mortality, and societal costs given that early detection is directly associated with improved mortality and even the opportunity for cure. For populations in which screening and surveillance do not routinely occur, GC is most often diagnosed at an advanced stage when symptoms present and there are limited if any therapeutic options, none of which are curative. Because of logistical difficulties in conducting direct comparative clinical studies, decision analyses offer a unique mechanism for both clinicians and health policy makers to model and explore costs and outcomes of various GC reduction strategies efficiently with essentially real-time evaluation of how altering certain parameters might affect the predicted outputs. Moving forward, high-quality decision analyses might best serve high incidence but resource limited countries in order to inform resource allocation and motivate discovery into lower cost interventions, as well as low-to-intermediate incidence countries in order to better define the high-risk subgroups who might benefit most from GC screening and preneoplasia surveillance.

### Incidence, stage, treatment, and survival of noncardia gastric cancer [^53efd9d5]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, and investigating its incidence, characteristics, treatment, and outcomes over the past decades can help in selecting clinical strategies and future research directions.

Objective

To analyze the trends in incidence, staging, and treatment of gastric cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide, population-based cohort study included patients diagnosed with noncardia gastric cancer (NCGC) between 1989 and 2021 in the Netherlands.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Differences in tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival were analyzed per fixed time periods (1989–1993, 1994–1998, 1999–2003, 2004–2008, 2009–2013, 2014–2018, and 2019–2021).

Results

In total, 47 014 patients (median [IQR] age, 73 [64–80] years; 28 032 [60%] male patients) were identified with mostly adenocarcinomas of the antrum region (when location was known). Age-standardized incidence decreased from 20.3 to 6.1 per 100 000 person-years between 1989 and 2021. During the study period, unknown T and N stages were recorded less frequently, and metastatic disease was diagnosed more frequently (1989–1993: 2633 of 9493 patients [28%]; 2019–2021: 1503 of 3200 patients [47%] in 2019–2021). Over time, fewer patients with metastatic disease underwent surgery with or without other treatment modalities (68% in 1989–1993 vs 64% in 2019–2021), and palliative chemotherapy in metastatic NCGC increased from 9% to 40%. For patients with nonmetastatic disease, 5-year relative survival improved from 28% (95% CI, 26.5%-29.2%) to 36% (95% CI, 33.5%-37.6%) between 1989 and 2021. For patients with nonmetastatic disease undergoing a resection, 5-year survival increased from 40% (95% CI, 38.3%-41.8%) to 51% (95% CI, 47.9%-53.3%). For patients with metastatic disease, 1-year relative survival increased from 10% (95% CI, 8.7%-11.1%) to 19% (95% CI, 17.2%-21.6%), but 3-year relative survival remained poor at 5% (95% CI, 3.6%-7.5%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this nationwide cohort study involving 47 014 patients diagnosed with NCGC (1989–2021), the results showed a decrease in incidence, more accurate staging, a shift in treatment modalities, and improved patient survival.

### Recent US gastric cancer prevention recommendations: advances, unanswered questions, and the need for a unified approach [^a3c54809]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

What Constitutes High Risk?

Both recommendations highlight similar characteristics to select high-risk populations for screening (Table 1). However, neither set of recommendations clarify at what specific risk threshold these benefits become greater than the harms. This is critical, given the substantial variation in risk levels within the defined high-risk groups. For example, Korean American individuals (with an incidence of 49.0 per 100,000) and non-Hispanic Black individuals (11.2 per 100,000) both fall into the high-risk category but have a nearly five-fold risk-difference. Additionally, development of risk calculators incorporating factors beyond race could help identify more specific groups at even higher risk. While our commentary focuses on US-based guidelines, a previous review of endoscopy guidelines also demonstrated scope for global harmonization on which populations merit index endoscopic screening.

Differences in GC risk among potential screening populations have major implications for the balance between benefits and harms. The AGA CPU makes an elegant comparison between GC and CRC incidence to suggest that GC risk in some demographic groups may be comparable to CRC, for which screening is widely accepted. While this comparison is informative, a detailed quantification of the benefits (such as the prevented GC mortality) and harms (such as the number of required tests) for populations with varying risk levels would be valuable. Such studies could clarify the point at which the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.

In addition to identifying characteristics that define high-risk populations for screening, the ACG clinical guideline on premalignant lesions and the AGA CPU also outline precursor lesions that warrant surveillance. These are based on the extent and histologic subtype, as also specified in previous practice updates. Just as defining a risk threshold is important for screening initiation, further guidance is needed on the exact risk-stratification algorithm and interval for surveillance. Cohort studies tracking the yield of endoscopic surveillance of patients with premalignancies, along with modeling studies, could facilitate a favorable balance between harms and benefits.

### Controlling gastric cancer in a world of heterogeneous risk [^0a3e4489]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of global mortality but also a cancer whose footprint is highly unequal. This review aims to define global disease epidemiology, critically appraise strategies of prevention and disease attenuation, and assess how these strategies could be applied to improve outcomes from GC in a world of variable risk and disease burden. Strategies of primary prevention focus on improving the detection and eradication of the main environmental risk factor, Helicobacter pylori. In certain countries of high incidence, endoscopic or radiographic screening of the asymptomatic general population has been adopted as a means of secondary prevention. By contrast, identification and targeted surveillance of individuals with precancerous lesions (such as intestinal metaplasia) is being increasingly embraced in nations of low incidence. This review also highlights existing knowledge gaps in GC prevention as well as the role of emerging technologies for early detection and risk stratification.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — screening initiation age for high-risk groups indicates uncertainty about when to begin but provides reference ages and individualization criteria. The ideal age at which to initiate screening in high-risk US populations is not clear, yet 45 years may be an optimal age as it corresponds to the age for average-risk colorectal cancer screening initiation and facilitates addition of esophagogastroduodenoscopy at colonoscopy; it also mirrors screening-eligible ages in high-risk countries, including South Korea (age ≥ 40 years) and Japan (age 40–50 years). The age of screening initiation should be individualized for those with a first-degree family history of GC.

### Screening patients for gastric cancer: art and science are better together [^44b26cfc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Gastric cancer is currently the fourth most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The prevalence and mortality of gastric cancer varies among regions around the world. Age-standardized incidence rates range from 3.9 in Northern Africa to 42.4 in Eastern Asia for men and from 2.2 in Southern Africa to 18.3 in Eastern Asia for women. Moreover, in the same region, prevalence of gastric cancer is diverse among countries. Countries in Eastern Asia (including Japan, Korea, and China) have a high incidence of gastric cancer (i.e. > 40 cases per 100,000 men). By contrast, most other countries in Western and Southern Asia have a relatively low cancer incidence (i.e. < 10 cases per 100,000 men). Even in multiethnic countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, gastric cancer incidence varies among Chinese, Malay and Indian origins. These differences are explained by both host and bacterial factors. Whether gastric cancer screening, especially of the mass population, should be done remains controversial because, even in a very high-risk country such as Japan, there is only some evidence that mass screening reduces mortality from gastric cancer. Therefore, selection of high-risk populations to undergo screening is fundamental for the early detection of gastric cancer in countries with medium to low incidence.

Diagnostic tests are performed to increase the percentage or probability of a disease in a target population or an individual. Each diagnostic test has a certain sensitivity and specificity (i.e. accuracy) that improve post-test probability. However, when we consider actual outcome of the diagnostic test, not only accuracy, but also prevalence of disease i.e. pre-test probability, affect the post-test probability. Currently, endoscopy plays a pivotal role in gastric cancer screening because of its high lesion detection rate and the ability to remove biopsy specimens for histological diagnosis providing the best diagnostic performance. However, there are substantial limitations for endoscopy such as the restricted number of gastroscopies and experienced endoscopists and the potential risks of perforation, cardiopulmonary events, aspiration pneumonia, and bleeding. So when we apply endoscopy to low pre-test probability subjects, even though it has a high diagnostic accuracy, false positive rates increase considerably with constant occurrence of the complications. Traditionally, in order to avoid this situation, experienced clinicians wisely select high-risk patients for endoscopy by careful interview and physical examination. Recently, biomarkers such as the combination of serum pepsinogen and Helicobacter pylori antibody are used to identify high-risk patients for gastric cancer.

Gastric cancer (GC) epidemiology — In the United States, incidence rates are 2- to 13-fold greater in non-White individuals, particularly early-generation immigrants from regions of high GC incidence, and the US 5-year survival rate for GC is 36%. Globally, GC is the leading infection-associated cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with more than 1 million new cases and more than 768,000 related deaths in 2020. The United States is considered a low-incidence country with an age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 5.6 per 100,000 person-years and an estimated 26,890 new cases and 10,088-related deaths in 2023.

### Deterministic evolution and stringent selection during preneoplasia [^b4633670]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The earliest events during human tumour initiation, although poorly characterized, may hold clues to malignancy detection and prevention 1. Here we model occult preneoplasia by biallelic inactivation of TP53, a common early event in gastric cancer, in human gastric organoids. Causal relationships between this initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes were established using experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over 2years. TP53 loss elicited progressive aneuploidy, including copy number alterations and structural variants prevalent in gastric cancers, with evident preferred orders. Longitudinal single-cell sequencing of TP53-deficient gastric organoids similarly indicates progression towards malignant transcriptional programmes. Moreover, high-throughput lineage tracing with expressed cellular barcodes demonstrates reproducible dynamics whereby initially rare subclones with shared transcriptional programmes repeatedly attain clonal dominance. This powerful platform for experimental evolution exposes stringent selection, clonal interference and a marked degree of phenotypic convergence in premalignant epithelial organoids. These data imply predictability in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis and show evolutionary constraints and barriers to malignant transformation, with implications for earlier detection and interception of aggressive, genome-instable tumours.

In South Korea's National Cancer Screening Program, in the 10-year interval from inception the number of endoscopic screening examinations for GC increased 20-fold, and a meta-analysis from East Asia showed curable early-stage GCs were more common in the screening (73%) vs the nonscreening (43%) group.

### The global, regional, and national burden of stomach cancer in 195 countries, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^b41970b0]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

We found that reductions in age-standardised incidence rates did not necessarily parallel those of age-standardised death and DALY rates, meaning that while age-standardised death rates fell considerably in many locations, age-standardised incidence rates decreased more slowly. For example, east Asia, particularly China, witnessed a relatively small decrease in age-standardised incidence rates over the study period, whereas the decreases in age-standardised death and attributable DALY rates were much larger. A study of cancer registries in China showed that the disparity in cancer mortality rates was far greater than cancer incidence when rural and urban areas were compared. The authors suggested that this disparity was due to limited medical resources, lower levels of cancer care, and a larger proportion of patients diagnosed with cancer at a late stage in rural and underdeveloped areas. China has taken steps to reduce the cancer care disparities between rural and urban areas, and we think these efforts might explain the sharp decrease in death rates due to stomach cancer. Another successful strategy to reduce deaths due to stomach cancer has been used in Japan and South Korea, two of the high-income Asia Pacific countries. These countries have implemented population screening programmes leading to early detection of cancer casesand better survival rates. This has led some investigators to believe that China should adopt a similar strategy to further reduce the burden of stomach cancer. But population screening for stomach cancer includes invasive methods, and its feasibility and cost-effectiveness outside high-risk regions have never been investigated. A serum pepsinogen test combined with H pylori testing has been suggested as a potential method to triage suitable candidates for more invasive screening methods, but evidence for their clinical application is still mainly limited to Japanese populations. Although regional patterns convey a lot of useful information about the distribution of stomach cancer burden and its trends and correlates, significant variations exist within each region. For example, stomach cancer incidence rates in Canada are almost double those in the USA, and stomach cancer contributes to more age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population in Portugal, Chile, Guatemala, Bolivia, Haiti, Zimbabwe, and Mali than in other countries in the same regions. In addition, the two countries with the highest age-standardised incidence, death, and DALY rates globally (Mongolia and Afghanistan) have much higher rates than those of their respective regions (central Asia, and north Africa and Middle East, respectively). While making such comparisons, it is important to note that data quality differs across individual countries, and GBD uses a rating system (from zero to five stars) to assess the quality of the available data from each country. In addition to data quality, differences in data collection and coding systems are other challenges facing such comparisons.

Studies of the incidence of gastric cancer in patients with GIM

We identified 30 studies that reported data informing the incidence of gastric cancer in patients with non-dysplastic GIM. The studies were from 5 different geographical regions and 16 different countries. 10 studies reported the incidence rate with a median number of subjects of 686 (range 129–11,530 and IQR 32–859) and the median duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (range 3–12 and IQR 5–9.75). The number of studies that reported the cumulative incidence at different time intervals was 27 with a median number of subjects of 249 (range 71–60,488 and IQR 151–874) and the median follow-up duration was 6 years (range 2–16 and IQR 5–9.5). We had to exclude several studies because they reported outcomes for all the pre-neoplastic lesions together (i.e. atrophic gastritis, GIM, and/or dysplasia) but did not report separate results for non-dysplastic GIM patients.

Similar to the prevalence studies, the overall risk of bias in the individual studies was moderate to high. Frequently, the included studies did not report obtaining biopsies from both the antrum and body or followed the updated Sydney system. Also, many of the studies used pathology or endoscopy databases or patients referred for endoscopy leading to possible referral bias. As many of the studies relied on databases, the duration of follow-up and the factors that led to discontinuation of follow-up was often unclear.

The study was designed to have an 80% power to show an improvement in 1-year survival rate to 30% from historical control of 15 with 5% type-I error, using two-sided testing, and assuming exponential overall survival times. According to Minimax phase II design, a sample size of 48 patients was required. Considering a 5% drop-out rate, 52 patients were needed for this trial. The secondary aims included response rate in patients according to RECIST criteria, safety, PFS, time-to-treatment-failure, and OS. Time-dependent variables were analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log–rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard regression model. Exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided for proportions.

### Gastric cancer screening in the United States: a review of current evidence, challenges, and future perspectives [^e97dfdef]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In the United States, gastric cancer incidence and mortality are substantially higher among non-White racial and ethnic groups and new immigrants from high-incidence countries. This is in large part related to the higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori -associated gastric premalignant changes in these populations. Apart from primary prevention, early detection of gastric cancer is the principal strategy to reduce gastric cancer mortality and improve survival. Extensive evidence in Asian countries has demonstrated the benefits of endoscopic screening in detecting early-stage gastric cancer and reducing gastric cancer-related mortality. By contrast, direct, high-quality US-based data, such as from large clinical trials or observational studies, on important outcomes of gastric cancer screening are still lacking. In this review, we evaluate and summarize the latest global evidence on the epidemiology and predisposing factors of gastric cancer as well as the efficacy, benefits vs. risks, and cost-effectiveness of gastric cancer screening. We further discuss the critical knowledge gaps and challenges in promoting gastric cancer screening in the United States. Dedicated research is urgently needed to enrich the US-based data on gastric cancer primary and secondary prevention to inform clinical practice and reduce gastric cancer-related morbidity and mortality in a cost and resource efficient manner.

### Molecular-targeted first-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer [^c0217e55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Complete resection of the whole tumor remains the only approach to treat this malignant disease. Since gastric cancer is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, many people are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is inoperable. In addition, because other conventional treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) have only modest efficacy for those with advanced/metastatic gastric cancer, the prognosis in such cases is poor. Recently, trials have provided some promising results regarding molecular-targeted therapy, raising the possibility that the development of these agents could be a fruitful approach. However, the benefit of molecular-targeted therapy for advanced gastric cancer remains inconclusive.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of molecular-targeted therapy, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in people with advanced gastric cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (from inception to December 2015): the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (aged 18 years or older) with histologically-confirmed advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach/gastro-esophageal junction. Trials of participants with esophageal adenocarcinoma were also considered to be eligible. The eligible trials should aim to evaluate the effects of molecular-targeted agents on participants' prognosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed selection of eligible trials, assessment of trial quality, and data extraction. We used methods of survival analysis and expressed the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR) when pooling time-to-event data, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 11 studies randomizing 4014 participants to molecular-targeted therapy plus conventional chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Five were at low risk of bias, and we considered the risk of bias in the other six studies to be high, mainly due to their open-label design. All identified studies reported data regarding survival. We found low-quality evidence that molecular-targeted may have a small effect on mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05, 10 studies) compared with conventional chemotherapy alone. Similarly, it may have little effect on progression-free survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04, 11 studies; low-quality evidence). We did not find evidence from subgroup analysis that survival outcomes differed by type of molecular-targeted agent (EGFR- or VEGF-targeting agents) or tumor type, meaning that we were unable to explain the variation in effect across the studies by the presence or absence of prognostic biomarkers or type of molecular-targeted agent. From 11 eligible trials, we were able to use data from 3723 participants with measurable tumors. We found low-quality evidence that molecular-targeted therapy may increase tumor response (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.55, low-quality evidence). Data from one small trial were too limited to determine the effect of treatment on quality of life (very low-quality evidence). The addition of targeted therapy to chemotherapy probably increases the risk of adverse events (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.92, 5 trials, 2290 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and severe adverse event (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.37, 8 trials, 3800 participants), compared with receiving chemotherapy alone.

Authors' Conclusions

There is uncertainty about the effect of adding targeted therapy to chemotherapy on survival outcomes in people with advanced gastric cancer, with very little information on its impact on quality of life. There is more certain evidence of increased risk of adverse events and serious adverse events. The main limitation of the evidence for survival outcomes was inconsistency of effects across the studies, which we could not explain by prespecified subgroups in terms of the type of therapy or tumor type. Ongoing studies in this area are small and unlikely to improve our understanding of the effects of targeted therapy, and larger studies are needed.

Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastric cancer, more specifically with respect to patients with precancerous gastric lesions, endoscopic surveillance, EHMSG/ESGE/ESP/SPED 2019 guidelines recommend to perform immediate high-quality endoscopic reassessment with chromoendoscopy (virtual or dye-based) in patients with dysplasia in the absence of an endoscopically defined lesion. Perform biopsies for the staging of gastritis (if not previously done) and endoscopic surveillance within 6 months (if high-grade dysplasia) to 12 months (if low-grade dysplasia), if no lesion is detected in this high-quality endoscopy.

### Assessment of outcomes from 1-year surveillance after detection of early gastric cancer among patients at high risk in Japan [^9171bccd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is new gastric cancer (GC) detectable approximately 1 year after intensive index endoscopic examination using both white light and narrow-band imaging among patients with a high risk of GC?

Findings

In this case-control study involving secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 4523 patients with a high risk of GC, the rate of new GC detected within approximately 1 year after intensive index endoscopic examination was 2.6%, which was similar to the rate of early GC detected by index endoscopy (3.0%).

Meaning

This study's findings suggest that 1-year surveillance is warranted among patients with a high risk of GC even after intensive endoscopic examination using both white light and narrow-band imaging.

Best Practice Advice 15 — equity and personalized risk — To achieve health equity, a personalized approach should be taken to assess an individual's risk for GC to determine whether screening and surveillance should be pursued. In conjunction, modifiable risk factors for GC should be distinctly addressed, as most of these risk factors disproportionately impact people at high risk for GC and represent health care disparities.

Endoscopic screening for gastric adenocarcinoma

Is there evidence to support the introduction of a population screening programme for glandular gastric cancer?

We suggest endoscopic screening should be considered in individuals aged ≥ 50 years with multiple risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma (male, smokers, pernicious anaemia) — in particular, in those with a first-degree relative with gastric cancer (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: weak; level of agreement: 100%).

We do not recommend endoscopic screening for gastric adenocarcinoma in the UK population (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: strong; level of agreement: 100%).

Evidence for the effectiveness of endoscopic screening for prevention of gastric cancer has been gathered from studies conducted in high-risk populations (defined as an ASR > 20 per 100 000); in Japan and Korea (29.9 and 41.3, respectively). These include five cohort studies and three case–control studies. Although there are no randomised control trials, the results of the available studies suggest a reduction in mortality from gastric cancer in screened populations. In the more recent regional Japanese cohort studies, there was a reduction in gastric cancer mortality (calculated as the standardised mortality ratio or adjusted RR) of 57% and 67% after a 5-year and 6-year follow-up. The earlier cohort studies from Japan and China were less convincing but were limited by a broad age distribution and poorly matched cohorts. The results of the case–control studies were equally variable with a reduction in gastric cancer mortality of between 20% and 80% in high-risk populations in Japan and South Korea. Based on these results, the authors recommended endoscopic screening in regions with a high incidence of gastric cancer.

High-grade gastric dysplasia (HGD) — progression risk and surveillance-only outcomes show substantial cancer detection within short follow-up. HGD is associated with a synchronous carcinoma and a high rate of progression to invasive carcinoma, with progression estimated 47%–100% over 4–48 months. A low-incidence region cohort reported approximately one-quarter diagnosed with invasive cancer within 12 months. In an Australian cohort of 160 patients with dysplasia, 26.9%, 57.5%, and 15.6% were HGD, LGD, and IND, with 70.6% nonpolypoid; among HGD under surveillance only (mean follow-up 1.0 ± 1.4 [SD] years), 42.9% had cancer at index and 4.8% developed an interval cancer (> 12 months). Literature also shows HGD "regression" and "progression" rates in the range 14.9%–15.1%.

Best Practice Advice 3 — high-quality upper endoscopy for gastric cancer (GC) detection states that high-quality upper endoscopy for the detection of premalignant and malignant gastric lesions should include the use of a high-definition white-light endoscopy system with image enhancement, gastric mucosal cleansing, and insufflation to achieve optimal mucosal visualization, plus adequate visual inspection time, photodocumentation, and a systematic biopsy protocol for mucosal staging when appropriate. The endoscopic miss rate for early GC is consistently around 10%, and higher among inexperienced endoscopists. Training, continuing medical education, image libraries, and progressive technological advancements should be prioritized and detection metrics established and adhered to.

Literature searches, evidence synthesis and grading of evidence

A literature search was undertaken by each subgroup with predefined search terms, electronic databases used (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Medline) and the time period covered. Where appropriate, conference abstracts were used to help formulate recommendations, provided that these were of sufficient scientific rigour.

The PICOs were used to guide the search for evidence and the highest quality studies were prioritised. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected initially. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses or critically appraised articles were unavailable, lower levels of evidence were selected. Where reviews use poor-quality studies such as that by Spence et al, for example, where the review was based on small, often single-centre cohort studies resulting in high levels of heterogenicity, this is discussed in the evidence review and highlighted in the evidence tables. In this instance, more weight is given to larger studies using large databases, which are likely to be more accurate. This hierarchy of searching was performed in a pyramidal sequence from top (high quality) to bottom (low quality), cascading from recently published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, to RCTs, and subsequently to observational studies providing that no evidence is available from the higher quality categories. The selected evidence was tabulated in an evidence table categorising each study into the study design, intervention/clinical question, participants/population, reference standard, results and conclusions/comments.

Although randomised controlled studies are deemed the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, other types of studies were included to assess types of effectiveness, such as ways of delivering service or outcomes from registries in clinical practice. If evidence from studies was weak or contradictory, searches for alternative sources were undertaken to see if the evidence concurred or contradicted (triangulation of searches). All available negative studies were included in the searches. The subgroups discussed the external validity of the studies and whether the study outcomes are applicable to the target population for the guidelines. Literature searches were transparent and reproducible to reduce 'dissemination biases'.

All evidence tables and references were downloaded to a shared reference manager (F1000Workspace), to which all GDG members had access. Shortly before the statements were finalised, a further literature search was undertaken. The quality of the evidence was assessed following the GRADE terminology using table 2. Evidence is graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality (table 2).

### Screening and preventive strategies in esophagogastric cancer [^b2cc1ff1]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are among the most prevalent and deadly of malignancies worldwide. Screening and prevention programs will be critical to finally improving outcomes in these diseases. For gastric adenocarcinoma, screening in high-risk populations has significantly reduced mortality. More research is needed on screening high-risk individuals in low-risk populations. For esophageal adenocarcinoma, work is needed to develop efficient and effective techniques in mass screening programs. For most Western populations, current screening is not cost effective. Avoiding environmental risk factors is critical to reducing the incidence of this deadly illness.

Gastric cancer screening in the United States — knowledge gaps include that randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the utility of GC/GPMC screening on GC incidence and mortality and potential harms; risk prediction models are needed and initial US studies may incorporate "convenience endoscopy" paired with screening colonoscopy with later evaluation of the optimal endoscopy-alone threshold; effectiveness of noninvasive biomarkers and novel blood-based screening modalities needs evaluation; and barriers and adherence among marginalized high-risk groups warrant investigation.
