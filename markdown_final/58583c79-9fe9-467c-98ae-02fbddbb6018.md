## Question

A previously healthy 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of abdominal pain and confusion. Prior to the onset of the abdominal pain, he visited a festival where he consumed large amounts of alcohol. Examination shows a distended abdomen, decreased bowel sounds, and diffuse tenderness to palpation. There is motor weakness in the upper extremities. Sensation is decreased over the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory studies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's condition?
A. Intravenous immunoglobulin
B. Hemin
C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
D. Chlordiazepoxide

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which therapy is most appropriate for a 29-year-old man presenting with severe abdominal pain, confusion, decreased bowel sounds, and diffuse extremity motor and sensory deficits after heavy alcohol use, given normal labs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which diagnosis best fits this constellation of neurovisceral symptoms. Then, I should verify whether the provided options map to the evidence-based treatment for that condition. Next, I will review the mechanism of action and guideline-supported dosing. Finally, I should confirm immediate supportive steps and what not to do while awaiting confirmation, to avoid delays in lifesaving therapy.

> Let me first synthesize the clinical picture. The triad of severe abdominal pain, central nervous system involvement with confusion, and peripheral neuropathy with motor and sensory loss, particularly in the context of a trigger such as heavy alcohol use, is classic for an acute hepatic porphyria attack, where alcohol is a known precipitant; importantly, routine labs can be deceptively normal early in the course, which is why diagnosis is often delayed [^1156YDba] [^11464cT5] [^114mT8JX] [^116NxQAr].

> Wait, let me verify the key mimics I need to exclude before committing to porphyria-specific therapy. Guillain-Barré syndrome can produce progressive weakness but lacks the severe visceral pain and encephalopathy seen here, making it less likely despite some superficial overlap, and delays in hemin can worsen porphyric neuropathy. Similarly, Wernicke encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal syndromes can explain confusion and some autonomic features, but not the simultaneous severe abdominal pain and porphyria-typical neuropathy, and alcohol-associated liver disease would typically show liver test abnormalities, which are not reported here, arguing against those alternatives as primary explanations [^1138rkon] [^117WEns6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm the diagnostic anchor and the urgency. In acute hepatic porphyria, random urine testing for porphobilinogen and delta-aminolevulinic acid is highly sensitive during attacks and should be obtained immediately, but treatment must not wait for results if suspicion is high; delays in hemin therapy correlate with worse neurologic outcomes, and IV glucose is insufficient for severe attacks with weakness or hyponatremia [^112A8bba] [^117WEns6] [^111TbawS].

> I will now examine the specific therapies. Intravenous hemin suppresses hepatic ALA synthase by negative feedback, rapidly reducing the neurotoxic porphyrin precursor load; current guidelines recommend daily IV hemin for severe attacks requiring hospitalization, preferably via a high-flow central vein to minimize phlebitis, while IV glucose alone is reserved for mild attacks without neurologic involvement; supportive care includes aggressive pain control, antiemetics, management of autonomic instability, and correction of hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia as indicated [^111TbawS] [^1156YDba] [^113UTV7j] [^114QCuj7].

> Let me think about dosing and logistics. Typical dosing uses 3–4 mg/kg of hemin daily infused over 30–40 minutes, often for four days initially. When standard hemin is not immediately available, some centers use heme arginate, and while dextrose can transiently help in milder attacks, it will not reverse established neuropathy. If an attack is already complicated by severe motor weakness, respiratory support and ICU-level care may be necessary, but hemin remains the disease-modifying therapy [^117WEns6] [^112XDm11] [^114QCuj7] [^116NUBEF].

> But wait, what about the provided options — do any of them match this standard of care? IV immunoglobulin is not indicated for porphyria and could delay appropriate hemin therapy. Chlordiazepoxide treats alcohol withdrawal and is irrelevant to porphyria pathophysiology. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is a chelator and not a porphyria treatment. Therefore, none of the distractors align with evidence-based management of an acute hepatic porphyria attack [^117WEns6] [^1156YDba] [^114VbAdx].

> I should double-check that we incorporate trigger avoidance and secondary prevention counseling, because removing the precipitant improves outcomes and reduces recurrence. In this case, alcohol is a recognized trigger, and future attacks may be mitigated by avoiding porphyrinogenic medications and alcohol, with consideration of prophylactic strategies such as scheduled hemin or givosiran for recurrent attacks. Long-term surveillance for liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma is also recommended in patients with AHP [^111XGGZy] [^114VD3Pj] [^112116Hw].

> Final answer: The most appropriate therapy is intravenous hemin, given the classic neurovisceral presentation of an acute hepatic porphyria attack with severe abdominal pain, confusion, and peripheral neuropathy after alcohol exposure, and the need for prompt disease-specific therapy to prevent progression of neurologic injury. None of the other options are appropriate for this condition [^111TbawS] [^117WEns6] [^1156YDba].

The most likely diagnosis is **acute hepatic porphyria** (acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria) [^116dYNcj], given the triad of severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms (confusion), and peripheral neuropathy (motor weakness, sensory loss) [^114mT8JX] triggered by alcohol [^1133mECk]. The immediate treatment is **intravenous hemin** [^111TbawS] to suppress porphyrin precursor synthesis and prevent neurologic deterioration [^114QCuj7]. Supportive care includes pain control, antiemetics, and correction of electrolytes, especially hyponatremia [^113UTV7j]. IVIG is not indicated, EDTA is irrelevant, and chlordiazepoxide is for alcohol withdrawal, not porphyria.

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

The presentation of severe abdominal pain, confusion, and peripheral neuropathy in a young adult following alcohol consumption strongly suggests **acute hepatic porphyria** (AHP) [^116dYNcj], specifically acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) or variegate porphyria (VP) [^114wTKd8]. AHPs are rare inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis characterized by acute neurovisceral attacks triggered by alcohol, drugs, fasting, or infection [^1133mECk].

Key features supporting AHP include:

- **Severe abdominal pain**: Diffuse, colicky, often without peritoneal signs [^111s114h].
- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Confusion, anxiety, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction [^117BpYAg].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Motor weakness, sensory loss, and areflexia [^111s114h].
- **Trigger**: Alcohol consumption is a known precipitant [^1133mECk].

Other considerations include Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute alcoholic neuropathy, and Wernicke encephalopathy. However, the combination of severe abdominal pain, confusion, and peripheral neuropathy following alcohol consumption is most consistent with AHP [^117BpYAg].

---

## Pathophysiology of acute hepatic porphyria

AHPs result from enzyme deficiencies in the heme biosynthetic pathway, leading to accumulation of **porphyrin precursors (ALA and PBG)** [^117BpYAg]. These precursors are neurotoxic and cause the characteristic **neurovisceral symptoms**. Alcohol induces **hepatic ALA synthase**, increasing precursor production and precipitating attacks [^11464cT5].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Initial diagnosis of **AHP** is made by biochemical testing of urinary ALA, PBG, and creatinine on a random urine sample [^112A8bba]. During acute attacks, **ALA and PBG are typically elevated at least 5-fold above the upper limit of normal** [^115TGqyP]. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and enables **family screening** [^1156YDba].

---

## Management of acute hepatic porphyria

### Immediate management

Immediate management includes:

- **Intravenous hemin**: The cornerstone of therapy, suppressing ALA synthase and reducing precursor accumulation [^111TbawS].
- **Supportive care**: Pain control, antiemetics, and correction of electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyponatremia [^113UTV7j].
- **Avoidance of triggers**: Discontinuation of alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications [^1133mECk].

---

### Long-term management

Long-term management focuses on **trigger avoidance**, **genetic counseling**, and consideration of prophylactic therapies (e.g. givosiran) for recurrent attacks [^114VD3Pj].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Relevance to diagnosis** | **Therapeutic appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) | Not indicated for AHP; primarily used for autoimmune neuropathies such as GBS. | Inappropriate |
| B. Hemin | Specific therapy for AHP; suppresses porphyrin precursor synthesis. | Appropriate |
| C. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) | Chelating agent used for heavy metal poisoning; not relevant to AHP. | Inappropriate |
| D. Chlordiazepoxide | Benzodiazepine used for alcohol withdrawal; does not address underlying porphyria. | Inappropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate therapy for this patient is **intravenous hemin** (Option B), the specific treatment for acute hepatic porphyria. IVIG, EDTA, and chlordiazepoxide are not indicated for this condition. Immediate initiation of hemin therapy, along with supportive care and trigger avoidance, is essential to prevent progression of neurologic complications and ensure optimal outcomes [^117WEns6].

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### ED presentation of acute porphyria [^116NxQAr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint for visits to ED. Among the causes of abdominal pain, the acute porphyria may confuse emergency physicians. With wide range of unspecific symptoms and signs, acute porphyria is rarely considered as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in ED. Some patients even receive unnecessary surgery. There are 32 patients who visited the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital because of acute porphyric attacks over the past 13 years. Ten patients (3 males and 7 females) were diagnosed with acute porphyria for the first time at ED. The onset of age ranged from 17 to 55 years (mean, 32 years). All of our patients presented with abdominal pain but without fever, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms that are typically presented in acute porphyria. On the average, most of them repeatedly sought for medical help because of persistent symptoms for 4 times before being definitely diagnosed and thus receiving the optimal treatment. Meanwhile, all patients needed at least 2 kinds of analgesic, and most of them needed narcotic analgesia for pain control before diagnosis. The most commonest point of tenderness is over epigastrium (7 of 10 patients). The laboratory and image studies of our patients were of no diagnostic value for acute porphyria, except for Watson-Schwartz test. In summary, our study revealed that when a patient after puberty with repetitive visits because of severe abdominal pain without reasonable causes and needs narcotics for pain control, acute porphyria should be taken into consideration.

Acute intermittent porphyria as a mimic of cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute intermittent porphyria occurs infrequently and generally does not present before puberty. It can present with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain, mimicking CVS, but usually has 1 or more symptoms of anxiety, depression, hallucination, seizures, cranial nerve weakness, and paresis of the extremeties. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding an increased urinary d-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in a spot urine during the episode.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### Atypical attack of acute intermittent porphyria – paresis but no abdominal pain [^115sLMmu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We report a case of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) in a 45-year-old woman. Her first attack occurred at the age of 38. Because of escalating cyclical premenstrual attacks, the following 2 years, depletion of the endogenous sex hormone was considered as haeme arginate treatment proved insufficient. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist treatment with low-dose oestradiol add back was quite successful initially but was abandoned after 18 months when progesterone add back precipitated a severe attack. Following hysterectomy and oophorectomy at age 42 and oestradiol add back, a remarkable monthly regularity of attacks ensured periodically but with milder symptoms. Two years after surgery, preceded by six attack-free months, a puzzling symptom-shift occurred, from abdominal pain, back and thigh pain during the attacks, to solely severe distal extensor paresis in the arms. Haeme arginate treatment interrupted the progress of the paresis almost immediately and motor function improved considerably up to the 9-month follow-up. Electrophysiological examination revealed only motor neuropathy, consistent with axonal degeneration. Subsequently the symptoms changed yet again, to sensory disturbances with numbness and dysesthesia as the primary expression followed by rather mild abdominal pain. However, cyclical attacks occurred, despite absence of endogenous ovarial hormone production, possibly attributable to impaired oestrogen metabolism in the liver, or adrenal oestrogen production. Treatment comprising oophorectomy, low-dose oestradiol add back and haeme arginate infusion for 2 days on the appearance of early AIP symptoms is now quite successful affording improvement in life quality.

Alcohol withdrawal — dosage regimens describe three approaches: Front loading uses moderate to high doses of a long-acting medication given frequently at the start of treatment to achieve rapid control and can be followed by a symptom-triggered or fixed-dose regimen; fixed dosing administers a predetermined dose at fixed intervals with doses usually decreasing in a gradual taper over several days and additional medication provided if symptoms are not adequately controlled; and symptom-triggered dosing gives medication only when symptoms cross a threshold, for example 15 mg oxazepam for CIWA-Ar scores 8–15 and 30 mg oxazepam for CIWA-Ar > 15. Symptom-triggered dosing, if used alone, requires highly reliable and dedicated staff to avoid undertreatment of withdrawal and should be used only when there are adequate qualified staff to perform assessments.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^111s114h]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

It is of utmost importance to consider porphyrias when related symptoms and findings appear — not least due to the fact that the wrong medication can lead to a dramatic exacerbation of the disease. Clinical features are dependent on the type of porphyria. The striking, principle symptom of patients with acute porphyrias is severe abdominal pain that might present itself as an "acute abdomen" but remains without peritonism. Other manifestations are predominantly neurological, psychological and autonomic. Cutaneous porphyrias on the other hand lead to either blistering or nonblistering photosensitivity (overlap of clinical symptoms in HCP and VP).

The following section will focus on pain in acute porphyrias.

Acute porphyrias – ie AIP, HCP, VP and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP) – can be life-threatening and occur episodically in the form of attacks. Among abdominal pain, patients show nausea, vomiting and constipation. Motor neuropathies as well as neurovisceral and neuropathic pain are among the neurological manifestations. The affection of proximal muscles (mostly of the upper extremities) is common but tetraplegia, lethal respiratory and bulbar paralysis do also occur. Neuropathic symptoms like tickling or numbness were found to be characteristic for the chronic state of the condition in a study with 19 patients. In a review on AIP with focus on pain, it is reported that pain in the chest, head, neck and limbs were among the most common clinical manifestations affecting 50–52% of the patients. The involvement of cranial nerves was reported in 35–55% of the patients and peripheral neuropathy in 10–40%. Sensory loss was present in 9–38%. The authors discussed several mechanisms that, secondary to heme deficiency or to the accumulation of neurotoxic substances such as ALA, might contribute to the development of central and peripheral sensitisation and neuropathic and neurovisceral pain. For instance, a demyelination due to the release of free radicals is discussed. An affection of central and peripheral nociceptive transmission by increased levels of brain tryptophan and increased turnover of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (resulting from a decreased activity of the heme-dependent enzyme liver tryptophan pyrrolase) was another hypothesis posed by the authors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1114yB7i]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease — clinical presentation and AUD recognition: There is no unique presentation of ALD that can be distinguished with confidence from other forms of liver disease, and alcohol use is often not disclosed by the affected patient, whereas liver injury, whether due to alcohol or other causes, often proceeds silently. Although not all patients with ALD meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), failure to recognize AUD remains a significant clinical problem, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion for AUD in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and signs given in Table 6. Table 6 lists symptoms such as odor of alcohol on breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, day/night reversal (sleepy by day; wakeful at night), peripheral neuropathy, weight gain (due to ascites), weight loss (due to loss of proximal muscle mass), confusion (as part of hepatic encephalopathy), loss of sexual drive, and amenorrhea, and signs including spider angioma, palmar erythema, leukonychia, ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae, loss of proximal muscle mass, systemic hypotension; tachycardia suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bruises, gynecomastia, gonadal atrophy in men, neurological findings of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (fine tremor, psychomotor agitation, transient hallucinations or illusions) and hepatic encephalopathy (coarse flapping tremor [asterixis], altered consciousness), as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Dupuytren's contracture.

### Pathogenesis of acute encephalopathy in acute hepatic porphyria [^116NUBEF]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Basal ganglia and brain stem oedema (case 8)

Case 8 with a short-lasting delirium demonstrated nucleus caudatus and midbrain hyperintensity comparable with Wernicke encephalopathy (Fig. 1 A, B) and occipital cortical oedema (Fig. 1 C). This could be due to the single alcohol binge followed by acute pancreatitis three weeks prior to the manifestations of the attack with confusion, severe abdominal pain and PNP. Porphyrinogenic medication and rapid weight loss before confusion triggered the attack. Hyponatremia (125 mmol/L) was corrected slowly without signs of pontine myelinolysis. The patient was the only case with both normal serum ALT (< 50 U/L) and PRES. Serum vitamin B1-level was normal at the time of imaging.

PRES and sinus thrombosis (case 1)

The most prominent finding was CVST on the brain MRI of Case 1 (Tables 2, 3, Figs. 2 and 3). A 26-year-old female had experienced recurrent undiagnosed attacks during premenstrum. At the onset of an attack, she had severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, and systolic hypertension (150–170/90 mmHg) without headache. During the following four days, the attack proceeded to seizures, progressive confusion and later generalised muscle weakness with low tendon reflexes due to PNP (Fig. 2). Brain CT during the period of seizures (11th day of the attack) revealed hypodense foci in the left frontal and parietal area. EEG revealed focal epileptiform discharges in the frontal area. She was diagnosed with AHP and treated with 10–20% glucose infusions before hematin was available. Plasmapheresis, which has been used experimentally during attacks without clinical effect, did not improve her condition either. Contraceptive pills were administered when she was recovering from the attack to prevent further cyclical attacks (Fig. 2). Thereafter, she became lethargic and developed short-lasting blurred vision and reversible motor dysphasia. Brain MRI (15th day of the attack) revealed hyperintensive foci with the same distribution as in the CT a week earlier suggesting PRES. Segmental vasospasms of the basilar, both vertebral arteries and M2–M4 segments of the middle cerebellar arteries could be detected. She was treated with the hematin infusions (Normosang, Recordati Rare Diseases, France) for four days from the 18th day of the attack.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Progressive bilateral facial weakness [^115jP9iu]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old man presented with sudden onset of right-sided facial muscle weakness and slurred speech and a 3-day history of fevers, myalgia and sore throat. There was no hyperacusis, change in taste or lacrimation. His history included untreated hepatitis C diagnosed 10 years before, but quiescent at his annual liver review 8 weeks before presentation. He smoked cannabis intermittently but there was no recent alcohol or other drug abuse. There was a history of promiscuity with female partners.

On examination, he was alert and orientated. His blood pressure was elevated at 159/86 mm Hg but other vital signs and general examination were normal. Neurological examination showed a severe right-sided lower motor facial weakness with Bell's phenomenon (see online). The remaining cranial nerve examination was normal, including eye movements, pupillary responses, facial sensation, hearing, taste and otoscopy. There was mild left hip flexion weakness but preserved deep tendon reflexes. There was reduced sensation to temperature in a glove-and-stocking pattern; joint-position sense, light touch and pain sensation were intact. There was mild gait instability on walking tandem.

His condition progressed rapidly and on day 2 of admission he developed left-sided facial weakness (figure 1) with bilateral, proximal lower limb weakness. His paraesthesias were more painful. His lower limb deep tendon reflexes were no longer present (see online). Spirometry remained normal. He was transferred to a high dependency unit for ongoing monitoring.

### Acute intermittent porphyria: analgesia can be dangerous [^115S2q4X]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare condition, a metabolic disorder of the haem biosynthesis. An acute crisis of AIP can present as a combination of symptoms, such as abdominal pain, autonomic dysfunction, hyponatremia, muscle weakness and neurological symptoms in the absence of others obvious causes. We report the case of a 53-year-old woman, who was previously diagnosed with AIP 5 weeks after therapeutic suspension has developed an acute disease exacerbation. During hospitalisation, further exacerbation has occurred after analgesia with metamizole. Glucose and hemin infusions resulted in slow improvement. Physical rehabilitation was crucial to peripheral polyneuropathy recovery. Taking into account the porphyrinogenic effect described for metamizole, this drug might have triggered the second attack. Clinical history was sufficient to suspect the diagnosis and to start the treatment immediately, preventing important sequelae.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume.

Reactions reported with the use of potassium-containing solutions include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, areflexia, muscular or respiratory paralysis, mental confusion, weakness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest. Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function, and intestinal ileus and dilatation.

If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.

Abnormally high plasma levels of calcium can result in depression, amnesia, headaches, drowsiness, disorientation, syncope, hallucinations, hypotonia of both skeletal and smooth muscles, dysphagia, arrhythmias and coma. Calcium deficits can result in neuromuscular hyperexcitability, including cramps and convulsions.

The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Diagnostic enzymes and imaging — Serum amylase concentrations may be normal in alcohol-induced AP and hypertriglyceridemia, and serum lipase seems to be more specific and remains elevated longer than amylase following disease presentation. For example, an upper limit of normal greater than 3–5 times may be needed in some patients, and while elevations of amylase and lipase greater than 3× normal help establish AP, some patients without AP will have such elevations; once the diagnosis of AP is established, there is no reason to follow the serum amylase or lipase. Abdominal imaging may confirm AP: contrast-enhanced CT provides more than 90% sensitivity and specificity; routine abdominal CT is unwarranted, but in a patient failing to improve after 48–72 hours CT or MRI is recommended to assess local complications, and CT and MRI are comparable in the early assessment of AP.

### Acute porphyria presenting as major trauma: case report and literature review [^114cfxm9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute porphyria is historically known as "the little imitator" in reference to its reputation as a notoriously difficult diagnosis. Variegate porphyria is one of the four acute porphyrias, and can present with both blistering cutaneous lesions and acute neurovisceral attacks involving abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric features, neuropathy, hyponatremia, and a vast array of other nonspecific clinical features.

Case Report

A 40-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) as a major trauma call, having been found in an "acutely confused state" surrounded by broken glass. Primary survey revealed: hypertension, tachycardia, abdominal pain, severe agitation, and confusion with an encephalopathy consistent with acute delirium, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13, and head-to-toe "burn-like" abrasions. Computed tomography was unremarkable, and blood tests demonstrated hyponatremia, acute kidney injury, and a neutrophilic leukocytosis. The next of kin eventually revealed a past medical history of variegate porphyria. The patient was experiencing an acute attack and received supportive management prior to transfer to intensive care, subsequently making a full recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case highlights the importance of recognizing acute medical conditions in patients thought to be suffering from major trauma. Acute porphyria should be considered in any patient with abdominal pain in combination with neuropsychiatric features, motor neuropathy, or hyponatremia. Patients often present to the ED without any medical history, and accurate diagnosis can be essential in the acute setting to minimize morbidity and mortality. The label of the major trauma call must be taken with great caution, and a broad differential diagnosis must be maintained throughout a diligent and thorough primary survey.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^114QCuj7]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Lin et al conducted excitability measurements of peripheral motor axons in 20 patients with AIP. These were then combined with the findings of genetic screening and biochemical and conventional nerve conduction studies. They proposed that porphyrin neurotoxicity may be the cause of a subclinical reduction in the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-dependent current in the axons of patients with acute porphyric episodes without clinical neuropathy. On the other side, it was suggested that the development of porphyric neuropathy might occur when a reduced activity of the Na(+)/K(+) pump results in membrane depolarization.

Treating the acute attack appropriately is key to achieving a satisfactory analgesia and warding off life-threatening neurological symptoms (Table 1). For patients with known porphyria, though, the priority should always be the prevention and avoidance of possible, attack-precipitating factors. Those can be starvation and infections, hormonal fluctuations (eg during menstrual cycle), alcohol, smoking and the usage of certain drugs (including hormonal contraceptives).P450-inducing drugs, for instance, increase the hepatic heme turnover and thus act as porphyrinogenic.

Table 1
Problematic and Non-Problematic Analgesics for the Treatment of Patients with Acute Intermittent Porphyria

The characteristic symptoms are accompanied by an increased urinary excretion of PBG and 5-ALA. It should be noted that patients with the ALA dehydrase deficiency porphyria (ADP) have a normal PBG excretion. If the acute attack has been diagnosed and other potentially life-threatening and intervention-requiring diagnoses are excluded, treatment must begin in a timely manner. If present, precipitating factors should be eliminated (eg treatment of possible infections, correction of hypocaloric diets).

The prime principle must be the avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs, whenever possible. The Norwegian Porphyria Centre (NAPOS) drug database for acute porphyria can be consulted to learn about the potential of drugs to provoke attacks of acute porphyria (see). As a specific therapy, intravenous hematin has shown to suppress hepatic ALA synthase by negative feedback, thus reducing the excretion of aminolaevulinic acid and PBG. In a review article published in 2017, a daily dose of 3 to 4 mg Panhematin per kg of body weight infused over a period of 30 to 40 min is recommended.

### Chronic abdominal discomfort syndrome (CADS): defining and discussing a novel diagnosis [^1178XBbX]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Within the umbrella of CAP, we propose a diagnostic subclassification that we describe as "Chronic Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome" (CADS). Our goal is to establish a consensus CADS definition encompassing clinical symptomatology and pathophysiology with suspected neuronal etiology.

The patient may report a history of previous abdominal surgery with/without potential neuronal injury such as entrapment, adhesions, and neuroma formation. Patients may also carry a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease would be excluded. Associated symptoms can include abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting or dyspepsia. These diseases may result in a reduced quality of life and inability to complete activities of daily living, objective surveys can be administered to quantify extent of impairment.

On examination, signs may include generalized tenderness to palpation of the abdomen with poor localization. Patient's positioning should not change the character of pain. There should be no signs of acute abdomen such as rigidity, guarding or hemodynamic instability. The abdomen should show no discoloration or signs of external trauma. Patients demonstrating hyperalgesia or allodynia of the abdomen should also be considered if acute abdomen is ruled out. Specifically, if abdominal pain is more localized (i.e. can be pointed out with one finger), consideration should be given to Chronic Abdominal Wall Pain (CAWP) – also known as Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES). An effective tool to diagnose these patients is Carnett's Sign: worsening of abdominal pain with increased tension placed on the abdominal wall. These patients would qualify for a diagnosis of CADS as they would fulfill criteria as outlined below.

Diagnostically, lab values for lipase, amylase, liver enzymes and bilirubin should be stable and within normal range. Imaging may show prior interventions but no acute pathology such as increased stool burden, dilation or edema of the bowel or tumors and other obstructions should be visualized.

If no other diagnosis explains signs and symptoms, consider Chronic Abdominal Discomfort Syndrome. It is possible that a diagnostic nerve block of the abdomen (eg Transverse Abdominal Pain) can solidify the diagnosis, particularly if accompanied by decrease in quantity of oral pain medications consumed. What follows is a set of diagnostic criteria establishing the condition, with further research slated to address patient treatment and long-term management.

### Porphyria: often discussed but too often missed [^11247Kmy]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is often overlooked. We describe a patient with this condition who had all the 'bells and whistles', in whom the diagnosis was only made after considerable delay. Far from an esoteric condition haunting examination candidates, AIP is an important cause of a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms. Its early recognition allows the astute clinician to prevent potentially devastating sequelae. We provide practical guidance on the investigation and management of this complex disorder. With a 'back to basics' approach to the underlying genetics and biochemistry, we hope to dispel some of the confusion that may obstruct a timely diagnosis.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: current diagnosis&management [^112XDm11]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Each of the four acute hepatic porphyrias is due to mutation of an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The accumulation of pathway intermediates that occur most notably when these diseases are active is the basis for screening and establishing a biochemical diagnosis of these rare disorders. Measurement of enzyme activities and especially DNA testing also are important for diagnosis. Suspicion of the diagnosis and specific testing, particularly measurement of urinary porphobilinogen, are often delayed because the symptoms are nonspecific, even when severe. Urinary porphyrins are also measured, but their elevation is much less specific. If porphobilinogen is elevated, second line testing will establish the type of acute porphyria. DNA testing identifies the familial mutation and enables screening of family members. Management includes removal of triggering factors whenever possible. Intravenous hemin is the most effective treatment for acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is sometimes used for mild attacks. Cyclic attacks, if frequent, can be prevented by a GnRH analogue. Frequent noncyclic attacks are sometime preventable by scheduled (e.g. weekly) hemin infusions. Long term complications may include chronic pain, renal impairment and liver cancer. Other treatments, including RNA interference, are under development.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^114mT8JX]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute hepatic porphyria:

- Definition: Acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, primarily delta-ALA, in the body due to deficiencies in certain enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
- Pathophysiology: Acute hepatic porphyrias are caused by defects in one of the eight enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This leads to the accumulation of organic compounds called porphyrins, specifically in the liver.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of acute hepatic porphyrias is estimated at about 1 in 1,600 Caucasians.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations are often neurological and can result from severe episodes of acute attacks. These include an acute, predominantly motor axonal neuropathy resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropsychiatric syndromes, seizures, encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular disorders. Severe abdominal pain is also a common symptom. If left untreated, potential long-term complications, including chronic hypertension, CKD, and HCC, develop.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis can be good with early diagnosis and management, which includes avoiding identifiable triggers, controlling pain, and administering intravenous hemin during acute attacks.

### Current and innovative emerging therapies for porphyrias with hepatic involvement [^117HtR3u]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders caused by specific enzyme dysfunctions in the haem synthesis pathway, which result in abnormal accumulation of specific pathway intermediates. The symptoms depend upon the chemical characteristics of these substances. Porphyrins are photoreactive and cause photocutaneous lesions on sunlight-exposed areas, whereas accumulation of porphyrin precursors is related to acute neurovisceral attacks. Current therapies are suboptimal and mostly address symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in the understanding of the molecular bases and pathogenesis of porphyrias have paved the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this Clinical Trial Watch we summarise the basic principles of these emerging approaches and what is currently known about their application to porphyrias of hepatic origin or with hepatic involvement.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias – A guide for hepatologists [^114Q97NL]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) are a group of rare, inherited disorders of the heme biosynthesis pathway, usually manifesting with attacks of acute abdominal pain and other neurovisceral symptoms, with or without cutaneous manifestations. AHPs are characterized by the accumulation of porphyrin precursors, porphobilinogen, and/or aminolevulinic acid, in the blood. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to both inadequate testing and the improper use of available laboratory tests. In this review, we describe the various clinical presentations of the 4 AHPs, elucidate the approach to diagnosis, and provide recommendations for immediate and long-term management. We also describe the different complications that can occur with long-standing AHP, including the development of HCC. The AHPs are very treatable conditions, with excellent outcomes if diagnosed and treated early. A high index of suspicion for the presence of these disorders, along with accurate testing and timely treatment, will help reduce the burden of disease and prevent irreversible complications in patients with AHP.

### Differential diagnosis… [^1174Cwjm]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

An acute abdomen refers to a sudden, severe abdominal pain. It is in many cases a medical emergency, requiring urgent and specific diagnosis. Several causes need immediate surgical treatment. Differential diagnosis Common causes of an acute abdomen include a gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric ischemia, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, and an abdominal hemorrhage. However, this is a non-exhaustive list and other less common causes may also lead to an acute abdomen. In pregnant patient, a tubo-ovarian abscess, ruptured ovarian cyst or a ruptured ectopic pregnancy are common causes of an acute abdomen. Ischemic acute abdomen Vascular disorders are more likely to affect the small bowel than the large bowel. Arterial supply to the intestines is provided by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, both of which are direct branches of the aorta.

Clinically, patients present with diffuse abdominal pain, bowel distention, and bloody diarrhea. On physical exam, bowel sounds will be absent. Laboratory tests reveal a neutrophilic leukocytosis, sometimes with a left shift, and increased serum amylase. Abdominal radiography will show many air-fluid levels, as well as widespread edema. Acute ischemic abdomen is a surgical emergency. Typically, treatment involves removal of the region of the bowel that has undergone infarction, and subsequent anastomosis of the remaining healthy tissue. Diagnosis Traditionally, the use of opiates or other pain medications in patients with an acute abdomen has been discouraged before the clinical examination because of the concern that pain medications may mask the signs and symptoms of the condition and therefore may lead to a delay in diagnosis.

However, the scientific literature has shown that early administration of pain medications, including opiates, in those with acute abdomen does not lead to delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment or errors in management. In a meta-analysis of those with acute appendicitis, early administration of opiates was found to alter treatment approach but diagnostic accuracy and surgical outcomes were unaffected by pain medication use. Clinical guidelines also recommend early analgesic use before a cause is established. Medical imaging aids in the diagnosis of potential causes of an acute abdomen. A CT scan or ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis are the preferred imaging modalities in the evaluate of an acute abdomen. The use of radiocontrast agents with CT scans improve diagnostic accuracy.

Some authors advocate for the use of CT angiography with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis as the preferred imaging modality. An ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality in pregnant patients as CT scans expose the fetus to ionizing radiation which may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. An abdominal x-ray may show free air in the abdominal cavity due to a perforation in the gastrointestinal tract. However, abdominal x-ray is not recommended as part of the diagnostic evaluation in acute abdomen due to its low sensitivity and specificity. Delays in medical imaging acquisition and interpretation greater than 2 hours are associated with an increased risk of complications and death. Society and culture In a population based study of Medicare patients in the United States, Black patients who were admitted to the hospital for an acute abdomen requiring general surgery consultation were 14% less likely to receive surgical consultation as compared to White patients.

### Systemic causes of abdominal pain [^114zjgNk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

A variety of systemic and extra-abdominal diseases can cause symptoms within the abdominal cavity. Systemic and extra-abdominal diseases may include abdominal symptoms caused by several mechanisms.

### Significance testing as perverse probabilistic reasoning [^116QAYve]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

However, medical reasoning frequently requires going beyond syllogistic reasoning. For example, consider the following argument type:

Of course, given the premise (A ⇒ B), the truth of B does not, strictly speaking, imply the truth of A, hence the use of the term 'plausible' to denote an implication that falls short of certitude. Arguments of this kind, which have been aptly called 'weak syllogisms', are indispensable in everyday medical reasoning. For example, it is reasonable to assert that patients with appendicitis will have abdominal pain, and we accept abdominal pain as grounds for suspecting appendicitis, though logically there are numerous other possible explanations for abdominal pain. In a similar vein, consider these additional typical case vignettes and possible diagnoses:

- 45 year old homeless alcoholic man brought in by police with confusion, disorderly behavior, and breath smelling of alcohol. Diagnosis: Ethanol intoxication.

- 75 year old nursing home resident with known heart failure presents with confusion and shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals rales, 3+ lower extremity pitting edema, labored breathing. Diagnosis: CHF exacerbation.

- 55 year old male presents to ED with acute onset substernal chest pain. Diagnosis: Gastric reflux.

Most physicians quickly assign rough degrees of plausibility to these diagnoses. However, in these cases it is reasonable to entertain alternative diagnoses, for example in the first case other intoxicants, or meningitis; and in the second case pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction. In the third case the stated diagnosis is only weakly plausible, and most physicians would doubt it at least until other possibilities (for example myocardial ischemia) are ruled out. In each case, there is insufficient information to make a certain (that is logically deductive) diagnosis; nevertheless, we are accustomed to making judgements of plausibility.

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^113mchfz]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

3.1 Clinical and Laboratory Findings

A total of seven patients with acute quadriparesis as the initial presentation of AIP were identified. One patient was excluded due to incomplete clinical data. A total of six patients from six unrelated families were included for analysis. All patients are female, with a median age at initial assessment of 22 years (range 15–29).

The demographic features, clinical presentations, electrophysiologic, and molecular genetic findings, as well as treatment outcomes are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3. All patients reported non‐neuropathic symptoms suggestive of porphyria (e.g. abdominal pain, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES], psychiatric symptoms) prior to the onset of acute quadriparesis by a median of 45 days (range 4–660 days). A prior diagnosis or family history of acute intermittent porphyria was lacking in all patients. All patients had symmetric weakness except for patient 4. All but one patient were initially suspected to have GBS; two patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and one patient was treated with plasmapheresis followed by IVIg. Two patients did not receive a specific treatment for GBS. All patients required admission to intensive care units for blood pressure or heart rate instability. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF) including cell count, protein, and glucose levels was performed for three patients and was within normal limits in all. Five patients had elevated urine PBG levels tested at a median of 5 weeks (range 1–22 weeks) from the onset of acute quadriparesis. All patients were treated with haem arginate infusions at a median of 4.5 weeks (range 2.5–28 weeks) (Figure 1). Follow‐up clinical neuromuscular assessment was available for all patients at a median of 16 days (range 8–30 days) following the initial attack of acute polyneuropathy.

Best Practice Advice 6: Patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers that may precipitate acute attacks, such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications.

The low penetrance of AHPs indicates the likely presence of additional factors that are required for clinical symptoms, including precipitating factors and other poorly defined modifying genes and/or epigenetic factors. Sex hormones, in particular progesterone, are known to precipitate attacks. Other common precipitating factors include medications that induce cytochrome P450, acute illness or infection, physical or psychological stress, excess alcohol intake, tobacco use, and caloric deprivation. These factors induce hepatocyte ALAS1 messenger RNA and protein expression.– All patients with AHP should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers. Lists of safe and unsafe drugs are available online (and).

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### A case report of porphyria variegata management in the emergency department [^112GTD61]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyria variegata (VP) is one of the hepatic porphyrias that results from the deficiency of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway. The name porphyria variegata refers to its many presentations, which include various neuropsychiatric and cutaneous manifestations. Emergency department (ED) presentations due to VP are most commonly neuropathic abdominal pain.

Case Report

We present the case of a 57-year-old woman presenting to an ED with abdominal pain consistent with prior VP attacks. In addition to analgesics and supportive care, infusion of intravenous dextrose resulted in improvement in her symptoms.

Conclusion

Intravenous dextrose and heme administration remain the first-line treatment for abdominal pain attributable to known acute hepatic porphyria attacks. Recently, the mechanism of action of carbohydrates in treating porphyria has been elucidated. Current information on this illness and ED management are discussed.

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^115rZs82]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

First line testing for suspected AIP is through measuring PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins (with or without fractionation) from a random urine sample of ~10 mL normalized to creatinine. Timing of analysis should coincide with an acute attack, although persistent elevations of metabolites have been reported months to years following an acute episode of AIP. Urine PBG levels during an attack are in orders of 2–10 times above normal, in association with elevated urine total porphyrins. Hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria will have similar biochemical results and can only be differentiated from AIP through testing of fecal porphyrins or by genetic testing. Accurate differentiation of various porphyrias is essential for appropriate family counseling on avoidance of triggers.

Definitive diagnosis of AIP is through identification of pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene, located on chromosome 11q24.1–q24.2 with over 500 identified mutations. Prevalence in European populations ranges from 1:1600 to 1:2000 with low disease penetrance, reported at less than 1% in the general population but can be as high as 52% in specific Spanish populations. Up to 90% of subjects with HMBS gene mutations are clinically asymptomatic, highlighting the role of other genes and environmental factors (diet or medications) in precipitating episodes of acute intermittent porphyria. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIP requires a combination of clinical and biochemical laboratory findings rather than reliance on the presence of HMBS gene mutations alone.

Three patients in the present study harbored splice site mutations ([c.826‐2A > T] in two patients and [c.706‐2A > T] in one patient). A missense mutation (c.275T > C) and nonsense mutation (c.874C > T) were detected in one patient each. All mutations are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ClinVar with the exception of patient three, who carries a deletion that results in a premature stop codon, previously reported in a patient originally from Saudi Arabia and presenting with severe abdominal pain, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and lower limb weakness. Further studies are needed to understand the genetic susceptibility factors underlying penetrance of AIP in Arab populations.

Despite the consistent report of abdominal pain and presence of electrolyte disturbances in all patients, there were substantial delays in diagnoses, with all but one patient misdiagnosed as GBS. CSF analysis was within normal limits in three patients tested, although cyto‐albuminologic dissociation has been reported in AIP and adds further to the diagnostic overlap with GBS.

### Caffeine-induced hypokalemia: a case report [^113C2i6W]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old man without a significant past medical history visited our hospital emergency room with severe generalized muscle weakness and bilateral leg numbness that continued for several hours. He had no specific family history including diabetes mellitus and hypokalemia. His motor power values were 3 of 5 in all four extremities with normal reflexes and sensation. Blood pressure was within normal range and no other abnormalities were found on his physical examination. The patient was not under medication with herbal medicines (such as licorice), diuretics, or laxatives. No documented endocrinal dysfunction was noted. He had no symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.

His symptom onset was relatively rapid. He felt no discomfort for several years before the symptoms presented. First he felt progressive generalized muscle weakness and fatigue; after a few hours, the muscle weakness and numbness became intolerable. His laboratory examination data demonstrated considerable hypokalemia (2.6 mmol/L as K +), decreased serum renin (0.14 ng/mL/hr, reported 8 days after testing) and aldosterone (11.81 pg/mL, reported 8 days after testing), metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation, and diluted urine (decreased urine osmolality, 130 mOsm/kg H 2 O) (Table 1). The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was 2.43, but it was not valid because the urine osmolality was less than plasma osmolality. The spot urine potassium/creatinine ratio was 16 mEq/gCr. He was discharged from the emergency room after the muscle weakness improved by 40 mEq of intravenous potassium replacement. His potassium level was 4.4 mmol/L and he refused to be admitted for evaluation of the cause of hypokalemia. When he visited an outpatient clinic a few days later, the potassium level was within the normal range (4.3 mmol/L). Sixteen months after the first event, he visited the emergency room again with the same symptoms and signs. Serum and urine laboratory test results were similar to those of the first event: serum potassium, 2.9 mmol/L; serum renin, 0.48 ng/mL/hr; and aldosterone, 7.39 pg/mL. When the patient visited the emergency room at the first event, symptoms improved rapidly after intravenous potassium replacement and were discharged without a 24-hour urine test. In the second event, the 24-hour urine potassium excretion was measured at 57.4 mEq/24-hours while intravenous potassium replacement was performed. Two months later, a third event occurred with the same symptoms and signs. Potassium levels during the third hypokalemia event improved to 4.1 mEq/L in the next day only by recommending discontinuation of caffeine drink, without intravenous or oral potassium supplementation. As the potassium level was corrected, his generalized weakness resolved. Hypokalemia was suspected as the main cause of his muscle weakness and numbness.

### Abdominal pain in the geriatric patient [^114gznyP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

With an aging population, emergency department clinicians can expect an increase in geriatric patients presenting with abdominal pain. Compared with younger patients, this patient population is less likely to present with classic symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory values of abdominal disease. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with elderly patients presenting with abdominal pathologic conditions are significant. For this reason, the clinician must be familiar with some subtle and not so subtle differences when caring for the geriatric patient with abdominal pain to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Guide to porphyrias. A historical and clinical perspective [^113orjtC]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis classified as neurovisceral, cutaneous, or mixed. A deficiency of any of the 8 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. Classification depends on the defective enzyme. Porphyrias often are misdiagnosed because patients have vague symptoms. However, acute forms of porphyria can be life-threatening, so it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate proper medical management. We discuss the history, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of porphyrias and then briefly describe the 8 types of porphyrias and their distinguishing features.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old man presented on 23 January 2019 with a history of chest pain, back pain, abdominal distention, leg weakness and numbness. Chest pain had started 6 weeks earlier, was sharp and mostly on the left side and worse with breathing. Pain was present all the time and was often made worse when laying down.

He reported increasing back pain while walking and had been taking pain killers for about 6 weeks prior to admission and was complaining of constipation. In addition, he had weakness and numbness of lower limbs suggestive of spinal cord compression.

There was no history of smoking and he only drank alcohol occasionally. He had no medical history of note and was not on any regular medications.

General physical examination was normal. There was no clubbing or palpable lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination was essentially normal. His abdomen was distended but without palpable hepatomegaly. Examination of lower limbs demonstrated minimal leg weakness.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: recommendations for diagnosis and management with real-world examples [^115oRaSL]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of four rare inherited diseases, each resulting from a deficiency in a distinct enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Characterized by acute neurovisceral symptoms that may mimic other medical and psychiatric conditions, lack of recognition of the disease often leads to a delay in diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment. Biochemical testing for pathway intermediates that accumulate when the disease is active forms the basis for screening and establishing a diagnosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identifies the pathogenic variant, supporting screening of family members and genetic counseling. Management of AHP involves avoidance of known exogenous and hormonal triggers, symptomatic treatment, and prevention of recurrent attacks. Here we describe six case studies from our own real-world experience to highlight current recommendations and challenges associated with the diagnosis and long-term management of the disease.

### Acute intermittent porphyria presenting with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and abdominal pain [^114tfLxm]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare genetic condition in which disrupted haem synthesis causes overproduction of porphyrin precursors. Occasionally, it is associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), presenting with headache, confusion, seizures and visual disturbance. We describe a patient with acute intermittent porphyria who presented with seizures and PRES, and who had previous unexplained severe abdominal pain. Acute intermittent porphyria should be considered as a possible cause of PRES, especially in those with unexplained abdominal pain, since delays in its diagnosis can result in permanent complications.

### Update review of the acute porphyrias [^115Y1eDc]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute porphyrias are rare inherited disorders due to deficiencies of haem synthesis enzymes. To date, all UK cases have been one of the three autosomal dominant forms, although penetrance is low and most gene carriers remain asymptomatic. Clinical presentation is typically with acute neurovisceral attacks characterised by severe abdominal pain, vomiting, tachycardia and hypertension. Severe attacks may be complicated by hyponatraemia, peripheral neuropathy sometimes causing paralysis, seizures and psychiatric features. Attacks are triggered by prescribed drugs, alcohol, hormonal changes, fasting or stress. The diagnosis is made by finding increased porphobilinogen excretion in a light-protected random urine sample. Management includes administration of intravenous human haemin and supportive treatment with non-porphyrinogenic drugs. A few patients develop recurrent attacks, a chronic illness requiring specialist management. Late complications include chronic pain, hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic renal failure and hypertension. In the UK, the National Acute Porphyria Service provides clinical advice and supplies haemin when indicated.

### Neurovisceral porphyrias: what a hematologist needs to know [^114wTKd8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The acute or inducible hepatic porphyrias comprise four inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis. They usually remain asymptomatic for most of the lifespan of individuals who inherit the specific enzyme deficiencies but may cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms. Failure to consider the diagnosis frequently delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests and/or mistaken interpretation of results may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The four disorders are ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. Other conditions that clinically and biochemically may mimic acute porphyria include lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type I. The diagnosis of one of these acute porphyric syndromes should be considered in many patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain, severe constipation, systemic arterial hypertension, or other characteristic symptoms. Critical to the rapid diagnosis of the three most common of these disorders is demonstration of markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) in a single-void urine specimen. The treatment of choice for all but mild attacks of the acute porphyrias is intravenous hemin therapy, which should be started as soon as possible. Intravenous glucose alone is recommended only for mild attacks (no weakness or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available.

### Pathogenesis of acute encephalopathy in acute hepatic porphyria [^117BpYAg]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute encephalopathy can be a manifestation of a protracted or severe attack of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). An acute attack manifests typically with acute abdominal pain and signs of autonomic dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy (PNP) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, accompanied by excess of plasma and urine porphyrins and precursors. Accumulation of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and porphobilinogen (PBG) in the circulation is initialised by triggering factors, such as certain medications, fasting, hormonal changes during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and alcohol, via up-regulation of ALA synthase (ALAS1). ALAS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of the haem biosynthesis in the liver. Each of the four AHPs (acute intermittent porphyria, AIP, hereditary coproporphyria, HCP, variegate porphyria, VP, and ALA dehydratase, ALAD, deficiency porphyria) results from a partial deficiency in one of the enzymes in the haem biosynthesis. All of them manifest with a similar clinical picture of an attack.

Mild mental symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, irritability and even mild cognitive decline occur at the preliminary stage of an attack, independent on its severity, commonly prior to abdominal pain. Acute encephalopathy manifests as aberrant behaviour, hallucinations, confusion, or decreased consciousness (19–58% of attacks), hyponatremia (25–61%) or seizures (1–20%) with or without hyponatremia (Table 1). Seizures are transient, presenting only in severe attacks with AE, and do not occur in remission.

Indications/patient selection — initial evaluation for acute lower-extremity ischemia centers on history, examination, and targeted testing, with emphasis on defining embolic versus thrombotic etiology. Patient selection "is determined by a number of clinical findings of the limb in question", and "an appropriate history and physical examination and an evaluation of the patient for absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy should be performed". The history and exam "should focus on" pain, sensory and motor changes, pallor, and temperature, while laboratory tests "should be obtained to assess for renal function, baseline hematocrit and coagulation profile, and evidence of hyperkalemia and acidosis". An "electrocardiogram may be obtained to ascertain if any cardiac arrhythmias are present and to assess for a recent myocardial infarction". Etiologic assessment informs management; in embolic events, "the heart is the source in 80%–90% of cases", and "arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can have a 3%–6% annual risk of thromboembolic complications if they are not treated with anticoagulation".

### Diagnosis and management of Guillain-Barrésyndrome in ten steps [^1138rkon]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Box 1 Diagnostic criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome

This box lists the diagnostic criteria for Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)and subsequently modified in a review paper. We have added some features that cast doubt on the diagnosis, which were not mentioned in the original criteria, and have made some adaptations to improve readability. These criteria are not applicable to some of the specific variants of GBS, as described in Table 1.

Features required for diagnosis
Progressive bilateral weakness of arms and legs (initially only legs may be involved) a
Absent or decreased tendon reflexes in affected limbs (at some point in clinical course) a

Features that strongly support diagnosis
Progressive phase lasts from days to 4 weeks (usually < 2 weeks)
Relative symmetry of symptoms and signs
Relatively mild sensory symptoms and signs (absent in pure motor variant) a
Cranial nerve involvement, especially bilateral facial palsy a
Autonomic dysfunction
Muscular or radicular back or limb pain b
Increased protein level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); normal protein levels do not rule out the diagnosis b
Electrodiagnostic features of motor or sensorimotor neuropathy (normal electrophysiology in the early stages does not rule out the diagnosis) b

Features that cast doubt on diagnosis
Increased numbers of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear cells in CSF (> 50 × 10 6 /l)
Marked, persistent asymmetry of weakness
Bladder or bowel dysfunction at onset or persistent during disease course b
Severe respiratory dysfunction with limited limb weakness at onset b
Sensory signs with limited weakness at onset a
Fever at onset
Nadir < 24 h b
Sharp sensory level indicating spinal cord injury a
Hyper-reflexia or clonus b
Extensor plantar responses b
Abdominal pain b
Slow progression with limited weakness without respiratory involvement
Continued progression for > 4 weeks after start of symptoms b
Alteration of consciousness (except in Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis) b

Minor adaptations were made by the authors to a simplified version of the original NINDS criteria. a Statements in NINDS criteria that were adapted by authors to improve readability. b Additional features which were not included in the NINDS. Note: for clarity, we have omitted 'Features that rule out the diagnosis' from the original NINDS criteria for this adapted version.

### Porphyrias [^116dYNcj]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Hereditary porphyrias are a group of eight metabolic disorders of the haem biosynthesis pathway that are characterised by acute neurovisceral symptoms, skin lesions, or both. Every porphyria is caused by abnormal function of a separate enzymatic step, resulting in a specific accumulation of haem precursors. Seven porphyrias are the result of a partial enzyme deficiency, and a gain of function mechanism has been characterised in a new porphyria. Acute porphyrias present with acute attacks, typically consisting of severe abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, confusion, and seizure, and can be life-threatening. Cutaneous porphyrias present with either acute painful photosensitivity or skin fragility and blisters. Rare recessive porphyrias usually manifest in early childhood with either severe cutaneous photosensitivity and chronic haemolysis or chronic neurological symptoms with or without photosensitivity. Porphyrias are still underdiagnosed, but when they are suspected, and dependent on clinical presentation, simple first-line tests can be used to establish the diagnosis in all symptomatic patients. Diagnosis is essential to enable specific treatments to be started as soon as possible. Screening of families to identify presymptomatic carriers is crucial to decrease risk of overt disease of acute porphyrias through counselling about avoidance of potential precipitants.

### Intra-abdominal infections [^113J9Eck]. Microbes and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections in the hospitalized patient differ from those arising in the community in their clinical presentation, sites of involvement, and characteristic microbiology. They are also associated with greater morbidity and mortality. New onset organ dysfunction, more than acute abdominal pain and tenderness, is the predominant clinical manifestation. Successful management depends on aggressive resuscitation and hemodynamic support, administration of adequate antimicrobial therapy, and the timely use of source control measures appropriate to the clinical situation.

### Epigastric pain… it's not always alcohol! an unusual presentation of caecal intussusception [^115H9rf9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Our patient is a 19-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after consuming 50–60 units of alcohol over a weekend. He presented with a 2-day history of right-upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain radiating to the back. On examination he was haemodynamically stable. His abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness in the RUQ, epigastric and right-iliac fossa areas. Laboratory results showed a slightly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Amylase and white cell count were normal. Ultrasound was performed raising the suspicion of intussusception. A CT scan was recommended and confirmed the presence of an intussusception. Once diagnosis was established, the patient had an emergency laparotomy and right hemicoloectomy, with per-operative findings consistent with the CT findings. This case illustrates the importance of keeping an open approach to all differentials while considering a diagnosis along with the importance of recognising intussusception when it occurs as complications can each represent a cause of mortality on their own.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute porphyrias [^117WEns6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The acute porphyrias, 4 inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis, cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms that mimic many other acute medical and psychiatric conditions. Lack of clinical recognition often delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. We review the clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and genetics of the acute porphyrias and provide recommendations for diagnosis and treatment on the basis of reviews of the literature and clinical experience. An acute porphyria should be considered in many patients with unexplained abdominal pain or other characteristic symptoms. The diagnosis can be rapidly confirmed by demonstration of a markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen level by using a single-void urine specimen. This specimen should also be saved for quantitative measurement of porphobilinogen, 5-aminolevulinic acid, and total porphyrin levels. Intravenous hemin therapy, started as soon as possible, is the most effective treatment. Intravenous glucose alone is appropriate only for mild attacks (mild pain, no paresis or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available. Precipitating factors should be eliminated, and appropriate supportive and symptomatic therapy should be initiated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment greatly improve prognosis and may prevent development of severe or chronic neuropathic symptoms. We recommend identification of at-risk relatives through enzymatic or gene studies.

### Atypical presentation of transverse myelitis in the emergency department [^115sCefb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammatory disorder of the spinal cord characterized by acute onset sensory loss and motor weakness below the level of the lesion. The etiology of the disease is varied, and diagnosis of TM in the Emergency Department (ED) can be difficult owing to the low incidence of the disease, and frequently insidious onset. We report a case of a 59-year-old female who presented to the ED from home with left upper quadrant abdominal pain and flank pain of sudden onset. While in the ED, she experienced left lower extremity weakness and sensory changes that slowly progressed bilaterally, and ultimately was diagnosed with transverse myelitis. Transverse myelitis rarely diagnosed in the ED setting, but it is an important clinical consideration when evaluating ED patients presenting with both pain and progressive neurologic symptoms.

Abstract.

A 32-year-old medical practitioner presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, 1 week after the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient did not report any comorbid conditions, alcohol usage, or gallstone disease. Laboratory and radiological investigations revealed the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. He underwent conservative management and was discharged after 3 days of hospital admission. This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis, and the need for clinicians to carefully evaluate patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints during the current pandemic.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (isolyte S) [^114GVZ4B]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume.

Reactions reported with the use of potassium-containing solutions include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, areflexia, muscular or respiratory paralysis, mental confusion, weakness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest. Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function, and intestinal ileus and dilatation.

If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.

Abnormally high plasma levels of magnesium can result in flushing, sweating, hypotension, circulatory collapse, and depression of cardiac and central nervous system function. Respiratory depression is the most immediate threat to life. Magnesium deficits can result in tachycardia, hypertension, hyperirritability and psychotic behavior.

The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and venous irritation. Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance. Use of the largest peripheral vein and a small bore needle is recommended. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume.

Reactions reported with the use of potassium-containing solutions include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, areflexia, muscular or respiratory paralysis, mental confusion, weakness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest.

Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function, and intestinal ileus and dilatation.

If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.

The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reaction to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1126CBc2]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — annual liver disease monitoring: Best Practice Advice 9 states that patients with AHP should be monitored annually for liver disease. Liver enzymes have been elevated in approximately 13% of patients with AHP during acute attacks and in some patients without clinical symptoms, and in the ENVISION clinical trial of patients with recurrent AHP attacks, baseline serum aminotransferase elevations were reported in 28% of patients.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^111wLdch]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

POTS conclusions — The condition is described as "a relatively chronic, idiopathic disorder of adolescents and young adults that may include abdominal symptoms". A "rapid office screen of orthostatic vital signs and focused review of symptoms is likely to accurately identify at least a subgroup of recurrent abdominal pain patients who also have POTS features".
