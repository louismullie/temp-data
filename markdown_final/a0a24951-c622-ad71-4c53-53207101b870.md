## Question

Abdominal pain with diarrhea assessment and testing recommendations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to assess and test patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the presentation by duration and severity. Then, I should verify alarm features that mandate expedited workup. Next, I will consider the initial history and examination elements that narrow the differential. After that, I need to outline testing for acute versus chronic diarrhea, including infectious, inflammatory, malabsorptive, and structural etiologies. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm with escalation triggers, making sure I double-check conflicting guidance where it appears.

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification, because everything downstream depends on it. Duration separates acute diarrhea, typically less than 4 weeks, from chronic diarrhea, 4 weeks or longer, and this threshold is consistently used across guidelines and reviews, which helps frame the differential and testing strategy [^717dfbbc]. I should also confirm severity and risk context: dysentery, dehydration, immunocompromise, pregnancy, extremes of age, and public health risks such as outbreak exposure or high-risk occupations shift pretest probabilities and testing thresholds upward [^8d33569b] [^9d948568].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before screening for alarm features that override routine pathways. I need to check for weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, nocturnal symptoms, fever, severe abdominal pain, age over 50 with new symptoms, family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and immunocompromise, because these features lower the threshold for invasive testing and expedited referral [^03df26fe] [^4a0b52c5]. I should double-check that even in suspected IBS, alarm features still prompt broader evaluation rather than a purely functional diagnosis, which is reinforced by ACG and BSG guidance [^fadd7272] [^d8c08c2a].

> Next, I should review the initial history and physical examination with a structured approach. Let me consider chronology, stool characteristics, associated symptoms, dietary triggers, medication exposures including antibiotics and metformin, travel, animal or childcare exposures, surgical history including cholecystectomy or ileal resection, and family history of GI disease, while on exam I assess for dehydration, abdominal tenderness or masses, and perianal disease, because these elements shape pretest probabilities and test selection [^41038d3b] [^2bf86698]. Wait, let me verify that persistent abdominal pain, especially right lower quadrant pain in children, raises concern for Yersinia and mesenteric adenitis, which IDSA highlights as a targeted testing indication [^13841d2a].

> For acute diarrhea with abdominal pain, I should confirm when stool testing is warranted. Indications include dysentery, moderate to severe disease, symptoms beyond 7 days, immunocompromise, outbreak exposure, or high risk of transmission, and in these settings testing for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, C. difficile, and STEC is recommended, with STEC testing prioritized when stools are bloody and C. difficile testing considered with recent antibiotic exposure or healthcare association [^8d33569b] [^6a2f794e] [^3ea7defb]. I need to ensure I avoid reflexive antibiotics in watery, noninflammatory illness because most cases are viral and empiric antimicrobials offer little benefit and may cause harm, reserving therapy for dysentery or high-risk scenarios after diagnostics if possible [^f927eebd].

> For chronic diarrhea with abdominal pain, I will now examine first-line laboratory screening. Routine blood tests such as CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, and TSH provide baseline assessment and clues to malabsorption or inflammation, while stool studies should include fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for inflammatory diarrhea, C. difficile in appropriate risk contexts, and ova and parasite testing with a focus on Giardia when risk is present, given its prevalence and test performance [^632f4785] [^fadd7272] [^07277b5c]. Wait, I initially thought ESR or CRP might be useful screens for IBD, but the AGA advises against using ESR or CRP alone to screen for IBD in chronic diarrhea, so I should correct that and rely on fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin instead, reserving CRP for selected cases within an IBS evaluation framework rather than as a standalone IBD screen [^a2ffac19] [^fadd7272].

> I should confirm celiac disease testing in the right patients. The AGA recommends tTG-IgA with a second test to detect IgA deficiency when chronic diarrhea is present, given celiac disease's frequency and the consequences of missing it, and positive serology should be confirmed with duodenal biopsy before committing to a lifelong gluten-free diet [^70ad93b9] [^740a6567]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when IBS is suspected, and yes, ACG also recommends serologic testing for celiac disease in IBS-D, reinforcing its place in the initial workup [^fadd7272].

> Let me consider bile acid diarrhea, which is underrecognized. I should check for risk factors such as terminal ileal disease or resection, cholecystectomy, or pelvic radiation, and if suspected, either test with SeHCAT where available or use an empiric trial of bile acid sequestrants, recognizing that North American access to validated assays is limited and that an empiric cholestyramine trial is reasonable in expert guidance [^f4286f10] [^f2996f37]. I need to ensure I do not overcall BAD in the absence of compatible features, so anchoring on risk factors and response to therapy is prudent [^f4286f10].

> For suspected inflammatory bowel disease, I should double-check the noninvasive screening strategy. Fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin plus CRP improve the likelihood of IBD when positive, though I must remember that in older adults, colorectal cancer and ischemic colitis rise on the differential, so colonoscopy remains pivotal when alarm features or positive screens are present [^4a692271] [^3766d4af]. But wait, what if the patient is young with classic IBS features and no alarms? In that scenario, ACG supports a positive diagnostic strategy for IBS-D with minimal testing, reserving colonoscopy for those over 45 or with warning signs, which helps avoid unnecessary procedures [^fadd7272].

> When should I escalate to endoscopy or imaging? I need to ensure I do not delay necessary structural evaluation. Colonoscopy with biopsies is indicated for alarm features, unexplained chronic diarrhea, or altered bowel habits with rectal bleeding to exclude colorectal cancer and microscopic colitis, and upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies is appropriate when malabsorption is suspected and colonoscopic evaluation is unrevealing [^fc40b4b8] [^f77d8273]. In elderly patients or when acute severe disease is suspected, cross-sectional imaging such as CT may be appropriate to evaluate for complications or alternative diagnoses, and in children with suspected IBD, MR enterography or video capsule can help assess small bowel disease while minimizing radiation [^3766d4af].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts. In immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, maintain a broad differential and obtain stool cultures, viral studies, and parasite testing before empiric therapy, and in IBD flares, always test for C. difficile because prevalence and severity are higher and management nuances differ [^9d948568] [^12c9720d]. In pregnancy, avoid radiation and prioritize ultrasound or MRI when imaging is needed, and in children, use fecal calprotectin plus CRP and hemoglobin to triage endoscopy, which reduces unnecessary procedures while maintaining sensitivity for IBD [^9ed9ad2b] [^6f3bad07].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with duration and alarm features to branch into acute versus chronic and urgent versus routine pathways, then apply targeted stool testing for acute disease and a tiered laboratory approach for chronic disease, followed by selective endoscopy or imaging based on results and risk, and incorporate empiric trials such as bile acid binders or dietary strategies when appropriate, documenting shared decision-making throughout [^8d33569b] [^4a692271] [^fadd7272]. I should double-check that this aligns with BSG's emphasis on history-driven testing and AGA's recommendations for minimal, high-yield diagnostics in IBS-D, which it does, while still preserving the low threshold to investigate alarms [^41038d3b] [^4a692271].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed key controversies and corrected any missteps. I initially considered ESR or CRP as general screens for IBD in chronic diarrhea, but the AGA advises against using ESR or CRP alone for this purpose, so I should rely on fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin and use CRP selectively within an IBS evaluation framework, not as a standalone IBD screen [^a2ffac19]. I also briefly conflated acute and chronic thresholds for stool testing; I should confirm that for acute diarrhea, testing is generally reserved for dysentery, moderate to severe disease, or symptoms beyond 7 days, whereas for chronic diarrhea, baseline blood and stool testing to exclude malabsorption and inflammation is appropriate even in the absence of alarms, with escalation based on results and clinical evolution [^8d33569b] [^4a692271].

For abdominal pain with diarrhea, start with a **focused history and exam** to classify duration, severity, and alarm features [^41038d3b]. For acute symptoms (< 4 weeks), test stool for **bacterial pathogens, C. difficile, and parasites** if there is dysentery, severe disease, duration > 7 days, immunocompromise, or outbreak risk [^8d33569b] [^79d75d81]. For chronic symptoms (≥ 4 weeks), obtain CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver panels, TSH, celiac serology with IgA, and stool for fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin, C. difficile, and Giardia; add colonoscopy with biopsies for alarm features or when results are inconclusive [^4a692271] [^fadd7272] [^fc40b4b8]. Reserve CT/MRI for severe or unclear cases, and tailor testing to immunocompromised, elderly, or travel-exposed patients [^3766d4af] [^9d948568].

## Summary of diagnostic approach

| **Clinical scenario** | **Initial tests** | **Further tests if indicated** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute diarrhea | - Stool culture <br/> - C. difficile <br/> - Parasites (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) <br/> - CBC <br/> - Electrolytes | - CT/MRI if severe or unclear <br/> - Endoscopy if persistent |
| Chronic diarrhea | - CBC <br/> - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal/liver function <br/> - TSH <br/> - Celiac serology <br/> - Fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin <br/> - Giardia <br/> - C. difficile | - Colonoscopy with biopsies <br/> - SeHCAT or empiric bile acid binder <br/> - Fecal elastase <br/> - MR enterography/capsule <br/> - Hydrogen breath tests |

---

A structured approach to abdominal pain with diarrhea begins with **history and exam** to classify symptoms and identify alarms, followed by **targeted stool and blood tests**, and escalation to colonoscopy or imaging when indicated. This strategy balances diagnostic yield, cost, and patient risk.

OVERARCHING CLINICAL QUESTION A

What are the optimal diagnosis and staging strategies for adult women with ovarian masses and/or EOC?

Evaluation and diagnosis of adult women with ovarian masses or symptoms of EOC (Recommendations 1.1–1.4)

Recommendations on evaluation and diagnosis for women with ovarian masses are provided in Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Figures A 1, A 2, A 8, and A 9. These recommendations are adapted, and in some cases modified from the guidelines from the developers Belgian KCE, Irish NCEC, SIGN, BGCS, and ASCO and SGO and informed by clinical expertise.

Diagnostic Strategies

Discussion

These recommendations concern assessment for adult women with ovarian masses in basic, limited, and enhanced settings.

Basic-resource settings

Women with ovarian cancer may report generalized symptoms of pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal bloating, or feeling full with small meals or early satiety. Other focal signs can include a patient's report of a mass noted in the abdomen or symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal or pelvic pain, and change in bowel function with diarrhea or constipation (for the latter, symptoms of < 12 months duration and occurring more than 12 times per month). Women presenting with symptoms associated with possible EOC require an evaluation. The cause of underlying symptoms, generally nonspecific but potentially severe or life-impacting in nature, needs to be determined and may lead to a potential cancer diagnosis. A general practitioner in a basic-resource setting has to rely on the patient's history and physical examination findings to determine the need for diagnostic testing. Initial assessment by a general practitioner includes a complete physical examination, focusing on the abdominal and pelvic examination, to determine the presence of any pelvic or ovarian mass. A clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be discussed on the basis of certain complements of symptoms. A symptom index has been validated and may be helpful in guiding care. Measuring the serum CA-125 tumor marker alone is not validated for diagnostic use; however, if more than 300 IU/mL, can be suggestive of serous ovarian cancer. CA-125 is less useful for women who are premenopausal, with early-stage ovarian cancer, with ovarian cancer of other epithelial types, or with nonepithelial ovarian tumors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic diarrhea, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, CD-EG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain testing in the presence of alarm features, when the differential diagnosis can be effectively distinguished based on test results, or when the differential diagnosis remains broad and initial testing will limit the number of additional tests needed. Consider offering a therapeutic trial for disorders without definitive diagnostic tests.

### Suspected inflammatory bowel disease – the clinical and economic impact of competing diagnostic strategies [^e45aa472]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The suspicion of IBD in patients presenting with nonspecific abdominal pain and diarrhea results in the extensive use of invasive diagnostic testing in patients likely to have a functional GI disorder. Noninvasive serodiagnostic tests, however, accurately identify IBD and may serve as effective screening tools. The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of initial serodiagnostic screening followed by standard invasive testing, compared to standard invasive testing alone, in patients presenting with uninvestigated symptoms suggestive of IBD.

Methods

Decision analysis was performed to compare the costs and outcomes of competing diagnostic strategies. Probability estimates were derived from the medical literature and expert opinion. Costs estimates were obtained from the Medicare Fee schedule and the cost-analysis was done from a third party payer perspective. The target population was patients with uninvestigated symptoms suggestive of IBD. The outcome measure was cost per correct diagnosis in competing strategies and was assessed at 1 yr.

Results

In the base case analysis, the serodiagnostic strategies were dominant; they were less costly and more accurate than the standard invasive strategies. Sequential serodiagnostic strategies resulted in the largest cost savings ($550 per average patient) with an average cost per correct diagnosis of $1640 compared to $2188 for standard invasive testing. Cost savings were attributable to a 39% reduction in the use of invasive tests. The results were robust to varying model estimates over prespecified ranges in the sensitivity analyses. When costs of invasive testing are reduced by 80% or the prevalence of IBD is at least 83%, serodiagnostic strategies are no longer the most cost-effective.

Conclusions

Initial serodiagnostic screening strategies may represent a cost-effective alternative to standard invasive diagnostic strategies. The economic benefits seem to be achieved by avoiding invasive evaluations in patients without IBD. Confirmation of these findings in a prospective comparative trial seems to be warranted.

### AGA institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^7c8fd4cb]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^740a6567]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Celiac disease — indications for testing (Recommendations 7A and 7B) specify that patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence suggestive of malabsorption, such as chronic diarrhea with weight loss, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, should be tested for CD. Patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory evidence for which CD is a treatable cause should be considered for testing for CD. Patients with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD should be tested if they show possible signs, symptoms or laboratory evidence of CD. Consider testing of asymptomatic relatives with a first-degree family member who has a confirmed diagnosis of CD.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^3b16ecb9]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) severity assessment — patients should be evaluated to determine the severity of CDI and for the presence of peritonitis or multisystem organ failure. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Clinical assessment and laboratory testing (complete blood count and renal and liver function) are typically performed to evaluate the patient and to help identify potential organ failure and associated sepsis, and a significant leukocytosis typically raises the suspicion for CDI but is not considered pathognomonic. The stratification of the severity of CDI as mild/nonsevere, severe, or severe-complicated/fulminant is loosely defined; diarrhea, leukocytosis (but less than 15 × 10³/μL), and abdominal pain with positive testing for C difficile in the absence of hypotension or organ failure such as kidney injury is typically defined as mild disease, whereas severe CDI typically includes an elevated creatinine or leukocytosis over 15 × 10³/μL.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^09d19594]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

These guidelines deal with clinical assessment in primary and secondary care of a patient with diarrhoea, the exclusion of cancer or inflammation, and detecting common disorders such as bile acid diarrhoea, microscopic colitis, lactose malabsorption or post radiation diarrhoea, together with rarer causes of malabsorption and surgical disorders as outlined in figure 1. Options for therapy are not dealt with as it is beyond the remit of this guideline, nor has the cost effectiveness of investigations been addressed due to paucity of available evidence.

Summary of all recommendations

We recommend the following investigation algorithm based on the clinical differential diagnosis outlined in figure 1.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^717dfbbc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Chronic unexplained diarrhea: a logical and cost-effective approach to assessment [^4d4b6de4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The workup of chronic unexplained diarrhea can be equally frustrating for care providers and patients. It carries a physical, financial, and social toll. In this review we provide a sensible approach to evaluating and managing chronic diarrhea.

Recent Findings

Bile acid diarrhea is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause behind some cases of chronic diarrhea.

Summary

A detailed history and physical examination can provide clues that guide a logical approach to the evaluation. We suggest a cost-effective approach to the workup and management of chronic diarrhea based on individual patient factors related to clinical history and physical exam. We find that this approach leads to initiation of treatment in a time-efficient fashion and avoids unnecessary testing.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^4640005b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Diarrhea is a common yet complex disorder precipitated by multiple etiologic and pathogenic mechanisms. Distinguishing these conditions from each other can be problematic, especially where symptoms overlap. This is highlighted in individuals with IBS-D: in the United States, up to 75% of patients meeting the criteria remain undiagnosed. This is concerning because IBS is the most common cause of diarrhea and can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on a few simple binary questions and minimal diagnostic testing.

One of the most reported mimickers of IBS-D is EPI, and it is not uncommon for patients with EPI to be misdiagnosed with IBS-D. Consequently, we have proposed an algorithm designed specifically to help distinguish between these 2 disorders (Fig. 3) and differentiate them from other etiologies of chronic diarrhea. Most importantly, this algorithm incorporates recommendations from the recently published ACG and AGA IBS guidelines stressing a positive diagnostic strategy. This simple algorithm should assist practitioners in making timely diagnoses and reduce superfluous testing, thus reducing delays in treatment and improving patient health and quality of life.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^f927eebd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Test strategies to predict inflammatory bowel disease among children with nonbloody diarrhea [^6f3bad07]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated 4 diagnostic strategies to predict the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children who present with chronic nonbloody diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study including 193 patients aged 6 to 18 years who underwent a standardized diagnostic workup in secondary or tertiary care hospitals. Each patient was assessed for symptoms, C-reactive protein (> 10 mg/L), hemoglobin (< -2 SD for age and sex), and fecal calprotectin (≥ 250 μg/g). Patients with rectal bleeding or perianal disease were excluded because the presence of these findings prompted endoscopy regardless of their biomarkers. Primary outcome was IBD confirmed by endoscopy or IBD ruled out by endoscopy or uneventful clinical follow-up for 6 months.

Results

Twenty-two of 193 (11%) children had IBD. The basic prediction model was based on symptoms only. Adding blood or stool markers increased the AUC from 0.718 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.604–0.832) to 0.930 (95% CI: 0.884–0.977) and 0.967 (95% CI: 0.945–0.990). Combining symptoms with blood and stool markers outperformed all other strategies (AUC 0.997 [95% CI: 0.993–1.000]). Triaging with a strategy that involves symptoms, blood markers, and calprotectin will result in 14 of 100 patients being exposed to endoscopy. Three of them will not have IBD, and no IBD-affected child will be missed.

Conclusions

Evaluating symptoms plus blood and stool markers in patients with nonbloody diarrhea is the optimal test strategy that allows pediatricians to reserve a diagnostic endoscopy for children at high risk for IBD.

Consultative management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) gastrointestinal (GI) and liver issues — best practice statements are as follows: In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days. In a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity. There is presently inadequate evidence to support stool testing for diagnosis or monitoring of COVID-19 as part of routine clinical practice. In patients (outpatients or inpatients) with elevated LFTs in context of suspected or known COVID-19, evaluate for alternative etiologies. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain baseline LFTs at the time of admission and consider LFT monitoring throughout the hospitalization, particularly in the context of drug treatment for COVID-19. In hospitalized patients undergoing drug treatment for COVID-19, evaluate for treatment-related GI and hepatic adverse effects.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria context for trials notes that the Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by deleting abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months, resulting in fewer individuals meeting Rome IV than Rome III. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that generally measure changes in abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria are described as more applicable, but it is not known whether these diagnostic changes would alter the efficacy and safety of IBS treatments in RCTs.

Bile Acid Diarrhea (BAD) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea, often accompanied by urgency, occasional fecal incontinence, abdominal pain, and fatigue. A nationwide survey has shown limited awareness of BAD within the Italian medical community, prompting a panel of experts to develop a Position Paper that outlines the most practical and cost-saving diagnostic investigations and treatments for this frequently overlooked condition. The document provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and classification of the different types of Bile Acid Diarrhea (BAD). A key focus is the diagnostic approach to identifying and managing the many undiagnosed BAD patients in both primary care and specialized medical settings. Finally, the paper addresses the optimal therapeutic strategies for BAD, including traditional bile acid sequestrants and newer, promising treatments.

### Diagnosing the patient with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits: is it irritable bowel syndrome? [^03df26fe]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Diagnosing a patient who presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits can be challenging. Although serious organic illnesses can cause these symptoms, irritable bowel syndrome is commonly responsible. It can be difficult to properly evaluate these patients without overusing diagnostic tests and consultation. A practical approach for diagnosing irritable bowel syndrome is suggested, using the Rome II criteria and the presence of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, fever, or frequent nocturnal symptoms as starting points. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are not met, it is acceptable to reevaluate the patient at a later date. If there are no alarm symptoms and the Rome II criteria are met, the patient should be categorized on the basis of age: patients 50 years or younger can be evaluated on the basis of predominant symptoms — constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Patients older than 50 years should be fully evaluated and considered for gastroenterology referral. If alarm symptoms are present, a full evaluation should be performed (and gastroenterology referral considered), regardless of the patient's age.

### A Bayesian approach to acute infectious diarrhea in adults [^c104d5bc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea is a yearly occurrence for most Americans, and is associated with 1 million hospitalizations and about 6000 deaths in the United States annually. Up to 80% of acute infectious diarrhea is caused by noroviruses, which produce a clinically mild illness with a predictable short course and good outcome that make laboratory testing and antimicrobial treatment unnecessary. Most diarrhea-causing bacteria and protozoa can cause a clinical illness "like norovirus"; when they do so in healthy adults neither specialized testing nor antimicrobials is required. The presence or absence of epidemiologic evidence (such as travel, hospitalization, antibiotic use, other exposures)and clinical evidence (such as diarrhea frequency and duration, severity of abdominal pain and fever, character of stool, presence of chronic illness or immune deficiency) can change the probability of "not norovirus" from as low as 8% to as high as 100%. Such probabilities guide the use of laboratory testing and antimicrobial therapy in patients who have acute infectious diarrhea.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^3766d4af]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

Background & Aims

Chronic diarrhea affects about 5% of the population overall. Altered bile acid metabolism is a common but frequently undiagnosed cause.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of publication databases for studies of assessment and management of bile acid diarrhea (BAD). The certainty (quality) of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome questions were developed through an iterative process and were voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The certainty of evidence was generally rated as very low. Therefore, 16 of 17 recommendations are conditional. In patients with chronic diarrhea, consideration of risk factors (terminal ileal resection, cholecystectomy, or abdominal radiotherapy), but not additional symptoms, was recommended for identification of patients with possible BAD. The group suggested testing using 75 selenium homocholic acid taurine (where available) or 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, including patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, functional diarrhea, and Crohn's disease without inflammation. Testing was suggested over empiric bile acid sequestrant therapy (BAST). Once remediable causes are managed, the group suggested cholestyramine as initial therapy, with alternate BAST when tolerability is an issue. The group suggested against BAST for patients with extensive ileal Crohn's disease or resection and suggested alternative antidiarrheal agents if BAST is not tolerated. Maintenance BAST should be given at the lowest effective dose, with a trial of intermittent, on-demand administration, concurrent medication review, and reinvestigation for patients whose symptoms persist despite BAST.

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review, BAD should be considered for patients with chronic diarrhea. For patients with positive results from tests for BAD, a trial of BAST, initially with cholestyramine, is suggested.

### The science, evidence, and practice of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome [^4a72ff97]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder that is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates published trials.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — evaluation of chronic diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D): Current evidence supports the use of fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin and stool testing for Giardia in patients presenting with chronic diarrhea. The panel suggests against the use of blood tests ESR or CRP to screen for IBD. Our evidence profiles also strongly recommend testing for celiac disease with IgA-tTG and a second test to detect celiac disease in the setting of IgA deficiency. In addition, testing for bile acid diarrhea is suggested. The AGA makes no recommendation for the use of currently available serologic tests for the diagnosis of IBS. A clinical decision support tool is included to guide the evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea (> 4 weeks).

### Imaging of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^9ed9ad2b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this review is to examine the current imaging literature and develop basic imaging guidelines for evaluation of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The three following typical clinical scenarios in the imaging evaluation of IBD are considered: patient with an initial diagnosis of suspected IBD, the goals being to determine disease extent and severity and to differentiate Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis; patient with known IBD presenting with new acute symptoms (fever, peritonitis, leukocytosis) requiring urgent evaluation; and patient with known IBD presenting with nonacute symptomatic recurrence (abdominal pain, diarrhea), the goals being to assess the efficacy of the current treatment and to evaluate the possible need for additional medical or surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Imaging of pediatric patients with IBD must balance considerations of diagnostic accuracy against concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation and tolerance of the imaging technique. The imaging modality chosen depends on the clinical presentation and expected pathologic finding.

Celiac disease testing for chronic diarrhea (American Gastroenterological Association [AGA]) — In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA recommends testing for celiac disease with IgA tissue transglutaminase and a second test to detect celiac disease in the setting of IgA deficiency; Strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence. Testing options for IgA-deficient subjects include IgG tissue transglutaminase and IgG or IgA deamidated gliadin peptides. The sensitivity of serum IgA-tTG using thresholds in the 7–15 AU/mL range is typically > 90% and the specificity is typically slightly higher, and a positive test would warrant confirmation by duodenal biopsy. In adults, small bowel biopsy should be used to confirm a serologic diagnosis of celiac disease before committing a patient to a strict gluten-free diet.

Bloody stools are not an expected manifestation of infection with C. difficile. STEC O157 should be assessed by culture and non-O157 STEC should be detected by Shiga toxin or genomic assays (strong, low). Sorbitol-MacConkey agar or an appropriate chromogenic agar alternative is recommended to screen for O157:H7 STEC; detection of Shiga toxin is needed to detect other STEC serotype (strong, moderate).

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^6a74eefd]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

AN ALGORITHM FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA: FOCUS ON IBS-D AND EPI

Using the four-step procedure described above, we have refined and developed a straightforward algorithm to assist clinicians in differentiating IBS-D and EPI from other diarrhea syndromes (Fig. 3). Use of this algorithm should minimize diagnostic testing and reduce health care expenditure by avoiding unnecessary investigations and may result in more timely and appropriate diagnosis and management. The algorithm provides a simple framework for making a rapid and accurate diagnosis of IBS-D. It begins with three "rule-in" questions to determine alignment with Rome IV criteria for IBS: (1) Do you experience pain? (2) Does the pain improve or worsen with defecation? and/or (3) Is the pain associated with changes in stool frequency or texture? If the answers to these three rule-in questions are positive, and in the absence of a few alarm symptoms/signs (Fig. 3), IBS-D can be diagnosed with an accuracy approaching 97%. In this scenario, minimal diagnostic testing is warranted. However, if alarm symptoms are present (eg, weight loss) and if EPI is suspected as the cause of chronic diarrhea, nutritional markers, and FE-1 are indicated, with any abnormal results making exploration of the pancreas mandatory. If the pancreas looks normal, then a false positive FE-1 test is likely, EPI can be excluded, and another cause of chronic diarrhea should be sought.

Diarrhea generates a wide range of diagnostic considerations and has profound individual and public health significance. The setting and circumstances under which a patient presents with diarrhea drastically influences the concern brought to the encounter. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are often provisionally labeled "gastroenteritis" with appropriate expectant management. In resource-poor countries, the significance of diarrhea is even greater. This review focuses on diarrhea and its initial evaluation and management in the emergency department.

### A practical guide to managing patients with systemic symptoms and breast implants [^5db3b212]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Symptoms

Gastrointestinal complaints reported in association with breast implants are usually abdominal pain and changes in bowel movement patterns consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Notably, IBS with episodes of alternating diarrhea and constipation have been reported by patients with breast implants and other systemic symptoms. Evaluation should include a history of the location and duration of abdominal pain as well as a history of disordered bowel habits (ie, constipation, diarrhea, or both) and their temporal association with abdominal pain episodes. Changes in diet or medications that affect gastrointestinal transit should also be assessed. Although the need for laboratory and other diagnostic testing is typically minimal for routine evaluation of IBS-like symptoms, limited testing may be required to accurately distinguish disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, lactose and fructose intolerance, and celiac disease. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and to determine the need for endoscopy and colonoscopy.

### AGA institute rapid review of the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of COVID-19, meta-analysis of international data, and recommendations for the consultative management of patients with COVID-19 [^9fccff15]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities, have been variably reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This document provides best practice statements and recommendations for consultative management based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and preprint servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5, 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19, 2020. We pooled the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver function tests abnormalities, using a fixed-effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework.

Results

We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts. We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients. Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms were as follows: diarrhea 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.2%-8.2%), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-8.5%), and abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%). Most studies reported on hospitalized patients. The pooled prevalence estimates of elevated liver abnormalities were as follows: aspartate transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.5%) and alanine transaminase 15.0% (95% CI, 13.6%-16.4%). When we compared studies from China to studies from other countries in subgroup analyses, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China, with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (95% CI, 16.6%-20.1%). Isolated GI symptoms were reported rarely. We also summarized the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID-19.

Conclusions

GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in < 10% of patients. In studies outside of China, estimates are higher. Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and liver function test checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19. Based on findings from our meta-analysis, we provide several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^49e8eb08]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — epidemiology/public health and diagnosis: Diagnostic evaluation using stool culture and culture-independent methods if available should be used in situations where the individual patient is at high risk of spreading disease to others, and during known or suspected outbreaks. Stool diagnostic studies may be of value in cases of dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, and symptoms lasting > 7 days to clarify the etiology of the patient's illness and enable specific directed therapy. Traditional methods of diagnosis fail to reveal the etiology of the majority of cases of acute diarrheal infection; if available, the use of FDA-approved culture-independent methods of diagnosis can be recommended at least as an adjunct to traditional methods. Antibiotic sensitivity testing for management of the individual with acute diarrheal infection is currently not recommended.

### Management of Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^12c9720d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The evidence reviewed in this article is a summation of relevant scientific publications, expert opinion statements, and current practice guidelines. This review is a summary of expert opinion in the field without a formal systematic review of evidence. Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated. However, the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.

### The strategy for biopsies of the terminal ileum should be evidence based [^4b0efe61]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Ileocolonoscopy is regarded as the diagnostic procedure of choice for patients presenting with abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and suspicion of inflammatory bowel diseases. The widespread use of endoscopy has led to an increase of biopsies of the colon and terminal ileum. The diagnostic yield of biopsies of the terminal ileum is not established and is low in unselected patients. Retrospective studies have assessed the diagnostic value of these biopsies in comparison to the indication for ileoscopy and the endoscopic findings. The data suggest that biopsies of the terminal ileum are mainly helpful in patients with inflammatory diarrhea and/or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

GI manifestations of COVID-19

The most common symptoms in COVID-19 are fever and respiratory symptoms, followed by GI symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, dysgeusia, and abdominal pain. Based on the SECURE-IBD registry-based study, about 30% of the patients reported an increase in baseline IBD symptoms. Among the IBD patients, diarrhea was the most common symptom (25.5%), followed by abdominal pain (8.4%), nausea (5.7%), and vomiting (3.2%). In contrast, among non-IBD patients, studies have reported diarrhea in 2–10%, nausea or vomiting in 1–10% and abdominal pain in 2.2–5.8%. The diagnosis of IBD flare-up is challenging in the context of COVID-19, as the typical presenting features of IBD, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, along with elevated inflammatory markers, may also be secondary to COVID-19. However, rectal bleeding is not common in COVID-19. Laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein and ferritin are elevated in both conditions, although occasionally ferritin can be low in UC. Patients with COVID-19 have lymphopenia, whereas in IBD patients, lymphocyte levels are usually normal or elevated. The red blood cell distribution width index has been found to be elevated in nearly half of patients with COVID-19 and has been found to be associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.5, 95%CI 1.4–14.3) and septic shock (aOR 4.6, 95%CI 1.4–15.1). In all cases, standard stool tests, such as stool culture and stool Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin, should also be performed. For patients with severe GI symptoms, abdominal computed tomography or endoscopic evaluation should be considered to assess the bowel inflammation to determine appropriate management.

### Derivation of a clinical prediction rule for evaluating patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea [^b30244a0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop a simple prediction rule to reliably identify abdominal pain patients with diarrhea who may require surgical intervention.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of adults with acute nontraumatic abdominal pain and diarrhea in an urban emergency department (ED). Structured data collection included 109 historical and 28 physical examination items, laboratory and radiographic results, and final diagnosis. The main outcome was operative intervention.

Results

One thousand patients were enrolled; 174 patients with diarrhea were included in this analysis. Patients had a mean age of 39 ± 16 years and were likely to be female (64%) and black (60%). Fifteen (9%) patients received a surgical intervention from the ED. Clinical variables associated with the need for surgical intervention using univariate analysis were age older than 40 years, constant pain, and peritonitis on examination. Using recursive partitioning multivariate analysis, the derived prediction rule included 2 variables: age older than 40 years and constant pain. This rule had a sensitivity of 1.0 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.0) and specificity of 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.30).

Conclusion

Patients older than 40 years with constant abdominal pain and diarrhea are likely to have a surgical cause of their symptoms.

### Evaluation and performance of a newly developed patient-reported outcome instrument for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a clinical study population [^7271b142]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

One of the major strengths of the IBS-D Symptom Diary and Event Log is that it provides rigorous assessment of all important symptoms of IBS-D. The aspects of IBS-D assessed by this instrument provide more specific information regarding a patient's condition or response to therapy compared with a single-item rating system such as the IBS PGI-C. Nevertheless, the ultimate usefulness of an instrument such as this involves a balance between comprehensiveness and feasibility/respondent burden; such issues are particularly important for instruments that are completed daily/per event, such as this one. On initial evaluation of psychometric validity, item level results for the 'Frequency of gas' item were relatively weak and suggested that this item may not be closely related to severity. Here, a five-item summary score omitting the 'Frequency of gas' item was evaluated and results from analyses with that version were equally strong, suggesting that this item may be dispensable. Given that the four-item and three-item summary scores for the Diary also provided remarkably similar results, there may be room to streamline the instrument further. In fact, a previous analysis suggests that 'Stomach pain', which was omitted from the four-item summary score, is a strong candidate for deletion as it is so strongly related to 'Abdominal pain'.

Astellas engaged a group of gastroenterology experts to understand the relevance and clinical applicability of the instrument. The panel was probed about bloating and its potential of being multidimensional. The panel stated that bloating was observed in clinics and seemed very important to patients from the clinical perspective; therefore, it was recommended not to delete the bloating item, but instead to keep it and utilize it as an exploratory endpoint. Another example is the three items associated with abdominal pain (abdominal cramps, pain, and pressure), which Astellas thought should be evaluated as a single score, and the experts concurred. Upon a complete review of the results, the experts were supportive of the relevance, clinical applicability of the instrument, and conceptual framework with regard to items included and their respective domains.
