## Question

Creatinine before and after contrast imaging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to measure serum creatinine before and after contrast-enhanced imaging, how to interpret changes, and what to do about them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-imaging risk assessment and whether to obtain baseline creatinine. Then, I should verify the timing and thresholds for post-contrast creatinine monitoring. Next, I will examine how to interpret creatinine changes in light of background variability and competing causes of AKI. After that, I need to consider special populations and emergency scenarios. Finally, I will integrate prevention strategies and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm with citations to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the pre-imaging step: baseline renal function assessment is recommended in patients at risk, but routine creatinine for everyone is not advised. I should double-check the screening approach. Guidelines endorse using a simple questionnaire to identify high-risk patients who should have creatinine/eGFR measured before contrast, rather than universal testing, which is impractical and low yield in low-risk populations [^93b65b4e] [^5c5bffc0] [^3c7f40cd]. Hold on, I should verify the risk factors that trigger testing: diabetes, CKD, heart failure, older age, volume depletion, nephrotoxic medications, and prior contrast exposure are commonly cited, and many programs use a standardized checklist to operationalize this [^93b65b4e] [^5c5bffc0].

> Next, I should review when to obtain post-contrast creatinine and in whom. Wait, let me verify the timing windows. Most guidance recommends rechecking creatinine 48–72 hours after intra-arterial contrast in patients with eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and some statements extend monitoring to 12–72 hours in high-risk patients more broadly, reflecting that the peak of contrast-associated AKI often occurs within this interval [^6bd9bc9a] [^1696fe1f] [^9c9ff925] [^8d04cd0c]. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize: routine post-contrast creatinine is not recommended for low-risk patients, given the very low incidence of clinically meaningful AKI in that group [^6bd9bc9a] [^1696fe1f].

> I will now examine how to interpret creatinine changes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — background fluctuation in creatinine is common even without contrast, so I should confirm thresholds and context. Contrast-associated AKI is typically defined as a rise in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or ≥ 25% from baseline within 48–72 hours, but studies show that 6–35% of inpatients not exposed to contrast can meet similar thresholds, underscoring the need to consider alternative etiologies and the time course of change [^fbfde571] [^eb96814e]. Let me reconsider the magnitude of risk: in higher-risk cohorts, pooled CIN incidence after contrast-enhanced CT is around 6%, with persistent renal decline in about 1%, whereas in low-risk outpatients the absolute risk is far lower, often < 1% [^bf1c096b] [^b0e51bb6].

> But wait, what if the patient is in an emergency and creatinine is not available? I should confirm the exception pathways. In time-sensitive emergencies such as suspected stroke, PE, or acute aortic syndromes, guidelines advise not delaying indicated contrast-enhanced imaging to obtain creatinine, as the diagnostic benefit outweighs the low incremental AKI risk in most patients, especially when baseline renal function is unknown or presumed normal [^4ebe303c] [^84d1636b]. I need to ensure we document the rationale and, when feasible, obtain creatinine soon after the emergent study to guide follow-up if the patient is high risk [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In patients with CKD stage 4–5 (eGFR < 30), the risk of contrast-associated AKI is higher, so I should double-check that we minimize contrast dose, prefer iso-osmolar agents when supported, and ensure hydration when not contraindicated, with post-procedure creatinine at 48–72 hours if baseline was abnormal or unknown [^6bd9bc9a] [^1696fe1f] [^f446fa96]. In diabetes with CKD, risk is compounded, and in COVID-19 cohorts with moderate CKD, observational data suggest higher rates of creatinine rise after contrast, though confounding is likely and causality cannot be inferred; still, it nudges me toward vigilant monitoring and risk mitigation in these groups [^bf1c096b] [^9dc138cd] [^73a0ed9e].

> I need to check prevention strategies because interpretation is only half the battle. The most consistently supported intervention is periprocedural isotonic intravenous hydration for patients at increased risk, with typical regimens of normal saline before and after contrast; N-acetylcysteine has mixed and largely negative high-quality evidence and is not routinely recommended, though it may be considered in select cases given low risk and cost, but not as a substitute for hydration [^7230bd47] [^1e7da5b9] [^cb32e61c]. Hold on, I should verify contrast agent choice: in high-risk patients, iso-osmolar iodixanol may reduce CIN compared with some low-osmolar agents, but the absolute benefit is modest and must be balanced against clinical needs and availability [^f446fa96] [^e846a3c9].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. Pre-imaging, screen for risk factors; if any are present, obtain baseline creatinine/eGFR and proceed with contrast if indicated, using the lowest effective dose and planning hydration for those at risk; if the screen is negative and the patient is low risk, proceed without routine baseline testing, documenting the rationale [^93b65b4e] [^5c5bffc0] [^3c7f40cd]. Post-imaging, recheck creatinine at 48–72 hours in high-risk patients or when baseline was abnormal or unknown; in low-risk patients, routine post-contrast testing is unnecessary, but counsel patients to seek care for oliguria, dyspnea, or edema in the ensuing days [^6bd9bc9a] [^1696fe1f] [^2068e812]. If creatinine rises, I should confirm the magnitude and timing, exclude other causes of AKI, and manage supportively with hydration and avoidance of nephrotoxins, recognizing that most cases are transient and resolve within 1–3 weeks [^fbfde571] [^5d46d7c1].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with contemporary guidance emphasizing individualized risk–benefit decisions and avoiding unnecessary delays in care. Modern radiology and nephrology guidelines converge on a pragmatic, risk-based pathway that reserves pre- and post-contrast creatinine testing for those who will actually benefit from the information, while allowing clinically urgent contrast studies to proceed when the diagnostic yield is high and the incremental AKI risk is acceptable [^adf2b4b1] [^79f38d8e] [^4ebe303c].

---

Creatinine should be measured **before contrast** in patients with risk factors (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, age > 65, or nephrotoxic drugs) [^5c5bffc0] to establish baseline and guide prevention [^5d0d2813]. Routine pre-contrast creatinine is **not required for low-risk patients** [^7230bd47] [^3c7f40cd]. After contrast, **recheck creatinine at 48–72 hours** in high-risk patients [^6bd9bc9a] to detect contrast-associated AKI, which is typically a ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or ≥ 25% rise from baseline [^fbfde571]. Most cases are transient, but persistent decline can occur in high-risk patients [^bf1c096b]; early detection enables timely management and reduces progression risk [^notfound].

## Indications for pre-contrast creatinine measurement

Pre-contrast creatinine is **not universally required**; it is reserved for patients with risk factors for contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI) [^7230bd47]:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^5c5bffc0].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: especially with renal impairment [^a7262c66].
- **Heart failure**: particularly decompensated [^93b65b4e].
- **Advanced age**: generally > 65 years [^notfound].
- **Nephrotoxic medications**: NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, metformin (hold peri-procedurally if eGFR < 30) [^notfound].
- **Prior contrast exposure**: within 48–72 hours [^7145266a].

Routine pre-contrast creatinine is **unnecessary in low-risk patients** (young, healthy, no comorbidities) [^7230bd47] [^3c7f40cd].

---

## Timing and interpretation of post-contrast creatinine measurement

Post-contrast creatinine should be measured at **48–72 hours** in high-risk patients to detect CA-AKI, defined as a ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or ≥ 25% rise from baseline [^fbfde571]. Early changes may be subtle, so **serial measurements** improve detection [^fbfde571].

---

## Clinical significance of creatinine changes

Creatinine changes after contrast are **typically transient**, peaking at 2–5 days and resolving within 1–3 weeks [^5d46d7c1]. Persistent decline (> 30 days) occurs in ~1% and is more likely with CKD, diabetes, or large contrast volumes [^bf1c096b] [^ff92dab8]. CA-AKI is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, especially in high-risk patients [^8d670035] [^477bc484].

---

## Risk factors for significant creatinine rise

Several factors increase the risk of **significant creatinine rise** after contrast:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Chronic kidney disease (CKD) | eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^5c5bffc0] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Especially with renal impairment [^a7262c66] |
| Heart failure | Particularly decompensated [^93b65b4e] |
| Advanced age | > 65 years [^notfound] |
| High contrast dose | > 100 mL or repeated exposures [^notfound] |
| Nephrotoxic medications | NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, metformin [^notfound] |
| Dehydration | Volume depletion [^5a270de9] |

---

## Preventive strategies

Effective prevention focuses on **risk stratification**, hydration, and contrast minimization:

- **Risk assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. Mehran score) to identify high-risk patients [^a00ba9d1].
- **Hydration**: Isotonic saline before and after contrast reduces CA-AKI risk [^7230bd47] [^1e7da5b9].
- **Contrast minimization**: Use the lowest effective dose; prefer iso-osmolar agents in high-risk patients [^f446fa96] [^e846a3c9].
- **Medication management**: Hold nephrotoxic drugs peri-procedurally [^5a270de9].

---

## Clinical management of elevated creatinine

If creatinine rises after contrast:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Rule out other causes of AKI (e.g. hypotension, nephrotoxins) [^447a5d4c].
- **Supportive care**: Ensure adequate hydration, avoid nephrotoxins, and monitor electrolytes [^7230bd47].
- **Follow-up**: Track renal function until return to baseline; consider nephrology referral if decline persists [^ff92dab8].

---

## Long-term implications

Most creatinine elevations resolve, but persistent decline can occur in high-risk patients, accelerating CKD progression and increasing dialysis risk [^bf1c096b] [^5d46d7c1]. Long-term follow-up is **warranted in high-risk patients** to detect chronic kidney disease progression [^ff92dab8].

---

Creatinine should be measured **before contrast** in patients with risk factors and **rechecked at 48–72 hours** in high-risk patients to detect CA-AKI. Most changes are transient, but persistent decline can occur in high-risk patients; early detection and prevention strategies reduce morbidity and progression.

### In which patients should serum creatinine be measured before iodinated contrast medium administration? [^07ea9464]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Routine measurement of serum creatinine before injection of intravascular iodinated contrast material in all patients would be cumbersome and have an associated cost. There is doubt about whether serum creatinine should be measured routinely in all patients or selectively. The Contrast Media Safety Committee of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology decided to review the literature and draw up guidelines on this important practical issue. A literature search was carried out and summarized in a report. Based on the available information and discussions amongst the members of the Committee, guidelines were produced. The report and guidelines were discussed at the 11th European Symposium on Urogenital Radiology in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The practice for identifying patients at risk of contrast medium induced nephropathy varies considerably from one institution to another. Patients at risk constitute only a small percentage of all cases referred for contrast enhanced imaging examination. However, it is important to identify them and take the necessary precautions. Recent serum creatinine level should be available in patients with an increased probability of a raised serum creatinine level (renal disease, renal surgery, proteinuria, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, gout, current intake of nephrotoxic drugs). A simple guideline has been produced.

### A retrospective comparison of creatinine changes among patients receiving, not receiving, and not yet receiving contrast administration [^30b55072]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare variability in serum creatinine among inpatients in our institution receiving contrast imaging studies and among inpatients not receiving such studies.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective, single-site, multiple-cohort study in a 550-bed academic medical center in October 2016 used the electronic medical record data to analyze the greatest absolute and relative changes in serum creatinine over periods no longer than 48 hours (1) during the admission for 1,134 patients who did not receive a contrast imaging study, (2) before the earliest contrast study for 155 patients who had not yet had a scheduled contrast examination, and (3) straddling the time when 266 patients received their earliest contrast study. We compared creatinine changes in the first cohort with those in the second and the third using histograms and t tests.

Results

Among those who did not receive contrast, 18.3% had a creatinine increase of greater than 0.3 mg/dL, and before contrast, 14.2% had such increases (P = 0.22). After contrast, 6.4% had increases at least this great (P < .001). Patients with increases in creatinine before contrast tended to have such increases after as well (Pearson's 0.48, P < .001).

Conclusions

Physiological variability may explain the similar increases among patients who did not receive contrast versus patients who had not yet received contrast. Hydration therapy may explain the milder and fewer increases after contrast. Only a randomized clinical trial can determine whether acute kidney injuries are caused by contrast; these results support equipoise for such a trial.

### The clinical epidemiology of contrast-induced nephropathy [^a7262c66]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in contrast agents and radiologic imaging tools have resulted in an increasing number of patients undergoing contrast media (CM)-enhanced examinations. Although the majority of patients undergoing these diagnostic and therapeutic procedures experience only mild adverse events, some patient subpopulations are at risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), an adverse event that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Contrast-induced nephropathy is usually defined as an increase of ≥ 25% in the serum creatinine level relative to baseline. Pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this disorder are not fully understood, but it is currently believed that disturbances in renal hemodynamics and a direct effect of CM on renal tubules are involved. In the general population, the incidence of CIN is estimated to be 1% to 6%. However, the risk may be as high as 50% in some patient subgroups. Patients with diabetes and pre-existing renal impairment are at high risk, and CIN incidence increases in patients with multiple comorbidities. The volume and osmolality of CM used also play a role in the development of CIN. Patients who develop CIN are more likely to die in-hospital and, for those who are discharged, 1-year mortality rates are high. Whether this is due to CM, comorbidity, or concurrent comorbid events is unclear. Randomized controlled trials that measure non-renal clinical outcomes are necessary to determine whether interventions that prevent CIN can also prevent non-renal adverse events. A review of the incidence, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of CIN is provided.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^7230bd47]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Implications within US health care for contrast-enhanced imaging and contrast-induced AKI are as follows: all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging procedures should be evaluated for risk of AKI, and screening can most appropriately be performed using standardized questionnaires; routine measurement of serum creatinine (SCr) in all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging is not recommended; the risks and benefits of contrast administration need to be carefully evaluated in patients at high risk of contrast-induced AKI, and the risk of contrast-induced AKI should not preclude the performance of needed diagnostic imaging and therapeutic procedures; iso-osmolar or selected low-osmolar contrast in the lowest possible dose should be used in high-risk patients; the only intervention consistently demonstrated to decrease risk is periprocedural intravenous volume administration using isotonic crystalloid, thus all patients at increased risk should receive periprocedural intravenous isotonic crystalloid, although the optimal rate of fluid administration is uncertain and whether bicarbonate is superior to saline remains unresolved; the benefit associated with NAC remains uncertain, and given its minimal risk and cost, we do not recommend against its use, although it should not be used in lieu of more effective interventions, particularly periprocedural administration of isotonic crystalloid.

### Renal safety of multimodal brain imaging followed by endovascular therapy [^56b65248]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Contrast-enhanced noninvasive angiography and perfusion imaging are recommended to identify eligible patients for endovascular therapy (EVT) in extended time windows (> 6 hours or wake-up). If eligible, additional intraarterial contrast exposure will occur during EVT. We aimed to study the renal safety in the DEFUSE 3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke) population, selected with contrast-enhanced multimodal Imaging and randomized to EVT versus medical management.

Methods

In the randomized DEFUSE 3 trial population, we compared changes in serum creatinine between baseline (before randomization) and 24 hours later. The primary outcome was the relative change in creatinine level between baseline and 24 hours in the EVT versus medical arm. The secondary outcome was a comparison between computed tomography (CT) versus magnetic resonance imaging selection in the EVT arm. The safety outcome was a comparison of the proportion of patients with criteria for contrast-associated kidney injury in the EVT versus medical arm and a comparison between CT versus magnetic resonance imaging selection in the EVT arm.

Results

In the DEFUSE 3 population (n = 182, age 69 ± 13, 51% female), mean creatinine decreased from a baseline of 0.98 ± 0.33 mg/dL to 0.88 ± 0.28 mg/dL at 24 hours (P < 0.001). There was no difference in change between treatment groups: relative to baseline, there was a 6.3% reduction in the EVT group versus 9.2% in the medical group, P = 0.294. Absolute decrease -0.08 ± 0.18 in EVT versus -0.12 ± 0.18 in medical, P = 0.135; Among patients treated with EVT, there was no difference in 24-hour creatinine level changes between patients who were selected with CT angiography/CT perfusion (-0.08 ± 0.18) versus magnetic resonance imaging (-0.07 ± 0.19), P = 0.808 or 6.8% reduction versus 4.8%, P = 0.696. In the EVT arm, contrast-associated kidney injury was encountered in 4 out of 91 (4.4%) versus 2/90 (2.2%) in the medical arm P = 0.682. In the EVT arm, contrast-associated kidney injury was evenly distributed between magnetic resonance imaging (1/22, 4.6%) versus CT 3 out of 69 (4.4%), P = 1.0.

Conclusions

Perfusion imaging before EVT was not associated with evidence of decline in renal function. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02586415.

### Meta-analysis: serum creatinine changes following contrast enhanced CT imaging [^bf1c096b]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is defined as a decrease in renal function following administration of contrast media. The aim of this meta-analysis was to asses the overall risk of CIN, chronic loss of kidney function and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) after intravenous contrast enhanced CT-scan. Secondly, we aimed to identify subgroups at increased risk for CIN.

Materials and Methods

A literature search in Pubmed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was performed. Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using an exact likelihood approach.

Results

Forty studies evaluating the incidence of CIN after CT were included. The pooled incidence of CIN was 6.4% (95% CI 5.0–8.1). The risk of RRT after CIN was low, 0.06% (95% CI 0.01–0.4). The decline in renal function persisted in 1.1% of patients (95% CI 0.6–2.1%). Patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 2.26, p < 0.001) or diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 3.10, p < 0.001) were at increased risk for the development of CIN.

Conclusion

CIN occurred in 6% of patients after contrast enhanced CT. In 1% of all patients undergoing contrast enhanced CT the decline in renal function persisted.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, creatinine monitoring, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up serum creatinine measurement 48–72 hours after intra-arterial iodinated contrast media administration in all patients with an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Do not obtain routine serum creatinine measurement in the remainder of patients as the risk of AKI is extremely low.

### Contrast administration to the deceased kidney donor has No impact on post-transplant outcomes [^2ac24142]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury may occur in patients undergoing imaging studies. This study reviews all deceased kidney donors at a single center during a 15-y period to determine if donor contrast exposure results in contrast-induced acute kidney injury in the donor or is associated with worse outcomes in the transplant recipient.

Methods

Donor and recipient renal functions were recorded, including donor serum creatinine and recipient delayed graft function, creatinine clearance at 1 y, and early and late graft survival. Donor contrast exposure was recorded as the number of preprocurement contrasted studies.

Results

Donor and recipient records were available for 1394 transplants (88%). There were 51% of donors who received any contrasted study (38%, one study; 12%, two studies, and 1%, three studies). Donor contrast exposure was not associated with significant differences in preprocurement serum creatinine levels. Post-transplant, donor contrast exposure was associated with risk of neither delayed graft function (4% for all) nor early kidney graft loss. Creatinine clearance at 1 y was equivalent. Five-year Cox regression demonstrated higher graft survival for contrast-exposed grafts (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

There is no negative effect of donor contrast administration on early and late kidney graft function. These findings included donor kidneys exposed to as many as three contrasted studies.

### Long-term effects of contrast media exposure on renal failure progression: a retrospective cohort study [^5d46d7c1]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

With the increasing importance of accurate diagnosis and precise treatment, imaging examinations using contrast media have become unavoidable and indispensable in many disease areas. However, contrast media can induce hypersensitivity symptoms such as erythema and urticaria immediately after injection, resulting in severe shock. Despite years of research, the pathogenesis of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remains poorly understood. The risk of CIN development includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), which occurs in 4–11% of patients with moderate renal impairment and 50% of patients with severe renal impairment. Management by rehydration is the primary preventive measure for CIN.

The effects of CIN on renal function are often transient. For example, serum creatinine levels peak at 2–4 days after contrast administration and recover to pre-administration values within 2 weeks. In a short-term post-administration analysis of 90–180 days, contrast media testing did not affect renal function decline in a few studies. CIN related to percutaneous coronary intervention does not affect the long-term prognosis (death or initiation of permanent dialysis) of Japanese patients with advanced renal failure.

In contrast, renal function decline progresses to the point of requiring haemodialysis in some cases. There are scattered reports that CIN affects renal function decline in a long-term analysis over 2 years after administration. With the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases, there is growing interest in the prevention of CKD progression and risk factors for CIN, including diabetes. Contrast agents, which are taxing on the kidneys, and other risk factors, such as diabetes and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are a cause of concern for long-term CKD progression, mainly because of frequent contrast studies and imaging-based treatments for chronic diseases.

As described above, concerns have been raised regarding the long-term prognosis of the effect of contrast media on renal function, but sufficient data have not been accumulated. In particular, the effects of contrast media on CIN development and the long-term prognosis (follow-up period of 5 years or more) of CKD have not been fully investigated in populations with advanced renal failure. Therefore, we examined the relationship between medical intervention with contrast media and long-term trends in renal function in patients with renal failure from the perspective of preventing CKD progression.

### In emergency situations, should serum creatinine be checked in all patients before performing second contrast CT examinations within 24 hours? [^7145266a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) examinations within 24 hours, as well as associated risk factors.

Materials and Methods

Through a search of medical and radiologic records, patients who underwent 2 contrast-enhanced CT examinations within 24 hours during a 4-year period (2003–2006), with available serum creatinine measurements before and after CT imaging were included. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data, risk factors, renal status, and CT contrast volume. The frequency of CIN was calculated, and odds ratios of risk factors were determined.

Results

There were 164 patients (90 men, 74 women; mean age, 56.3 years), with an average baseline serum creatinine level of 1.02 ± 0.73 mg/dL (range, 0.3–6.6 mg/dL). Three hundred twenty-eight CT examinations were performed: 2 in each patient, at an average interval of 11.4 hours. The mean doses of contrast medium used for the first and second CT examinations were 126.2 and 123.4 mL, respectively. Twenty-one patients (12.8%) developed CIN. Comparing patients with and without CIN, the only statistically significant risk factor for CIN was an increase in serum creatinine between the first and second CT examinations, with an odds ratio of 18 (P < .005).

Conclusion

The incidence of CIN in patients who underwent repeat contrast-enhanced CT examinations was 12.8%. An increase in serum creatinine between the first and second CT examinations was highly associated with CIN and may serve as a risk factor for developing CIN.

### Prehydration prior to computed tomography in prevention of postcontrast acute kidney injury… [^cb32e61c]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the renal safety of omitting prophylactic prehydration prior to iodine-based contrast media administration in patients with stage 3 CKD. Design, Setting, and Participants. The primary end point was the mean relative increase in serum creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postcontrast acute kidney injury 2 to 5 days after contrast administration, mean relative increase in creatinine level 7 to 14 days after contrast administration, incidences of acute heart failure and renal failure requiring dialysis, and health care costs. The mean relative increase in creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline was 3. 0% in the no prehydration group vs
3. 5% in the prehydration group.

The primary outcome was the mean relative increase in serum creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes were PC-AKI 2 to 5 days after contrast administration; mean relative increase in creatinine level.

Acute ischemic stroke — CTA before creatinine check when LVO is suspected: For patients who otherwise meet criteria for EVT, it is reasonable to proceed with computed tomography angiography (CTA) if indicated in patients with suspected intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO) before obtaining a serum creatinine concentration in patients without a history of renal impairment. The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy secondary to CTA imaging is relatively low, particularly in patients without a history of renal impairment, and waiting for these laboratory results may lead to delays in mechanical thrombectomy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^fbfde571]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO Chapter 4.1 — contrast-induced AKI definition, prediction, and background variability — The term contrast-induced nephropathy is "usually defined as a rise in SCr of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl (≥ 44 μmol/l) or a 25% increase from baseline value, assessed at 48 hours after a radiological procedure," though another definition reports creatinine changes "within 3 days after intravascular administration of contrast media." The peak increase of serum creatinine (SCr) may occur "up to 5 days after contrast exposure." In a prospective study, the 12 h percentage change of SCr vs the basal value best predicted CI-AKI (P < 0.001), where "A 5% increase of its value yielded 75% sensitivity and 72% specificity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 and an OR of 7.37 (95% CI 3.34–16.23)," and the 12-hour value predicted renal impairment at 30 days (P = 0.002; "sensitivity 87%, specificity 70%; AUC 0.85; OR 13.29; 95% CI 2.91–60.64"). Background fluctuation can label "6–35% of inpatients, not exposed to contrast media" as CI-AKI depending on the threshold, and in a computed tomography (CT) cohort "the incidence of AKI (defined as an increase of SCr of 0.5 mg/dl [44 μmol/l] or a ≥ 25% decrease in eGFR within 3 days after CT) was similar in all three groups… up to a baseline SCr level of 1.8 mg/dl (159 μmol/l)."

### N-acetylcysteine effect on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels in CKD patients [^2c8c0584]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been widely used as a prophylactic therapy for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Its efficacy is controversial because of heterogeneity in study results and because of evidence that NAC can alter serum creatinine levels without affecting glomerular filtration rate. This confounding effect of N-acetylcysteine on serum creatinine has not been rigorously tested, however, in a population at risk for CIN and following doses of NAC currently recommended for prophylaxis of CIN.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

"Double-dose" NAC was administered in the absence of iodinated contrast media to 29 stage 3 to 5 stable chronic kidney disease patients. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were measured before and 4 h and 48 h after the last dose of NAC.

Results

There was no effect of NAC on either serum creatinine or cystatin C levels.

Conclusion

NAC, in doses currently recommended for prophylaxis of CIN, has no effect on serum creatinine or cystatin C levels. It is therefore unlikely that the heterogeneity seen in clinical trials of NAC prophylaxis for CIN is related to a confounding effect on serum creatinine.

FDG PET/CT — iodinated contrast risk assessment and renal testing: When a diagnostic CT scan with intravenous contrast agent enhancement is to be performed as part of the FDG PET/CT study, indications, contraindications and restrictions have to be assessed by a qualified physician, and medication interactions and relevant medical history should be considered; renal function should be checked prior to contrast agent administration in all patients considered at risk of contrast agent nephrotoxicity, while routine creatinine testing is not necessary in all patients with major indications including age over 60 years, specified renal disease or impairment, diabetes mellitus, hypertension requiring medical therapy or use of metformin/metformin-containing combinations; estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements are recommended for patients with a high risk of nephrotoxicity or those with creatinine > 13 mmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) and/or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min, and if renal function assessment is required, a creatinine level and estimated glomerular filtration rate within the preceding 4 weeks is sufficient in most clinical settings.

### Glomerular filtration rate in evaluation of the effect of iodinated contrast media on renal function [^337c728f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to use measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the reference standard of renal function, to assess the deleterious effect of iodinated contrast media on renal function. Such an effect has been traditionally defined as a greater than 0.5-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine concentration or a 25% or greater increase 24–72 hours after the injection of iodinated contrast medium.

Subjects and Methods

This pilot investigation was focused on the consequences of clinically indicated IV injection of iodinated contrast media; intraarterial injection was excluded. One hundred thirteen patients with normal serum creatinine concentrations were enrolled in an approved protocol. At random, as chosen by one of the investigators, patients underwent imaging with one of three monomeric agents (iopamidol 300, iopromide 300, iohexol 300) and one dimeric agent (iodixanol 320). Measured GFR was determined immediately before CT and approximately 3 and 72 hours after the contrast injection for the CT examination. Iodinated contrast medium, a glomerular filtrate with no tubular excretion or reabsorption, was the GFR marker. Measured GFR was determined by x-ray fluorescence analysis with nonisotopic iodinated contrast media.

Results

Monomeric and dimeric contrast agents in diagnostic CT volumes (based on bodyweight and imaging protocol) did not induce a significant change in measured GFR (95% confidence by Wilcoxon test), suggesting that use of the evaluated contrast media will not lead to more than a 12% variation.

Conclusion

The three monomeric agents studied and the one dimeric agent were equivalent in terms of lack of a significant effect on measured GFR when administered to patients with a normal GFR.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^93b65b4e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI commentary — definition, staging, screening, and risk factors for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI): The first recommendation is that contrast-induced AKI be defined and staged using the KDIGO definition and staging criteria, while noting that most clinical studies have used thresholds including increments in serum creatinine level of ≥ 25% or ≥ 50% relative to baseline and/or an absolute change in serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL within 2–5 days following iodinated contrast media. The applicability of the urine output criteria to the diagnosis and staging for this form of AKI is uncertain and most episodes of contrast-induced AKI are nonoliguric. For pre-procedure risk identification, measuring serum creatinine prior to all contrast-enhanced procedures is neither practical nor feasible; simple questionnaires have been shown to be effective for identifying patients at higher risk of abnormal underlying renal function, and in patients without a recent serum creatinine measurement it is reasonable to use such questionnaires to identify patients who should have serum creatinine measured prior to contrast administration. Additional risk factors to recognize include diabetes in the setting of renal impairment, heart failure, repeated contrast exposure over short periods, and concomitant nephrotoxin administration (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides).

### Contrast-induced nephropathy [^1e00dcbf]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic disorder, resulting from exposure to contrast media. Contrast-induced hemodynamic and direct cytotoxic effects on renal structures are highly evident in its pathogenesis, whereas other mechanisms are still poorly understood. CIN is typically defined as an increase in serum creatinine by either ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or by ≥ 25% from baseline within the first 2–3 days after contrast administration. Although rare in the general population, CIN has a high incidence in patients with an underlying renal disorder, in diabetics, and the elderly. The risk factors are synergistic in their ability to produce CIN. The best way to prevent CIN is to identify the patients at risk and to provide adequate peri-procedural hydration. The role of various drugs in prevention of CIN is still controversial and warrants future studies. Despite remaining uncertainty regarding the degree of nephrotoxicity produced by various contrast agents, in current practice non-ionic low-osmolar contrast media are preferred over the high-osmolar contrast media in patients with renal impairment.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy [^ce2eaa5e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Interventional radiological procedures involving anaesthesia are generally increasing. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), usually defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 44 micromol litre(-1) (0.5 mg dl(-1)) or a 25% increase from the baseline value 48 h after intravascular injection of contrast media, is a common and potentially serious complication of the use of iodinated contrast media in patients at risk of acute renal injury. It is an important cause of hospital-acquired renal failure, may be a difficult differential diagnosis and the incidence does not appear to have changed over the last few decades. In the general population, the incidence of CIN is estimated to be 1–2%. However, the risk for developing CIN may be as high as 50% in some patient subgroups, such as those with diabetes mellitus and pre-existing renal impairment. The impact of CIN on clinical outcomes has been evaluated most extensively in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention where it is associated with increased mortality both in hospital and at 1 yr. As treatment is limited to supportive measures while awaiting the resolution of the renal impairment, emphasis needs to be directed at prevention.

Risks and benefits of imaging studies should be determined on an individual basis in the context of their CKD; the use of iodinated radiocontrast media has been associated with the occurrence of AKI with varying rates across populations and definitions, the term "contrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI)" has been suggested instead of "contrast-induced AKI," and although there is potential risk for AKI with contrast administration in people with CKD G4–G5, caution should be exercised in withholding contrast treatment or evaluation of a potentially fatal condition solely based on GFR.

### N-acetylcysteine does not prevent contrast nephropathy in patients with renal impairment undergoing emergency CT: a randomized study [^58103f77]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

A role of NAC on creatinine secretion independently of kidney filtration has been reported by Hoffman and collegues. To correct for this, we also measured cystatin C at all time points of our study. We observed no effect of NAC on AKI based on creatinine or cystatin C level. Furthermore, cystatin C and creatinine levels showed a good correlation at all time points, arguing against a major role of intravenous NAC on creatinine secretion.

Our study is limited by some aspects. First our population is relatively small and we cannot exclude a minor effect of NAC that might have been detectable in a larger cohort. However, such a small effect would probably not be relevant in clinical practice. Second our selection criteria were based on a single creatinine level measurement in the ER. We may therefore have mixed acute and chronic cases of renal impairment, rendering our population less homogenous than in previous studies but closer to everyday practice in the ER. The high rate of CN demonstrates that this population was in any cases vulnerable. Finally, the contrast medium dose used for CT-Scan is generally lower than for cardiac angiography which has been the situation mostly studied regarding NAC effect. Despite these limitations, the follow up of patients with two renal markers, the very high dose of NAC and different definitions of AKI used are strong arguments against an effect of IV NAC on AKI prevention in patients presenting on the ER with a decreased estimated clearance and undergoing contrast CT-Scan.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, restriction of contrast medium use, KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining alternative imaging methods in patients at increased risk for contrast-induced AKI.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although these recommendations seem trivial, it is important to balance the potential risk of CIN against the potential gain of administering contrast in the clinical decision process.

Risk for CIN increases with decreasing pre-existing GFR. A CIN Consensus Working Panel agreed that CIN risk becomes clinically significant when the baseline SCr concentration is ≥ 1.3 mg/dL (≥ 115 mmol/L) in men and ≥ 1.0 mg/dL (≥ 88.4 mmol/L) in women, mostly equivalent to an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In light of more recent work, the ERBP work group agrees with KDIGO that this threshold could be lowered to 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

The risk of CIN also increased in the presence of diabetes, and dehydration. The risk may be lower when simple i.v. contrast is administered for imaging versus when contrast is used during an invasive intra-arterial procedure, where the risk of cholesterol embolization should also be taken into account. It is unclear whether simple intra-arterial injection, e.g. digital subtraction angiography has a different risk from i.v.

### Risk prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy: systematic review [^a00ba9d1]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We performed this systematic review in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Our objective was to systematically review prediction models for contrast induced nephropathy.

Data sources and searches

We used a strategy developed with a health informatics specialist to search Ovid Medline (1946 to 9 March 2015), Embase (1947 to week 10 in 2015), and CINAHL (cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature; 1993 to March 2015). We reviewed the bibliographies of identified articles to locate further eligible studies. The web appendix shows the search strategies performed.

Study selection

Studies published in the English language were eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the characteristics of a predictive model for identifying patients at risk of contrast induced nephropathy among adults undergoing a diagnostic or interventional procedure that used conventional, iodinated radiocontrast (media used for computed tomography (CT) or angiography, and not gadolinium based contrast). Because a set of predictive factors derived in only one population could lack validity and applicability, we only included studies in which both development and validation of the prediction model was conducted. We did not prespecify the method of validation, nor did we exclude studies where the derivation and validation cohorts were drawn from the same population. We excluded unpublished conference abstracts.

Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity in the criteria for contrast induced nephropathy between studies and the well described association between even mild elevations of serum creatinine levels and adverse outcomes, we accepted each study's definition of the disorder. These included relative or absolute increases in serum creatinine after contrast exposure.

Two authors (ZH and SAS) scanned titles and abstracts for initial selection. Selected articles were reviewed in full and independently assessed for eligibility by the same two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data extraction

From each study, we abstracted data on baseline patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, criteria to define contrast induced nephropathy, the number of events, predictor variables included in the risk model, internal and external validation, measures of discrimination, measures of calibration, and methodological features indicative of study quality. To facilitate a comparison of predictor variables, we grouped final model variables into six categories: demographic data, anthropometric data, medical history, physical examination and clinical presentation, procedural characteristics, and laboratory values.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^5eae409e]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) evidence comparability is limited by clinical heterogeneity and methods differences: baseline kidney function and diabetes prevalence vary, CI-AKI definitions differ, and serum creatinine (SCr) timing after contrast is not uniform; different time-points can give different results, standardized simultaneous measurements are probably the most conclusive, and varying volume expansion and pharmacological strategies make conclusive comparisons virtually impossible.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^447a5d4c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

The ERBP work group is not aware of any pathophysiological or epidemiological reason why the definition and staging of CIN should be different from the general AKI definition. This definition is slightly different from the ESUR criteria for contrast-induced nephropathy, which requires an increase in SCr by more than 25% or 44 µmol/L in the 3 days following intravascular administration of contrast medium (CM) in the absence of an alternative aetiology. Thus, many patients with an SCr increase ranging from 26.5 to 44 µmol/L following CM administration would be considered as presenting Stage 1 AKI but not as CI nephropathy. However, for the sake of clarity and uniformity, ERBP recommends to use the general AKI criteria. Remarkably, studies have also pointed out that in many hospitalized patients not receiving contrast, an increase in serum creatinine was observed. As such, in patients who did receive contrast, one should be cautious to attribute AKI to the contrast, and other underlying causes for AKI should be explored.

The moment when the repeat serum creatinine should be measured is a matter of debate. According to ESUR, it should be done in the 3 days following intravascular administration of CM. Some studies suggest that the peak of SCr could even occur later, especially in patients with diabetes and pre-existing CKD which really underlines the need for an extended period of renal function survey. On the other hand, the percentage increase in serum creatinine from baseline after 12h showed a good prediction for later development of renal impairment.

The reliability of other renal function markers such as cystatin C should be further evaluated.

On the other hand, the importance of urinary output for diagnosing CIN should be emphasized.
3.2.1 We recommend balancing the risk for CIN against the benefit of administering contrast. (Not Graded)
3.2.2 We recommend considering alternative imaging methods not requiring contrast administration in patients at increased risk for CIN, so long as these yield the same diagnostic accuracy. (Not Graded)

### Left-digit bias in serum creatinine levels and contrast administration: a Nationwide cohort study using a Japanese percutaneous coronary intervention registry [^47e51b95]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings should be interpreted in the context of the following potential limitations. First, this observational study design means there may be unmeasured confounding factors influencing the results, despite adjusting for a wide range of patient characteristics and procedural details in the multivariable linear regression model. Second, the creatinine levels reported in the J‐PCI registry were available up only to the first decimal place. This may have led to a slight discrepancy between the creatinine levels recognized by physicians in the clinical setting and those used in this study. This misclassification might have diluted the observed differences in contrast volume between groups on both sides of the threshold. However, the LDB is still clearly confirmed, solidifying its existence. Third, the contrast agent variable was newly added to the registry in 2018, and there was a relatively high proportion of missing data. To address this limitation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis limited to data from 2022, when the missing rate was lowest (19.7%). This analysis showed similar relationship patterns between creatinine levels and contrast volume as observed in our primary analysis (Figure S3), which supports the robustness of our data despite the presence of missing contrast values. Fourth, we could not obtain follow‐up data, including postrenal function such as the serum creatinine at 48 to 72 hours after the procedure. Therefore, we could not evaluate how LDB in contrast volume affects post‐PCI AKI and long‐term outcomes. Future studies incorporating postprocedural renal function and extended follow‐up data may provide a more comprehensive understanding of LDB and its clinical implications. Fifth, detailed information regarding PCI procedures, such as the complexity of the lesions or the types of imaging devices, were not included. Sixth, only 1.2% of the population had creatinine levels > 3 mg/dL, which may have resulted in insufficient statistical power at this threshold. Additional data are needed to further assess the impact of creatinine levels at this threshold on contrast use by LDB. Finally, the study population was limited to patients in Japan, which may restrict generalizability. Future research in diverse populations and settings would help validate our findings and assess the global applicability of LDB in PCI practice.

### Effectiveness of contrast-associated acute kidney injury prevention methods; a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^f8a7ae12]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rationale

Contrast Associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) also known as Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) previously known as contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is the third leading cause of hospital-acquired acute renal injury, accounting for 12% of cases. It is defined as an abrupt deterioration in renal function following exposure to contrast media (CM) in the absence of other aetiological factors. The absolute and relative values used to define CI-AKI vary, but are most commonly quoted as a relative increase of > 25% or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL and ≥ 0.3 mg from baseline serum creatinine measurement within 1–3 (4–5 days less frequently used) of contrast exposure. In CI-AKI, the serum creatinine level begins to rise within 24 h of contrast exposure, peaking after 72 h, and usually returning to baseline within 1–3 weeks.

The proposed pathophysiology of CI-AKI is acute tubular necrosis. The underlying mechanisms are thought to be vasoconstriction, leading to cellular hypoxia, or direct toxicity of contrast media to renal tubular cells. Multiple therapies have been postulated to prevent CI-AKI act by affecting these mechanisms or their metabolic mediators.

There is ongoing discussion about the impact of new contrast media on the size of the problem and the outcomes of prevention methods or even the existence of the problem, on the other side these conclusions were challenged as coming only from retrospective studies that does not take in account patients factors or indications for using contrast media in deferent cases with deferent baseline renal profile.

In recent years, there have been many systematic reviews and meta-analyses for direct pair-wise comparisons of individual interventions suggested for CI-AKI prevention. With so many options explored, it is difficult to determine the treatment options most likely to show benefit in large-scale trials. Unlike conventional meta-analysis, Network facilitates simultaneous comparison of indirect relationships between multiple interventions. The network can establish an estimate of comparative efficacy between two or more treatments compared to the same control intervention. We undertook a network-meta-analysis of preventive strategies for CA-AKI to determine the treatment most likely to be beneficial based upon currently available evidence.

### Left-digit bias in serum creatinine levels and contrast administration: a Nationwide cohort study using a Japanese percutaneous coronary intervention registry [^b320ce74]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

To address this creatinine‐based heterogeneity and overcome the problem, it remains crucial to identify and mitigate cognitive biases. Promising strategies for sustainable bias reduction in health care involve avoiding strategies that rely on self‐checking, team‐based decision‐making, understanding clinicians' cognitive biases, using appropriate supportive tools, and leveraging the usefulness of clinical decision‐support systems. More specifically, potential measures include sharing the AKI risk with the catheter team on the "timeout" before PCI, using contrast diluted to 50% with saline, employing biplane angiography and stent boost techniques, creating roadmaps, maximizing the use of intravascular imaging, and introducing a combination of clinical decision support, audit, and feedback for AKI prevention. Integrating these systems with an understanding of cognitive biases holds the potential to further reduce contrast volume.

### Iodinated contrast and nephropathy: does It exist and what is the actual evidence? [^7a5a6cd4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Iodinated contrast material (ICM) is a critical component for many radiologic examinations and procedures. However, ICM has often been withheld in the past out of concern for its potential nephrotoxicity and increased risk of morbidity and mortality, often at the expense of diagnostic accuracy and timely diagnosis. Evidence from controlled studies now suggest that most cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by ICM were instead due to contrast-independent causes of AKI or normal variation in renal function. This study will discuss current knowledge of contrast-induced AKI, including the incidence, sequelae, risk factors, and prevention strategies of this potential complication.

### N-acetylcysteine does not prevent contrast nephropathy in patients with renal impairment undergoing emergency CT: a randomized study [^f480ab75]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients admitted to the emergency room with renal impairment and undergoing a contrast computed tomography (CT) are at high risk of developing contrast nephropathy as emergency precludes sufficient hydration prior to contrast use. The value of an ultra-high dose of intravenous N-acetylcysteine in this setting is unknown.

Methods

From 2008 to 2010, we randomized 120 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency room with an estimated clearance lower than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 by MDRD (mean GFR 42 ml/min/1.73 m2) to either placebo or 6000 mg N-acetylcysteine iv one hour before contrast CT in addition to iv saline. Serum cystatin C and creatinine were measured one hour prior to and at day 2, 4 and 10 after contrast injection. Nephrotoxicity was defined either as 25% or 44 μmol/l increase in serum creatinine or cystatin C levels compared to baseline values.

Results

Contrast nephrotoxicity occurred in 22% of patients who received placebo (13/58) and 27% of patients who received N-acetylcysteine (14/52, p = 0.66). Ultra-high dose intravenous N-acetylcysteine did not alter creatinine or cystatin C levels. No secondary effects were noted within the 2 groups during follow-up.

Conclusions

An ultra-high dose of intravenous N-acetylcysteine is ineffective at preventing nephrotoxicity in patients with renal impairment undergoing emergency contrast CT.

Trial Registration

The study was registered as Clinical trial (NCT01467154).

### Long-term effects of contrast media exposure on renal failure progression: a retrospective cohort study [^74fd0101]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Notwithstanding the limitations surrounding the collection of information on patient background, test results, some aspects of the clinical picture, and statistics, this study, oriented towards real-world considerations in the Japanese health care system, clarified the actual long-term effects of contrast media exposure on renal function. Thus, we were able to identify a clinical trend of successful measures for preventing renal outcomes associated with contrast media exposure. We subsequently found that contrast exposure under certain conditions is a potential long-term influencing factor on renal function.

Although study design limitations require careful interpretation, the results of longitudinal observations over approximately 5 years have implied that, as with other risk factors, the number of contrast exposures has a long-term effect on renal function. The results of PSM-adjusted stratified analysis (G3b-centred group with altered renal function) showed that the decrease in GFR in the CAT group was 1.69-fold greater than that in the non-CAT group in the population with high annual contrast exposure. Therefore, it was inferred that the strategy of selecting appropriate contrast-enhanced medical treatment is important as a part of CKD measures in moderate CKD and beyond.

The population in this study consisted of CKD patients at high risk of CIN, particularly those in CKD stage G3 and beyond. For urgent diagnosis and treatment in this population, the choice is generally based on a balance of clinical risks and benefits while protecting the renal function. In the present study, we could not examine the amount of contrast media injected into the body and the type of intervention and route of administration in detail. Consequently, we did not discuss in detail the causal relationship between the amount of contrast media exposure and the amount of decline in renal function. Therefore, the results of this study are considered insufficient to contribute to the discussion of clinical decisions as described above. In the future, long-term clinical studies with multivariate analysis of relevant factors (serum creatinine, serum albumin, body mass index, saline, etc.) are desirable.

### Comparative investigation of I.V. iohexol and iopamidol: effect on renal function in low-risk outpatients undergoing CT [^0f2fbcf1]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to compare the effects of i.v. iohexol and iopamidol on renal function in outpatients undergoing CT.

Subjects and Methods

We performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 389 adults with low risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, comparing i.v. iohexol with iopamidol (300 mg I/mL). Serum creatinine (SCr) concentration was measured at baseline and 2 and 3 days after contrast administration. A noninferiority analysis was planned to compare the mean maximum SCr change from baseline between subject groups. Contrast-induced nephropathy rates (three definitions) for both contrast agents were compared as a secondary end point.

Results

One hundred ninety and 199 subjects received iohexol and iopamidol, respectively. The mean change in SCr from baseline using the maximum day 2 or 3 measurement was 0.07 ± 0.12 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.05–0.09 mg/dL) for the iohexol group and 0.05 ± 0.12 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.03–0.07 mg/dL) for the iopamidol group. The difference between contrast agents with respect to the mean change in SCr from baseline was -0.02 ± 0.12 mg/dL (95% CI, -0.045 to 0.003 mg/dL; p = 0.08). Contrast-induced nephropathy rates were not statistically different using any definition.

Conclusion

Although our results were unable to show absolute noninferiority of iohexol compared with iopamidol because of a very small difference in increase in mean SCr from baseline (using a noninferiority margin of 0.04 mg/dL), this difference is likely of minimal or no clinical importance in outpatients undergoing CT with low risk for contrast-induced nephropathy.

### Negative effects of iodine-based contrast agent on renal function in patients with moderate reduced renal function hospitalized for COVID-19 [^73a0ed9e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with existing renal replacement therapy examined with contrast enhancement

This group (n = 15) received higher doses of contrast agent than patients not taking renal replacement therapy (median doses (IQR): 110 mL (60–129) vs. 60 mL (60–70); p < 0.001). The median (IQR) P-creatinine levels in this group declined from 161 μmol/L (130–232) at baseline to 127 μmol/L (105–175) at 48 h; then it rose to 188 μmol/L (67–358) at 4–10 days after contrast agent exposure (not significantly different from baseline; Table 1 c).

After 4–10 days, we observed a > 50% increase in P-creatinine in five out of remaining 14 patients in the renal replacement therapy with contrast-enhanced CT group and only one out of 21 patients in the non-renal replacement therapy unenhanced CT group (36% vs. 5%, p = 0.017, Pearsons χ 2 -test, Table 1 b). Among the 24 patients that received an unenhanced CT during the study period, five were taking renal replacement therapy at the time of the CT (5 patients included in Table 1 c).

Odds ratio analysis

Odds ratio analyses indicated that a > 50% rise in P-creatinine 48 h after contrast agent administration associated with eGFR ≥ 30–60 and contrast-enhanced CT (p = 0.018), with 30-day mortality (p < 0.001) and with renal replacement therapy at CT (p = 0.037) but not with age, male gender or contrast agent dose/weight (Table 2). At 4–10 days, a > 50% rise in P-creatinine was aside from eGFR ≤ 30–60 and contrast-enhanced CT, 30-day mortality and renal replacement therapy at CT also associated with advancing age (p = 0.042), ICU stay (p = 0.023) and increased CRP at CT (p = 0.039) but not with male gender (Table 2).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to eGFR, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain an indicated contrast-enhanced imaging without delay if the patient is in an emergent presentation (such as suspected acute stroke, PE, acute aortic syndrome, bowel ischemia or perforation, and other conditions). Do not delay emergent imaging to obtain eGFR measurement and do not withhold contrast required for an accurate diagnosis of the emergent pathology.

### Background fluctuation of kidney function versus contrast-induced nephrotoxicity [^b0e51bb6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The reported incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury varies widely. Almost no studies have been conducted to quantify the background fluctuation of kidney function of patients receiving iodinated contrast medium. The purpose of this study was a retrospective comparison of the incidence of acute kidney injury among patients undergoing CT with low-osmolar (iohexol) or isoosmolar (iodixanol) contrast medium with the incidence among patients undergoing CT without contrast administration.

Materials and Methods

Creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate were evaluated for 11,588 patients. Rates of acute kidney injury (defined as a 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine concentration or a 25% or greater decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate within 3 days after CT) were compared among groups and stratified according to creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate before the imaging examination.

Results

In all groups, the incidence of acute kidney injury increased with increasing baseline creatinine concentration. No significant difference in incidence of presumed contrast-induced kidney injury was identified between the isoosmolar contrast medium and the control groups. The incidence of acute kidney injury in the low-osmolar contrast medium cohort paralleled that of the control cohort up to a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, but increases above this level were associated with a higher incidence of acute kidney injury.

Conclusion

We identified a high incidence of acute kidney injury among control subjects undergoing unenhanced CT. The incidence of creatinine elevation in this group was statistically similar to that in the isoosmolar contrast medium group for all baseline creatinine values and all stages of chronic kidney disease. These findings suggest that the additional risk of acute kidney injury accompanying administration of contrast medium (contrast-induced nephrotoxicity) may be overstated and that much of the creatinine elevation in these patients is attributable to background fluctuation, underlying disease, or treatment.

### Comparative effect of contrast media type on the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f446fa96]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Iodine contrast media are essential components of many imaging procedures. An important potential side effect is contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

Purpose

To compare CIN risk for contrast media within and between osmolality classes in patients receiving diagnostic or therapeutic imaging procedures.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, and Scopus through June 2015.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that reported CIN-related outcomes in patients receiving low-osmolar contrast media (LOCM) or iso-osmolar contrast media for imaging.

Data Extraction

Independent study selection and quality assessment by 2 reviewers and dual extraction of study characteristics and results.

Data Synthesis

None of the 5 studies that compared types of LOCM reported a statistically significant or clinically important difference among study groups, but the strength of evidence was low. Twenty-five randomized, controlled trials found a slight reduction in CIN risk with the iso-osmolar contrast media agent iodixanol compared with a diverse group of LOCM that just reached statistical significance in a meta-analysis (pooled relative risk, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99]; P = 0.045). This comparison's strength of evidence was moderate. In a meta regression of randomized, controlled trials of iodixanol, no relationship was found between route of administration and comparative CIN risk.

Limitations

Few studies compared LOCM. Procedural details about contrast administration were not uniformly reported. Few studies specified clinical indications or severity of baseline renal impairment.

Conclusion

No differences were found in CIN risk among types of LOCM. Iodixanol had a slightly lower risk for CIN than LOCM, but the lower risk did not exceed a criterion for clinical importance.

Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) risk reduction during PCI — Patients with baseline renal insufficiency (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and/or elevated risk scores are at increased risk of developing CIN. The only strategies consistently shown to reduce the risk of CIN are hydration and minimizing the contrast dose, and pre-procedural intra-venous hydration can mitigate the risk and should be used routinely for patients at increased risk for CKD if not contraindicated. Administration of N-acetylcysteine does not offer a significant benefit and is no longer recommended. The total contrast dose should be monitored and risk scores can help identify a suggested limit; one tool uses the ratio of contrast volume to creatinine clearance (CrCl), with a ratio of contrast volume/CrCl > 3.7 as predictive of renal injury. For those with compromised renal function, recording the left ventricular end diastolic pressure and using it to guide fluid administration during the procedure should be considered, and optimal use of intravascular imaging may reduce contrast dose and is a developing strategy.

### Impact of creatinine screening on contrast-induced nephropathy following computerized tomography for stroke [^a930eb6d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study sought to evaluate rates of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computerized tomography for acute stroke in the emergency department (ED) before and after the cessation of creatinine screening.

Methods

This retrospective study compared ED patients receiving contrast-enhanced imaging for suspected acute stroke with and without protocolized creatinine screening. The primary outcome was CIN, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours or 50% above baseline within 7 days after contrast administration. Secondary outcomes consisted of CIN based on other definitions, renal impairment greater than 30 days from contrast administration, hemodialysis, and mortality. Outcomes were compared using difference of proportions and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

This study included 382 subjects, with 186 and 196 in the screening and post-screening cohorts, respectively. No significant differences were observed for CIN (7.0% vs 7.1%, difference 0.1% [95% CI -5.6–5.1%], OR 1.02 [95% CI 0.47–2.24]), renal impairment greater than 30 days post-contrast (8.4% vs 7.5%, OR 0.88 [0.38–2.07]), or mortality (index visit: 4.8% vs 2.6%, OR 0.51 [0.17–1.57], 90-day follow-up: 6.7% vs 4.0%, OR 0.58 [0.22–1.53]). No patients from either group required hemodialysis.

Conclusions

The elimination of creatinine screening prior to obtaining contrast-enhanced computerized tomography in patients with suspected acute stroke did not adversely affect rates of CIN, hemodialysis, or mortality at a comprehensive stroke center.

### Acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy after intravascular angiography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9242d7a1]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy is a leading cause for acquired acute reductions in kidney function. Despite advances in supportive therapy, the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy may continue to increase significantly with the broader utilization of radiocontrast media for diagnostic and interventional procedures. Furthermore, contrast-induced nephropathy is associated with a greater risk of in-hospital morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, increased health care costs and potentially irreversible reduction in kidney function.

The pathophysiology of contrast-induced nephropathy remains incompletely understood. However, current evidence suggests that contrast media induce prolonged vasoconstriction and medullary ischemia coupled with generation of free radicals and oxidative injury to tubular cells.

Acetylcysteine, a thiol-containing anti-oxidant, has been hypothesized to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. The potential benefit of acetylcysteine is believed to be mediated by its properties as a scavenger of free-radical species and by increasing the synthesis of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator, in response to ischemic or other toxic injury in the kidney. Given the recent publication of a series of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of acetylcysteine in preventing the decline in kidney function following contrast exposure associated with intravascular angiography, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of these trials. The specific objectives of our meta-analysis were to assess the effect of acetycysteine on 1) the dichotomous endpoint of contrast-induced nephropathy (yes/no) and 2) serum creatinine levels following the administration of contrast media. We also conduct a meta-regression analysis to determine whether particular clinical or study quality factors influence the apparent effect of acetylcysteine on risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

Ethical aspects

SCAPIS has been approved as a multicentre trial by the ethics committee at Umeå University and adheres to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Radiation for imaging

With current imaging modalities, the dose of radiation can be kept low (see pilot data). Evidence from our pilot data indicates that SCAPIS will lead to the early detection of many more cancers than those caused by the additional radiation dose. In addition, multi‐organ imaging will facilitate the detection of other diseases and lead to early treatment. Furthermore, we anticipate that the large amount of information that will result from imaging in SCAPIS will lead to many new scientific discoveries. The radiation safety committee at each hospital has carefully weighed the potential benefits against the potential harm induced by radiation exposure (mainly radiation‐induced lung cancer in the age group considered) and deemed that the radiation dose is justifiable for the SCAPIS population. The SCAPIS steering committee has also considered radiation safety (see Supporting Information).

Medication for imaging

The iodinated contrast agent used for CCTA has the potential to cause renal damage 52, but the frequency of contrast‐induced nephropathy is debated; very few high‐quality studies have been conducted 52, 53, 54, and from a recent large study, it was concluded that contrast material is not associated with increased risk 55. No hospitalizations for renal failure were reported in the pilot trial. However, we will prospectively monitor renal function in the next phase of SCAPIS, using repeated creatinine measurements in a selected population, to investigate the impact of iodinated contrast agents on subtle functional changes.

### Frequency of serum creatinine changes in the absence of iodinated contrast material: implications for studies of contrast nephrotoxicity [^eb96814e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Most studies of contrast-induced nephropathy lack controls to distinguish it from nephropathy from other causes. We assessed the frequency and magnitude of serum creatinine changes in patients not receiving iodinated contrast material to compare with creatinine changes in publications regarding contrast nephropathy.

Materials and Methods

From the electronic medical records of an academic medical center, adults with creatinine determinations on five consecutive days who had not received contrast material during the previous 10 days were identified. The first creatinine level was compared with those on subsequent days. We calculated the frequency with which these levels exceeded thresholds used to identify contrast nephropathy in previous publications.

Results

Among 32,161 patients, more than half showed a change of at least 25% and more than two fifths, a change of at least 0.4 mg/dL. Among patients with baseline creatinine levels of 0.6–1.2 mg/dL, increases of at least 25%, 33%, and 50% occurred in 27%, 19%, and 11% of patients, respectively. Increases of 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/dL occurred in 13%, 7%, and 3% of patients. Among patients with baseline creatinine levels greater than 2.0 mg/dL, increases of at least 25%, 33%, and 50% occurred in 16%, 12%, and 7%. Increases of 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/dL occurred in 33%, 26%, and 18%. These increases were not different from the incidences of contrast nephropathy previously published.

Conclusion

The creatinine level increases in patients who are not receiving contrast material as often as it does in published series of patients who are receiving contrast material. The role of contrast material in nephropathy may have been overestimated.

This also applies to post-contrast serial measurements of SCr in clinical settings. Since AKI is not necessarily associated with permanent changes in renal function, consistent SCr measurement protocols following CM administration would be of great value to improve the diagnostic algorithm in suspected AKI. Diagnostic standardization with longer observation periods may help differentiate between subclinical renal damage and potentially reversible background fluctuations of SCr. Lastly, the majority of studies failed to report AKI stages, which would have been beneficial to understand the severity of kidney injury and show the risk of progression to higher AKI stages.

Currently, no adjunctive medication can effectively prevent or treat post-contrast AKI. Therefore, it remains crucial to anticipate and obviate post-contrast renal decline with comprehensive risk prediction scores and preprocedural volume expansion, even in emergencies and time-sensitive conditions. The clinical practice of withholding CM–enhanced imaging for concern of CI-AKI appears not to be justified. However, despite the low incremental risk, caution remains warranted in individuals with hypertension or eGFR less than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### Early detection and intervention using neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may improve renal outcome of acute contrast media induced nephropathy: a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing intra-arterial angiography (ANTI-CIN study) [^f869cbad]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In recent decades, the growing demand for sophisticated diagnostics in all fields of modern medicine has increased the need for contrast-enhanced imaging. The amount of iodinated contrast media (CM) used worldwide cannot be even roughly estimated. While contrast-enhanced procedures are fairly safe in the healthy population, patients with pre-existing impaired renal and/or cardiac function are prone to develop acute kidney injury (AKI) due to acute contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) and so have a greater risk of death. This has been shown in patients undergoing coronary angiography and intervention who sometimes end up with end-stage renal disease. The effect of an immediate post-procedural hemodialysis treatment to eliminate CM load is also discussed controversially.

Until recently and for this reason, physicians have increasingly used gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to avoid renal complications, especially in such high-risk patients. For interventional settings, however, gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has never been an appropriate alternative.

Also, with the recognition of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis as a severe and also life-threatening gadolinium side effect without treatment options, physicians now have to weigh the risk of either investigation for the individual patient. A return to iodinated CM enhanced investigations is now seen in many clinical settings.

A variety of investigators have tried to establish risk scores for patients before investigation. To date, a reliable laboratory value or test that recognizes acute renal damage before serum creatinine increases is still being sought and might be a most helpful tool to initiate proper treatment on time. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a new biomarker predictive for acute renal injury, has been shown to be capable of earlier diagnosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and CIN. NGAL so might be the desired diagnostic link between acute kidney damage and the later occurrence of elevated creatinine values. Randomized controlled trials using this "timesaver" for earlier intervention have not yet been performed, but would be highly desirable. Such a study might change physicians' therapeutic strategies and improve clinical outcomes.

### Radiographic contrast media and the kidney [^477bc484]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

AKI is a potential complication of intravascular iodinated contrast exposure. Contrast-associated AKI, which typically manifests as small and transient decrements in kidney function that develop within several days of contrast administration, is associated with serious adverse outcomes, including progressive kidney dysfunction and death. However, a causal link between the small increases in serum creatinine that characteristically occur with contrast-associated AKI and serious adverse outcomes remains unproven. This is important given mounting evidence that clinically indicated, potentially lifesaving radiographic procedures are underutilized in patients with CKD. This has been hypothesized to be related to provider concern about precipitating contrast-associated AKI. Intravascular gadolinium-based contrast, an alternative to iodinated contrast that is administered with magnetic resonance imaging, has also been linked with potential serious adverse events, notably the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severe impairment in kidney function. Patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit frequently have clinical indications for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that involve the intravascular administration of contrast media. Accordingly, critical care providers and others treating critically ill patients should possess a sound understanding of the risk factors for and incidence of such outcomes, the ability to perform evidence-based risk-benefit assessments regarding intravascular contrast administration, and knowledge of empirical data on the prevention of these iatrogenic complications.

Background

We performed a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study to compare the renal effects of iomeprol-400 and iodixanol-320 in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease undergoing contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography of the liver.

Methods

One hundred forty-eight patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease, ie, serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (132.6 micromol/L) and/or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 60 mL/min, undergoing contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography of the liver were randomized to equi-iodine doses (40 gI) of either the low-osmolar agent iomeprol-400 (400 mgI/mL, 726 mOsm/kg, N = 76) or the isotonic agent iodixanol-320 (320 mgI/mL, 290 mOsm/kg, N = 72), injected intravenously at 4 mL/S, followed by a bolus of 20 mL normal saline solution at the same rate. SCr was obtained at screening, baseline and at 48 to 72 hours postdose. SCr measurements and CrCl calculations were performed by a central laboratory. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) was defined as an absolute SCr increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) from baseline to 48 to 72 hours postdose. Mean SCr changes from baseline were also assessed. A Renal Safety Review Board comprised 3 medical experts reviewed the renal safety data, demographics, medical history, CIN risk factors, concomitant medications, and hydration status of each subject in a blinded manner.

Results

The 2 study groups were comparable with regard to age, gender distribution, concomitant nephrotoxins, hydration status, and total iodine dose; however, the iomeprol-400 group showed a significantly higher proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus (P = 0.02). Baseline SCr was 1.7 ± 0.6 mg/dL (150.3 ± 53.0 micromol/L) in the iomeprol-400 group and 1.7 ± 0.7 mg/dL (150.3 ± 61.9 micromol/L) in the iodixanol-320 group (P = 0.87). Predose CrCl was 41.5 ± 13.1 mL/Min in the iomeprol-400 group and 43.0 ± 13.3 mL/Min in the iodixanol-320 group (P = 0.49). Five of 72 patient receiving iodixanol-320 (6.9%) and none of the patients receiving iomeprol-400 showed an increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) from baseline [P = 0.025, 95% CI (-12.8%, -1.1%)]. The mean SCr change from baseline was significantly higher (P = 0.017 ANCOVA) after iodixanol-320 (0.06 ± 0.27) than after iomeprol-400 (-0.04 ± 0.19).

Conclusions

The incidence of CIN was significantly higher after IV administration of iodixanol-320 than iomeprol-400. The mean rise in SCr from baseline was also higher in patients receiving iodixanol.

### Negative effects of iodine-based contrast agent on renal function in patients with moderate reduced renal function hospitalized for COVID-19 [^2958a9fb]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iodine-based contrast agents for intravascular use may have a negative effect on kidney function, particularly in previously compromised kidneys. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has been defined as an increase in plasma (P)-creatinine measured 2–3 days after computed tomography (CT). CI-AKI is defined as an increase in P-creatinine ≥ 27 μmol/L or > 50% rise in P-creatinine above the value on the day of CT. A previous definition used a P-creatinine increase of 44 μmol/L or above as diagnostic. A recent guideline recommends a lower limit. Patient related factors are known to affect the risk; most importantly kidney function, which is usually expressed as, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A value < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 has been used to define a somewhat higher risk. eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 indicates severe renal failure and is considered a risk factor for CI-AKI. The incidence of CI-AKI was shown to range from 0 to 24%, with the highest risk in diabetic nephropathy. Other background factors of importance are kidney surgery, proteinuria and hypertension. It is also well known that severity of present disease increases the risk substantially.

Kidney disease and renal failure were associated with hospital death in COVID-19. Thromboembolic diseases, including pulmonary embolism (PE), are seen with a high frequency in COVID-19. The primary method for confirming pulmonary embolism is CT angiography. Suspected PE was the dominating indication for CT angiography in our study. These observations raised the question of whether patients with COVID-19 might be more susceptible to the harmful effects of iodinated contrast material. This possibility could influence risk assessments whether a CT angiogram is performed in COVID-19. We hypothesized that, in patients with COVID-19 stratified according to eGFR, the administration of contrast agent in patients with a moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) would increase P-creatinine and reduce eGFR to a greater extent than an unenhanced CT.

### Effects of iodinated contrast agents on renal oxygenation level determined by blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging in rabbit models of type 1 and type 2 diabetic nephropathy [^9104fcbc]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The development of an international economy and improvements in living standards have led to progressive increases in the morbidity and prevalence of diabetes mellitus, such that diabetes mellitus is now a major public health concern. Worldwide, 284 million people were estimated to have diabetes in 2010, representing 6.4% of the total population. Furthermore, it was predicted that 439 million individuals worldwide, 7.7% of the total population, will have diabetes mellitus in 2030.

Diabetic nephropathy affects 15–25% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 30–40% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Iodinated contrast agents are mainly metabolized in the kidneys. Contrast agents sometimes cause hypoxia in the kidney — a deficiency of oxygenation and the primary feature of progressive chronic kidney disease. According to the studies by Pakfetrat et al. and Toprak and Cirit, renal insufficiency and chronic kidney disease are major risk factors for contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN), especially in patients with diabetes. CIN is defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or an increase of ≥ 25% above baseline. Generally, CIN is usually transient because the serum creatinine starts to rise within 24–48 h after exposure and reaches its peak value within 3–5 days after administration of the contrast agent, and subsequently declines. Therefore, early detection of CIN is challenging.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI, can facilitate detailed noninvasive assessment of renal function. This technique has been used to study the effects of iodinated contrast agents on the kidney in initial feasibility studies in humans. Tissue oxygenation bioavailability can be evaluated in terms of the R2* values. The increase of transverse relaxation rate R2* values reflect a poor oxygenation content in tissue. Prasad reported that the baseline R2* values in the renal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats were significantly greater than those of Wistar–Kyoto rats, implying lower oxygenation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In the present study, we used BOLD-MRI to examine the effects of iodine-containing contrast agents on renal oxygenation in a New Zealand white rabbit model of diabetic nephropathy.

### Nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography [^e846a3c9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7.

Results

The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P = 0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P = 0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P = 0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).

Conclusions

Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy – prevention and risk reduction [^5a270de9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a serious, but potentially preventable adverse event associated with the use of iodinated contrast media (CM). Studies suggest that the occurrence of CIN is directly related to the number of pre-existing patient risk factors such as pre-existing renal insufficiency (RI) with or without diabetes, advanced age, congestive heart failure and dehydration. Because the risk factors for CIN are common and the consequences serious or even life-threatening, it is important for physicians to implement preventive strategies. Although the optimal strategy for preventing CIN has not been fully established, it is important to first identify patients at risk. The commonly used methods for identifying patients at risk include use of patient questionnaires, review of medical history and measurement of serum creatinine levels prior to the administration of CM. Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) before CM administration should be encouraged. To prevent the development of CIN, patients should be well-hydrated and nephrotoxic medications should be withdrawn at least 24 h prior to CM. Use of the minimal necessary CM dose is recommended, as the nephrotoxic effect of CM is dose-dependent. Furthermore, appropriate selection of CM is important. The incidence of CIN has been shown to be lower when an iso-osmolar CM rather than a low-osmolar CM (iohexol) is used in patients with RI and diabetes. Pharmacological intervention with calcium channel blockers, dopamine and N-acetylcysteine have not consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of CIN. This article will review the risk factors for the development of CIN and discuss practical strategies for its prevention in at-risk patients.

### Probability of reduced renal function after contrast-enhanced CT: a model based on serum creatinine level, patient age, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [^07b2b7ca]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of our study were to develop a model to predict the probability of reduced renal function after outpatient contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) — based on patient age, sex, and race and on serum creatinine level before CT or directly based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) before CT — and to determine the relationship between patients with changes in creatinine level that characterize contrast-induced nephropathy and patients with reduced GFR after CECT.

Materials and Methods

Of 5,187 outpatients who underwent CECT, 963 (18.6%) had serum creatinine levels obtained within 6 months before and 4 days after CECT. The estimated GFR was calculated before and after CT using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation. Pre-CT serum creatinine level, age, race, sex, and pre-CT estimated GFR were tested using multiple-variable logistic regression models to determine the probability of having an estimated GFR of < 60 and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) after CECT. Two thirds of the patients were used to create and one third to test the models. We also determined discordance between patients who met standard definitions of contrast-induced nephropathy and those with a reduced estimated GFR after CECT.

Results

Significant (p < 0.002) predictors for a post-CT estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were age, race, sex, pre-CT serum creatinine level, and pre-CT estimated GFR. Sex, serum creatinine level, and pre-CT estimated GFR were significant factors (p < 0.001) for predicting a post-CT estimated GFR of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The probability is [exp(y) / (1 + exp(y))], where y = 6.21 - (0.10 x pre-CT estimated GFR) for an estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and y = 3.66 - (0.087 x pre-CT estimated GFR) for an estimated GFR of < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2). A discrepancy between those who met contrast-induced nephropathy criteria by creatinine changes and those with a post-CT estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was detected in 208 of the 963 patients (21.6%).

Conclusion

The probability of a reduced estimated GFR after CECT can be predicted by the pre-CT estimated GFR using the four-variable MDRD equation. Furthermore, standard criteria for contrast-induced nephropathy are poor predictors of poor renal function after CECT. Criteria need to be established for what is an acceptable risk to manage patients undergoing CECT.

### Negative effects of iodine-based contrast agent on renal function in patients with moderate reduced renal function hospitalized for COVID-19 [^9dc138cd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We hypothesized that the administration of iodine-based contrast agent to patients with COVID − 19 would affect P-creatinine and renal function. In the present study, in all subgroups of renal function, small changes were seen in median values 24–48 h after contrast agent exposure. However, our findings indicated that contrast agent administration had a negative effect on renal function at 48 h in 24% of patients and at 4–10 days in 36% of patients with moderate renal failure and eGFR 30–60 ml/min/1.73m 2. Corresponding figures observed in patients with eGFR > 60 and contrast-enhancement were significantly lower, 5%. Not surprisingly mortality was higher in contrast-enhanced patients with eGFR of 30–60 compared with those with eGFR above 60 (53% vs 11%). More patients with eGFR between 30 and 60 given contrast agent developed CI-AKI compared to those not receiving contrast agent (24–36% vs 0%). Patients in the unenhanced CT group with eGFR ≤ 60 had a median CRP of 186 mg/L at CT scan (compared to the median in the entire group 93 mg/L) and significantly higher median P-creatinine at CT scan compared with the eGFR ≥ 30–60 contrast-enhanced CT group (163 vs 130 μmol/L, p < 0.001). Despite this, 30-day mortality showed a tendency to be lower in the unenhanced CT group. These findings indicate that CI-AKI seems to have identified a vulnerable group of COVID-19 patients.

The findings related to renal replacement therapy are difficult to interpret without detailed knowledge of the renal replacement therapy intensity or diuresis. Not surprisingly, renal failure after contrast-enhanced CT was associated with an ICU stay day 4–10 (p = 0.023) and with 30-day mortality (p < 0.001).

The peak P-creatinine is typically observed 2 to 5 days after a contrast medium injection. The risk factors associated with acute kidney injury after an iodinated contrast injection includes advanced age, hypovolemia and dehydration, type 2 diabetes, and previously impaired kidney function. Chronic kidney disease was proposed to be the strongest risk factor associated with developing a contrast-associated acute kidney injury. However, Barrios-Lopez et al. reported, before the COVID − 19 era, that the incidence of CI-AKI was only 1% in patients with chronic renal disease and eGFR 30–60 ml/min × 1.73 m 2.

### Long-term effects of contrast media exposure on renal failure progression: a retrospective cohort study [^2e8a875b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study aimed to analyse the long-term effects of contrast media exposure in the field of CKD, which is of great social concern due to its high disease and economic burdens, and to compile basic data that will contribute to the study of preventive measures against its progression. The obtained results will indirectly contribute to the development of medical strategies for the application of contrast media testing and study of disease mechanisms, such as CIN.

### Remote ischemic preconditioning to reduce contrast-induced acute kidney injury in chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^bde8f0f1]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are routinely performed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) increases mortality and morbidity, and it is one of the most important adverse effects of contrast medium (CM), particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction. Based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome guidelines, AKI is defined as a 30% rise or 0.3 mg/dl increase in serum creatinine level The European Society of Urogenital Radiology defined contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) as an increase of the serum creatinine level ≥ 0.5 mg/dL or > 25% of the baseline value 48–72 h after CM administration. Cystatin C has been suggested to be more sensitive than serum creatinine to detect acute changes in renal function. In addition, Briguori et al. demonstrated that a serum cystatin C increase ≥ 10% from that at baseline was the best marker to identify patients at risk of developing CIN. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to have protective effects on the remote organs by alternating ischemia and reperfusion and releasing mediators in the body. Recently, RIPC has been evaluated to prevent CI-AKI. Although RIPC showed protective effects on urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein levels in patients with CI-AKI at low and moderate risks of developing CIN, the serum creatinine levels in the RIPC and control groups did not show significant differences. On the other hand, a pilot study reported by Er et al. showed a reduced incidence of CIN in high-risk patients, based on serum creatinine levels measured 48–72 h after CM administration.

Given the lack of enough data regarding the protective effects of RIPC in patients at moderate-to-high risk of developing CIN and the different effects of RIPC on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels in various reports, we performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the impact of RIPC after CM administration to protect renal function.

### N-acetylcysteine and contrast-induced nephropathy: a meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials [^4bf1b061]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following coronary angiography increases morbidity and mortality. Randomized trials of small sample size have evaluated whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents CIN in patients with renal dysfunction.

Methods

To conduct a meta-analysis of the randomized trials the following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966–2003), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, ACP Journal Club online, published abstracts presented at the major cardiology and nephrology meetings, references from reviews. Two authors independently evaluated all relevant randomized trials. Eligibility criteria were (1) randomized placebo controlled trials of NAC, (2) patients with impaired renal function (creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL) undergoing coronary angiography, (3) patients receiving intravenous fluids and low-osmolarity nonionic contrast media, (4) the primary outcome was CIN (increases in creatinine of either at least 0.5 mg/dL or 25% from baseline to 48 hours). Of 589 trials reviewed 3 disagreements were easily resolved by mutual discussion and 13 were selected. Data extraction included patient characteristics, intravenous fluid regimen, type and dose of contrast media, dosing regimen, creatinine at baseline and 48 hours and CIN requiring dialysis.

Results

Four of the 13 trials reported statistically significant results. In meta-analysis of the 13 trials, which included 1892 patients, the RR was 0.68 (95%CI, 0.46–1.01). The addition of the trial of patients undergoing computerized tomography, which had formulated the hypothesis, yielded a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.64 [95%CI 0.42–0.96]) as did an earlier meta-analysis of 7 trials.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis of the most currently available randomized data concerning NAC before coronary angiography to prevent CIN in patients with impaired renal function is neither conclusive nor provides proof beyond a reasonable doubt to influence clinical practice and public policy. The intervention has minimal toxicity but the width of the 95% CI remains compatible with a range from a large benefit to none at all. In addition, the trials used change in creatinine as the measure of outcome. Further randomized trials of large sample size and with clinical outcomes will add importantly relevant information to the totality of evidence and allow the most rational clinical decisions for individual patients as well as policy decisions for the health of the general public.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied throughout the years. There is a large volume of literature documenting this risk, and most radiology departments and radiologists use this information when making decisions regarding contrast administration. A review of the current information on the topic of contrast-induced acute kidney injury is necessary to ensure that the risks of intravenous contrast are properly weighed against the benefits of a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan.

### Preventing contrast-induced nephropathy: problems, challenges and future directions [^6c6b1595]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Current limitations of diagnosis of CIN

Our ability to diagnose CIN is limited by the lack of an appropriately sensitive and specific marker of kidney injury. Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18 and other markers are currently being evaluated as reliable indicators of injury and predictors of adverse outcomes. Until such validation occurs, changes in kidney function, specifically glomerular filtration rate (GFR), remain our only means of diagnosing CIN. In clinical practice, changes in GFR are estimated by absolute or relative changes in serum creatinine, that is, increases of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25%, respectively, occurring 48 to 72 hours after contrast exposure. Unfortunately, changes in serum creatinine can occur for reasons other than a decrease in GFR and thus are not specific for a decrease in GFR. Furthermore, because of the time lag between a fall in GFR and a rise in creatinine, the timing of creatinine measurement following contrast exposure can affect the sensitivity of the test. Cystatin C has been advocated as a more sensitive marker of a fall in GFR.

### I.V. N-acetylcysteine and emergency CT: use of serum creatinine and cystatin C as markers of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity [^7d9ef85d]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of i.v. administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C, two markers of renal function, in patients with renal insufficiency who undergo emergency contrast-enhanced CT.

Subjects and Methods

Eighty-seven adult patients with renal insufficiency who underwent emergency CT were randomized to two groups. In the first group, in addition to hydration, patients received a 900-mg injection of NAC 1 hour before and another immediately after injection of iodine contrast medium. Patients in the second group received hydration only. Serum levels of creatinine and cystatin C were measured at admission and on days 2 and 4 after CT. Nephrotoxicity was defined as a 25% or greater increase in serum creatinine or cystatin C concentration from baseline value.

Results

A 25% or greater increase in serum creatinine concentration was found in nine (21%) of 43 patients in the control group and in two (5%) of 44 patients in the NAC group (p = 0.026). A 25% or greater increase in serum cystatin C concentration was found in nine (22%) of 40 patients in the control group and in seven (17%) of 41 patients in the NAC group (p = 0.59).

Conclusion

On the basis of serum creatinine concentration only, i.v. administration of NAC appears protective against the nephrotoxicity of contrast medium. No effect is found when serum cystatin C concentration is used to assess renal function. The effect of NAC on serum creatinine level remains unclear and may not be related to a renoprotective action.

3. Contrast-induced nephropathy

Besides the KDIGO guidelines, many other bodies issued recommendations on the treatment and prevention of CIN.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^f88fc820]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) contrast nephropathy risk assessment for computed tomography (CT) imaging states that the overall risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) following IV contrast utilization is very low, ranging from 0 to 11 percent, and that improved sensitivity of the study will outweigh AKI risk in the majority of patients. Patients with a significantly compromised glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to multiple comorbidities, marked dehydration, or known chronic kidney injury are particularly susceptible; point-of-care creatinine assessment (iSTAT), when available, will rapidly estimate GFR in 2 minutes. Patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min are deemed at risk for AKI; options in these patients include performing the study initially without contrast or performing the study with the minimum acceptable volume contrast infusion necessary to obtain a diagnostic study. When initial non-contrast torso imaging is used, real-time interpretation concurrent with acquisition is a best practice, and the presence of mediastinal, intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid consistent with hemorrhage, in other words, Hounsfield units of 30 or more, and/or concern for visceral injury usually warrants utilization of IV contrast despite its risk.

### Radiologists' knowledge and perceptions of the impact of contrast-induced nephropathy and its risk factors when performing computed tomography examinations: a survey of European radiologists [^8f357db5]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The past decade has seen a proliferation in the number of CT procedures. As increasing numbers of elderly patients with multiple comorbidities undergo contrast media (CM)-enhanced procedures, more patients are at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).

Objectives

To understand whether radiologists are sufficiently aware of the incidence, impact and risk factors of CIN, and whether they are taking sufficient measures to prevent CIN among patients undergoing CT.

Materials and Methods

A telephone or online survey was conducted in 2005 with 509 radiologists from 10 European countries. Participants had a minimum of 3 years' experience and performed at least 50 CT scans per week.

Results

Most (88%) radiologists believed that CIN is an important issue. While 45% identify that a patient is experiencing CIN when the serum creatinine level increases > 25% (0.5mg/dL) from baseline within 48h, the remainder used criteria that might lead to significant under-diagnosis. Most (72%) radiologists believed that CIN is associated with increased morbidity; 56% did not believe that it is associated with increased mortality. Most respondents agreed that pre-existing renal impairment (97%), dehydration (90%) and diabetes (89%) were risk factors for CIN; however, 26%, 30% and 46%, respectively, did not identify advanced age, CM dose or congestive cardiac failure as risk factors. Only 7% of radiologists thought they were always made aware of CIN associated with their cases and 28% never consulted a nephrologist to discuss patients at risk of CIN or who had developed CIN.

Conclusion

There is highly variable awareness of the definition, impact and risk factors for CIN among European radiologists. Data regarding the importance of CIN in CT are limited. Improved efforts are required to better educate radiologists and referring physicians and to institute appropriate protocols to identify at-risk patients and prevent CIN.

### The value of N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of radiocontrast agent-induced nephropathy seems questionable [^2b02f518]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Prevention of contrast agent-induced nephropathy is of crucial importance for a number of diagnostic studies. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) was recently reported to decrease serum creatinine levels in this setting, and its administration before radiocontrast medium administration has been widely recommended. The objective of this prospective study was to investigate whether there are effects of NAC on serum creatinine levels that are independent of alterations in GFR. Volunteers with normal renal function who did not receive radiocontrast medium were studied. Fifty healthy volunteers completed the study protocol. NAC was administered orally at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h, for a total of four doses. Surrogate markers of renal function, such as serum creatinine, urea, albumin, and cystatin C levels, were measured and estimated GFR (eGFR) was assessed immediately before the administration of NAC and 4 and 48 h after the last dose. There was a significant decrease in the mean serum creatinine concentration (P < 0.05) and a significant increase in the eGFR (P < 0.02) 4 h after the last dose of NAC. The cystatin C concentrations did not change significantly. In several studies, a protective effect of NAC on renal function after radiocontrast medium administration has been postulated. This is the first study to demonstrate an effect of NAC on creatinine levels and eGFR, surrogate markers of renal injury, without any effect on cystatin C levels. Before renoprotective effects of NAC against contrast agent-induced nephropathy are considered, the direct effects of NAC on creatinine levels, urea levels, and eGFR should be assessed.

### Shaped-bolus protocol reduces contrast medium volume in abdominal CT while maintaining image quality [^33a2307e]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To prospectively assess whether bolus shaping to exponentially decrease the contrast medium injection rate leads to alteration in image validity or renal function.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, patients alternatively received 100 mL contrast medium versus 75 mL via bolus shaping. Image quality was assessed via measurement of attenuation values in the aorta, liver, and spleen and also blinded subjective assessment of image sharpness, low contrast detectability, image noise, and overall quality. Renal function was assessed by change in creatinine levels up to 72 hours post-contrast medium administration.

Results

Of 190 abdominal computed tomography (CT) studies performed in the 3-month period, 98 received the 75 mL dose. There was no significant difference in renal function or objective image quality with a significant improvement in image sharpness in the 100 mL group.

Conclusions

By using bolus-shaping software, it is possible to maintain objective image quality while reducing the contrast medium load to the patient. This has significant implications regarding clinical practice in decreasing cost and risks associated with iodinated contrast media.

Figure 1
Study flow chart of meta‐analysis. CIN indicates contrast‐induced nephropathy; CT, computed tomography; RCT, randomized controlled trial.

The 61 articles with 66 comparisons were published between 1996 and 2016 and yielded a cumulative total of 11 480 patients, 5757 of whom were randomly assigned to the NAC group and 5723 to the control group (Table 1). All included studies had reported the incidence of CIN. Forty‐six studies with 48 comparisons 1 were conducted in patients who underwent coronary angiography, 4 studies with 5 comparisons 64, 72, 74, 75 in patients who underwent peripheral angiography, 7 studies with 7 comparisons 11, 52, 60, 70, 81, 85, 87 in patients who underwent CT, and 4 studies with 6 comparisons 36, 44, 45, 62 in patients who underwent both coronary and peripheral angiography. The outcome of CIN was assessed by the change in the serum creatinine level. Thirty studies with 34 comparisons defined CIN as either > 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% increase in the serum creatinine level, 2 13 studies with 13 comparisons 3 defined CIN as > 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine, and 18 studies with 19 comparisons 4 defined CIN as a > 25% increase in the serum creatinine level. The interventions used for all studies were NAC supplementation of varying dosages and treatment methods. The dosage of NAC supplements ranged from 600 to 16 000 mg. Twenty‐one studies with 23 comparisons 5 chose to administer a total NAC dosage larger than 2400 mg, and 40 studies with 43 comparisons 6 preferred a total supplementation dosage between 600 and 2400 IU. Forty‐six studies with 49 comparisons 7 preferred oral supplementation strategies, 14 studies with 15 comparisons 8 preferred intravenous route strategies, and the other 2 comparisons 32, 71 selected both oral and intravenous strategies. Forty‐one studies with 44 comparisons 9 enrolled patients with renal insufficiency at the baseline (serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dL), whereas the other 20 studies with 22 comparisons 10 did not diagnose renal impairment. Twenty studies with 22 comparisons 11 performed the injection of high‐dose contrast agent (> 150 mL), while another 36 studies with 38 comparisons 12 performed the injection of low‐dose contrast agent (< 150 mL).

### Prospective observational study of point-of-care creatinine in trauma [^6a156528]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

The vast majority of patients in this study had normal creatinine values. Therefore, while the data support the accuracy of the creatinine values for patients with normal creatinine, the accuracy outside of the normal range was not demonstrated. A larger study or a different patient population would be necessary to look at the device in patients with renal failure.

This device may affect practice in austere environments, where determination of creatinine values with a small, inexpensive device could prove beneficial. There is a precedent for POC creatinine determination in an austere environment; more research would be needed to determine its role in the care of trauma and surgical patients. Potential uses include resuscitation and management during prolonged transport and management of perioperative patients without access to a full laboratory. Forward surgical teams in role II settings may benefit by having an easily portable device that can be transported to each destination. Additionally, development is underway for similar devices that measure other important values, including hemoglobin.

This study also has the potential to affect a subset of trauma patients who have a low probability of critical findings on CT scanning, but have an increased likelihood of developing contrast-induced nephropathy. Examples of patients who may benefit are elderly patients who sustain a ground level fall requiring CT imaging and patients who are found down and at risk for rhabdomyolysis. The elderly portion of the trauma population is steadily growing, and even low energy mechanisms can cause significant injury in these patients. If found to have elevated creatinine, elderly patients could be resuscitated prior to a delayed CT scan with contrast, or an algorithm could be used to initially scan without contrast. Notably, the fact that creatinine values were available prior to contrast administration in this study means that this algorithm could potentially be implemented with minimal delay of care.

Determination of creatinine values with a POC device is feasible in a major trauma center. More research would be necessary to determine its feasibility in an austere environment. The device is quite portable; however, the test strips must be refrigerated in the long term.

### Canadian association of radiologists guidance on contrast-associated acute kidney injury [^efceb229]. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for contrast-induced nephropathy, more specifically with respect to restriction of contrast medium use, CAR 2022 guidelines recommend to assess the overall risk of worsening AKI with contrast versus the benefit of improved diagnostic capability and therapeutic intervention for the use of IV or intra-arterial contrast in the setting of preexisting AKI.

### Incidence and risk factors for postcontrast acute kidney injury in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest [^a96fa633]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest may be exposed to iodinated contrast from invasive coronary angiography or contrast-enhanced computed tomography, although the effects on incident acute kidney injury are unknown. The study objective was to determine whether contrast administration within the first 24 hours was associated with acute kidney injury in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest.

Methods

This cohort study, derived from a prospective clinical trial, included patients with sudden cardiac arrest who survived for 48 hours, had no history of end-stage renal disease, and had at least 2 serum creatinine measurements during hospitalization. The contrast group included patients with exposure to iodinated contrast within 24 hours of sudden cardiac arrest. Incident acute kidney injury and first-time dialysis were compared between contrast and no contrast groups and then controlled for known acute kidney injury risk factors.

Results

Of the 199 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest, 94 received iodinated contrast. Mean baseline serum creatinine level was 1.3 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 1.5 mg/dL) for the contrast group and 1.6 mg/dL (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL) for the no contrast group. Incident acute kidney injury was lower in the contrast group (12.8%) than the no contrast group (17.1%; difference 4.4%; 95% CI -9.2% to 17.5%). Contrast administration was not associated with significant increases in incident acute kidney injury within quartiles of baseline serum creatinine level or after controlling for age, sex, race, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and admission serum creatinine level by regression analysis. Older age was independently associated with acute kidney injury.

Conclusion

Despite elevated baseline serum creatinine level in most survivors of sudden cardiac arrest, iodinated contrast administration was not associated with incident acute kidney injury even when other acute kidney injury risk factors were controlled for. Thus, although acute kidney injury is not uncommon among survivors of sudden cardiac arrest, early (< 24 hours) contrast administration from imaging procedures did not confer an increased risk for acute kidney injury.

### Absence of potential gadolinium toxicity symptoms following 22, 897 gadoteric acid (dotarem ®) examinations, including 3, 209 performed on renally insufficient individuals [^ab2f8858]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

PC-AKI

Serum creatinine levels within 3 days pre- and post-MRI were available and percentage changes thus calculated for 2,105 contrast and 970 non-contrast scans. After controlling for the dependence of creatinine changes on eGFR category, there was no statistical difference in percentage changes of creatinine between contrast or non-contrast scans (-0.40% vs. 0.61%, p = 0.273). When this analysis was limited to only those scans performed on patients with renal function categorised as stage 4 or 5, those undergoing a non-contrast scan experienced an average serum creatinine increase of 7.31%, while the serum creatinine of those undergoing contrast scans decreased by an average of -4.40% (p = 0.023). There was no statistical difference in cases of a greater than 25% increase in serum creatinine post-MRI observed (Fig. 1) regardless of renal function or whether contrast was administered or not (p = 0.566).

GDD

A total of ten (0.026%) cases of new and regular chronic pain medication prescriptions were noted following either contrast or non-contrast MRI. Seven of these were contrast-enhanced MRI. All patients had normal renal function at the time of scan. The rate was not statistically higher regardless of renal function or whether contrast was administered (p = 0.777).

### Point of care creatinine testing in diagnostic imaging: a feasibility study within the outpatient computed tomography setting [^9a4e609b]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although the risks associated with iodinated contrast administration are acknowledged to be very low, screening of kidney function prior to administration is still standard practice in many hospitals. This study has evaluated the feasibility of implementing a screening form in conjunction with point of care (PoC) creatinine testing as a method to manage the risks of post contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) within the CT imaging pathway.

Method

Over an eight-week period 300 adult outpatients attending a UK CT department for contrast-enhanced scans were approached. Participants completed a screening questionnaire for co-morbidities linked to kidney dysfunction and consented to have a PoC and laboratory creatinine tests. Comparison was made against with previous baseline blood tests obtained within the preceding 3 months, as required by the study site. Participants were also invited to attend for follow up PoC and laboratory bloods tests at 48-72h.

Results

14 patients (4.7%) had a scan-day eGFR below 45mL/min/1.73m2, all identified through screening. The majority of patients (n = 281/300; 93.7%) fell in the same risk category based on previous and scan-day blood results. Six PoC test failures were recorded on the scan day. The constant error between the Abbott i-STAT PoC scan-day measurements and the laboratory scan-day measurements was -3.71 (95% CI: -6.41 to -0.50). Five patients had an elevated creatinine (≥ 25% from baseline) post contrast administration, but no instances of PC-AKI (≥ 50% from baseline) were identified.

Conclusion

PoC creatinine testing is a practical method of ensuring renal function and is feasible in the radiology environment.

### Contrast-induced nephropathy: identifying the risks, choosing the right agent, and reviewing effective prevention and management methods [^3aa3fe3b]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With the rise in the use of intravenous iodinated contrast media for both computed tomography scan and angiographic studies, there is a greater likelihood of complications. One of the most well-known adverse effects is contrast-induced media nephropathy, which is also called contrast-induced acute kidney injury. This is third most common cause of hospital acquired acute renal failure. It is associated with an increase in morbidity, mortality, and greater financial burden on healthcare system. Because of these factors, it is important for the radiologist to not only recognize risk factors, as well as the signs and symptoms, but also to know how to manage patients appropriately.

### The clinical and renal consequences of contrast-induced nephropathy [^8d670035]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), an impairment of renal function following intravascular injection of contrast media, is commonly defined as an increase in the baseline serum creatinine concentration of > 25% or 0.5 mg/dl (44 micromol/l). The incidence of CIN does not appear to have changed appreciably in the last three decades, and it continues to be the third leading cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure (ARF). In the general population, the incidence of CIN is estimated to be 1–2%. However, the risk for developing CIN may be as high as 50% in some high-risk patient subgroups, such as those with diabetes mellitus and pre-existing renal impairment. Patients who develop CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention sustain an increase in both short- and long-term mortality whether or not chronic kidney disease was present prior to contrast exposure. The diminished long-term survival in patients with CIN has been observed for both, those whose ARF is not severe enough to require dialysis as well as those requiring dialysis. Treatment is limited to supportive measures while awaiting the resolution of the renal impairment. At times, this does not occur. Because of the lack of treatment options and because CIN is associated with serious short- and long-term sequelae, emphasis needs to be directed at preventative measures, identification of high-risk patients and education of all physicians involved in the care of these patients in order to reduce the incidence of CIN.

### Contrast agent – associated nephrotoxicity [^518a6b40]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Radiocontrast media can lead to a reversible form of acute renal failure that begins soon after the contrast dye administration and generally is benign. Contrast media accounts for 10% of all causes of hospital-acquired acute renal failure and represents the third leading cause of in-hospital renal function deterioration after decreased renal perfusion and postoperative renal insufficiency. The in-hospital mortality rate in patients developing renal insufficiency is related directly to the magnitude increase of serum creatinine concentration. The mortality rate ranges from 3.8% with an increase in serum creatinine level of 0.5 to 0.9 mg/dL to 64% with an increase of greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The mechanism by which contrast-induced renal failure occurs is not well understood. Contrast agent-associated nephrotoxicity appears to be a result of direct contrast-induced renal tubular epithelial cell toxicity and renal medullary ischemia. Furthermore, a key mechanism seems to be alteration in renal dynamics, probably caused by imbalances between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor factors, including the activities of nitric oxide, prostaglandins, endothelin, and reactive oxygen species. The optimal strategy to prevent contrast-associated nephrotoxicity remains uncertain. At present, recommendations are as follows: (1) periprocedural hydration, (2) use of a low-osmolality contrast, and (3) limiting the amount of contrast agent. Recently, considerable interest has resulted from the preliminary positive data on the effectiveness of prophylactic administration of acetylcysteine and fenoldopam. The former may prevent the direct oxidative tissue damage, whereas the latter is a selective intrarenal vasodilator.

### Negative effects of iodine-based contrast agent on renal function in patients with moderate reduced renal function hospitalized for COVID-19 [^bbfc72a0]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This retrospective study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review authority, (Dnr 2020–01882), and informed consent was waived. From March 19 to May 31, 2020, we included all patients with a PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were referred to thoracic or abdominal CT at our hospital.

Measurements

We collected P- creatinine measured on the day of before CT and 24 h, 48 h, and 4–10 days after CT, when available. The collection of P-creatinine values at days 4–10, a little longer interval than normal was performed as a way to study if P-creatinine reacted differently in this patient group after contrast injection but also as a double-follow-up. P-creatinine (anticoagulated with Li-heparin) was analyzed with an enzymatic photometric method (Cobas®, Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The reference values were < 100 μmol/L for men and < 90 μmol/L for women. Pre- COVID − 19 levels of P-creatinine were retrieved from patient records up to 2 years before the current hospitalization. These values were collected in order to compare renal function before COVID-19 as this might affect outcome.

eGFR was calculated according to the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula. An eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 was taken as normal, eGFR values 30–60 indicated moderate reduced renal function and values below 30 indicated severe renal failure. CI-AKI was defined as an increase in P-creatinine ≥ 27 μmol/L or > 50% rise in P-creatinine above the value on the day of CT.

CT was performed with a 256-slice multi-detector Revolution CT (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, USA). Of the 142 patients receiving contrast administration at CT in our study, 115 subjects were investigated with CT angiography of the chest for suspected PE. According to standardized protocol the legitimate total contrast injection was 50 ml, which was slightly higher (70 ml) in adipose patients (> 80 kg). Nevertheless the standard contrast dose received at CT was 60 ml. The contrast agent (Omnipaque 350 mg/ml, Iohexol, GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, USA) was injected at a flow rate of 5 ml/s. Remaining patients (n = 27) performed CT angiography and CT of the abdomen in venous phase with personalized and higher contrast doses.

### Fluctuations in eGFR in relation to unenhanced and enhanced MRI and CT outpatients [^a77d19af]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To study fluctuations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in relation to contrast medium (CM) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) compared to control groups in outpatients.

Materials and Methods

eGFR was determined right before the imaging procedure and three days later at the department or at the patient's home. The iodine-based and gadolinium-based contrast media were the same as used for all other examinations at the department.

Results

A total of 716 patients completed the study. There was a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant rise in eGFR after three days in all four groups. The average eGFR variation was 4.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). There were large variations in eGFR between the two measurements in 45.8% of the patients as they had a change greater than ± 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Only three patients fulfilled the contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) requirement when the definition s-creatinine ≥ 44 μmol/l (0.5mg/dl) was used.

Conclusions

eGFR in outpatients undergoing MRI or CT did vary independently of whether the patient received contrast or not. The findings probably reflect the natural variations in s-creatinine levels. This should be taken into consideration when CIN is studied.
