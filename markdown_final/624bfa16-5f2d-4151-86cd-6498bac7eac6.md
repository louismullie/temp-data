## Question

Are bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas transmitted through sexual contact?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are transmitted through sexual contact, what the transmission evidence shows, and how partner management should follow from that classification. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental biology and definitions for BV versus TV. Then, I should verify how major guidelines classify each condition. Next, I will review the transmission data, including partner-concordance and epidemiologic associations. After that, I need to check partner-treatment recommendations and typical therapeutic regimens to see how they align with transmission dynamics. Finally, I will synthesize a nuanced conclusion and note key caveats and exceptions, anchoring on CDC 2021 and WHO 2024 guidance [^11488KRC] [^114kX2MY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. BV is best understood as a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by loss of lactobacilli and overgrowth of diverse anaerobes rather than a single-organism infection, which immediately raises a flag that it might not fit the classic STI paradigm; this non-optimal microbiota includes Gardnerella, Atopobium, and Prevotella species, among others [^112iwPBi] [^113yDc2c]. By contrast, trichomoniasis is caused by the protozoan T. vaginalis and is consistently described by major public health bodies as a common, curable STI, which suggests a more straightforward sexual transmission pattern that often requires concurrent partner management [^11488KRC] [^111VNU6f].

> I need to verify formal classification next. For TV, the CDC and IUSTI/WHO guidelines explicitly classify trichomoniasis as an STI and manage it within STI frameworks, which is a strong classification signal [^11488KRC] [^112xUasi]. For BV, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although BV is strongly associated with sexual activity, contemporary reviews and guidelines describe it as a dysbiosis with unknown exact etiology, and they avoid labeling it a classic STI, which I should keep in mind as I evaluate partner-management evidence [^112iwPBi] [^1144WFg8].

> I will now examine direct transmission evidence for TV. Partner-concordance studies show high rates of infection in male partners of infected women, with more than two-thirds of male partners testing positive and most being asymptomatic, a pattern typical of sexually transmitted pathogens that circulate silently without treatment; this supports routine partner therapy to break reinfection cycles [^113uUFua] [^111VNU6f]. Risk factors such as multiple partners and unprotected intercourse further align with STI epidemiology for TV and reinforce its sexual transmissibility [^114Gj5f3] [^11488KRC].

> Next, I should review evidence for sexual transmission in BV. Epidemiologically, BV is linked to new or multiple partners and reduced condom use, suggesting sexual exposure has a material role in acquisition dynamics; molecular studies also document exchange of BV-associated bacteria between partners and higher BV prevalence in women who have sex with women, both of which imply transmissibility of bacterial communities during sexual contact [^114yUGwt] [^115BEA6z] [^1172dPuf]. But wait, what if this still reflects dysbiosis rather than a single-pathogen infection? The polymicrobial nature and variability of implicated species keep its classification complex and short of a definitive STI label despite the strong sexual association [^113yDc2c] [^1144WFg8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the counterarguments that challenge a strict STI designation for BV. The presence of BV-associated organisms in some virginal women, the inconsistent efficacy of treating male partners to prevent female recurrence, and the ability of endogenous reservoirs to reseed dysbiosis argue against a purely sexually transmitted model and suggest a broader pathogenesis that includes but is not limited to sexual transmission pathways [^1144WFg8] [^115BEA6z] [^1172dPuf]. Let me reconsider: taken together, these data support describing BV as sexually associated rather than a classic STI, which aligns with guideline language and observed recurrence patterns [^112iwPBi] [^114yUGwt].

> I need to check partner-treatment guidance to ensure my classification aligns with practice. For trichomoniasis, guidelines recommend that all sexual partners be treated concurrently to prevent reinfection, which operationalizes the STI classification and reflects high asymptomatic carriage in men; rescreening of women at three months is also advised due to frequent repeat infections [^112xUasi] [^111VNU6f]. For BV, I should confirm recommendations; the IUSTI/WHO guidance explicitly advises against treating male partners because randomized trials have not shown a reduction in recurrence, while treatment of female partners is guided by symptoms and diagnosis, consistent with BV's sexually associated but non-classic-STI status [^114Dz9ZQ] [^116LmS3w]. Initially, I thought partner therapy might help BV recurrence broadly; hold on, I should verify — those trials have largely been negative for routine male partner treatment, which corrects that assumption [^114Dz9ZQ].

> Let me verify that therapeutic regimens further reflect this distinction. For TV, nitroimidazoles are first-line, with metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for seven days for women and single-dose options for certain contexts, and WHO 2024 provides single-dose alternatives where adherence is a concern; the emphasis on partner therapy and retesting mirrors its transmissibility profile [^11488KRC] [^113o9tb4] [^112GEJDK]. For BV, recommended regimens include oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole gel, or clindamycin cream, with alternatives such as clindamycin oral or ovules and secnidazole; none of these recommendations include routine male partner treatment, again reflecting a dysbiosis model rather than a classic STI construct [^116ecoQF] [^114fsSas] [^116LmS3w].

> Synthesis time: I need to ensure the final framing is precise. Trichomonas vaginalis is definitively an STI with efficient sexual transmission and high partner concordance, and management requires concurrent partner treatment to prevent reinfection and ongoing transmission, per major guidelines [^11488KRC] [^112xUasi] [^111VNU6f]. Bacterial vaginosis is not classified as a classic STI; however, sexual activity is a major driver of risk and partner exchange of BV-associated bacteria is well documented, so the most accurate clinical language is that BV is sexually associated, with management focused on treating the affected patient and not routinely treating male partners given trial data and guideline recommendations [^112iwPBi] [^1144WFg8] [^114Dz9ZQ].

Trichomoniasis is a **sexually transmitted infection** [^11488KRC] caused by Trichomonas vaginalis and is transmitted through vaginal, oral, or anal sex, with partners requiring treatment to prevent reinfection [^112xUasi]. Bacterial vaginosis is **not classified as an STI** [^112iwPBi] but is associated with sexual activity [^113yDc2c] and can recur after sex with untreated partners; male partners are not treated [^114Dz9ZQ], but female partners should be treated if symptomatic. Both conditions increase the risk of acquiring other STIs [^113yDc2c], including HIV [^111VNU6f], and are managed with metronidazole or tinidazole [^11488KRC] [^114kX2MY], with partner management differing between the two [^112xUasi].

## Trichomoniasis: a sexually transmitted infection

### Etiology and transmission

Trichomoniasis is caused by **Trichomonas vaginalis**, a flagellated protozoan parasite [^11488KRC] [^114Gj5f3]. Transmission occurs primarily via vaginal intercourse [^11488KRC]; oral and anal sex can also spread the infection [^115EDyn7]. Many infected individuals — especially men — are asymptomatic but remain infectious [^113uUFua].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Women may present with vaginal discharge, itching, irritation, dysuria, and dyspareunia [^114Gj5f3]; **men** are often asymptomatic but can develop urethritis, prostatitis, or epididymitis [^11488KRC] [^111VNU6f].

---

### Diagnosis

- **NAATs**: Highly sensitive and specific [^1148douX]; recommended by CDC and WHO [^11488KRC] [^115eerEw].

- **Wet mount microscopy**: Rapid [^111ZyVe6] but less sensitive [^11488KRC].

- **Culture**: Previously gold standard [^111ZyVe6]; now less commonly used due to NAATs [^11488KRC].

---

### Treatment and partner management

- **First-line therapy**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily [^113GQ4Qd] for 7 days [^11488KRC].

- **Alternative therapy**: Tinidazole 2 g orally [^113GQ4Qd] as a single dose [^11488KRC].

- **Partner treatment**: Sexual partners must be treated [^112xUasi] to prevent reinfection [^111VNU6f].

## Bacterial vaginosis: a sexually associated condition

### Etiology and transmission

Bacterial vaginosis reflects a **polymicrobial dysbiosis** [^112iwPBi] with reduced lactobacilli and increased anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae [^113yDc2c]. It is not classified as an STI but is associated with sexual activity — such as new or multiple partners and inconsistent condom use [^114yUGwt] [^113yDc2c]. Nonsexual contributors include douching [^114yUGwt], smoking, and hormonal changes [^113yDc2c].

---

### Clinical manifestations

Symptoms include a thin, grayish-white discharge with a fishy odor, vaginal irritation, and itching [^112iwPBi] [^113yDc2c]; however, **asymptomatic cases** are common, especially in pregnant women [^11187FjD].

---

### Diagnosis

Clinical diagnosis uses **Amsel criteria**, including characteristic discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, a positive whiff test, and clue cells [^111hK5ws]. Nugent scoring provides a Gram stain–based assessment of vaginal flora [^112iwPBi]. Molecular diagnostics are emerging but not yet standard [^116K2hdo] [^113yDc2c].

---

### Treatment and partner management

- **First-line therapy**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily [^116ecoQF] for 7 days [^114kX2MY].

- **Alternative therapy**: Clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily [^114fsSas] for 7 days [^114kX2MY].

- **Partner treatment**: Male partners not treated [^114Dz9ZQ]; female partners treated if symptomatic.

---

## Comparative summary

| **Characteristic** | **Trichomoniasis** | **Bacterial vaginosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiology | Trichomonas vaginalis (protozoan) | Polymicrobial dysbiosis |
| Transmission | Sexually transmitted | Sexually associated |
| Classification | STI | Not an STI |
| Diagnosis | - NAATs <br/> - Wet mount <br/> - Culture | - Amsel criteria <br/> - Nugent scoring |
| Treatment | Metronidazole or tinidazole | Metronidazole or clindamycin |
| Partner management | Treat all partners | Treat symptomatic female partners only |

## Public health implications

Both conditions increase **susceptibility to other STIs**, including HIV [^111VNU6f] [^113yDc2c]. They are also associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, and other adverse outcomes [^1118aqNd] [^113yDc2c]. High recurrence rates — particularly for BV — complicate management [^115BEA6z] [^113yDc2c].

---

Trichomoniasis is a **sexually transmitted infection** requiring partner treatment [^112xUasi], while bacterial vaginosis is a sexually associated condition **not classified as an STI** [^112iwPBi], with partner treatment only for symptomatic female partners [^114Dz9ZQ]. Both conditions increase the risk of other STIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^111VNU6f] [^113yDc2c], necessitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynecological and obstetric sequelae, including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those that do, it is the symptoms themselves, including malodour and vaginal discharge, that cause significant distress to women and impact their quality of life and relationships.

Evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB).

While the exact pathogen/s responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesized that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

### An updated conceptual model on the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis [^1144WFg8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease, and sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The epidemiology of BV supports sexual transmission; however, its etiology remains unknown.

- **Debate on causation**: At the center of the debate is whether BV is caused by a primary pathogen or a polymicrobial consortium of microorganisms that are sexually transmitted. A previously published conceptual model hypothesized that BV is initiated by sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis. Critics of this model have argued that G. vaginalis is found in virginal women and sexually active women with a normal vaginal microbiota. Additionally, colonization does not always lead to BV.

- **Recent advances**: Recent research into BV pathogenesis has identified 13 different species within the genus Gardnerella. It may be that healthy women are colonized by nonpathogenic Gardnerella species, whereas virulent strains are involved in BV development.

Based on results from a recent prospective study, coupled with an extensive literature review, an updated conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV is presented, focusing on the roles of virulent strains of G. vaginalis, as well as Prevotella bivia and Atopobium vaginae.

### Molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: An update [^116K2hdo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women. BV has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV represents the acquisition of a diverse community of anaerobic and facultative bacteria and a reduction in lactobacilli. It can be diagnosed using several tests ranging from clinical indicators, point-of-care tests, and molecular assays.

- **Molecular technologies**: These are objective, able to detect fastidious bacteria, enable quantitation, and are ideal for self-collected vaginal swabs.

This paper reviews the currently available BV diagnostic tests in the United States.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Global epidemiology and control of Trichomonas vaginalis [^114CsSwq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection. Despite a number of serious health consequences, including facilitation of HIV transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, it remains an under-recognized condition. This review aims to update the reader on the global epidemiology and control of T. vaginalis.

The burden of T. vaginalis infection is found in resource-limited settings and high-risk groups in industrialized settings. Utilization of polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics has enhanced our understanding of the epidemiology of T. vaginalis both at the population level and in sexual partners. High rates of asymptomatic infection in male partners of infected females and subsequent re-infection have significant implications for control programs. Further studies investigating the role of T. vaginalis in facilitating HIV transmission have highlighted its significance and the need to develop and implement control interventions.

Future research to develop affordable, point-of-care diagnostic tests will allow a greater understanding of T. vaginalis epidemiology. In addition, the effect of treatment on the outcome of pregnancy and HIV acquisition requires further study. This will, in turn, facilitate operational studies evaluating optimal control strategies and their impact on the complications of T. vaginalis.

Use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Most important is the recognition of different subgroups of women who have BV and are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing related diseases.

### State of the art for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^112iwPBi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among reproductive-age women. It is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including an increased risk of acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in addition to adverse birth outcomes. While it is known that BV is a vaginal dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the vaginal microbiota from protective Lactobacillus species to an increase in facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria, its exact etiology remains unknown.

This minireview provides an updated overview of the range of tests currently used for the diagnosis of BV in both clinical and research settings.

- **Traditional BV diagnostics**: The article examines various conventional methods for diagnosing BV.

- **Molecular diagnostics**: Molecular diagnostic assays, particularly 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are specifically highlighted. Additionally, multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are noted for their increasing use in clinical practice (NAATs) and research studies (16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and FISH) concerning the vaginal microbiota and BV pathogenesis.

We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of BV diagnostic tests and address future challenges in this field of research.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116ZcbgY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginitis, which most often manifests clinically as abnormal discharge, dysuria, odor, or itching, is one of the most common causes of primary care office visits for women in the United States. Women seek care from a variety of provider types or clinical settings, including obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN), family planning, family practice, internal medicine, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. For symptomatic women, diagnostic testing often depends on the clinic type, available diagnostic services, and provider assumptions about their clientele. These real-world factors could result in restricted diagnostic testing of some causes of vaginitis, to the exclusion of others.

In addition, comprehensive diagnostic testing for women in primary care settings can be hampered by reliance on clinical methods (e.g. wet prep microscopy and visual assessment of discharge) that are subjective and/or require specialized equipment and training. In other cases, testing may carry stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As public funds continue to be withdrawn from STD-specific clinical services, primary care providers must take on the additional responsibility of providing these services for their clients. Making this type of testing both simple (e.g. through use of a single sample) and normative (i.e. it is provided for everyone with these symptoms) will both improve services for women and reduce the stigma associated with STI testing. A distinction is often drawn by providers between vaginitis (which is generally not perceived as an STI) and STIs.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^1155Ubo4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Significant increases in rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV), *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT), *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG), and *Mycoplasma genitalium* (MG) are occurring in the United States. We present results of a U.S. study examining the intersection of STIs and vaginitis.

Among 1,051 women diagnosed for the presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), 195 (18.5%) had one or more STIs, including 101 (9.6%) with TV, 24 (2.3%) with CT, 9 (0.8%) with NG, and 93 (8.8%) with MG. STI prevalence in BV-positive women was 26.3% (136/518), significantly higher than the 12.5% (59/474) prevalence in BV-negative women (P < 0.0002).

- **Association of STIs with BV and VVC**:
	- Solo infections of MG or TV were each significantly associated with a diagnosis of BV-positive/VVC-negative (MG: OR 3.0751; 95% CI 1.5797–5.9858, P = 0.0113; TV: OR 2.873; 95% CI 1.5687–5.2619, P = 0.0017).
	- Mixed infections containing MG and TV were associated with higher odds (MG: OR 3.4886; 95% CI 1.8901–6.439, P = 0.0042; TV: OR 3.1858; 95% CI 1.809–5.6103, P = 0.0014).

- **Nugent score categories and infection rates**:
	- TV and MG infection rates were higher across all Nugent score (NS) categories compared to CT and NG infection rates. Both STIs had similar comparative prevalence ratios to CT in NS 6–10 vs NS 0–5 (CT: 3.06% vs 1.4%, 2.2-fold; MG: 10.7% vs 6.1%, 1.8-fold; TV: 14.5% vs 7.0%, 2.1-fold).
	- NG prevalence was relatively invariant across NS categories.

These results highlight the complexity of associations between STIs and the major causes of vaginitis.

### Trichomoniasis: The "neglected" sexually transmitted disease [^112rvjLv]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million people in the United States. Although trichomoniasis is common, it has been considered a "neglected" sexually transmitted disease due to limited knowledge of its sequelae and associated costs. This article reviews epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic methods, clinical management recommendations and special considerations, research on associated conditions and costs, prevention strategies, and controversies regarding trichomoniasis.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences, including an increased risk of acquiring other infections, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus-2, as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and an increased risk of cervical cancer. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, who are the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs).

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single-dose, point-of-care treatment strategy, which is novel to the U.S. but evidence-based and consistent with international guidelines. This approach addresses existing deficiencies in the availability of inexpensive and accurate point-of-care diagnosis and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow-up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

### The global epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic review [^1118aqNd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) enhances the acquisition and transmission of a range of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus. This has made it more important to uncover the reasons why some populations have very high BV prevalences and others do not. This systematic review describes the global epidemiology of BV, summarizing data from peer-reviewed publications that detail the population prevalence of BV as diagnosed by a standardized and reproducible methodology, the Nugent scoring system. BV variations between countries, and between ethnic groups within countries, are described.

We evaluated 1,692 English- and non-English-language articles describing the prevalence of BV using MEDLINE and the Web of Science databases. A total of 86 articles met our inclusion criteria. BV prevalences were found to vary considerably between ethnic groups in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Although BV prevalence is generally highest in parts of Africa and lowest in much of Asia and Europe, some populations in Africa have very low BV prevalences, and some in Asia and Europe have high rates.

### Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114yUGwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2019 to examine recent literature addressing updates in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STIs. This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic Trichomonas vaginalis infections [^1178xa4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of Black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals. This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection. Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

### Trichomonas vaginalis infection in male sexual partners: Implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113uUFua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis causes a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in women, yet trichomoniasis in male sexual partners is not well recognized. Nucleic acid amplification tests can increase detection of T. vaginalis in men compared with culture.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate T. vaginalis infection among male partners of women with trichomoniasis and factors associated with infection by recruiting patients from three public clinics in the United States. Male partners were tested for concordant T. vaginalis infection, defined as a positive urethral culture, urine culture, or urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. A subset of men also provided a semen sample for T. vaginalis culture and PCR. Factors associated with concordant infection were determined from bivariable and multivariable analyses.

- **Results**: We enrolled 540 women with trichomoniasis (diagnosed using wet mount microscopy and/or culture) and 261 (48.4%) of their male partners. T. vaginalis infection was detected in 177 (71.7%) of 256 male partners [95% confidence interval (CI), 66.0%-77.3%], of whom 136 (77.3%) were asymptomatic. A vaginal pH of > 4.5 in a woman was independently associated with infection in the male partner (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0–6.3). Younger male age (20–29 and 30–39 years) was also found to be an independent risk factor for concordant trichomoniasis.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of male partners of women with trichomoniasis were infected; however, few factors predicted infection. T. vaginalis causes a highly prevalent STI.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112SQVmb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Our findings demonstrate the limited accuracy of clinical diagnosis as an approach for managing vaginitis caused by bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, or T. vaginalis compared with the vaginal assay panel among women with symptoms of vaginitis seen in clinical settings. Consistent with the results here, Schwebke et al. previously demonstrated that the vaginal panel assay had better sensitivity (using a laboratory reference standard) than clinical diagnosis for all three causes of vaginitis. We observed that 65%, 44%, and 56% of individuals with vaginal assay-positive, clinical diagnosis-negative results for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis, respectively, went untreated. Conversely, those women who were negative for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis by assay testing were still overtreated according to clinical diagnosis 15%, 17%, and less than 1% of the time.

Previously, Hillier et al. demonstrated that almost half of the women with a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received at least one inappropriate treatment. Not surprisingly, return visits based on persistent vaginitis symptoms were common in that study, occurring in 35%, 17%, and 42% of cases associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T. vaginalis, respectively.

We found a significant difference in the paired proportions between the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the vaginal panel assay. Although Amsel's criteria represents the primary…

### Trichomonas vaginalis is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^1158oAgo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We assessed the association between the causative agents of vaginal discharge and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) among women attending a rural sexually transmitted disease clinic in South Africa; the role played by coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was studied. Vaginal and cervical specimens were obtained to detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis. HIV-1 infection was established by use of serum antibody tests.

A total of 696 women with vaginal discharge were recruited, 119 of whom had clinical PID. Patients with trichomoniasis had a significantly higher risk of PID than did women without trichomoniasis (P = .03). PID was not associated with any of the other pathogens. When the patients were stratified according to HIV-1 status, the risk of PID in HIV-1-infected patients with T. vaginalis increased significantly (P = .002); no association was found in patients without HIV-1. T. vaginalis infection of the lower genital tract is associated with a clinical diagnosis of PID in HIV-1-infected women.

### Going public and making it official: Should Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis be reportable sexually transmitted infections in the United States [^111DtJJT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveillance for five sexually transmitted infections (STIs), yet Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium remain unmonitored despite their impact on women's health. Trichomonas vaginalis, the most common non-viral STI in the United States, disproportionately affects marginalized populations and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased susceptibility to HIV. Mycoplasma genitalium, an emerging STI, is linked to cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and antibiotic resistance, yet its prevalence is estimated rather than systematically tracked.

CDC guidelines outline seven criteria for determining a reportable disease: frequency, severity, disparities, cost, preventability, communicability, and public interest. However, it has been argued that only three of these criteria have been fulfilled for TV and Mgen, preventing their designation as reportable STIs. Limited public health funding and the lack of a national surveillance program result in an underestimation of the national STI burden, thus limiting efforts to mitigate the associated STI-related morbidity.

### Association between male circumcision and women's biomedical health outcomes: a systematic review [^1154bcQK]. The Lancet Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, high-risk HPV, trichomonas, non-specific genital ulcers, and vaginal discharge were the other low-consistency outcomes. Two patterns underlie this heterogeneity. For gonorrhoea and non-specific genital ulcers, the one data point showing a harmful association was from the same study, which had a participant pool of members of high-risk populations recruited from sexually transmitted infection clinics. The data points showing harmful associations with trichomonas are from this study and another study with patients from sexually transmitted infection clinics. For bacterial vaginosis, of the two data points showing a (non-significant) harmful association, the observational point was one of the same two high-risk studies, and the RCT enrolled female partners of HIV-positive men. Without this RCT, evidence on bacterial vaginosis would be high consistency for a protective association. For high-risk HPV, the single study showing a (non-significant) harmful association was also an RCT enrolling partners of HIV-positive men. For vaginal discharge, the same was true for the data point showing a harmful association (prevalence ratio 1.13, no CI), whereas the other two points had prevalence ratio estimates of 0.99 and 1.01. We conclude that the protective effects of male circumcision for women against many sexually transmitted infections are not evident when male partners are HIV infected. In the case of women at high risk of sexually transmitted infections, the mechanisms that underlie protection in the general population would be expected to operate in the same context.

### Findings associated with recurrence of bacterial vaginosis among adolescents attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics [^112X8hBK]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common infection and has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and acquisition of HIV. There are limited data on recurrent BV in adolescents. A relationship between the frequency of BV recurrence and specific risk factors might shed light on the pathophysiology of BV and lead to targeted interventions.

The study was a record-based historical clinic study set in adolescent visits to two sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics between 1990 and 2002. Participants included 254 girls who had two or more episodes of BV and at least three clinical visits. These participants were matched on clinic attendance frequency to 254 girls with only one documented BV episode and 254 girls with no history of BV. The main outcome measure was risk factor differences between groups.

The analysis involved multinomial logistic regression with a robust estimator of the standard errors, accounting for repeated measures. Among 5,977 adolescent girls who visited the clinics, 1509 (25%) had at least one episode of BV; of those, 303 (19.9%) had two or more BV episodes. Girls with a history of one BV episode and girls with a history of two or more episodes were more likely to be infected with Trichomonas vaginalis [OR 1.77, 95% CI: 1.17–2.67; OR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.05–2.34], and to be diagnosed with PID [OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.02–2.22; OR 2.05, 95% CI: 1.41–2.98] compared to girls with no BV history, respectively. Additionally, girls with a history of BV were more likely to report active oral sex and a lack of contraceptive use.

In conclusion, adolescent girls who attend STD clinics are at increased risk for recurrent BV, especially those engaging in certain behaviors such as active oral sex and not using contraceptives.

### When is it a sexually transmitted infection? Intimate contact transmission of pathogens not traditionally defined as STIs [^111s7QoH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Several microorganisms, which are not traditionally considered sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are capable of sexual transmission and have the potential to cause global outbreaks. The aim of this review is to describe pathogens not traditionally defined as STIs, provide insight into potential outbreaks, and call for clinical vigilance among members of key populations.

Recent findings emphasize that several pathogens, not traditionally classified as STIs, can be sexually transmissible. These include the mpox virus, enteric infections such as Shigella spp., dermatophytes like Trichophyton mentagrophytes, ectoparasites, and atypical bacterial genito-urinary infections such as Neisseria meningitidis. The internationally reported outbreaks and the reports on potential sexual transmission of these pathogens underline the emerging risks, the need for a broader STI definition, and the importance of vigilant public health control strategies.

These findings suggest that clinical practice should broaden STI testing and awareness to include pathogens not traditionally considered sexually transmissible, particularly among key populations. Clinicians must be vigilant for atypical presentations, ensuring comprehensive sexual healthcare and diagnostic testing. The development of targeted preventive efforts and continuous surveillance to detect and manage emerging sexually transmissible infections is paramount.

### Correlation of leukorrhea and Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^1158WvBp]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) causing vaginitis. Although microscopy has poor sensitivity, it is used for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to provide a more reliable diagnosis of trichomoniasis by investigating its association with leukorrhea. Women presenting for evaluation of vaginal discharge, STI exposure, or preventative gynecologic examination were assessed for Trichomonas infection.

Vaginal pH was determined, and microscopy was performed by the provider, who recorded the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per epithelial cell, as well as the presence of clue cells, yeast, and/or motile trichomonads. Leukorrhea was defined as possessing more than one PMNL per epithelial cell. Culture and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were employed to detect T. vaginalis. Additionally, patients were evaluated for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using NAATs and for bacterial vaginosis using Gram stains.

Two hundred ninety-four women were enrolled, and 16% were found to have Trichomonas (46/294). Trichomonas infection was more frequent in parous non-Hispanic, black women, who reported lower contraceptive use rates (33% versus 17%; P = 0.02) and a history of STIs (85% versus 55%; P = 0.002). These women were more likely to report vaginal discharge (76% versus 59%; P = 0.02), have an elevated vaginal pH (87% versus 48%; P < 0.001), and be infected with gonorrhea (15% versus 4%; P = 0.002). Leukorrhea was associated with a fourfold increased risk of Trichomonas infection. Leukorrhea observed through microscopy was significantly associated with Trichomonas vaginitis.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^113kdF5a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Several factors were assessed in relation to the occurrence of patient-reported recurrent vaginitis or vaginosis in the past 12 months. These factors included patient demographic status, STI infection status, age range, consensus Nugent score (cNS), modified Amsel criteria status, and presence of vaginal symptoms. Only White Hispanic/Latina women showed a modest but significant elevated risk of vaginitis recurrence during this time period, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0619–1.3188, P = 0.0023.

Fig. 2 illustrates the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by consensus Nugent score in women with symptoms of vaginitis or vaginosis. The prevalence of each STI was categorized by consensus Nugent score. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) prevalence was relatively invariant with respect to cNS category, while the mean Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) prevalence in cNS categories 6–10 (3.06%) was approximately twice (2.2-fold) that of the mean CT prevalence in cNS categories 0–5 (1.4%). Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) infection prevalence values were higher in all cNS categories compared to CT and NG infection prevalence. However, both STIs had similar comparative prevalence ratios to CT in cNS categories 6–10 versus 0–5 (MG: 10.7% vs. 6.1%, 1.8-fold; TV: 14.5% vs. 7.0%, 2.1-fold).

### Is the presence of Trichomonas vaginalis a reliable predictor of coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae in female ED patients [^113yFsaN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine if the presence of *Trichomonas vaginalis* (TV) is associated with an increased risk of coinfection with *Chlamydia trachomatis* (CT) and/or *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (NG) in female patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms consistent with a sexually transmitted disease (STD).

This was a retrospective observational study of female patients tested for the presence of TV by wet mount preparation in the ED from January 1998 through January 2001. Only patients that had the complete results of the wet preparation for TV, DNA probe for CT, and culture for NG were included.

A total of 690 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 420 (61%) patients tested positive for TV by wet mount preparation, and 270 (39%) tested negative. Among the 420 TV-positive patients, 41 (9.8%) tested positive for NG, 35 (8.3%) tested positive for CT, and 16 (3.8%) for both. For the 270 TV-negative patients, 16 (5.9%) tested positive for NG, 91 (33.7%) tested positive for CT, and 16 (5.9%) for both. By chi-squared testing, there was a strong negative association between the presence of TV and coinfection with CT and/or NG. The presence of TV made it 2.9 times less likely to have coinfection with NG and/or CT.

In conclusion, the presence of TV in female patients presenting to the ED with symptoms consistent with an STD is not associated with an increased risk of coinfection with NG and/or CT.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts.

This article describes advances in TV diagnostics which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biological and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of reTV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115BEA6z]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally, yet an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within six months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, which has been attributed to the possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners.

There is a robust body of evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity. While the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed to women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure, and the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection is justified.

In this manuscript, we present the molecular and epidemiological evidence that underlies the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted and summarize why research that continues to consider sexual partnerships is necessary. We also outline the significant barriers and challenges identified while undertaking partner treatment studies and discuss the factors impacting our ability to determine their effectiveness.

### Interrelationships among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and the presence of yeasts [^1158XGXj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Vaginal discharge of mixed etiology occurs frequently, with abnormal vaginal flora being the most common condition. The interrelationships among the disturbance of the vaginal ecology, the presence of yeasts, and infection with *Trichomonas vaginalis* and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were investigated among women presenting to a sexually transmitted diseases service. Analysis was conducted on 598 women.

Although the prevalence of HIV-1 infection increased linearly with increasing Nugent's score (bacterial vaginosis score of Gram stain), the prevalence of *T. vaginalis* increased suddenly, from 12% in patients with a Nugent's score of ≤ 3 to 33% in patients with a score of 4, and remained at this level at higher scores. Yeast colonization and vulvovaginal candidiasis were inversely related to Nugent's scores. *T. vaginalis* might be responsible for the change in normal vaginal flora and may, therefore, be one of the causes of bacterial vaginosis, which could lead to more effective HIV-1 acquisition.

### Reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis [^1151hDg8]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. We found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and in vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases. Unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid.

In organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with *Lactobacillus jensenii*, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mRNA. However, a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, *Gardnerella vaginalis*, had no effect. When the two bacteria were combined, *Gardnerella vaginalis* did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of *Lactobacillus jensenii*.

The loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^111jNsUw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

There have been significant increases in rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) in the United States. This study examines the intersection of STIs and vaginitis in a U.S. cohort. Among 1,051 women diagnosed for the presence or absence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), 195 (18.5%) had one or more STIs. This includes 101 (9.6%) with TV, 24 (2.3%) with CT, 9 (0.8%) with NG, and 93 (8.8%) with MG.

STI prevalence in BV-positive women was 26.3% (136/518), significantly higher than the prevalence of 12.5% (59/474) in BV-negative women (P < 0.0002). Solo infections of MG or TV were each significantly associated with a diagnosis of BV-positive/VVC-negative (OR 3.0751; 95% CI 1.5797–5.9858, P = 0.0113, and OR 2.873; 95% CI 1.5687–5.2619, P = 0.0017, respectively) and with mixed infections containing MG and TV (OR 3.4886; 95% CI 1.8901–6.439, P = 0.0042, and OR 3.1858; 95% CI 1.809–5.6103, P = 0.0014, respectively).

TV and MG infection rates were higher across all Nugent score (NS) categories than CT and NG infection rates. However, both STIs had similar comparative prevalence ratios to CT in NS categories 6–10 versus 0–5 (CT: 3.06% vs. 1.4%, 2.2-fold; MG: 10.7% vs. 6.1%, 1.8-fold; TV: 14.5% vs. 7.0%, 2.1-fold). In contrast, NG prevalence was relatively invariant across NS categories. These findings highlight the complexity of associations between STIs and the two major causes of vaginitis.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^1148douX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Diagnosis has historically relied on either microscopic analysis or culture, the latter being the previous gold standard. However, these tests are not readily available for male diagnosis, generally only perform well for symptomatic women, and are not as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).

Men are largely asymptomatic but carry the organism and transmit it to their sexual partners. This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the performance of the cobas T. vaginalis/Mycoplasma genitalium (TV/MG) assay for detection of T. vaginalis DNA compared with patient infection status (PIS) defined by a combination of commercially available NAATs and culture using urogenital specimens.

A total of 2,064 subjects (984 men and 1,080 women, 940 [45.5%] symptomatic, 1,124 [54.5%] asymptomatic) were evaluable. In women, sensitivity ranged from 99.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.8 to 99.9%) using vaginal samples to 94.7% (95% CI 90.2 to 97.2%) in PreservCyt samples. Specificity ranged from 98.9 to 96.8% (95% CI 95.4 to 97.8%).

In men, the cobas TV/MG assay was 100% sensitive for the detection of T. vaginalis in both male urine samples and meatal swabs, with specificity of 98.4% in urine samples and 92.5% in meatal swabs. The cobas TV/MG is a suitable diagnostic test for the detection of T. vaginalis, which could support public health efforts toward infection control and complement existing STI programs.

### The interplay of host immunity, environment and the risk of bacterial vaginosis and associated reproductive health outcomes [^1134oJFr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most common causes of vaginal symptoms in US women; however, its causal mechanism has not yet been defined. BV is more prevalent in women who are immunosuppressed, and several risk factors for the development of BV are associated with lower quantities of immune mediators in vaginal fluid. In contrast, the poor reproductive health outcomes associated with BV, such as preterm birth and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 acquisition, are linked to increased levels of proinflammatory immune mediators in the genital tract. In this article, we discuss how variations in the host immune profile and environmental effects on host immunity may influence the risk of BV, as well as the risk of complications associated with BV.

### Trichomonas vaginalis origins, molecular pathobiology and clinical considerations [^111MHk9s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To integrate a selection of the most recent data on *Trichomonas vaginalis* origins, molecular cell biology, and *T. vaginalis* interactions with the urogenital tract microbiota with trichomoniasis symptoms and clinical management:

- **Recent findings**:
	- Transcriptomics and proteomics datasets are accumulating, facilitating the identification and prioritization of key target genes to study *T. vaginalis* pathobiology. Proteins involved in host sensing and cytoskeletal plasticity during *T. vaginalis* amoeboid transformation have been identified. The organism was shown to secrete exosomes and a macrophage migration inhibitory factor-like protein that both influence host-parasite interactions.

	- Co-infections of *T. vaginalis* with *Mycoplasma* species and viruses modulate inflammatory responses, whereas interactions with various *Lactobacillus* species inhibit parasite interactions with human cells. Furthermore, *T. vaginalis* infections have been associated with bacterial vaginosis. A broader range of health sequelae is becoming apparent. Diagnostics for both women and men based on molecular approaches are being refined, particularly for men.

- **Summary**:
	- New developments in the molecular and cellular basis of *T. vaginalis* pathobiology, combined with data on the urogenital tract microbiota and immunology, have enriched our understanding of human-microbe interactions. This enhanced knowledge will contribute to increasing our capacity to prevent and treat *T. vaginalis* and other sexually transmitted infections.

### Trichomonas vaginalis detection in urogenital specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic men and women by use of the cobas TV/MG test [^1159hSob]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is considered one of the most common curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating 156 million cases in 2016, a higher prevalence than syphilis. It is currently not a reportable disease, and the true prevalence is not currently known. Some contributing factors include a lack of routine testing, nonspecific symptomatology, and infected men being predominantly asymptomatic.

A large proportion of Trichomonas vaginalis infections are asymptomatic; however, symptoms can include urethral discharge, primarily in males, and abnormal vaginal discharge, dysuria, itching, irritation, and abdominal pain in females. The consequences of untreated infection may include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Trichomonas vaginalis infection has also been shown to increase the risk of HIV by 50% via several mechanisms, including damage to the vaginal epithelial membrane by the protozoa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that women presenting with symptoms are tested for Trichomonas vaginalis, but they do not recommend generalized screening of asymptomatic women. However, screening is recommended for women living in areas with higher-than-average prevalence, those who report behaviors that may result in exposure to STIs, or those who are HIV positive. Coinfection of Trichomonas vaginalis with other STIs has been previously reported, and symptoms can overlap between infections. Therefore, Trichomonas vaginalis infections may be missed and left untreated if other infections are presumed to be the cause.

### Effects of bacterial vaginosis and other genital infections on the natural history of human papillomavirus infection in HIV-1-infected and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected women [^117SGcz3]. The Journal of infectious diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Whether the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is affected by bacterial vaginosis (BV) or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection has not been adequately investigated in prospective studies.

- **Methods**: Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected (n = 1763) and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected (n = 493) women were assessed semiannually for BV (by Nugent's criteria), TV infection (by wet mount), type-specific HPV (by polymerase chain reaction with MY09/MY11/HMB01 HPV primers), and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) (by cytological examination). Sexual history was obtained from patient reports at each visit. Risk factors for prevalent and incident HPV infection and SIL were evaluated using multivariate models.

- **Results**: BV was associated with both prevalent and incident HPV infection but not with the duration of HPV infection or incidence of SIL. TV infection was associated with incident HPV infection and with decreased duration and lower prevalence of HPV infection. TV infection had no association with the development of SIL. Effects of BV and TV infection were similar in HIV-1-infected and high-risk HIV-1-uninfected women. HIV-1 infection and low CD4(+) lymphocyte count were strongly associated with HPV infection and development of SIL.

- **Conclusions**: BV and TV infection may increase the risk of acquisition (or reactivation) of HPV infection, consistent with hypotheses that the local cervicovaginal milieu plays a role in susceptibility to HPV infection. The finding that BV did not affect the persistence of HPV infection and that TV infection may shorten HPV infection duration supports these hypotheses.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116G6uaa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

As women are seen in different clinical settings for symptoms indicative of vaginitis, it is important for treating clinicians to be aware that women with symptoms of vaginitis could be at an increased risk for an STI. The increased risk of some STIs in women who are positive for BV or Candida spp provides a strong impetus for comprehensive testing for STI. Integration of molecular testing for vaginitis and STI would establish consistent, objective, and sensitive testing methods, regardless of clinic type, to accurately identify and treat patients for these conditions.

### Molecular diagnosis of vaginitis: Comparing quantitative PCR and microbiome profiling approaches to current microscopy scoring [^112PDTTu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is often diagnosed by microscopy and is limited to testing for bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Approximately 10% of vaginal swabs are negative but are designated as "altered flora" by the BV Nugent score, leaving clinicians unsure how to treat patients. Accurate and comprehensive vaginitis diagnostics are needed to direct treatment and reduce the risk of more severe infections.

Vaginal swabs were collected from 93 women (mean age, 23.53 years; range 18 to 42 years) in a cross-sectional study. Microscopy results for BV and Candida were compared to those from two molecular approaches:

- **Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay**: This includes testing for aerobic vaginitis (AV), Candida, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and BV (Applied Biosystems) with an accompanying BV interpretive algorithm (Coriell Life Sciences).
- **Microbiome profiling**: The 16S rRNA gene (Illumina) was used for this purpose.

Microscopy plus the BV Nugent score had a 76% overall agreement with the qPCR plus BV interpretive algorithm method (24 positive, 47 negative). Of the nine samples designated as altered flora by Nugent, five were categorized as BV positive and four as BV negative by the qPCR method. Although BV negative, 3 out of 4 of the latter samples had positive AV targets, with one also testing positive for STI. Microscopic identification of Candida versus that by qPCR had 94% agreement (9 positive, 78 negative). The comprehensive qPCR assay revealed alternative etiologies summarized as 38% BV, 10% AV, 5% Candida, 2% STI, and 10% mixed infection (positive targets in multiple panels).

### WHO global research priorities for sexually transmitted infections [^112GTedp]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have a profound effect on sexual and reproductive health worldwide. More than one million STIs are acquired every day. In 2020, an estimated 374 million new infections occurred with one of four bacterial or parasitic STIs that can be cured with available antimicrobials: Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea), and Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis). Additionally, viral STIs that can be long-lasting (e.g. human papillomavirus [HPV]) or lifelong (e.g. herpes simplex virus) affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide at any point in time. The burden of STIs is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition to genital symptoms, STIs can lead to multiple adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including cervical cancer, infertility, increased vulnerability to HIV, pregnancy complications, and congenital infections. Moreover, the psychological, social, and economic consequences of STIs can substantially affect the quality of life.

Despite the need, the public health response to STIs has been poor in many parts of the world. As the WHO global strategy on STIs for 2016–21 came to a close, WHO issued a global progress report on the strategy, noting that STI control had shown little improvement. Long-standing challenges, such as the absence of available STI diagnostic tests in resource-limited settings, combined with newer threats, such as global shortages of benzathine penicillin for the treatment of syphilis, are increasing gonococcal antimicrobial resistance.

Regarding medical management for Trichomonas vaginalis infection, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy, the WHO 2024 guidelines suggest considering the following options if adherence to multiple doses is a serious concern:

- **Metronidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose.

- **Tinidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose (except during pregnancy).

- **Secnidazole 2 g PO**: Administer as a single dose (except during pregnancy).

- **Ornidazole 1.5 g PO**: Administer as a single dose (except during pregnancy) if metronidazole or tinidazole is not available.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116M6RWB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are a leading cause of primary care visits for women. Individuals exhibiting symptoms often receive laboratory testing based on clinic-specific standards of care. Thus, women seen at a family practice clinic might only receive a vaginitis workup, whereas those seen at a sexually transmitted diseases clinic could be more likely to receive only sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.

- **Methods**: The likelihood of STIs was assessed in women from whom samples were tested for vaginitis using a molecular diagnostic assay. Positivity rates for *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, and *Trichomonas vaginalis* DNA, detected using the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay, were calculated. Concordance between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay for detection of *T. vaginalis* was determined.

- **Results**: Women with bacterial vaginosis alone or with *Candida spp* infections had high rates of coinfection with sexually transmitted infections (24.4%–25.7%); samples from women who were negative for vaginitis had significantly lower positivity rates (7.9%; P < .001). Trichomonas vaginalis results were concordant between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay in 559 of 560 samples tested.

- **Conclusions**: These data suggest, as have other studies, that women with vaginitis symptoms may be at risk for an STI. Molecular testing could provide broad diagnostic coverage for symptomatic women and improve patient management, regardless of the type of clinic in which patients are treated.

### Management of women with cervicitis [^1168x6dP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

In the past several years, the collective understanding of cervicitis has extended beyond the recognition of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae as the prime etiologic suspects. Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus cause cervicitis, and both Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis have emerged as new candidate etiologic agents or conditions. However, major gaps in our knowledge of this common condition remain. Putative etiologic agents have not been identified in many women with cervicitis. Moreover, cervicitis occurs in a relatively small proportion of women with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Finally, scant research has addressed the clinical response of nonchlamydial and nongonococcal cervicitis to antibiotic therapy, and there are no data on the benefit of sex partner treatment for such women. New research into the etiology, immunology, and natural history of this common condition is needed, especially in view of the well-established links between cervicitis and an increased risk of upper genital tract infection and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 acquisition.

### The influence of ART on the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis among HIV-infected women [^114DvLTn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Among women who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+), both prevalent and persistent infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common. TV has been shown to increase vaginal shedding of HIV, which may influence HIV sexual and perinatal transmission, making prevention important. In one cohort of HIV+ women in Kenya, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, mostly nevirapine-based, was associated with lower cure rates of TV for single-dose therapy. Our goal was to repeat this study in a US-based cohort of HIV+/TV+ women and compare outcomes to those with multidose therapy.

- **Methods**: A secondary data analysis was performed on a multicentered cohort of HIV+/TV+ women who were randomized to single-dose (2 grams) or 7-day (500 mg twice daily) multidose metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. Test of cure visit, via culture, occurred 6–12 days after treatment completion. Information was collected on sex partner treatment and sexual exposures. Persistent TV infection rates were compared for women on ART at baseline vs. not on ART.

- **Results**: Of the 226 women included, those on ART had more treatment failures than women not on ART (24/146 [16.4%] vs. 5/80 [6.3%]; p = 0.03). When stratified by treatment arm, more treatment failures were seen in the single-dose arm (17/73 [23.3%] vs. 3/39 [7.7%]; p = 0.05) than in the multidose arm (7/73 [9.6%] vs. 2/41 [4.8%]; p = 0.39).

- **Conclusions**: ART usage was associated with a higher TV persistent infection rate among those receiving the single-dose treatment, but not the multidose, providing more evidence that multidose should be the preferred strategy.

### Trichomoniasis: Under control or undercontrolled [^11746SG2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Aside from human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, yet it has long been regarded as a sexually transmitted infection of minor importance. Medical opinion has traditionally held that it plays little role in health complications in women, and it is rarely seen in men. However, evidence has recently accumulated implicating *Trichomonas vaginalis* as a contributor to a variety of adverse outcomes among both sexes. Among both women and men, the association of *T. vaginalis* with human immunodeficiency acquisition and transmission has been shown in multiple studies.

Among women, trichomoniasis may play a role in the development of cervical neoplasia, postoperative infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and as a factor in atypical pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Among men, trichomoniasis has emerged as a cause of nongonococcal urethritis and as contributing to male factor infertility. As evidence continues to accumulate, the time has come to increase diagnostic efforts beyond traditional sexually transmitted disease clinic settings.

### Identifying a consensus sample type to test for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus [^117HQSQo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global cause of acute illness. Early detection plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission and preventing complications. However, the accessibility of STI testing is limited by the lack of a universally preferred sample type. In a prospective study involving female sex workers (FSW), we compared the sensitivity of samples from different anatomical sites in detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, we documented the prevalence of each STI in this high-risk population.

- **Methods**: We selected 303 FSW and tested them for each STI by nucleic acid amplification testing on two vaginal and cervical swabs from different manufacturers, cervical smear, and first-void urine. The sensitivity of each sample type was compared for each infectious agent to identify a consensus sample type.

- **Results**: Vaginal swabs were superior to all other sample types, with an overall sensitivity of 86%. The sensitivity was lowest for first-void urine, detecting only 63% of positive cases. The prevalence was 3.3% (10/299) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 9.0% (27/299) for Chlamydia trachomatis; 7.4% (22/298) for Trichomonas vaginalis; 10.8% (32/296) for Mycoplasma genitalium; and 55.6% (158/284) for human papillomavirus.

- **Conclusions**: When testing for STIs, vaginal swabs are the sample of choice, and first-void urine should be avoided. Designating (self-sampled) vaginal swabs as a consensus sample type enables harmonization of STI testing.

### Clinical and laboratory testing for Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^111ZyVe6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is highly prevalent in the United States and worldwide. Traditional clinical diagnostic methods fail to identify more than half of these infections, which, if left untreated, can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and an increased risk of both the acquisition and transmission of HIV. Women bear a disproportionate burden of these infections, and testing among populations at risk for this disease should be provided. Molecular technologies have expanded our capacity for laboratory-based detection of infection and can be used on samples already being collected for chlamydia/gonorrhea screening.

### Diagnosis and management of Trichomonas vaginalis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^111VNU6f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis likely represents the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, impacting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are evident in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, with African Americans being more than four times as likely to be infected compared to individuals of other races. Since the publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have highlighted the significance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women. These include an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The clinical significance of infection in men is less understood.

Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in both women and men, including urine. This allows for more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at three months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected individuals suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg, administered twice daily for seven days, reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at the one-month test of cure.

### Vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and risk for incident bacterial vaginosis in a population of women who have sex with men [^1172dPuf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other sequelae. It is characterized by a shift in the vaginal bacterial biota from one composed largely of Lactobacillus species to a microbiota with diverse anaerobic and facultative bacteria, here designated BV-associated bacteria (BVAB).

The acquisition source of BVAB in the vagina remains unclear. There is ongoing debate as to whether BV is a sexually transmitted infection, involves the acquisition of BVAB from sexual partners, reflects vaginal inoculation from endogenous reservoirs in women, or occurs through some other process. A previous study in a cohort of women who have sex with women (WSW) demonstrated that colonization of extra-vaginal reservoirs with certain BVAB was associated with an increased risk for incident BV. However, different sexual practices and exposures in women who have sex with men (WSM) could lead to different patterns of vaginal and extra-vaginal bacterial colonization that impact BV risk.

We sought to examine the link between vaginal or extra-vaginal bacterial colonization and the risk of incident BV in a second cohort focusing on WSM to assess the generalizability of these findings. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to detect bacterial colonization in the mouth, anus, vagina, and external genitalia (labia) of women who did not have BV at the time of initial sampling. Women were observed prospectively to assess the subsequent incidence of BV.
