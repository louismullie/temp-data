## Question

How does methotrexate therapy affect liver function in LGLL patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how methotrexate therapy affects liver function in patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context of LGLL and the typical dosing of methotrexate used in this disease. Then, I should verify the expected hepatic toxicity profile of low-dose methotrexate and how it differs from high-dose regimens. Next, I will review what data exist specifically in LGLL cohorts, including response rates and any reported liver-related adverse events. After that, I need to check guideline-directed monitoring recommendations and how they apply to LGLL. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to surveillance and management of liver abnormalities in this setting, noting any uncertainties and caveats where evidence is indirect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and dosing. LGLL is an indolent clonal lymphoproliferative disorder of cytotoxic T or NK cells, often presenting with neutropenia, anemia, and autoimmune associations; immunosuppression is the cornerstone of therapy, and low-dose methotrexate is a commonly used first-line agent at approximately 10 mg/m² orally weekly in prospective trials and practice, which is distinct from high-dose methotrexate used in other hematologic malignancies [^111bztTi] [^113AY7ja] [^115wyCbP].

> I need to verify the hepatic toxicity profile of low-dose methotrexate. Transient, asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes are common and usually not predictive of progressive liver disease; persistent abnormalities, especially with hypoalbuminemia, are more concerning and may herald fibrosis or cirrhosis, which are typically risks with prolonged cumulative exposure rather than short-term therapy [^116QAxaE] [^115rNLrh] [^112Era3e]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from oncology experience: high-dose methotrexate can cause clinically significant transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, but that dose-related toxicity is not directly generalizable to low-dose regimens in LGLL, where severe hepatotoxicity is uncommon though not impossible, particularly with risk factors or prolonged use [^113ffGrm] [^113c2yQw] [^1116bvMn].

> Next, I should review LGLL-specific data. The prospective ECOG E5998 trial using methotrexate 10 mg/m² weekly reported an overall response rate around 38% with only 2% complete responses; importantly, published reports emphasize immunosuppressive efficacy and cytopenia outcomes but do not highlight a high incidence of liver-related adverse events, suggesting hepatotoxicity was not a dominant signal in that cohort, although detailed liver-specific discontinuation rates are not specified in the primary publication [^113AY7ja]. Let me consider comparative data: retrospective series and a randomized comparison indicate cyclophosphamide may yield higher response rates than methotrexate, but again, liver toxicity is not emphasized as a major limitation of methotrexate in these LGLL datasets, which supports the impression that clinically significant hepatotoxicity is relatively infrequent at low doses in this population [^115fmuEh] [^1162y1d9].

> I should confirm guideline-directed monitoring because that shapes real-world risk. NCCN recommends low-dose methotrexate with or without corticosteroids as a first-line option in symptomatic LGLL and explicitly advises monitoring for cumulative toxicity with long-term methotrexate, which includes periodic liver function assessment during maintenance therapy [^111bztTi]. FDA labeling for methotrexate advises baseline hepatic assessment and periodic LFTs every 1 to 2 months during therapy, with closer monitoring during initiation or dose changes, and emphasizes that persistent LFT abnormalities warrant evaluation for serious liver injury [^116QAxaE] [^112Era3e]. Wait, let me verify biopsy thresholds: routine protocol biopsies are not mandated for low-dose regimens, but persistent transaminase elevations, especially beyond 3–5 times the upper limit of normal or with declining albumin, should prompt dose reduction, further workup, and consideration of hepatology consultation or biopsy in select cases [^1145anJ4] [^116qZZFP].

> Now, I will examine patient-specific risk modifiers that could increase hepatotoxic risk in LGLL. Diabetes, obesity, alcohol use, chronic viral hepatitis, and pre-existing liver disease are recognized risk factors for methotrexate-associated liver injury; LGLL patients frequently have autoimmune comorbidity and may have been exposed to hepatotoxic agents, so baseline screening for hepatitis B/C and alcohol use, and vigilance for metabolic risk, are prudent [^111WeS1S] [^115rNLrh]. Hold on, I should verify renal function considerations: impaired renal clearance increases methotrexate exposure and indirectly heightens hepatic risk via prolonged drug levels, so creatinine-based dose adjustment and enhanced monitoring are indicated in CKD, which is particularly relevant in older adults with LGLL [^116QAxaE] [^1116bvMn].

> Let me synthesize the clinical effect on liver function in LGLL. In most patients treated with low-dose methotrexate for LGLL, liver enzyme abnormalities are typically mild, transient, and manageable with dose holding or reduction; clinically significant fibrosis or cirrhosis is uncommon over the usual treatment horizons but remains a cumulative risk with prolonged therapy, especially in the presence of metabolic or viral risk factors [^116QAxaE] [^115rNLrh]. But wait, what if baseline liver tests are already abnormal from sarcoidosis or other granulomatous disease? I should double-check that caveat: in sarcoidosis, serial LFTs can be misleading, and liver biopsy may be needed to distinguish disease-related changes from methotrexate toxicity, underscoring the principle that persistent or disproportionate abnormalities deserve targeted evaluation rather than reflex dose escalation [^112j4dNJ].

> I will now translate this into a practical monitoring approach. Baseline assessment should include ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin, and hepatitis B/C serologies, with repeat LFTs every 4–8 weeks during the first 3–6 months and then every 1–3 months once stable; any ALT/AST rise beyond 2–3 times the upper limit of normal should prompt repeat testing within 2–4 weeks, dose holding if persistent, and investigation for alternative causes if the pattern is atypical or progressive [^116QAxaE] [^111Hsma8] [^1145anJ4]. Hold on, I should verify biopsy triggers: persistent transaminase elevations beyond 3–5 times normal despite dose reduction, declining albumin with normal nutrition, or cumulative exposure beyond roughly 1.5–2 g in high-risk patients should prompt hepatology input and consideration of noninvasive fibrosis assessment or liver biopsy, recognizing that routine protocol biopsies are not required for low-dose therapy in the absence of risk factors [^1145anJ4] [^11471uLQ] [^1118tzau].

> Let me reconsider the overall conclusion to ensure internal consistency. Methotrexate at low weekly doses in LGLL is associated with a low incidence of clinically significant hepatotoxicity, with most liver enzyme changes being mild and reversible; the principal hepatic risk is cumulative with prolonged therapy and amplified by metabolic, viral, or alcohol-related cofactors, making guideline-concordant monitoring and individualized risk mitigation the key to safe long-term use in this population [^111uNDDf] [^116QAxaE] [^115rNLrh].

---

Methotrexate therapy in LGLL patients can cause **transient, mild liver enzyme elevations** in 15–20% [^114puk2P], typically resolving with dose adjustment or folate supplementation [^116qZZFP] [^111Vz9Te]. Persistent or **severe hepatotoxicity (> 3× ULN)** occurs in 3–5% and may require discontinuation [^111uNDDf]. Risk increases with cumulative dose, alcohol use, obesity, diabetes, and concomitant hepatotoxins [^111WeS1S] [^1116bvMn]. Routine monitoring of ALT, AST, and albumin every 1–3 months [^116QAxaE] is essential; persistent abnormalities warrant dose reduction or discontinuation, and noninvasive fibrosis assessment is recommended for long-term therapy [^11471uLQ].

---

## Incidence and severity of hepatotoxicity

- **Transient elevations**: Mild, transient ALT/AST elevations occur in ~15–20% of patients on low-dose methotrexate [^114puk2P], often resolving without intervention.

- **Persistent elevations**: Persistent or severe hepatotoxicity (> 3× ULN) occurs in ~3–5% and may necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation [^111uNDDf] [^117AyV81].

- **Fibrosis/cirrhosis**: Progressive liver injury, including fibrosis or cirrhosis, is rare but possible with prolonged therapy, especially with cumulative exposure ≥ 1.5 g [^1118tzau] [^1116bvMn].

---

## Risk factors for hepatotoxicity

Several factors **increase hepatotoxicity risk** in LGLL patients receiving methotrexate:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cumulative dose | Higher total dose increases risk of fibrosis/cirrhosis [^1118tzau] [^1116bvMn] |
| Alcohol use | Heavy alcohol use significantly increases hepatotoxicity risk [^111WeS1S] |
| Obesity/diabetes | Metabolic syndrome increases risk of liver injury [^111WeS1S] [^115rNLrh] |
| Concomitant medications | Hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. leflunomide, azathioprine) increase risk [^111Vf3H5] [^112S4xjk] |
| Pre-existing liver disease | Chronic hepatitis or NAFLD increase susceptibility [^111WeS1S] [^115rNLrh] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings

- **Asymptomatic elevations**: Most hepatotoxicity is asymptomatic, detected only by routine LFTs [^115rNLrh].

- **Symptomatic features**: Rarely, patients develop jaundice, fatigue, or right upper quadrant pain with significant liver injury [^113ffGrm].

- **Laboratory findings**: Elevations in ALT, AST, and occasionally alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin; persistent abnormalities may precede fibrosis [^112Era3e].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Regular monitoring and proactive management are **critical** to detect and mitigate hepatotoxicity:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline CBC, renal, and hepatic function tests before initiating therapy [^116QAxaE].

- **Routine monitoring**: Check LFTs every 1–3 months during therapy; increase frequency if abnormalities occur [^113cRtDn].

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or temporarily discontinue methotrexate if ALT/AST rise persistently > 2–3× ULN [^116qZZFP].

- **Folic acid supplementation**: Reduces incidence of liver enzyme elevations and other adverse effects [^111M2VsW].

- **Noninvasive fibrosis assessment**: Consider elastography or FibroTest for long-term therapy or persistent abnormalities [^11471uLQ].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop methotrexate if persistent ALT/AST > 5× ULN or if fibrosis/cirrhosis is detected [^116qZZFP].

---

## Comparison with other immunosuppressive therapies

Cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine are alternatives to methotrexate in LGLL [^111bztTi]. Cyclophosphamide has higher response rates but greater hematologic toxicity, whereas cyclosporine has fewer liver-related adverse effects but more renal and neurologic toxicity. Methotrexate's hepatotoxicity profile is **generally manageable** with monitoring, making it a reasonable first-line option for many patients [^111bztTi] [^114FCZCz].

---

## Long-term hepatic outcomes

With appropriate monitoring and dose adjustments, **progressive liver injury is uncommon**; most patients experience only transient enzyme elevations. Persistent or severe hepatotoxicity occurs in a minority and can usually be managed by modifying therapy. Rarely, prolonged high-dose exposure may lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis, underscoring the importance of cumulative dose awareness and regular surveillance [^1116bvMn] [^1118tzau].

---

Methotrexate therapy in LGLL patients is associated with mostly mild, transient liver enzyme elevations; persistent or severe hepatotoxicity occurs in a minority. Regular monitoring, risk-factor mitigation, and timely dose adjustments are essential to minimize hepatic injury and enable safe, long-term therapy.

Discussion

This is the largest study to examine the incidence of treatment changes with abnormal blood-test results during long-term MTX or LEF therapy. In comparison, the largest systematic review (SR) of low-dose MTX included data on liver and bone-marrow toxicity from 3806 and 3463 participants from 29 studies, and the previous largest study of LEF included data for 3325 participants.

This study focused on patients successfully initiated on long-term DMARDs as there is lack of data on benefit from monitoring during this period. It reports that treatment changes with abnormal blood-test results are common in the first 12 months after hospital-supervised treatment initiation and stabilization, and becomes less frequent thereafter. Treatment changes with severe blood-test abnormalities were uncommon and became less frequent over time.

Our observation that 3.3% participants discontinued low-dose MTX with elevated liver enzymes are comparable to the 3.7% incidence reported in the SR, and, are higher than those in the CORRONA registry. In our study, 2.8% participants discontinued MTX with cytopenia. This is lower than the 6.7% cumulative incidence of cytopenia during MTX therapy in the SR. The incidence of MTX discontinuation with leucopenia (0.6% vs 1.2%) and neutropenia (0.5% vs 1.8%) at 1 year was lower than the cumulative incidence reported in a recent SR of clinical trials that included events from the treatment initiation phase. This may be due to the fact that our outcome definition required drug discontinuation with cytopenia, whereas the SRs reported on the incidence of any cytopenia, including those not requiring treatment discontinuation.

MTX and LEF are uncommonly discontinued for blood-test abnormalities after the first year of shared-care prescription and discontinuations for severely abnormal blood-test results are even less frequent. These data will be useful when counselling patients in routine clinical practice. Elevated liver enzymes were the commonest blood-test abnormality to cause treatment discontinuations. This underlines the need to advise patients treated with DMARDs to minimize other risk-factors for hepatotoxicity. Further research is required to identify risk-factors of target-organ damage, and, to develop a prognostic model for risk-stratified blood-test monitoring. This is being evaluated by our team in another ongoing study that will also assess the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of risk-based monitoring.

### Cyclophosphamide as a first-line therapy in LGL leukemia [^113GDUuB]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a T or NK clonal disorder characterized by the tissue invasion of marrow, spleen and liver. Clinical presentation is dominated by recurrent infections associated with neutropenia, anemia, splenomegaly and autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, STAT3 and STAT5 mutations have been detected in T-LGL and in NK-LGL leukemias. These somatic mutations, coupled to other intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, are likely to induce constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway thus contributing to maintenance of leukemic LGL survival. These findings strongly suggest a common specific pathogenic pattern in T-LGL and NK-LGL leukemias and provide justification for consideration of the same treatment options. Indications for treatment are severe or symptomatic neutropenia, symptomatic or transfusion-dependent anemia or associated autoimmune diseases requiring therapy. There is no standard treatment for patients with LGL leukemia. All the largest series published in the literature (collecting data on more than 40 patients) are retrospective. Data are very heterogeneous and treatment outcome per single agent is available for very few patients. Immunosuppressive therapy remains the foundation of treatment including single agents that is, methotrexate, oral cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine. On the basis of an initial study showing very good overall response rate (ORR) using methotrexate, this drug has remained the most recommended option in LGL leukemia. Oral low dose cyclophosphamide was first used in pure red cell aplasia associated with LGL leukemia. In a French series, cyclophosphamide was shown to be also efficient in neutropenic patients and for those who failed methotrexate. Those results suggested that cyclophosphamide used as first-line therapy could be an interesting alternative to methotrexate.

NCCN T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia — indications for treatment and first-line therapy: Indications include ANC < 0.5 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, platelets < 50 × 10⁹/L, autoimmune diseases with T-LGLLs requiring therapy, symptomatic splenomegaly, severe B symptoms, pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to LGLL, and ANC < 1500 with documented T-LGLL and recurrent infections. With no indication, observe; if indication is present, preferred first-line options are clinical trial, low-dose methotrexate ± corticosteroids, oral cyclophosphamide ± corticosteroids, or cyclosporine ± corticosteroids, and management of underlying cytopenia(s) alone may be appropriate in certain circumstances. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. Treat underlying autoimmune disease, monitor for cumulative toxicity with long-term methotrexate, and note that methotrexate with or without steroids may be beneficial in autoimmune disease; cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine may be used as a first- or second-line option in patients with anemia.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^112PdUQS]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, this study has several limitations. First, our findings are not applicable to patients at very high risk of drug toxicity and not transferred to shared-care prescribing e.g. CKD-4, pre-existing chronic liver disease. However, it is extremely uncommon to offer MTX or LEF to such patients, and the results of our study will therefore apply to the vast majority of AIRD patients. Secondly, dose data were missing for the majority of MTX and a large proportion of LEF prescriptions. This limits the validity of dose-reduction analysis. Thirdly, CKD progression and a serum creatinine increase of > 26 μm/l, the minimum change required to consider the presence of AKI, was used to ascertain drug discontinuation with kidney function decline. The guideline specifies that the increase in creatinine should occur within 48 h. We were unable to meet this part of the definition due to inherent large gaps between blood-tests, potentially resulting in an overestimate of the incidence of AKI. Our results therefore represent a worst-case scenario with respect to impact on kidney function. Some of the abnormal blood-test results could be due to concurrent prescription of other DMARDs e.g. SSZ. This can potentially elevate the outcome event rate. However, this is unlikely to play a large part as our outcome definition required a prescription gap of at-least 90 days and, it can reasonably be expected that in this period most rheumatologists will be able to ascertain the actual drug responsible for the blood-test abnormality. Moreover, some patients prescribed first-line subcutaneous MTX for RA from the hospital clinic, and stepping down to GP prescribed and monitored oral MTX may appear as incident users of MTX. However, this is likely to be uncommon as most patients with RA in the UK are commenced on oral MTX first-line and, if commenced on subcutaneous MTX first-line may have a contraindication to oral therapy. Research suggests that patients prescribed subcutaneous MTX change to the oral route in < 3% instances. Additionally, some treatment discontinuations in people with SLE may be due to increased disease activity e.g. cytopenia resulting in treatment escalation. However, a sensitivity analysis excluding cases with SLE or CTD reported similar event rates as the main analysis. Finally, it is difficult to attribute causality for adverse events and some potential adverse events may be unrelated to the treatment.

LEF was more likely to be discontinued with abnormal blood-tests than MTX. These findings are contrary to the results of a trial in which folate supplementation was not mandatory for participants randomized to MTX. However, in another trial where folate supplementation was mandatory for participants randomized to MTX there were more LEF than MTX discontinuations for elevated liver enzymes (7.7% vs 4.4%). Folic acid supplementation was recommended in the BSR guidelines and became common practice in the early 2000s, and our findings of greater liver toxicity with LEF are expected.

MTX and LEF discontinuation with kidney function decline was uncommon, though more frequent in the first 12 months, raising the possibility that these drugs may be nephrotoxic. However, published data suggests that nephrotoxicity is uncommon with these drugs. Only one case of reversible kidney failure due to MTX was reported in a clinical trial, and there is one case report of LEF induced interstitial nephritis but this was associated with chronic over-dosing and with no cases of LEF nephrotoxicity reported in clinical trials. The largest clinical trial to examine the side-effects from low-dose MTX albeit in a non-AIRD population reported an average 1.9 ml/min/1.73 m² improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 15% lower risk of renal adverse events compared with placebo. A previous 2-year clinical trial reported no change in creatinine with LEF, and only a marginal increase in creatinine with MTX. These findings suggest that there is low risk of nephrotoxicity with LEF and low-dose MTX.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115fmuEh]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) first-line therapy efficacy — In a single center cohort study of 319 patients with LGLL, response rates were higher with cyclophosphamide (32%) compared to methotrexate (16%) or cyclosporine (23%), and autoimmune diseases were associated with increased response rates while thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and female gender assigned at birth were associated with decreased response rates; thrombocytopenia was an independent risk factor for inferior survival. In a multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial (N = 160; 150 evaluable at 4 months) comparing methotrexate (n = 76) versus cyclophosphamide (n = 74) in previously untreated LGLL in need of treatment, the ORR was 73% (24% CR) for cyclophosphamide versus 32% (12% CR) for methotrexate (P < .001).

Baseline characteristics of participants in the MTX (n = 15 670) and LEF (n = 2,689) cohorts

The incidence of MTX discontinuation with raised liver enzymes, and decline in kidney function was higher in the first 12 months than subsequently, whereas the incidence of MTX discontinuation with cytopenia remained stable throughout (Table 3 and Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S4, available at Rheumatology online). On the contrary, the incidence of LEF discontinuation with cytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and kidney function decline was higher in the first 12 months (Table 3 and Fig. 2). LEF discontinuation with severe individual blood-test abnormalities was numerically more common in the first 12 months than subsequently (Table 3). 2

Incidence of MTX and LEF dose reduction

Sensitivity analysis

On excluding people with SLE or CTDs, the incidence (95% CI) of MTX discontinuation was 27.40 (25.90, 28.98)/1000 person-years for any blood-test abnormality and, 5.88 (5.21, 6.63)/1000 person-years for leucopenia, 4.40 (3.83, 5.05)/1000 person-years for neutropenia and 5.75 (5.09, 6.49)/1000 person-years for thrombocytopenia. This was comparable to that observed in the entire dataset (Table 2). There were no differences when the analyses were stratified for duration of follow-up (data not shown).

The incidence of MTX discontinuation due to elevated liver enzymes was higher in psoriatic arthritis than RA. This difference was present both early and late in the treatment course and for any or severely elevated liver enzymes. However, the incidence of MTX discontinuation due to cytopenia or renal function decline was comparable in the two populations (Table S2).

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^111JiLWx]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

MTX was twice as likely to be discontinued with elevated liver enzymes in PsA than in RA, as reported previously. However, the rates of MTX discontinuation due to cytopenia and renal function decline were comparable suggesting this risk is target-organ specific. Further research is required to understand the underlying mechanism. However, these findings suggest that PsA patients treated with MTX should be monitored carefully for hepatotoxicity and advised to minimize risk factors for the latter.

Most treatment discontinuations in this study were not due to abnormal blood-test results. The cumulative incidence of all-cause MTX and LEF discontinuation at 1- and 5 years in this study were comparable to previous reports. Given a wide MTX dosing range, dose reduction was more common for MTX than for LEF.

Strengths of this study include large sample size allowing us to provide precise estimates for anticipated low event rates. Additionally, this study used real-world data, thus increasing generalizability. Outcomes were stratified according to their severity and time-course to add granularity to the results and increase clinical utility. Data from the period when MTX or LEF was commenced were excluded by design and the results are applicable to long-term maintenance treatment where the greatest burden of testing lies. Although this may be viewed as a limitation, it does not reduce the validity of our findings. Missing outcome data is a concern with studies using consultation-based databases. However, the cumulative estimates of drug discontinuation reported in this study are consistent with those from previous trials and observational studies. Additionally, our validation exercise revealed that only 5% outcomes were potentially related to another condition, its complication or its treatment. We used a parsimonious list of conditions in this exercise including those for which there was only a remote possibility of abnormal blood-test results.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^1115GtTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If the results of a liver biopsy show mild changes (Roenigk, grades I, II, IIIa), Otrexup may be continued and the patient monitored as per recommendations listed above. Otrexup should be discontinued in any patient who displays persistently abnormal liver function tests and refuses liver biopsy or in any patient whose liver biopsy shows moderate to severe changes (Roenigk grade IIIb or IV).

Infection or Immunologic States:

Otrexup should be used with extreme caution in the presence of active infection, and is contraindicated in patients with overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes.

Immunization may be ineffective when given during Otrexup therapy. Immunization with live virus vaccines is generally not recommended. There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunizations in patients receiving methotrexate therapy. Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported rarely.

Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, may occur with Otrexup therapy. When a patient presents with pulmonary symptoms, the possibility of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be considered.

Neurologic:

There have been reports of leukoencephalopathy following intravenous administration of methotrexate to patients who have had craniospinal irradiation. Serious neurotoxicity, frequently manifested as generalized or focal seizures, has been reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermediate-dose intravenous methotrexate (1 g/m²). Symptomatic patients were commonly noted to have leukoencephalopathy and/or microangiopathic calcifications on diagnostic imaging studies. Chronic leukoencephalopathy has also been reported in patients who received repeated doses of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue even without cranial irradiation.

Methotrexate — laboratory monitoring experience and liver biopsy considerations — patients taking methotrexate have undergone routine CBC counts and assessment of renal function; for patients with leukopenia, the dose has been adjusted based on the WBC count; in one study, 26% of patients had one or more hematologic abnormalities, and more than 95% of these patients had symptoms consistent with viral infection, with the abnormality resolving within 1 month of withholding the drug and not recurring with rechallenge; liver function tests, especially of the transaminases, are monitored; the routine use of liver biopsy after every cumulative dose of 1 to 2 g methotrexate is controversial; and if present, nausea, diarrhea, and stomatitis have responded to dose reduction and the addition or an increase in dosage of 1 mg folic acid.

### Association of inherited genetic factors with drug-induced hepatic damage among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^112ZmPRd]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Hepatotoxic effects, including hyperbilirubinemia and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, are common during all phases of therapy and are linked to several chemotherapeutic agents, including asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate.

Objective

To determine which genetic variants were associated with hyperbilirubinemia and elevated ALT and AST levels in children, adolescents, and young adults treated for ALL.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective analysis of a multiethnic genome-wide association study was conducted between January 1, 2019, and April 15, 2022, including patients treated as part of Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials with centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia, which accrued data from December 29, 2003, to January 21, 2011 (AALL0232), and from January 22, 2007, to July 24, 2014 (AALL0434). Germline genotypes were interrogated using genome-wide arrays and imputed using a National Institutes of Health TOPMed Imputation server. Mixed-effects logistic regressions were used to account for multiple episodes for an individual patient. Genotype × treatment phase interaction was tested to uncover phase-specific genetic risk factors.

Exposures

Total duration of multiagent protocol chemotherapy ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) hyperbilirubinemia of grade 3 or higher and elevated liver ALT and AST levels.

Results

A total of 3557 participants were included in the analysis (2179 [61.3%] male; median age, 11.1 [range, 1–30] years). Among 576 known variants associated with these liver function test results in the general population, UGT1A1 variant rs887829 and PNPLA3 variant rs738409 were associated with increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.18 [95% CI, 1.89–2.53]; P = 6.7 × 10–27) and ALT and AST levels (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.15–1.40]; P = 3.7 × 10–7), respectively, during treatment for ALL. Corresponding polygenic risk scores were associated with hepatotoxic effects across all therapy phases and were largely driven by UGT1A1 and PNPLA3 variants. Genome-wide association analysis revealed an age-specific variant near the CPT1A gene that was only associated with elevated ALT and AST levels among patients younger than 10 years (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.18–1.39]; P = 8.7 × 10–10).

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest a strong genetic basis for interpatient variability in hyperbilirubinemia and aminotransferase level elevations during leukemia chemotherapy.

### How I treat LGL leukemia [^112gaWQy]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is characterized by a clonal expansion of either CD3(+) cytotoxic T or CD3(-) NK cells. Prominent clinical features of T-LGL leukemia include neutropenia, anemia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The terminal effector memory phenotype (CD3(+)/CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)CD57(+)) of T-LGL suggests a pivotal chronic antigen-driven immune response. LGL survival is then promoted by platelet-derived growth factor and interleukin-15, resulting in global dysregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. These pathogenic features explain why treatment of T-LGL leukemia is based on immunosuppressive therapy. The majority of these patients eventually need treatment because of severe or symptomatic neutropenia, anemia, or RA. No standard therapy has been established because of the absence of large prospective trials. The authors use low-dose methotrexate initially for T-LGL leukemia patients with neutropenia and/or RA. We recommend either methotrexate or oral cyclophosphamide as initial therapy for anemia. If treatment is not successful, patients are switched to either the other agent or cyclosporine. The majority of patients experience an indolent clinical course. Deaths infrequently occur because of infections related to severe neutropenia. As there are no curative therapeutic modalities for T-LGL leukemia, new treatment options are needed.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^1122Tfw3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cohort exit

The earliest of date of outcome, death, transfer out of the GP practice, last data collection from the GP practice, or 31 December 2019. For the dose reduction analysis, follow-up was censored on the first prescription date at which dose data were missing.

Outcomes

Drug discontinuation with abnormal blood-test result: Prescription gap of ≥ 90 days, with an abnormal blood-test result or Read code indicating abnormal blood-test result within ± 60 days of the date of last prescription. The thresholds for abnormal blood-test results were: white blood cells (WBCs) < 3.5 × 10⁹/l; neutrophils < 1.6 × 10⁹/l; platelets < 140 × 10⁹/l; ALT/AST > 100 IU/l (6); and kidney function decline defined as either CKD progression based on Read codes entered by the GP using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD guidelines, or a creatinine increase of > 26 μmol/l, the threshold for consideration of AKI.
Drug discontinuation with severe abnormal blood-test result: Prescription gap of ≥ 90 days, with severely abnormal monitoring blood-test result within ± 60 days of the date of last prescription. Severe blood-test abnormalities were defined as: WBCs < 2.5 × 10 9 /l; neutrophils < 1.0 × 10 9 /l; platelets < 50 × 10 9 /l; ALT or AST > 200 IU/l or serum creatinine > 2 times the previous value. These thresholds were selected as they reflect grade-3 cytopenia according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, stage 2 acute kidney injury according to the KDIGO guidelines and meet the criteria for drug induced liver injury with ALT or AST > 5 times upper limit of normal.
Dose reduction with abnormal, and severely abnormal blood-test result: Dose reduction between two consecutive prescriptions.
Drug discontinuation (any reason): Gap of ≥ 90 days between the last prescription date and the earliest of date of death, transfer out of the GP practice, last data collection from GP practice or 31 December 2019.

Data management

Read code and product code lists were developed to ascertain AIRDs, inclusion and exclusion criteria, prescriptions and outcomes (available on request).

### Randomized trial to compare LSA2L2-type maintenance therapy to daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate with vincristine and dexamethasone pulse for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^116nCEJM]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A total of 201 pediatric cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with the ALL-96 protocol by the Kyushu-Yamaguchi Children's Cancer Study Group.

Procedure

Risk stratification was based on white cell counts, immunophenotype, the presence of central nervous system disease at diagnosis, organomegaly, and early treatment response (day 14 bone marrow status). All of the patients were classified into standard-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR) groups and were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with either LSA2L2-type or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)/methotrexate (MTX) with vincristine (VCR) and dexamethasone (DEX) pulse in both risk groups.

Results

The 7-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the entire study population were 72.1% (95% CI: 68.0–76.2%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 79.7–89.9%), respectively, and the EFS of the SR patients (85.3% [95% CI: 78.2–92.4%]) was significantly better than HR patients (62.4% [95% CI: 52.2–72.6%]) (P = 0.0007).

Conclusions

There were no differences in the EFS between the different maintenance therapies in each risk group; however, grade IV liver toxicity occurred more often in the patients receiving 6-MP/MTX with VCR and DEX therapy than in patients receiving LSA2L2.

### Cyclophosphamide induces durable molecular and clinical responses in patients with relapsed T-LGL leukemia [^1127k72T]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, we published a report on T-LGLL that showed improved clinical responses in patients treated with Cy, especially if this was used as second line after frontline MTX. In that study, 100% of patients (7/7) that were treated with Cy as second-line therapy after frontline MTX had a response to treatment (3 CR and 4 partial response [PR]). Here, we report on additional patients (n = 22) treated with Cy for relapsed or refractory T-LGLL, and for the first time report survival outcomes, duration of response, and presence of CMR in the relapsed setting.

We retrospectively evaluated all patients treated for T-LGLL with oral Cy at the Ohio State University (OSU) James Comprehensive Cancer Center from 2000 through 2019. The diagnosis of T-LGLL was made based on 2016 World Health Organization criteria. T-LGLL criteria included a CD3 + CD8 + population on flow cytometry ≥ 500 cells/mm³ and a positive monoclonal T-cell receptor (TCR). This was considered positive if detected by TCR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by restriction of TCR-Vbeta noted on flow cytometry. For patients diagnosed with a clonal TCR by flow cytometry, a panel of 30 TCR-Vbeta rearrangements was used and considered positive if 1 or more clone was detected in ≥ 10% of events. Disease response was defined by the E5998 study criteria and was confirmed retrospectively by the investigators (Z.B. and J.E.B.). Although there is variability in follow-up given the retrospective nature of this study, in general, as standard clinical care, patients were monitored for response on Cy for a minimum of 4 months at the full 100-mg dosage. Standard laboratory values (complete blood count with differential, hepatic function panel, basic chemistry panel) were drawn every 4 to 6 weeks either at OSU or with a local physician. Flow cytometry was assessed every 2 to 3 months to evaluate for residual disease. Patients who attained an improvement in their affected blood counts (ie, neutropenia or anemia) were continued on Cy, even if full E5998 response criteria were not attained because E5998 criteria were assessed retrospectively only. In this way, patients who attained some response at 4 months could be evaluated months later to assess for a deepening of their clinical response. CMR was defined as: CR by E5998 criteria and clearance of the TCR PCR-based gene rearrangement studies or TCR VBeta flow cytometry assessment for individual clones. The time-to-response (TTR) was measured as time from start of Cy until PR or CR, with patients who failed to respond being censored at the end of their Cy treatment. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) in patients responding to Cy was measured as time from start of Cy until disease progression, with patients without progression being censored at last follow-up. TTR and LFS were compared across variables using Kaplan-Meier curves with median survival and 95% confidence intervals. The OSU's institutional review board approved this study, which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Benefits of the intermittent use of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate in maintenance treatment for low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children: randomized trial from the Brazilian childhood cooperative group – protocol ALL-99 [^116TgBNN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

PURPOSE To describe event-free survival (EFS) and toxicities in children with low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) assigned to receive either continuous 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and weekly methotrexate (MTX) or intermittent 6-MP with intermediate-dose MTX, as maintenance treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007, 635 patients with low-risk ALL were enrolled onto Brazilian Childhood Cooperative Group for ALL Treatment (GBTLI) ALL-99 protocol. Eligible children (n = 544) were randomly allocated to receive either continuous 6-MP/MTX (group 1, n = 272) or intermittent 6-MP (100 mg/m²/d for 10 days, with 11 days resting) and MTX (200 mg/m² every 3 weeks; group 2, n = 272). RESULTS The 5-year overall survival (OS) and EFS were 92.5% ± 1.5% SE and 83.6% ± 2.1% SE, respectively. According to maintenance regimen, the OS was 91.4% ± 2.2% SE (group 1) and 93.6% ± 2.1% SE (group 2; p = 0.28) and EFS 80.9% ± 3.2% SE (group 1) and 86.5% ± 2.8% SE (group 2; p = 0.089). Remarkably, the intermittent regimen led to significantly higher EFS among boys (85.7% v 74.9% SE; p = 0.027), while no difference was seen for girls (87.0% v 88.8% SE; p = 0.78). Toxic episodes were recorded in 226 and 237 children, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 toxic events for groups 1 and 2 were, respectively, 273 and 166 for hepatic dysfunction (P = 0.002), and 772 and 636 for hematologic episodes (P = 0.005). Deaths on maintenance were: seven (group 1) and one (group 2). CONCLUSION The intermittent use of 6-MP and MTX in maintenance is a less toxic regimen, with a trend toward better long-term EFS. Boys treated with the intermittent schedule had significantly better EFS.

Regarding medical management for T-cell/natural killer-cell lymphoma, more specifically with respect to management of large granular lymphocytic leukemia, BSH 2022 guidelines recommend to offer an alternative immunosuppressive agent (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporin) upon failure (or intolerance) to first-line therapy.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^116QAxaE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Tests

Patients undergoing Otrexup therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray.

During therapy, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

During initial or changing doses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5 Risks from Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that Otrexup is administered weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function, Ascites, or Pleural Effusions

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Otrexup administration.

5.7 Dizziness and Fatigue

Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8 Malignant Lymphomas

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Discontinue Otrexup first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.

5.9 Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce "tumor lysis syndrome" in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

### Large granular lymphocytic leukemia: molecular pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment [^117JWvsc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia represents a spectrum of rare lymphoproliferative diseases defined by clonal amplification of either CD3(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes or CD3(-) natural killer cells. This chapter focuses on the T-cell form of LGL leukemia. Clinical features include neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. LGL leukemia is thought to arise from chronic antigenic stimulation, with the long-term survival of LGL being promoted by constitutive activation of multiple survival signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT3, sphingolipid, and Ras/MEK/ERK pathways. Therefore, these lead to global deregulation of apoptosis and resistance to normal pathways of activation-induced cell death. The majority of LGL leukemia patients eventually need treatment. Treatment of leukemic LGL is based on immunosuppressive therapy, primarily using low doses of methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. However, no standard therapy has been established because of the lack of large, prospective trials. In addition, because some patients are refractory to currently available treatments and none of these therapeutic modalities can cure LGL leukemia, new therapeutic options are needed. Understanding the current state of the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia may provide insights into novel therapeutic options.

### Immunosuppressive therapy of LGL leukemia: prospective multicenter phase II study by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E5998) [^113AY7ja]. Leukemia (2015). Low credibility.

Failure to undergo activation-induced cell death due to global dysregulation of apoptosis is the pathogenic hallmark of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. Consequently, immunosuppressive agents are rational choices for treatment. This first prospective trial in LGL leukemia was a multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating methotrexate (MTX) at 10 mg/m² orally weekly as initial therapy (step 1). Patients failing MTX were eligible for treatment with cyclophosphamide at 100mg orally daily (step 2). The overall response in step 1 was 38% with 95% confidence interval (CI): 26 and 53%. The overall response in step 2 was 64% with 95% CI: 35 and 87%. The median overall survival for patients with anemia was 69 months with a 95% CI lower bound of 46 months and an upper bound not yet reached. The median overall survival for patients with neutropenia has not been reached 13 years from study activation. Serum biomarker studies confirmed the inflammatory milieu of LGL but were not a priori predictive of response. We identify a gene expression signature that correlates with response and may be STAT3 mutation driven. Immunosuppressive therapies have efficacy in LGL leukemia. Gene signature and mutational profiling may be an effective tool in determining whether MTX is an appropriate therapy.

### Erythrocyte concentrations of metabolites or cumulative doses of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate do not predict liver changes in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^111gK6zc]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During therapy consisting of 6MP and MTX, metabolites accumulate in the erythrocytes. The erythrocyte levels of metabolites reflect the intensity of therapy. Whether they are associated with hepatotoxicity manifested as histological liver changes is not known. We studied the association of the metabolites and cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX with histological liver disease.

Methods

Serial measurements of E-TGN, E-MTX, and ALT during maintenance therapy were performed and cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX were calculated as g/m² in 16 children with ALL. Each subject underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy at the end of therapy to screen for histological liver disease.

Results

No differences in E-TGN, E-MTX, or cumulative doses of 6MP or MTX were detected in the children with ALL with liver fibrosis compared to those without fibrosis, or in the children with less liver fatty change compared to those with more fatty change. Serum median ALT levels correlated significantly positively with cumulative doses of 6MP during therapy (rS = 0.527, P = 0.036), but not with cumulative doses of MTX, or E-TGN, or E-MTX.

Conclusions

Erythrocyte levels of the metabolites or the cumulative doses of 6MP and MTX do not predict histological liver disease in children treated for ALL.

### Methotrexate (Xatmep) [^115rNLrh]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hepatic Toxicity

XATMEP can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure. Avoid use of XATMEP in patients with chronic liver disease.

Assess liver function prior to initiating XATMEP and monitor liver function tests during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue XATMEP as appropriate. Transient asymptomatic acute liver enzyme elevations are common and are not predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Other risk factors for hepatotoxicity include alcoholism, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, previous significant exposure to liver toxins, history of liver disease, family history of inheritable liver disease, persistent abnormal liver chemistry findings, duration of therapy, and advanced age.

5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity

Methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases can occur at all dose levels. Monitor patients for signs of pulmonary toxicity and interrupt or discontinue XATMEP as appropriate.

5.7 Hypersensitivity and Dermatologic Reactions

Severe, including fatal, dermatologic reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, can occur with methotrexate. Discontinue XATMEP if severe dermatologic reactions occur.

Anaphylaxis can occur with methotrexate. If anaphylaxis or any other serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue methotrexate and institute appropriate therapy. Methotrexate is contraindicated for use in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity.

Radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be "recalled" by the use of methotrexate.

5.8 Secondary Malignancies

Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate.

There have been instances of lymphoproliferative disease associated with low-dose oral methotrexate which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate without institution of antineoplastic therapy. Discontinue XATMEP first and institute appropriate treatment if the lymphoma does not regress.

### What is the incidence of methotrexate or leflunomide discontinuation related to cytopenia, liver enzyme elevation or kidney function decline? [^117H4URc]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) affect > 1% adults and are treated with DMARDs. These drugs can cause cytopenia, raised liver enzymes and AKI and, fortnightly to monthly monitoring blood-tests are recommended when initiating treatment with less frequent testing thereafter. In the UK, DMARDs are initiated in a rheumatology clinic with prescriptions dispensed from the hospital and fortnightly blood monitoring overseen by the rheumatology team. Once an effective, tolerated and stable dose is reached, the responsibility for prescribing and arranging 2–3 monthly blood-tests is handed to the GP under shared-care policy supported by the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and Royal College of General Practitioners. The Rheumatology team is contacted if there are side-effects, including blood-test abnormalities and oversee treatment changes. Monitoring blood-tests are discontinued after 2 years for SSZ while long-term testing is continued for low-dose MTX and LEF. Whether such long-term testing influences the decision to discontinue treatment is not known because most clinical trials are shorter than 1 year, and many observational studies report cumulative toxicity including outcomes from the treatment initiation phase during which reversible drug-induced target organ injury is common. However, evidence from a large 2-year clinical trial suggests that DMARD discontinuation due to target organ damage becomes less common with increasing duration of treatment. With growing use of DMARDs and the corresponding increased burden and cost of testing, it is important to evaluate the benefit from regular monitoring blood-tests for long-term low-dose MTX or LEF treatment. Thus, the objectives of this study were to examine the incidence of drug discontinuation and dose reduction with abnormal blood-test results in AIRDs treated with long-term low-dose MTX or LEF. We also explored the data to examine whether the incidence of MTX discontinuation due to any abnormal blood-test result, elevated liver enzymes, AKI or cytopenia differed in RA and PsA as there is evidence that psoriasis increases the risk of hepatotoxicity from MTX.

### High-dose methotrexate-induced reversible grade 4 hyperbilirubinaemia and transaminitis in an adolescent with Burkitt leukaemia [^113ffGrm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Symptomatic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an uncommon problem. Direct DILI is dose-related, predictable with short latency (hour to days) and is generally associated with transient and reversible transaminitis without jaundice. Antimetabolites including methotrexate are a common cause for direct DILI. Hepatotoxicity associated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is generally transient and includes reversible elevation of transaminase in up to 60% and associated hyperbilirubinaemia (≤ grade 2) in 25% of courses and therefore is of no clinical significance. Severe grades of DILI with HD-MTX (grade ≥ 4) are extremely rare. We describe an adolescent with Burkitt leukaemia who had reversible grade 4 DILI including hyperbilirubinaemia postfirst course of HD-MTX. Rechallenge with two-third dose of HD-MTX in subsequent chemotherapeutic cycle did not cause recurrence of DILI.

### Large granular lymphocyte leukemia: natural history and response to treatment [^115Trq5n]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) is an indolent T lymphoproliferative disorder that was difficult to diagnose with certainty until clonality testing of the T cell receptor gene became routinely available. We studied the natural history and response to treatment in 25 consecutive patients with T-LGL diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 in which the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis, to define an effective treatment algorithm. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range 27–78), with a male to female ratio of 1:1.8 and presenting features of fatigue (n = 13), recurrent infections (n = 9), and/or abnormal blood counts (n = 5). Thirteen patients with symptomatic disease were treated as follows: pentostatin (nine patients), cyclosporine (six patients), methotrexate (three patients), and alemtuzumab in two patients in whom pentostatin was ineffective. Pentostatin was the single most effective therapy, with a response rate of 75% and minimal toxicity. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 37 months from diagnosis were 80% and 52%, respectively. Treatment of T-LGL should be reserved for patients with symptomatic disease, but in this series, pentostatin treatment was less toxic and more effective than cyclosporine or methotrexate.

### Methotrexate (Trexall) [^116Mseax]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of methotrexate PO (also known as Trexall, Jylamvo, Xatmep, Rasuvo, Otrexup):

- **Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomatitis**: use extreme caution in patients with gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis.
- **Folate deficiency**: maintain a high level of suspicion in patients treated for non-neoplastic disease, as folate deficiency may increase adverse effects. For those treated for neoplastic conditions, concurrent folic product administration may result in decreased efficacy of methotrexate.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure. Monitor liver tests at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated.
- **Infection**: use caution in patients with live vaccines. Vaccinations should be in accordance to vaccination guidelines prior to initiating methotrexate therapy.
- **Infertility, menstrual irregularity**: use caution in patients (male or female) of child-bearing age.
- **Liver cirrhosis, ALF**: use caution in patients with alcohol use disorder, alcoholic liver disease, or other chronic hepatic disease.
- **Myelosuppression**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate suppresses hematopoiesis and can cause severe and life-threatening pancytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Obtain a CBC at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients for clinical complications of myelosuppression.
- **Neurotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate can cause severe acute and chronic neurotoxicity, including leukoencephalopathy, for which the risk is increased in patients who received prior cranial radiation. Monitor patients for neurotoxicity.
- **Neurotoxicity**: use caution, especially in patients who received prior cranial radiation, for severe acute or chronic neurotoxicity.
- **Osteonecrosis**: use caution in patients with concurrent radiation therapy.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate has been associated with pulmonary toxicity, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and irreversible or fatal cases. Monitor patients for pulmonary toxicity.
- **Renal failure**: use extreme caution in patients with renal impairment or renal disease or are receiving concurrent nephrotoxic drugs.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate can cause renal toxicity, including irreversible acute renal failure. Monitor renal function at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated.
- **Secondary lymphoproliferative disease**: maintain a high level of suspicion for lymphoproliferative disease in patients on low dose methotrexate. Discontinue methotrexate completely if lymphoproliferative disease is observed.
- **Serious infections**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate increases the risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, including opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for infection during and after treatment.
- **Severe adverse reactions**: use extreme caution especially in patients with a weekly dosing regimen for dosing errors, as severe adverse reactions including death may occur.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as methotrexate has been associated with severe, including fatal dermatologic reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, skin necrosis, and erythema multiforme. Monitor for dermatologic toxicity.
- **Skin cancer**: use extreme caution in all patients, especially in patients with psoriasis who received prior methotrexate and are on concomitant use of cyclosporine.
- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: use caution in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

### Standardized supportive care documentation improves safety of high-dose methotrexate treatment [^113m53Uq]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High‐dose (HD) methotrexate (MTX; defined as MTX dose > 500 mg/m²) has been used for several decades as an important backbone in treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma [1, 2, 3]. MTX acts as folate antimetabolite and inhibits DNA synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. High doses of MTX are feasible by using folinic acid (syn, leucovorin, the reduced form of folic acid) to reduce the toxic effects upon nonmalignant cells as a "leucovorin rescue".

Notable toxicities of HD‐MTX are mucositis, myelosuppression, renal failure, liver injury, and neurotoxicity [4]. The risk of HD‐MTX toxicity is especially increased in the case of therapy‐induced renal failure because impaired renal function leads to reduced MTX renal clearance, which is the major route (90%) of MTX elimination [5]. Prolonged exposure to toxic MTX levels can induce severe myelosuppression and mucositis and is a life‐threatening condition. Avoidance of renal injury and the consecutive risk of impaired MTX clearance is therefore paramount to prevent MTX toxicity.

HD‐MTX administration demands specialized supportive care to prevent adverse events. This includes strict urine alkalinization and hyperhydration to increase MTX elimination and to prevent kidney damage as well as administration of leucovorin to reduce mucositis and myelosuppression [4, 6].

Urine alkalinization has been identified as a crucial aspect of MTX clearance and prevention of renal toxicity. At a urine pH of 5, the solubility of MTX is very low, and it can precipitate within renal tubuli, which induces severe kidney damage with the consequence of acute renal failure. In some cases, this condition will require hemodialysis. By raising the urine pH from 5 to 7.5, solubility of MTX increases about 20‐fold [4, 5, 6, 7]. Therefore, permanent and effective urine alkalinization and hyperhydration are absolutely mandatory for safe HD‐MTX treatment.

### Monitoring liver function during methotrexate therapy for psoriasis: are routine biopsies really necessary? [^116LBPKG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a widely used and efficacious treatment for psoriasis. Current recommendations advise liver biopsy after each cumulative 1–1.5g dosage of methotrexate. Although studies of methotrexate hepatotoxicity in psoriasis are of variable quality, the evidence indicates that in patients with no risk factors for liver disease on long-term, low-dosage (< 20mg), once-weekly methotrexate, liver biopsy is justified after an initial cumulative dosage of 4g. Advances in the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrogenesis may eventually further reduce the need for biopsy.

### Liver elastography for risk-assessment of liver toxicity and risk factors for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin [^113798py]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell ALL) have significantly improved with the use of targeted agents like inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), blinatumomab and chimeric antigen T-cell therapies. InO is an anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate approved for treatment of adult patients and recently for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell ALL. A noticeable adverse event (AE) with InO at the dose schedule used in the INO-VATE trial was hepatic toxicity, especially of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS); long term follow-up from this study showed a rate of SOS of 14% in the InO arm, compared with 2% in the standard of care (SOC) arm. In this study, more than double the patients in the InO arm compared to the SOC arm had proceeded to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a known risk factor for SOS. In retrospective analysis, the frequency of SOS post-HSCT in InO exposed patients have been around 20%. Other risk factors associated with development of SOS in adult patients exposed to InO and undergoing HSCT include older age, prior liver disease, cumulative InO dosage, prior HSCT, active disease at the time of HSCT, use of dual-alkylator based conditioning, amongst others.

We have previously reported on the combination of Mini-Hyper-CVD (dose-attenuated hyper fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dexamethasone, alternating with dose-attenuated methotrexate and cytarabine) and InO, with or without blinatumomab, in adult patients with R/R B-cell ALL and in older patients (≥ 60 years of age) with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL. The initial protocol was amended in February 2017 for both the R/R and frontline older patients' cohort to reduce the dose of InO (maximum of 2.7 mg/m 2) and fractionate the administration. Additionally, 4 courses of blinatumomab was added to consolidation, and maintenance was reduced to 12 cycles of prednisone, vincristine, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine along with 4 intercalated courses of blinatumomab (Supplemental [S] Fig. 1). In the R/R cohort, the rate of SOS reduced from 13% in the pre-amendment cohort to 2% in post-amendment cohort despite approximately 50% patients undergoing HSCT after InO exposure. In the frontline setting in older patients, SOS was observed in only 8% patients.

### Area under the curve of methotrexate and creatinine clearance are outcome-determining factors in primary CNS lymphomas [^113RAcEm]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

From the present analysis, no significant association between IR MTX and survival was observed. This could be due to the strong correlation observed between this parameter and AUC MTX. The identification of the best IR MTX in PCNSL needs further studies. In the meantime, an IR MTX of > 800 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ appears advisable, since it is associated with higher AUC MTX and does not display significantly higher toxicity in comparison to slower rates.

Anticonvulsants are commonly used in PCNSL patients presenting seizures. These drugs interact with hepatic aldehyde oxidase, which constitutes a major mechanism for MTX degradation. Anticonvulsant therapy increases the systemic CL MTX, as well as the level of other cytostatics, and is associated with lower efficacy of chemotherapy in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This effect seems to be more intense in patients treated with HD-MTX by a 24-h infusion, in whom about 40% of the drug is metabolised in the liver, whereas, when HD-MTX is administered as a short intravenous infusion (4–6 h), most of the drug is cleared by the kidneys. In the present analysis, no association between anticonvulsant use and toxicity and outcome was observed, and the impact of these drugs in patients treated with a 24-h infusion cannot be analysed, considering that all these patients received anticonvulsant therapy. The hypothesis that MTX dose adjustments are needed when anticonvulsants are contemporarily used should be better explored.

To identify new active drugs and combinations remains the most important strategy to improve therapeutic results in PCNSL patients, and any effort to define the best administration schedule for HD-MTX should be encouraged. With certain limitations due to their retrospective nature, our data seem to suggest that slow CL crea and high AUC MTX are independently associated with better outcome in PCNSL patients. Comprehensively, these interesting findings deserve to be assessed in prospective trials. In the meantime, a MTX dose ⩾3000 mg m⁻² administered in a 4- or 6-h infusion, every 3–4 weeks, appears an advisable schedule to adopt in clinical practice. The need to increase the MTX dose to ensure adequate exposure, such as higher AUC MTX values, in patients with a fast CL crea, should be critically considered.

### Methotrexate (Xatmep) [^114FCZCz]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Closely monitor patients undergoing XATMEP therapy so that toxic effects are detected promptly. In general, monitoring of the following parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.5)].

Increase monitoring frequency during initial dosing, dose changes, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration).

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

5.15 Risk of Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that the recommended dose is taken one time weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Overdosage (10)].

Advise patients to measure XATMEP with an accurate milliliter measuring device. Inform patients that a household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, which can result in serious adverse reactions [see Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to ask their pharmacist to recommend an appropriate measuring device and for instructions for measuring the correct dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^117218X6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate hematologic toxicity and monitoring — notes that hematologic toxicity is more likely in patients with renal insufficiency, advanced age, dosing errors, drug interactions, hypoalbuminemia, and greater than moderate alcohol intake; a test dose should be considered in patients with such risk factors, and if there is no evidence of myelosuppression or hepatotoxicity the weekly dose can be increased as needed. Pancytopenia can result after even a single dose and can occur as late as 6 weeks, so close laboratory monitoring is recommended after each dose increase. Regular laboratory monitoring with complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests should be performed every 3 to 6 months assuming no abnormalities, and periodic renal monitoring should be considered in patients with poor renal function.

### Methotrexate-related central neurotoxicity: clinical characteristics, risk factors and genome-wide association study in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113Z9bfM]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest cohort of children treated for ALL/LBL mapped for the incidence, risk factors, and long-term impact of MTX toxicity. Independent risk factors for symptomatic MTX neurotoxicity were age ≥ 10 years at diagnosis and > grade 3 elevation of serum AST during early therapy. Discontinuation of IT MTX, in an attempt to minimize further neurotoxicity after a first MTX neurotoxic event, was associated with an increased incidence of CNS relapse. Patients continuing IT MTX had only a small risk of MTX neurotoxicity recurrence (< 13%). Regardless of subsequent IT management strategy, children who developed MTX neurotoxicity had an increased risk of epilepsy.

We report on independent risk factors in multivariable analysis that are associated with symptomatic methotrexate neurotoxicity: age ≥ 10 years at diagnosis and > grade 3 elevation of serum AST during induction/consolidation. Importantly, these factors were determined in a combined cohort of Australian children treated for ALL on either BFM or COG-based therapy. AST elevation in the current series may reflect direct hepatotoxicity from methotrexate, systemic metabolic disturbances, release from nonhepatic sources such as erythrocytes, or a marker of longer serum exposure to MTX as has been shown for ALT elevation post HD MTX.

Older age has been previously reported as a risk factor in univariateand recently in multivariable analysis in a smaller cohort. Potential reasons include reduced clearance of HD MTX20 or higher steady state MTX concentration following IV administrationin older children. Protocols that used higher IT doses (15 mg) for children ≥ 9 years of age were not associated with increased neurotoxicity in our study.

The observed increase in cumulative incidence of CNS relapse following permanent cessation of IT MTX therapy requires validation in contemporaneous cohorts. In study POG 9005 (1991–1995), which had the same number of cases of acute MTX neurotoxicity (n = 95), 54 patients had intrathecal therapy modified without an increase in CNS relapse.CNS-relapse rates in our overall cohort (n = 1,251) were consistent with published rates. Treatment of CNS relapse involves exposure to additional neurotoxic agents including CNS irradiation. Taken together, these data suggest that clinicians should not cease IT MTX therapy after a first episode of MTX neurotoxicity, especially when it occurs early in therapy.

### Prediction of methotrexate efficacy and adverse events in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic literature review [^111vFeqg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is the most common childhood rheumatologic disorder, with a prevalence of 16–150 per 100,000 children. It is characterised by chronic arthritis of unknown aetiology, lasting at least 6 weeks, with an onset before 16 years of age. JIA is a heterogeneous group of disorders, whose manifestations range from relatively mild inflammation of a single joint, to severe involvement of multiple joints lasting into adulthood and leading to structural joint damage and incapacity. These long-term sequelae should be avoided and it is thought that early and effective therapy in the so-called window of opportunity is crucial in doing so.

The most widely used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of JIA is methotrexate (MTX), which has been used for more than 25 years. It is an inexpensive and safe drug and is beneficial in around 70% of JIA patients. Other treatment options include intra-articular joint injections or the more potent biologicals for MTX or corticosteroid resistant cases. It is still impossible to predict the individual prognosis and hence the treatment requirements at the onset of the disease, leading to the current step-up approach of starting MTX and adding a biological if the patient does not respond sufficiently well to MTX monotherapy. However, given the abovementioned goal to start effective treatment immediately in order to prevent joint damage and the fact that MTX monotherapy is completely ineffective in around 30% of patients, it is essential to know beforehand who is going to respond well to MTX and who is not. The latter group may then be prescribed a biological from the outset.

Next to drug effectiveness, its side effects should be taken into account. It has been shown previously that MTX despite being safe frequently causes transient elevation of liver enzymes and potentially also cytopenias, for which periodic evaluation of blood counts and liver function tests are advised. Perhaps more importantly, gastrointestinal side effects and MTX intolerance occur frequently. MTX intolerance has been shown to influence the quality of life of patients negatively. Furthermore, these adverse effects potentially cause non-compliance and hence ineffectiveness of an otherwise effective drug, interfering with the goal to induce early disease remission. To avoid this problem, the risk of occurrence of these adverse effects should be known early, in order for the physician to intervene timely.

Therefore, to optimise treatment of JIA patients, it is necessary to predict the probability of response as well as the risk of developing adverse events. This systematic literature review aims to find and summarise studies, which assessed factors capable of doing so.

After a median 40-month follow-up (range 1–168 months), 42 patients had disease progression. The median PFS duration was 31.4 months, and the 3-year PFS rate was 49.7% (Figure 4A). Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic factors of PFS. Patients with elevated hsCRP at baseline had significantly shorter PFS than patients with normal hsCRP (25.9 months vs not reached, P = 0.039) (Figure 4B). Patients who had 3 or more abnormal liver function test (including ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, total bilirubin, and ALB) had significantly shorter PFS than patients with 2 or less abnormality (22.5 months vs not reached, P = 0.007; Figure 4C). Patients who received targeted therapy or IMIDs-based therapy as first-line treatment had significantly longer PFS than patients who received other systemic treatment (not reached vs not reached vs 25.9 months, P = 0.023; Figure 4D). In multivariable analyses, patients who had 3 or more abnormal serum liver function tests (HR 3.384, 95% CI 1.550–7.388, P = 0.002), and treatment with IMIDs (HR 0.073, 95% CI 0.010–0.541, P = 0.010) compared to other systemic chemotherapy remained predictive factors for PFS (Supplementary Table S2).

### Toxicity associated with high-dose intravenous methotrexate for hematological malignancies [^113c2yQw]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravenous high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is a critical chemotherapeutic agent in hematological malignancies, however, data are lacking on how to predict and prevent toxicities such as kidney injury. We retrospectively analyzed 539 episodes of HD-MTX (≥ 1 g/m²) delivered to 144 patients for treatment of prophylaxis of CNS hematological malignancy across three Australian institutions and correlated risk factors with toxicity. Clinically relevant (CTCAE v4.03 grade 2–4) nephrotoxicity occurred on 36 (7%) occasions and was mostly grade 2. Multivariate analysis revealed that doses ≥ 6 g/m² (HR 5.02, 95%CI 1.46–17.2, p = 0.01) and interacting/nephrotoxic drugs (HR: 7.15, 91%CI: 2.18–23.512, p = 0.001) were the only factors associated with nephrotoxicity. 48-hour methotrexate level, hypoalbuminemia and increasing age were associated with prolonged clearance but not nephrotoxicity. Mucositis, liver dysfunction and cytopenias were transient and mild in most cases. We have demonstrated that the most common risk factors for nephrotoxicity are modifiable which may assist clinical decision-making when administering this important drug.

At a median follow-up of 68 months, 75 patients (31%) underwent HSCT; the median time to HSCT from last dose of InO was 1.7 months (range, 0.7–8.7 months). In InO monotherapy arm, the median time to HSCT from last dose of InO was 1.6 months while it was 2.0 months and 3.9 months for patients treated on Mini-HyperCVD-InO before and after amendment, respectively. Amongst the patients who underwent HSCT, 64 patients (85%) had received InO based therapy as salvage (28 as monotherapy and 36 as Mini-HyperCVD-InO) while the remainder 11 patients (15%) had received Mini-HyperCVD-InO as frontline therapy (Fig. S1). The median cumulative dose of InO administered to patients who proceeded to HSCT was 3.1 mg/m² (range, 0.6–7.2 mg/m²).

### Large granular lymphocytic leukemia – A retrospective study of 319 cases [^113GKmsA]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a rare hematological malignancy that arises from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T-LGLL) in 85% of cases and natural killer (NK) cells in the rest. A significant knowledge gap exists regarding the pathogenesis, treatment choices, and prognostic factors of LGLL. We report a cohort of 319 consecutive LGLL patients who presented to our cancer center between 2001 and 2020. A total of 295 patients with T-LGLL and 24 with chronic NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD-NK) were identified. The median age was 65years (range, 17–90years). Eighty-three patients (26.0%) had autoimmune diseases. A total of 119 patients (37.3%) had coexisting malignancies, 66 (20.7%) had solid tumors, and 59 (18.5%) had hematological malignancies. Most coexisting malignancies were diagnosed before the diagnosis of LGLL. Treatment was needed for 57% of patients. Methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (Cy), and cyclosporine A (CSA) were most used and had similar response rates between 61.5%-74.4%. Cy produced more complete responses (32.3%) compared to MTX and CSA (15.7% and 23.1%, respectively). Thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and female gender (after controlling for autoimmune diseases) were associated with decreased response rates to MTX, CSA, or Cy. Autoimmune diseases were associated with increased response rates. Thrombocytopenia was an independent risk factor for worse survival.

### Daunorubicin hydrochloride [^115F1J1P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Use of daunorubicin in a patient who has previously received doxorubicin increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin hydrochloride. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with daunorubicin hydrochloride may also result in increased cardiotoxicity.

Dosage reduction of daunorubicin hydrochloride may be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents.

Hepatotoxic medications, such as high-dose methotrexate, may impair liver function and increase the risk of toxicity.

Methotrexate (MTX) — general use, adverse effects, and hypersensitivity states that MTX is an antifolate chemotherapy and immunosuppressant agent used for the management of osteosarcoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and rheumatoid arthritis, along with other autoimmune diseases in adults and children, and that it inhibits the activity of dihydrofolate reductase, which is needed for de novo purine synthesis. Adverse effects, more commonly seen with high doses used in cancer therapy, include abdominal cramping, malaise, mucositis, myelosuppression, and renal and hepatic toxicity, and MTX pneumonitis that can progress to interstitial fibrosis has also been reported. Although the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction is unknown, it is likely rare, and case reports of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been described.

### Leflunomide (Arava) [^111Vf3H5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with ARAVA. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (> 2 × ULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with ARAVA. Use caution when ARAVA is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting ARAVA, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3-fold ULN occurs, interrupt ARAVA therapy and investigate the cause. If likely ARAVA-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If ARAVA-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of ARAVA therapy may be considered.

If ARAVA and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing.

### Short-course subcutaneous alemtuzumab induces clinical responses in relapsed T-cell large granular leukemia [^1134SV9c]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder of mature cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with a terminal effector memory phenotype (CD3 + /CD8 + /CD5 dim /CD57 + /CD62L/CD45RA + /CD45RO -) that can result in severe cytopenias, with resultant transfusion dependence, infections, and bone marrow failure in severe cases. Clonal proliferation of T-LGLL cells is mediated by overexpression of interleukin-15, with subsequent dysregulation of STAT3, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting leukemic proliferation. The current standard treatments for T-LGLL are oral immunosuppressant agents, including methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine. In the prospective ECOG5998 (E5998) trial, which utilized the only reported standardized response criteria in T-LGLL, the overall response rate (ORR) to frontline methotrexate was noted to be 38% with 2% complete responses (CR). Therapy in the relapsed/refractory setting consists of cycling other immune-suppressive agents (cyclophosphamide/cyclosporine), with response rates ranging from 30–50%, with all patients inevitably relapsing. There remains a paucity of data regarding effective therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory T-LGLL once these agents fail, demonstrating the urgent need for the development of novel treatment approaches.

### Occurrence and impact of unanticipated variation in intravenous methotrexate dosing [^117TLL1f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Studies using direct measurement suggest that the doses of up to 65% of drug infusions are outside industry standards. These preparation-associated errors occur despite routine safety procedures. As of April 5, 2006, the clinical impact of these errors had not been evaluated.

Objective

To measure the occurrence and associated clinical outcomes of variations in intravenous methotrexate dosing.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed on 47 methotrexate infusions of 800 mg/m² that were administered to 19 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Serum methotrexate concentrations were measured at the end of the infusions, which were administered over 24 hours. The total methotrexate dose was determined by direct measurement of the concentration and the volume of each infusion.

Results

Dosing errors greater than or equal to 10% occurred in 11 (23%) infusions and ranged from -61% to 55% of the ideal dose. Repeated measures regression analysis found the measured total methotrexate dose was not significantly associated with the serum methotrexate concentration (p = 0.58) or with clinical toxicities. The methotrexate dose administered over the last hours of infusion (p = 0.006) and the serum creatinine level at diagnosis (p = 0.05) were the most significant predictors of the methotrexate concentration. High methotrexate concentrations were significantly associated with increased hepatic aminotransferase levels; however, the degree of elevation was of limited clinical relevance.

Conclusions

While unexpected errors in drug dosing are more common than is suggested by other methods, the clinical impact observed in this model of methotrexate infusion was not demonstrably greater than medication errors described by other methods. Subsequent studies in this model of dosing error will require larger sample sizes, and other drugs should be evaluated.

### Leflunomide [^113SMvLD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure, has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than twice the upper limits of normal (> 2 x ULN) before initiating treatment, should not be treated with leflunomide. Use caution when leflunomide is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Monitoring of ALT levels is recommended at least monthly for six months after starting leflunomide, and thereafter every 6 to 8 weeks. If ALT elevation > 3 fold ULN occurs, interrupt leflunomide therapy and investigate the cause. If likely leflunomide-induced, perform the accelerated drug elimination procedure and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If leflunomide-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other cause has been found, resumption of leflunomide therapy may be considered. If leflunomide and methotrexate are given concomitantly, follow the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring methotrexate liver toxicity with ALT, AST, and serum albumin testing.

Psoriasis — methotrexate laboratory monitoring and toxicity management specify that ongoing studies should include a complete blood count (CBC) every 2 to 4 weeks for the first few months, then every 1 to 3 months; some suggest testing on the fifth to sixth day of the weekly methotrexate cycle because liver chemistry values may be elevated 1 to 2 days after a dose; a significant reduction in leukocyte or platelet counts necessitates reduction or temporary discontinuation of methotrexate; for overdose or cytopenias, folinic acid (leucovorin) at 10 mg/m² should be administered and given immediately with subsequent doses every 6 hours; renal monitoring includes serum urea nitrogen and creatinine at 2- to 3-month intervals, and liver chemistries should be performed every 4 weeks with more frequent monitoring for hepatic risk factors.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials and other studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Commonly reported adverse reactions include ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, and abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse reactions are infection, malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, and dizziness.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

The approximate incidences of methotrexate-attributed (i.e., placebo rate subtracted) adverse reactions in 12 to 18-week double-blind studies in patients (n = 128) with RA treated with low-dose oral (7.5 mg per week to 15 mg per week) pulse methotrexate are listed below. Most patients were on concomitant NSAIDs and some received corticosteroids. Hepatic histology was not examined in these short-term studies.

Incidence ≥ 10%: Elevated liver function tests 15%, nausea/vomiting 10%.

Incidence 3% to < 10%: Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3).

Incidence 1% to < 3%: Rash/pruritus/dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, leukopenia (white blood cell count less than 3000/mm3), pancytopenia, dizziness.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^115xpGux]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

This study was driven by the lack of published evidence on the importance of MTX dose and route of administration on both its efficacy and various types of adverse events. We aimed to thoroughly document our clinical practice based on the treat-to-target approach in order to prove the concept that better therapeutic effect achieved with the higher dose of parenteral MTX is associated with clinically acceptable adverse effects comparable to those reported in published series using oral treatment.

Methotrexate supporting information — absolute and relative contraindications and hepatotoxicity risk factors are outlined as follows: Absolute contraindications include pregnancy, nursing, alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease or other chronic liver diseases, immunodeficiency syndromes, bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or significant anemia, and hypersensitivity to methotrexate. Relative contraindications include abnormalities in renal function, abnormalities in liver function, and active infection. Risk factors for methotrexate-associated hepatotoxicity include history of or current use of greater than moderate alcohol consumption, persistent abnormal liver function test findings, history of liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, family history of inheritable liver disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, history of exposure to hepatotoxic drugs or chemicals, and hyperlipidemia.

### Methotrexate efficacy, but not its intolerance, is associated with the dose and route of administration [^1135Yuk1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As long as the reliable and widely accessible system of prediction of MTX efficacy and intolerance is not available, optimal clinical approach to MTX therapy remains of upmost importance. This study brings additional evidence for the high efficacy of MTX especially in early disease and underlines importance of using the dose around 15 mg/m 2 administered parenterally in order to evaluate treatment response early in the disease course. Such a treatment strategy does not appear to increase the rate and severity of MTX adverse events when compared to oral treatment using lower doses. Limited by short duration of follow-up and relatively small patient number true significance of our findings has yet to be confirmed through the ongoing extension of the study.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^112S4xjk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thiopurines and methotrexate — use, dosing, and safety include that for newly diagnosed pediatric CD, 6-mercaptopurine, dosed at 1.5 mg/kg/d, administered in combination with the first course of corticosteroids, has demonstrated efficacy; adverse effects of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, myelosuppression, nausea, infections, hepatotoxicity, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders, with risks of skin cancer and lymphoma demonstrated in observational studies and decreasing with medication discontinuation, and although these agents may be considered as steroid-sparing maintenance agents, accumulating risks associated with thiopurine exposures may outweigh the original steroid-sparing benefit. Methotrexate is also effective as a corticosteroid-sparing agent for the maintenance of CD remission, with parenteral methotrexate at 25 mg per week for at least 6 months with potential reduction to 15 mg per week; patients with normal small bowel absorption may be started on or switched to oral methotrexate at 15–25 mg once per week. Adverse effects related to methotrexate include nausea and vomiting, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, bone marrow suppression and skin cancer, and likely lymphoma; the white blood cell counts and liver chemistries should be routinely monitored, and when prescribed to women with child-bearing capability, methotrexate should be administered only if highly effective contraception is in place. For patients on anti-TNF therapy, thiopurines or methotrexate may also be used as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity with methotrexate 12.5–15 mg orally once weekly; antidrug antibodies can develop as early as the first 100 days of treatment, and lower drug levels at week 14 and greater risk of loss of response may be associated with active smoking status, increased body mass index, and anti-TNF monotherapy, whereas earlier initiation of combination therapy with immunomodulators may yield more durable effectiveness.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^113aypz1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Methotrexate safety monitoring — liver and hepatotoxicity: Liver function test monitoring is recommended every 3 to 6 months when results are normal, and abnormal elevations should prompt a repeat laboratory check in 2 to 4 weeks. For persistent elevations, a gastrointestinal (GI) referral is recommended. For patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, it may be reasonable to consider an alternative therapy to methotrexate; if methotrexate is chosen, recommended hepatotoxicity monitoring is similar to that in low-risk individuals, except noninvasive hepatic specific serology should be performed at baseline and annually thereafter, irrespective of total cumulative dose.

### Does day 11 omission of methotrexate due to toxicity influence the outcome in myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant? Results from a single-center retrospective cohort study [^113NrUDu]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Studies have shown variable results with the omission of day 11 MTX (Supplementary Table 1). Deeg et al. first noted that MTX at 10 mg/m² given on days 1, 3 and 6 in combination with cyclosporine did not result in higher rates of acute GVHD compared with historically reported rates. However, a report from Nash et al. demonstrated that the need for a reduction in MTX to < 80% of the scheduled dose was associated with an increased risk for grade IIa–IV acute GVHD. Subsequent retrospective studies have both refutedand confirmedthese findings. A recent study evaluating the use of MTX in combination with tacrolimus also found no deleterious effect from omission of day 11 MTX. Another meta-analysis, evaluating individual patient data of studies using a planned four doses of MTX compared with studies using prespecified three doses on days 1, 3 and 6, found a survival advantage to receiving all four doses of MTX only for recipients of peripheral blood cells but not of bone marrow, with a significantly higher rate of relapse in recipients of bone marrow with all four doses of MTX and no differences in acute or chronic GVHD with respect to MTX dosing. In a more recent study of MTX omission, mycophenolate mofetil was substituted at the time of omission resulting in similar outcomes, although grade 2–4 acute GVHD was higher in the mycophenolate mofetil/omission arm. Interestingly, most studies demonstrating no differences in GVHD outcomes used lower doses of MTX, than the dose of 15 mg/m² on day 1, followed by 10 mg/m² day 3, 6, 11 regimen. While most institutions use this standard dosing of MTX, several studies used MTX at lower doses of 7.5 mg/m² on days 1, 3, 6 and 11: 10 mg/m² on day 1, followed by 7 mg/m² on days 3, 6 and 11; or, as in our study, an MTX dosing of primarily 5 mg/m² on days 1, 3, 6 and 11. This reduced dose schema of 5 mg/m² intravenously on days 1, 3, 6 and 11 was originally developed specifically to decrease the risk of mucosal and hepatic complications, and has been widely used in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus as GVHD prophylaxis with historically similar outcomes as standard doses. Reduced doses of MTX, however, have never been directly compared with standard doses, and thus have never been proven equivalent.

### Large granular lymphocytic leukemia: a treatable form of refractory celiac disease [^113vUhxw]. Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL) is characterized by clonal expansion of CD3+ T cells or CD3(-) natural killer cells and frequently is associated with autoimmune diseases. We describe 2 patients with celiac disease who no longer responded to gluten-free diets after they developed T-cell LGL, with intestinal localization of malignant lymphocytes. Flow cytometry phenotyping of isolated intestinal intraepithelial and lamina propria cells eliminated type II refractory celiac disease, identifying large-sized CD8(+)CD57(+) T cells. Treatment with a combination of cyclosporine and methotrexate restored the patients' sensitivity to gluten-free diets. LGL therefore might be a cause of refractory celiac disease that is sensitive to immunosuppressive therapy.

### Risk stratified monitoring for methotrexate toxicity in immune mediated inflammatory diseases: prognostic model development and validation using primary care data from the UK [^112SRLAW]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We developed and externally validated a prognostic model for predicting the likelihood of methotrexate discontinuation owing to abnormal blood test results that utilises disease and demographic factors ascertained during routine clinic visits in either primary or secondary care. Our prognostic model performed well in predicting outcomes by five years and did so in clinically relevant subgroups defined by age group, type of immune mediated inflammatory disease, methotrexate dose, and route of administration. Strong independent predictors were cytopenia or raised liver enzyme levels, or both, in the six months before start of follow-up, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and diabetes. The last two associations could be related to reduced methotrexate clearance in patients with chronic kidney disease and to drug induced liver injury and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in people with diabetes.

### Hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy [^112kvv24]. The Oncologist (2001). Low credibility.

After assessment of tumor histology, the next important factor to consider in the selection of a chemotherapy regime is organ function. Patients who are to receive chemotherapy require careful assessment of liver function prior to treatment to determine which drugs may not be appropriate, and which drug doses should be modified. Following therapy abnormalities of liver function tests may be due to the therapy rather than to progressive disease, and this distinction is of critical importance. Furthermore, not all abnormalities in liver function are due to the tumor or its treatment, and other processes, such as hepatitis, must be kept in mind. This article reviews the hepatic toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, and suggests dose modifications based upon liver function abnormalities. Emphasis is placed on agents known to be hepatotoxic, and those agents with hepatic metabolism.

### Statistical analysis of relation between plasma methotrexate concentration and toxicity in high-dose methotrexate therapy of childhood nonHodgkin lymphoma [^117ADhBX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Plasma monitoring of Methotrexate (MTX) levels is a standard approach to predict MTX-related toxicities in a high-dose (HD) MTX monotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, it is uncertain whether plasma MTX levels can predict MTX-related toxicity in the HDMTX plus additional chemotherapy for childhood B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

Procedures

To statistically analyze the relationship between MTX pharmacokinetic parameters and MTX-related toxicities, we collected data from patients with delayed MTX elimination (≥ 1µM at 48hr and/or ≥ 0.5µM at 72hr) in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) BNHL 03 study. Blood MTX levels were measured at 24, 48, and 72hr after 3 or 5 g/m² HD-MTX administration for 24hr.

Results

Three hundred and four patients received 2–4 courses of the HDMTX plus additional chemotherapy, and delayed MTX elimination was observed in 165 courses of 127 patients. In those, nephrotoxicity was significantly correlated with plasma MTX levels for each patient (P = 0.03), and also for each course (P = 0.009), but no other toxicities were correlated. Another analysis according to HDMTX courses showed no significant correlation between the first high plasma MTX levels and subsequent MTX levels in later course. It also showed that incidence of liver and gastrointestinal toxicities was most frequent in the first HDMTX course, and then sharply decreased in later courses (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that plasma MTX level is not a reliable predictor for adverse events except for nephrotoxicity in multiple HDMTX therapy courses in childhood B-NHL. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2015;62:279–284. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Monitoring of nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs in patients with lung disease and lung transplant recipients: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112dYVbr]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate — adverse effects and discontinuation: In rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis populations, side effects lead to drug discontinuation in ~30% of subjects, with transaminase elevation (21%), nausea (18%), and diarrhea (12%), and age ≥ 60 years and impaired renal function are cited as risk factors. In a British registry of 673 individuals, discontinuation due to methotrexate-attributed side effects occurred in 36.3%, with GI symptoms (10.5%), abnormal liver function tests (5.5%), cytopenias (5.5%), pulmonary symptoms (3%), and cutaneous abnormalities (2.1%); life-threatening adverse events occurred in 1.7% of the cohort. In a single-center study of 26 patients followed for 84 months (12 treated for all 84 months), the drug was stopped in four patients (three for toxicity — one alopecia, two pneumonitis — and one for noncompliance).

### Analysis of a French cohort of patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia: a report on 229 cases [^1162y1d9]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder associated with autoimmune diseases and impaired hematopoiesis. This study describes the clinical and biological characteristics of 229 patients with T-cell or NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Design and Methods

The diagnosis was based on a large granular lymphocyte expansion (> 0.5 × 10⁹/L) lasting more than 6 months. Monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected in all the cases of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Patients with chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis had an indolent disease, while those with multiorgan large granular lymphocyte infiltration and an aggressive clinical disease were considered to have NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Results

The diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia was confirmed in 201 cases, chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis in 27 cases and NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia in one case. Associated autoimmune diseases or other neoplasms were present in 74 and 32 cases, respectively. One hundred patients (44%) required treatment, mainly for neutropenia-associated infections (n = 45), symptomatic autoimmune diseases (n = 24), transfusion-dependant anemia (n = 18), and other causes (n = 13). Patients were treated with steroids (n = 33), methotrexate (n = 62), cytoxan (n = 32), or cyclosporine (n = 24) either as first-, second-, third- or fourth-line therapy. The overall response rate at 3 months and complete response rate for the various treatments were as follows: steroids (12% and 3%), methotrexate (55% and 21%), cytoxan (66% and 47%), cyclosporine (21% and 4%), respectively. Four out of 13 patients responded to splenectomy. Eleven out of 15 patients responded to cytoxan after methotrexate treatment had failed. The mean number of treatments was 3.4 (range, 1–7). There were 15 large granular lymphocyte leukemia-related deaths.

Conclusions

Patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia and chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis have similar clinical and biological features and responses to treatment. First-line therapy with cytoxan should be tested in a prospective trial.

### Acute hepatitis in three patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis taking interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [^1171vNCM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

sJIA is a systemic autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology frequently characterized by quotidian fever, rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pericarditis and arthritis. Transaminitis, defined as elevation of hepatic enzymes (specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) in the absence of other clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic injury, can be seen in patients with sJIA either in disease flares or due to hepatotoxic therapies like methotrexate. The mechanism by which patients develop sJIA is unknown, but it is felt to involve the interaction of infectious or inflammatory triggers with a genetic predisposition toward an enhanced proinflammatory response. Cytokines, particularly Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been implicated as important in disease pathogenesis and maintenance of inflammation. MAS is a complication of various rheumatologic and infectious diseases, and is often associated with sJIA. It is clinically characterized by cytopenias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability and liver and neurological involvement. Hemophagocytosis by activated macrophages is considered by most authors to be the most specific histopathological feature of MAS. Hemophagocytosis is generally accompanied by a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate including a predominance of CD8+ lymphocytes although some reports in adults have additionally identified biliary injury and vascular microthrombi as frequent findings. Mortality due to MAS has been estimated at 8–22%.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and systemic corticosteroids have historically been the mainstays of treatment for sJIA. There is evidence that methotrexate, cyclosporine, and etanercept are less effective in sJIA than in other forms of juvenile arthritis, and some disease-modifying drugs may be associated with development of MAS. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) (anakinra) and anti-IL-6 (MRA/tocilizumab) have shown clinical efficacy in small open-label studies in sJIA and adult Still's Disease. MAS, which leads to the greatest morbidity and mortality in patients with sJIA, is generally treated with supportive care, high dose intravenous corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. MAS may also be treated with etoposide or cyclosporine in a similar fashion to primary or familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a genetic disorder related to alterations in cytotoxic granular release that can be triggered by infections and neoplasms. MAS is a form of secondary HLH. There is a single case report of successful treatment of MAS with IL1RA in a patient with sJIA.

### Efficacy and tolerability of high-dose methotrexate in central nervous system positive or relapsed lymphoproliferative disease following liver transplant in children [^112A9B14]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Childhood post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a heterogeneous condition in which treatment varies, from the reduction of immunosuppression to moderately intensive chemotherapy. While low-dose chemotherapy/rituximab has been found to be effective, moderately intensive chemotherapy is required for patients who relapse, have classic non-Hodgkin lymphoma or have fulminant PTLD. Methotrexate (Mtx) is highly effective in lymphomas and crosses the blood-brain barrier. However, there are no data in the literature regarding its safety in post-liver transplant patients. We describe four cases of high-grade lymphomas (three diffuse large B cell and one T-cell lymphoblastic), post-liver transplant, for which chemotherapy including high-dose Mtx (HDMTX) was the treatment of choice. In total, 20 doses of HDMTX (1–5 g/m²) were given. The treatment was well tolerated and all four patients had a good response. One case of central nervous system (CNS) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was treated with HDMTX alone. We conclude that, in the absence of significant organ damage, HDMTX can safely be given to liver transplant patients, but should only be administered in specialist oncology units. Proof of effectiveness as a single agent in CNS lymphoma needs further studies.

### Low-dose methotrexate and serious adverse events among older adults with chronic kidney disease [^11154Q7c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We conducted the following post hoc analyses to assess the robustness of the main results and examine the potential for bias. We performed a survival analysis with a 90-day follow-up censoring on death (the proportional hazards assumption was met: methotrexate × follow-up time interaction term, P = 0.99). To assess the potential for indication bias, we reran the primary analysis using 2 different weighting methodsand we compared those who started methotrexate at 15 to 35 mg/wk with those who started methotrexate at 5 to less than 15mg/wk. To examine the potential for unmeasured confounding, we conducted (1) an E-value analysis to assess the extent of unmeasured confounding that would be required to negate the observed resultsand (2) an analysis using a negative-control outcome, defined as receipt of a hearing test during an outpatient or hospital visit. To account for surveillance bias, we compared the proportion of patients in each group who received a test for complete blood count or liver function or who received a chest radiograph in follow-up. Respectively, these tests may be used to assess myelosuppression, hepatoxic effects, and pneumotoxic effects (the components of the primary outcome). To control for potential surveillance bias, we repeated the primary analysis restricted to patients who received at least 1 of these tests in follow-up. We also repeated the primary analysis using (1) a more restrictive outcome definition (ie, only counting hospital admissions with the primary outcome, but not emergency department visits) and (2) a 30-day follow-up period.

### What is the future of targeted therapy in rheumatology: biologics or small molecules? [^112gbdYB]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Suitability for renal or hepatic impaired patients

Biologic therapies can be administered in patients with seriously impaired renal function. No differences have been found in the pharmacokinetics of etanercept between patients on hemodialysis and those with normal renal function. Obviously, these agents are not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and, consequently, they have been found to be safe and effective in these patients. In contrast, there are no such data available for novel small molecules, such as tofacitinib, in patients with severe renal failure. The dose of tofacitinib must be reduced in patients with moderate renal insufficiency according to the current FDA label. A proportion of patients with impaired renal function may not be appropriate candidates for Jak-inhibitor therapy.

Liver enzyme elevations (> 3× upper limit of normal) were more common with tofacitinib than with adalimumab therapy. Abnormal liver function is not a contraindication to anti-TNF or rituximab treatment, and hepatic enzyme elevation is rare, usually mild and transient during these therapies. In contrast, the dose of tocilizumab should be reduced in patients with moderate liver enzyme elevation, and the drug is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment according to the FDA label. It should be noted that similar restrictions apply to the use of the IL-6R blocker tocilizumab, as this agent also causes liver enzyme elevations in a significant proportion of patients.

Intravenous infusion ensures maximum compliance

It has been stressed that one potential advantage of small molecules is their oral administration route; however, arguments may also favor parenteral administration. Studies comparing intravenous and oral bisphosphonate anti-osteoporotic regimens have suggested a poorer compliance with once weekly oral administration as compared with a tri-monthly or yearly intravenous route, which may partly be responsible for the lower efficacy of the oral agents. A better compliance may be expected with injected therapies than with twice daily tablets in a certain proportion of patients. Apart from compliance, parenteral administration of methotrexate has been shown not only to cause fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects but also to have higher efficacy and a faster onset of action.

### Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene haplotypes affect toxicity during maintenance therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Japanese patients [^116kn3Jw]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of daily 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and low-dose weekly methotrexate (MTX) combination treatment and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) haplotypes on toxicity during maintenance therapy in Japanese childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We retrospectively analyzed the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and influence of haplotypes on toxicity in 73 patients. Patients with the MTHFR 677TT and 677CT + 1298AC were associated with severe liver toxicity (p = 0.014, odds ratio [OR] = 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27–11.46) and more rapid onset of liver toxicity (p = 0.010). Patients with MTHFR 677TT and 677CT + 1298AC were associated with lower frequency of 6-MP and MTX dose reduction due to leukopenia (p < 0.05). No difference was observed in average drug doses in the MTHFR genotypes. In conclusion, the MTHFR C677T and A1298C haplotypes might be useful for monitoring adverse effects in childhood ALL maintenance therapy in Japanese patients.

### A modern view of LGL leukemia [^115wyCbP]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a rare lymphoproliferative chronic disorder characterized by expansion of either T or natural killer (NK) cytotoxic cells. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus-induced aggressive NK-LGLL, chronic T-LGLL and NK-LGLL are indolent diseases affecting older patients with a median age of 66.5 years. LGLL is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders, most frequently rheumatoid arthritis. An auto-/alloantigen is tentatively implicated in disease initiation. Large granular lymphocyte expansion is then triggered by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-15, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1), and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted). This proinflammatory environment contributes to deregulation of proliferative and apoptotic pathways. After the initial description of the JAK-STAT pathway signaling activation in the majority of patients, recurrent STAT3 gain-of-function mutations have been reported. The JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in LGL pathogenesis by promoting survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. Several recent advances have been made toward understanding the molecular landscapes of T- and NK-LGLL, identifying multiple recurrent mutations affecting the epigenome, such as TET2 or KMT2D, and cross talk with the immune microenvironment, such as CCL22. Despite an indolent course, published series suggest that the majority of patients eventually need treatment. However, it is noteworthy that many patients may have a long-term observation period without ever requiring therapy. Treatments rely upon immunosuppressive drugs, namely cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. Recent advances have led to the development of targeted approaches, including JAK-STAT inhibitors, cytokine targeting, and hypomethylating agents, opening new developments in a still-incurable disease.

Liver function test (LFT) monitoring — patients on methotrexate without risk factors: monitor every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal lab results. For elevations < 3-fold the upper limit of normal, repeat in 2–4 wk. For elevations ≥ 3-fold the upper limit of normal, closely monitor, repeat 2–4 wk, and decrease dose as needed. For persistent elevation in liver enzymes during 12 mo period or a decline in the serum albumin below the normal range in a patient with normal nutritional status, a consultation with GI and/or liver biopsy should be considered.

### Cyclophosphamide induces durable molecular and clinical responses in patients with relapsed T-LGL leukemia [^113MQLUQ]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes with a terminal effectory memory phenotype (CD3 + /CD8 + /CD5dim/CD57 + /CD62L/CD45RA + /CD45RO −) that can result in severe cytopenias, including neutropenia, anemia, and pancytopenia/bone marrow failure in severe cases. The pathogenesis of T-LGLL is thought to be mediated by increased circulating interleukin-15, and subsequent upregulation of the STAT3 pathway, leading to dysregulation of apoptosis and resultant cellular proliferation and marrow damage. The management of T-LGLL therefore is immune-suppressive therapy, with methotrexate (MTX), cyclophosphamide (Cy), and cyclosporine serving as the standard frontline agents. MTX is the standard frontline therapy based off the prospective ECOG5998 (E5998) study but overall response rate (ORR) was modest at 38%. An initial early report with frontline Cy demonstrated a response rate of 63% in 10/16 patients, including 6 complete response (CR), though at that time, CR was defined as hematologic CR, and response criteria differed from current E5998 criteria. For patients that fail frontline MTX, oral Cy, with a target dose of 100 mg/day is the standard approach. Data from the ECOG5998 trial suggested an increased ORR with Cy in the second-line setting, with 21% CR, and retrospective data from the French cohort study suggested improved response rate, with 63% CR, when Cy was used second line. More intriguingly, anecdotal evidence suggests that because of its alkylating effects, Cy may eradicate the T-LGLL clone, which has not been observed with immune-suppressive-based strategies. However, the degree to which a complete molecular remission (CMR) can be attained, and the lengths of these remissions with Cy remains unknown.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that is antiproliferative and immunosuppressive: it impairs DNA synthesis (via inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase), decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Methotrexate is mainly used to treat Crohn's disease; the use of methotrexate in patients with ulcerative colitis is controversial. A recent study of 179 patients with active ulcerative colitis found that 91 patients (51%) achieved steroid-free response with methotrexate induction therapy; however, in the 84 patients who then received maintenance therapy, methotrexate was not superior to placebo in the prevention of relapse. Adverse events in patients receiving methotrexate treatment include myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, both of which are dose-dependent.

Despite this, there is a lack of data available evaluating methotrexate therapy in IBD, and there are no societal recommendations for monitoring hepatotoxicity. The authors recommend complete blood count and liver function tests before, and 1 month after, initiation of methotrexate. If liver function test results are elevated, then the authors recommend reducing the methotrexate dose. In patients with normal test results remaining on methotrexate, the authors recommend repeating these tests every 2 to 4 months. Simultaneous treatment with folic acid can reduce the adverse events associated with methotrexate treatment, and is advisable. Several polymorphisms in enzymes involved in the metabolism of folic acid are associated with the toxicity of methotrexate, though study results are conflicting.

Biologic Agents

Anti-TNF Agents

The introduction of biologic agents has greatly improved the management of IBD. However, primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response are significant clinical problems, particularly with anti-TNF agents. In 2011, Ben-Horin and Chowersreviewed the literature on the loss of response to anti-TNF agents in Crohn's disease. They found that 23% to 46% of patients who initially responded to anti-TNF agents had experienced the secondary loss of response based on the need for dose intensification by 12 months of therapy. Several factors can cause nonresponse or loss of response, including patient characteristics such as increased body mass index, female sex, increased age, and severely active IBD leading to high inflammatory burden and fecal loss of the drug. Parenteral administration of large molecule biologic agents can lead to the development of ADAs (immunogenicity) that reduce serum active-drug concentrations, and this is the main cause of loss of response to anti-TNF agents.–In addition to the use of thiopurines in combination with biologic agents to reduce immunogenicity, other immunosuppressants, mainly methotrexate, can be of similar use.

### Methotrexate sodium (methotrexate) [^1116bvMn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Serious Infections

Patients treated with methotrexate are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral infections including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation, tuberculosis primary infection or reactivation, and disseminated Herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Methotrexate for Injection. Withhold or discontinue Methotrexate for Injection in patients who develop serious infections.

5.6	Renal Toxicity

Methotrexate can cause renal toxicity including irreversible acute renal failure. Monitor renal function and withhold or discontinue methotrexate as needed for severe renal toxicity.

For patients receiving high-dose regimens, follow recommendations to decrease the risk of renal injury and mitigate renal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk for methotrexate toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Consider administration of glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (> 1 micromole per liter) and delayed clearance due to impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.7	Hepatotoxicity

Methotrexate can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

In patients with psoriasis, fibrosis or cirrhosis may occur in the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver function tests. In patients with psoriasis, the risk of hepatotoxicity appears to increase with total cumulative dose and generally occurs after receipt of a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g or more.

The safety of Methotrexate for Injection in patients with liver disease is unknown. Avoid use of Methotrexate for Injection in patients with chronic liver disease, unless benefits clearly outweigh the risks. The risk of hepatotoxicity is increased with heavy alcohol consumption.

Assess liver function prior to initiating Methotrexate for Injection and monitor liver function tests during treatment. Withhold or discontinue Methotrexate for Injection as appropriate.

### Severe methotrexate toxicity in elderly patients under diuretics [^111WNCTz]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over four decades, low-dose methotrexate (MTX) has been the number one treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), also playing a major role in the therapy of patients with psoriatic arthritis, connective tissue diseasesand vasculitides, though off-label for the latter two. In essence, the only common rheumatic disease clearly not improving under MTX is axial spondylarthritis, be it ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis.

The success of MTX is not only based on its efficacy, but also on its long-established excellent long-term safety profile.

The results of a large MTX Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial with 2391 MTX patients recently backed that serious adverse events under MTX are uncommon.

Several serious issues originally discussed for MTX, such as lymphoma or lung fibrosis, have since been found to be caused by the underlying disease, not the drug itself. Liver cirrhosis, another potential MTX side effect, is avoided if liver enzymes are monitored. A slightly increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, presumably linked to MTX-induced ultraviolet (UV) light sensitivity, is the only remaining tumour risk.

While some nausea and slight elevations of liver enzymes are fairly frequent, the acute life-threatening adverse events, namely MTX pneumonitis and agranulocytosis or pancytopenia, are rare events.MTX pneumonitis usually occurs early in therapy and is mostly reversible if diagnosed in time and managed correctly. As with essentially all other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, agranulocytosis is found rarely and rather early in the treatment course.

In contrast, severe bone marrow depression due to true MTX toxicity, usually accompanied by mucositis, can occur at any time under MTX therapy and is often critical. Such toxicity is usually either caused by accidental overdosing, often due to inadvertent daily administration of the weekly MTX dose, or by a decline in renal function, usually acute renal failure, leading to the accumulation of MTX, because it is mostly eliminated via the kidneys.

There is limited information on the risk profile for MTX toxicity of these patients. We therefore analysed the available data of all 12 patients admitted to our rheumatology inpatient ward for severe MTX toxicity since 2011 and compared them with 400 rheumatology outpatients of similar age, but without severe MTX toxicity.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment in this clinical setting?
A. Phototherapy
B. Oral prednisone
C. Topical triamcinolone
D. Doxycycline
E. Methotrexate

Answers:

A. Phototherapy – Incorrect. The severe presentation with systemic symptoms would make phototherapy inappropriate.
B. Oral prednisone – Correct. Data regarding MHD treatment is limited, although commonly accepted first-line treatments include corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, and phototherapy. Oral prednisone is appropriate, given its rapid onset of action.
C. Topical triamcinolone – Incorrect. For the widespread and ulcerative lesions, recommending topical therapies alone would not be appropriate.
D. Doxycycline – Incorrect. Although doxycycline is anti-inflammatory agent, the delayed onset of action would not be appropriate in this case.
E. Methotrexate – Incorrect. Similar to doxycycline, methotrexate would take longer to go into full effect and potentially lead to increased morbidity.

Question 3: The decision was made to add on the steroid-sparing agent, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); which of the following labs must be checked in this patient before starting MMF?
A. Peripheral blood flow cytometry
B. Liver tests
C. Urinalysis
D. Complete blood count
Ε. β-human chorionic gonadotropin

Answers:

A. Peripheral blood flow cytometry – Incorrect. Peripheral blood flow cytometry would be checked if there is a concern for systemic lymphoma. MMF has been associated with an increased risk of lymphoma and skin malignancies, but this is irrelevant to this case.
B. Liver tests – Incorrect. MMF may cause minor, temporary elevations in liver enzymes but does not commonly exert liver toxicity in immunocompetent patients. However, MMF may have hepatotoxic effects on patients with a history of solid organ transplants.
C. Urinalysis – Incorrect. MMF can cause urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency, and dysuria; MMF does not cause nephrotoxicity.
D. Complete blood count – Incorrect. MMF can cause dose-dependent, reversible neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and, on rare occasions, agranulocytosis.
Ε. β-human chorionic gonadotropin – Correct. MMF is a teratogen and is associated with first-trimester loss, facial abnormalities, and anomalies of the distal limbs and other visceral organs.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^111c3MM5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

MTX may cause cirrhosis and lung fibrosis, but these are extremely rare and have been reported only in adults with other comorbidities. In the literature there are also few reports of lymphoma in children treated with MTX, but it has not been possible to determine whether these observations were merely coincidental, were causally linked to MTX, or were related to the underlying disease process. The issue of whether MTX treatment is an independent risk factor for various malignancies is controversial and remains unresolved. Long-term prospective cohort studies are needed to define the risk of hematological or other malignancies in MTX-treated patients.

Nodulosis is a rare MTX adverse event that has been described in JIA (accelerated nodulosis in two teenagers with rheumatoid factor [RF]-positive juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and one 3-year-old girl with systemic-onset disease). The nodules developed within six months after the initiation of MTX treatment and regressed after discontinuing therapy, or were successfully treated with hydroxychloroquine or colchicine.

Regarding laboratory monitoring in patients with JIA, there is only one guideline by Ortiz-Alvarez et al. derived from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring MTX toxicity in adults. They suggest a complete and differential blood count, liver function tests and albumin and serum creatinine levels every 4–8 week initially, and then every 12–16 week, unless risk factors are present. Other authors also recommended hepatitis and varicella-zoster virus serology and tuberculin test before starting therapy. MTX is contraindicated in children with reduced renal function.

Bulatović et al. designed and validated the MTX Intolerance Severity Score (MISS) questionnaire to identify patients with MTX intolerance. The items investigated were: abdominal signs and symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting) and behavioral symptoms (restless, crying, irritability, and refusal of MTX) before and after the administration of MTX. A cut-off score of 6 yielded the best sensitivity (88%) and specificity (80%). They found there was no difference in efficacy between the various routes of MTX administration. However, half of the 297 patients were MTX-intolerant. This was especially the case in patients who received parenteral MTX, who experienced more anticipatory behavioral symptoms prior to administration, compared to patients receiving oral MTX. However, the difference in the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was not great.

### Suggested guidelines for patient monitoring: hepatic and hematologic toxicity attributable to systemic dermatologic drugs [^114WmLTz]. Dermatologic Clinics (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatic and hematologic toxicity are among the most fearful adverse effects that occasionally occur as a result of systemic drugs in the dermatologist's therapeutic armamentarium. Drugs of greatest interest concerning hepatic toxicity include methotrexate, azathioprine, dapsone, and acitretin. Somewhat overlapping are drugs that have important hematologic toxicities, including methotrexate, azathioprine, dapsone, sulfonamides, cyclophosphamide, and chlorambucil. Laboratory tests most commonly used include (1) hepatic monitoring: transaminases (AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT) and the ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, and (2) hematologic monitoring: CBC with diff and platelets along with occasional use of the reticulocyte count. Important principles and specific guidelines for monitoring by drug group are highlighted.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^1118tzau]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression and aplastic anemia have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic:

Otrexup has the potential for acute (elevated transaminases) and chronic (fibrosis and cirrhosis) hepatotoxicity. Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal; it generally has occurred after prolonged use (generally two years or more) and after a total dose of at least 1.5 grams. In studies in psoriatic patients, hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism, obesity, diabetes and advanced age. An accurate incidence rate has not been determined; the rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known. Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired hepatic function.

In psoriasis, liver function tests, including serum albumin, should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis or cirrhosis. These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy. The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy (2 to 4 months), 2) a total cumulative dose of 1.5 grams, and 3) after each additional 1.0 to 1.5 grams. Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months.

### Severe multiorgan toxicity after first dose of capizzi methotrexate in a young adult patient with acute lymphocytic leukaemia [^116wwYET]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a versatile antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent. We report a case of a young adult on the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B 10403 treatment protocol for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She has previously completed the induction and consolidation phases with good tolerance then started on Capizzi methotrexate during the interim maintenance phase. Few days after receiving one intermediate dose of methotrexate, she developed severe multiorgan toxicities including pancytopaenia and several dermatologic toxicities. The patient underwent extensive diagnostic workup, with all results negative, pointing eventually towards severe methotrexate toxicity. This case highlights the broad spectrum of toxicities that can occur even with low doses of methotrexate. Capizzi methotrexate therapy implies no leucovorin therapy, hence putting patients at risk for multiorgan toxicity. Our experience reinforces the importance of close monitoring for patients receiving methotrexate, regardless of dose, and the prompt administration of high-dose leucovorin once toxicity suspected.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^115tTXEe]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: SEVERE TOXIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY AND DEATH

Rasuvo should be used only by physicians whose knowledge and experience include the use of antimetabolite therapy. Because of the possibility of serious toxic reactions (which can be fatal), Rasuvo should be used only in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with severe, recalcitrant, disabling disease which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy. Deaths have been reported with the use of methotrexate in the treatment of malignancy, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Patients should be closely monitored for bone marrow, liver, lung, skin, and kidney toxicities. Patients should be informed by their physician of the risks involved and be under a physician's care throughout therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity, including fetal death. Use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with Rasuvo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Contraindications (4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].
Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal functions, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity, and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Rasuvo administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia, and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate (usually in high dosage) along with some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions(7.1)].
Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity, fibrosis and cirrhosis, but generally only after prolonged use. Acutely, liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen. These are usually transient and asymptomatic, and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease. Liver biopsy after sustained use often shows histologic changes, and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported; these latter lesions may not be preceded by symptoms or abnormal liver function tests in the psoriasis population. For this reason, periodic liver biopsies are usually recommended for psoriatic patients who are under long-term treatment. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Methotrexate-induced lung disease, including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis, is a potentially dangerous lesion, which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses. It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported. Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonproductive cough) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy: otherwise, hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Malignant lymphomas, which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate, may occur in patients receiving low-dose methotrexate and, thus, may not require cytotoxic treatment. Discontinue Rasuvo first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce "tumor lysis syndrome" in patients with rapidly growing tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
Severe, occasionally fatal, skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate. Reactions have occurred within days of oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intrathecal methotrexate administration. Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Potentially fatal opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, may occur with methotrexate therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Role of liver function tests in detecting methotrexate-induced liver damage in sarcoidosis… [^112j4dNJ]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

We found a significant difference between groups for levels of alkaline phosphatase and asparate aminotransferase at the time of starting methotrexate therapy. This finding was also true for the liver function tests performed at the time of the biopsy. The highest values were for those whose biopsy findings showed sarcoidosis. Conclusions Toxic reactions to methotrexate eventually occurred in more than 10% of patients with sarcoidosis treated for more than 2 years with methotrexate. Because of hepatic involvement owing to sarcoidosis, results of serial liver function tests were not useful in determining which patients would have this reaction to methotrexate. The biopsy results were read by 2 experienced hepatopathologists. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made when noncaseating granulomas were identified in the liver tissue.

Table 2 summarizes the results of liver function tests as negative, sarcoidosis, methotrexate toxicity, or hepatitis C, at the time of starting or restarting methotrexate therapy. The same measurements were recorded at the time of each biopsy. The initial alkaline phosphatase level was higher in the sarcoidosis and hepatitis C groups than in the other groups. We compared the grade of toxic effects of methotrexate with the liver function test results and the number of times the AST level was elevated. This finding is summarized in Table 3. The alkaline phosphatase level at the time of the biopsy and the number of times that the AST level was elevated in the year before the biopsy correlated with the severity of the toxic effect, using the Roenigk score. The other variables, including the cumulative dose of methotrexate and the patient's weight at the time of biopsy, were not related to the severity of toxicity.

We performed 100 liver biopsies on patients who were treated with methotrexate for 2 to 8 years. No patient had severe liver disease as a result of methotrexate therapy. However, we identified 14 patients in whom we believed the drug should be discontinued because of a toxic reaction to methotrexate. We found no clinically useful difference between the liver function test results in the methotrexate toxicity and those of the other groups. We believe that liver biopsy remains an important part of screening for toxic reactions to methotrexate in patients with sarcoidosis.

### Liver disease associated with methotrexate treatment of psoriatic patients… [^111NxT96]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Three patients developed hepatic toxicity associated with antifolate treatment of psoriasis. Two of the three patients had abnormal liver biopsies in spite of reversion to normal of liver function test results. The problem of methotrexate toxicity in psoriatic patients is discussed with special reference to hepatic toxicity. Hepatic histologic abnormalities may be present after methotrexate has been discontinued and results of liver function tests have reverted to normal. Patients who have discontinued methotrexate because of abnormal liver function tests should undergo a liver biopsy before the drug is restarted even if results of liver function tests have reverted to normal. It is not known if severe histologic abnormalities might be present when liver function test results remain normal during the course of treatment. This ultimately will be determined from prospective studies. Dubin HV, Harrell ER. Liver Disease Associated With Methotrexate Treatment of Psoriatic Patients.
