## Question

Diagnosis of fibromyalgia in primary care

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing fibromyalgia in primary care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical syndrome and why diagnosis is challenging. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria evolution and which tools are most practical in primary care. Next, I will review a stepwise diagnostic approach, including screening, exclusion of other conditions, and confirmation. After that, I need to check the role of laboratory testing and when to refer. Finally, I will consider documentation, follow-up, and special populations, and I will synthesize a concise algorithm with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and validation studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its diagnostic challenge. Fibromyalgia is a chronic centralized pain syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain persisting at least 3 months, accompanied by fatigue, unrefreshed sleep, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances, with no explanatory structural or inflammatory disease, and it is common in primary care yet frequently underrecognized or mislabeled as regional pain syndromes [^24fd937c] [^0bf57ea8] [^474ea801].

> Wait, let me verify the evolution of diagnostic criteria because this shapes primary care practice. The 1990 ACR criteria required chronic widespread pain plus at least 11 of 18 tender points, which proved impractical in primary care and missed a substantial fraction of patients with prominent symptom clusters; the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria replaced tender points with the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), and the 2011 modification allowed patient self-report of somatic symptoms, enabling primary care use; the 2016 revision retained WPI and SSS thresholds and emphasized symptom persistence for at least 3 months and exclusion of other explanatory disorders [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57] [^9e281cf1].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds and how to apply them. The 2010/2016 ACR criteria diagnose fibromyalgia when symptoms persist at least 3 months and either WPI is at least 7 with SSS at least 5, or WPI is 3–6 with SSS at least 9, with no other disorder explaining the pain; the modified 2010/2011 instrument that sums WPI and SSS has been validated with high sensitivity and specificity using a cutoff of 12–13, supporting its use as a brief, self-administered tool in primary care [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57] [^b302bced].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening tools. I initially thought the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) was the most validated for primary care, but wait, I should double-check its performance and context. FiRST shows good sensitivity and specificity in some studies, yet many validations occurred in specialty settings; by contrast, the modified ACR 2010/2011 questionnaire has direct primary care validation with sensitivity around 90% and specificity around 89–92%, making it the more defensible first-line instrument in general practice, while FiRST can still be considered when a very brief screen is needed [^7936e023] [^b302bced] [^f7055a7e].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise diagnostic approach. Let me think about a three-step process: screen for chronic widespread pain and core fibromyalgia symptoms; exclude other conditions that could explain the pain; and confirm the diagnosis using validated criteria and a biopsychosocial assessment, documenting severity and functional impact to guide management [^24fd937c] [^bc56f509] [^23ef486a].

> I will now examine screening and symptom characterization. In patients with diffuse pain lasting at least 3 months, I should assess the WPI by counting painful regions and rate symptom severity for fatigue, unrefreshed sleep, and cognitive symptoms; I also need to ask about mood, functional impairment, and comorbid pain syndromes such as IBS, headache, and regional pain, because these are common and shape prognosis and treatment planning [^4ad2eb6f] [^24fd937c] [^81b83e3e].

> But wait, what if the pain is explained by another condition? I need to ensure a careful differential. I should screen for inflammatory arthritis, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, hepatitis C, and other systemic or regional diseases based on history and exam; limited labs such as CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, and CK are reasonable when clinically indicated, and I should avoid routine extensive panels or imaging unless red flags or atypical features emerge, because fibromyalgia is a positive clinical diagnosis rather than a diagnosis of exclusion [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3] [^8f162cf1].

> Let me verify how to confirm the diagnosis. If the modified ACR 2010/2011 criteria are met and no other condition better explains the symptoms, I can confidently diagnose fibromyalgia; if scores are borderline or symptoms are atypical, I should reconsider the differential, monitor over time, and reassess. Importantly, I should communicate the diagnosis clearly, explain that fibromyalgia is a real, chronic pain syndrome with centralized pain processing, and set expectations for a multimodal, self-management–focused plan [^4ad2eb6f] [^24fd937c] [^8f162cf1].

> I should confirm the role of laboratory testing and avoid overtesting. No test confirms fibromyalgia, so I should reserve labs for suspected alternative diagnoses; a basic screen of CBC, ESR or CRP, TSH, and CK is reasonable when the history or exam suggests systemic disease, and I should avoid repeated testing once the diagnosis is established unless new symptoms arise, to prevent iatrogenic harm and unnecessary costs [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3] [^5ebea944].

> Hold on, I should verify when to refer. Routine rheumatology referral solely to confirm fibromyalgia is not recommended; referral is appropriate when the diagnosis is uncertain after appropriate evaluation, when red flags suggest inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease, or when management is refractory despite optimized primary care. Centralized triage models can reduce unnecessary specialty visits and costs while catching missed inflammatory disease [^5ebea944] [^26b6c795] [^127d2f83].

> Next, I should review documentation and follow-up. I need to record the diagnosis, severity using WPI and SSS, functional status, and comorbidities; I should schedule follow-up to reassess symptoms, adherence, and response, and I should avoid repeatedly relabeling or ordering new tests unless the clinical picture changes, because this can undermine patient trust and increase utilization without benefit [^5ebea944] [^23ef486a].

> Let me consider special populations. In adolescents and young adults, fibromyalgia is less common but does occur; the same clinical principles apply, with emphasis on early multidisciplinary rehabilitation and psychosocial support. In older adults, I should be cautious not to attribute all diffuse pain to fibromyalgia without evaluating for common comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and metabolic or endocrine disorders that may coexist or mimic fibromyalgia [^587918f3] [^24fd937c].

> I should double-check the economic and patient-centered rationale for early, accurate diagnosis. Early recognition of fibromyalgia and implementation of guideline-concordant care can reduce unnecessary testing, specialist visits, and overall healthcare costs, and it aligns with patient preferences for validation, education, and coordinated care; conversely, delays and misdiagnosis perpetuate frustration, disability, and high utilization [^3fcddd73] [^a0dcc08d] [^b6207f06].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise algorithm. Suspect fibromyalgia in patients with diffuse pain lasting at least 3 months plus fatigue, sleep disturbance, or cognitive symptoms; screen with the modified ACR 2010/2011 questionnaire and calculate WPI and SSS; exclude other explanatory conditions with targeted history, exam, and limited labs as indicated; confirm fibromyalgia if criteria are met and no better explanation exists; document severity and comorbidities; educate the patient and initiate a multimodal plan; and reserve specialty referral for diagnostic uncertainty or refractory disease, avoiding routine repeat testing once the diagnosis is established [^24fd937c] [^4ad2eb6f] [^5ebea944].

---

Fibromyalgia is diagnosed in primary care using a **clinical assessment** of chronic widespread pain (≥ 3 months) with multisystem symptoms (fatigue, sleep, cognitive, mood) and no better explanation [^24fd937c] [^4ad2eb6f]. The **2016 ACR criteria** (WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9) are validated for primary care and do not require a tender-point exam [^4ad2eb6f] [^9e281cf1]. Use brief screening tools (e.g. FiRST) to flag suspected cases, then confirm with the ACR criteria and a focused history/exam to exclude other causes [^7936e023] [^b302bced]. Routine labs are not diagnostic; obtain CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, and CK only when indicated to rule out mimics [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3]. Early, accurate diagnosis reduces unnecessary testing and improves outcomes [^3fcddd73] [^a0dcc08d].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features

The **2016 ACR criteria** are the current standard for diagnosing fibromyalgia in primary care [^notfound]. They comprise two main components:

- **Widespread Pain Index (WPI)**: Number of painful body regions (0–19).
- **Symptom Severity Scale (SSS)**: Severity of fatigue, cognitive symptoms, and waking unrefreshed (0–12).

A diagnosis requires **WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5**, or **WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9**, with symptoms present for at least 3 months and no other disorder explaining the pain [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57].

Common **clinical features** include:

- Chronic widespread pain (axial plus upper and lower limb pain)
- Fatigue and sleep disturbances
- Cognitive dysfunction ("fibro fog")
- Mood disturbances (anxiety, depression)
- Somatic symptoms (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, headaches)

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach in primary care

A **stepwise approach** is recommended for diagnosing fibromyalgia in primary care:

| **Step** | **Action** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical suspicion | Identify patients with chronic widespread pain (≥ 3 months) and multisystem symptoms (fatigue, sleep, cognitive, mood) [^24fd937c] [^6f1f9d96] |
| 2 | Screening tools | Use brief tools (e.g. FiRST) to identify suspected fibromyalgia cases [^7936e023] [^f7055a7e] |
| 3 | Confirmatory assessment | Apply 2016 ACR criteria (WPI and SSS) [^4ad2eb6f] [^9e281cf1] |
| 4 | Exclude other conditions | Perform focused history, physical exam, and limited labs (CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, CK) when indicated to rule out mimics [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3] |
| 5 | Document diagnosis | Record the diagnosis and educate the patient about fibromyalgia [^5ebea944] [^8f162cf1] |

---

## Role of laboratory and imaging studies

Laboratory and imaging studies are **not diagnostic** for fibromyalgia but are used to exclude other conditions. Routine testing is not recommended; obtain limited labs only when clinically indicated:

- **CBC**: Rule out anemia or infection.
- **ESR/CRP**: Screen for inflammatory disease.
- **TSH**: Evaluate thyroid dysfunction.
- **CK**: Assess for myopathy.

Imaging (e.g. X-rays, MRI) is **not routinely indicated** unless red flags or atypical features suggest another diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Common comorbidities and differential diagnosis

Fibromyalgia often coexists with other conditions, and it is essential to identify and manage them:

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD.
- **Functional somatic syndromes**: Irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder.
- **Rheumatologic conditions**: Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.

The **differential diagnosis** includes:

- **Inflammatory arthritis**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus.
- **Endocrine disorders**: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency.
- **Neurologic disorders**: Multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy.
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome**: Persistent fatigue with cognitive impairment.

---

## Benefits of early and accurate diagnosis

Early and accurate diagnosis of fibromyalgia in primary care offers several benefits:

- **Reduced healthcare utilization**: Fewer unnecessary tests, specialist referrals, and emergency visits [^3fcddd73] [^a0dcc08d].
- **Improved patient outcomes**: Better symptom control, function, and quality of life [^23b4c58e] [^8f162cf1].
- **Enhanced patient satisfaction**: Validation of symptoms and improved patient-provider relationship [^b6207f06] [^7a2fc408].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Despite clear criteria, diagnosing fibromyalgia in primary care remains challenging:

- **Lack of awareness**: Limited knowledge of diagnostic criteria among primary care providers [^7a2fc408] [^474ea801].
- **Stigma**: Patients may be perceived as malingering or having psychological issues [^b6207f06] [^45e27feb].
- **Overlap with other conditions**: Symptom overlap complicates diagnosis and leads to misdiagnosis [^ba0c8212] [^383ad52c].

---

## Practical recommendations

To improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in primary care:

- **Education**: Train primary care providers on fibromyalgia criteria and diagnostic approach [^7d92a974] [^8f162cf1].
- **Screening tools**: Implement brief screening tools (e.g. FiRST) in routine practice [^7936e023] [^f7055a7e].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinate care with mental health, physical therapy, and pain specialists [^25c16c39] [^ea56218b].
- **Patient education**: Provide resources and support groups to improve patient understanding and self-management [^8f162cf1] [^ea56218b].

---

Fibromyalgia in primary care is diagnosed using a **clinical assessment** of chronic widespread pain with multisystem symptoms, confirmed by the 2016 ACR criteria and exclusion of other causes. Early, accurate diagnosis reduces unnecessary testing and improves outcomes, but challenges remain, including limited provider awareness and symptom overlap with other conditions.

### Canadian Pain Society and Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^8f162cf1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Methods

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient followup were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and following review were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

Results

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with a pivotal symptom of body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and not requiring specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigation may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should be reduction of symptoms, but also improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested, and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. Outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern and any culture of disablement should be discouraged.

Conclusion

These guidelines should provide the health community with reassurance for the global care of patients with FM with the aim of improving patient outcome by reducing symptoms and maintaining function.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^1c30d85c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Management of fibromyalgia in primary care [^0c13613c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Most treatments for patients with fibromyalgia can be provided in primary care practices. When clinicians, therapists, and community resources work together, a range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments can be tailored to provide effective long-term care. Treatments found to be effective for various fibromyalgia symptoms, such as pain and problems with sleep or mood, include antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Additionally, other effective strategies include patient education, light exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Development and testing of the fibromyalgia diagnostic screen for primary care [^433868f6]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Screen was developed for use by primary care clinicians to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of fibromyalgia, a disorder that predominantly affects women.

Methods

The screen was designed to have a patient-completed questionnaire and a clinician-completed section, which included a brief physical examination pertinent to the differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The items in the questionnaire were based on patient focus groups and clinician and patient Delphi exercises, which resulted in a ranking of the most common and troublesome fibromyalgia symptoms. One hundred new chronic pain patients (pain > 30 days) and their primary care physicians completed the screen. The patients were grouped as fibromyalgia or nonfibromyalgia by an independent fibromyalgia specialist, who was blind to screen responses. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of fibromyalgia as a function of physician-reported and patient-reported variables. Best subset regression was used to identify a subset of symptoms that were summed to form a single measure. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was then used to select thresholds for continuous variables. The symptom and clinical variables were combined to create candidate prediction rules that were compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity to select the best criterion.

Results

Two final models were selected based on overall accuracy in predicting fibromyalgia: one used the patient-reported questionnaire only, and the other added a subset of the physical examination items to this patient questionnaire.

Conclusion

A patient-reported questionnaire with or without a brief physical examination may improve identification of fibromyalgia patients in primary care settings.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management for the primary healthcare provider [^0136f7bf]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain affecting 2% of the general population, with an increased frequency in women. Clinical diagnosis relies on history and research-supported tender point criteria. As in other chronic pain syndromes, a multidimensional approach optimizes treatment response. Empirical data and consensus support the use of nonpharmacological modalities, such as education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy, in the management of fibromyalgia. Evidence-supported pharmacological interventions include tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alpha-2-delta ligands, and other serotonergic-noradrenergic analgesic agents, such as tramadol. This paper offers the primary healthcare provider a systematic approach to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and management strategies based on available evidence, consensus, and empirical data.

### 2012 Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome: executive summary [^25c16c39]. Pain Research & Management (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for fibromyalgia, more specifically with respect to general principles, NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend to manage patients with FM in the primary care setting. Augment this care by providing access to a multidisciplinary team where feasible.

### A roadmap for the management of fibromyalgia [^ea56218b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The patient is at the center of the treatment roadmap for fibromyalgia, which extends beyond the primary care physician to include multidisciplinary experts and community resources. The physician must create a framework in which a full treatment strategy can be articulated with the input of the patient. Physicians need to help patients with fibromyalgia educate themselves about their illness and its treatment and understand that treatment success depends on patients' engagement with all components of the treatment roadmap.

### Fibromyalgia: recognition and management in the primary care office [^81b83e3e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition manifested by chronic generalized pain, fatigue, disordered sleep, and cognitive difficulties, persistent for at least 3 months. Other common complaints/conditions include symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, headaches, intermittent paresthesias, and various mood disorders. Women are more commonly affected than men. The treatment approach should be individualized and focused on associated mood disorders, sleep, exercise, correction of maladaptive responses to pain, and coping with stress.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^23ef486a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Perform a biopsychosocial assessment and address expectations

Where there is an identifiable cause of chronic pain (eg, diabetes, fibromyalgia), management should proceed as per the current available treatment guidelines with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. However, after appropriate investigations, in patients in whom the cause of chronic pain cannot be determined, repeated radiological and other special investigations are rarely helpful and should be avoided.

Management is guided by careful assessment for the presence of risk factors for chronic pain, psychosocial history, assessment of pain severity and the degree of functional impairment. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is recommended as a simple tool to measure pain intensity and physical and psychosocial components of pain.

Psychosocial and behavioral factors (Box 2) may complicate diagnosis, management and the course of chronic pain, and it is necessary to conduct a careful assessment for these using simple questions (Box 4) and/or self-rating scales (eg, Beck’s Depression Inventory). Detailed assessment tools are time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It is important to point out that many of these psychosocial factors are normal psychological processes and/or responses to adversity. However, in some patients they can influence the subjective experience of pain and directly modulate pain pathways leading to maladaptive coping and persistent pain that is apparently non-responsive to treatment.Management in the primary care setting is often sufficient, but if necessary patients should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional.

Box 4 
Helpful brief screening questions to identify risk factors for chronic pain, disability and delayed return to work

It is important to explain to patients and their family/caregivers that chronic pain is multifactorial and does not necessarily indicate harm, and also to set realistic expectations in terms of goals of treatment. In chronic pain, complete pain relief is rarely achieved and aims of therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and return to work and physical activity. A clinically meaningful improvement is at least a 30% reduction in pain (or ≥2 points on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) and/or 30% improvement in function.Other important outcomes include improvement in sleep and mood, reduced analgesic consumption and reduced health care consultations.

Work absenteeism is associated with low self-esteem, depression, loss of skills, delayed recovery, and in some patients, personal re-identification as a “disabled person”. Because the likelihood of returning to work diminishes with increasing duration of absence, it is important to encourage patients who are still working to continue to do so. Those who are off work should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^127d2f83]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is estimated to affect one in five adults worldwide.It is associated with considerable disability and a significant impact on daily activities and quality of life.Fibromyalgia, a primary chronic pain disorder, is diagnosed on the basis of a history of widespread pain and severity of somatic symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, cognitive symptoms, headaches, depression and pain or cramps in the lower abdomen.The prevalence of fibromyalgia has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5.0%, with females being nine times more likely to develop the syndrome than males.

Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, and has been estimated to be associated with $7.2 billion in annual direct costs in Canada.Fibromyalgia also has a substantial economic impact, accounting for $C2298–$C3804 per patient in annual direct costs and weeks worth of annual employment and household productivity losses.The annual healthcare costs of patients with fibromyalgia have been estimated to be $C493 higher than age, sex and geographically matched controls.

The most recent 2012 Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Fibromyalgia Syndrome recommend that the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia be concentrated in the primary care setting.Although a majority of primary care providers (PCPs) (63%) manage patients with fibromyalgia after diagnosis, 37% of PCPs refer patients with fibromyalgia to a specialist, typically a rheumatologist, for diagnosis.

Rheumatologists are central to the treatment and management of inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune conditions.However, the number of patients with inflammatory arthritis has doubled between 1996 and 2010, and is expected to double again over the next 30 years, with no proportional increase in the number of practising rheumatologists.In addition, delayed access to rheumatologists has been extensively recognised as a barrier to providing adequate care for rheumatological diseases, particularly with inflammatory arthritis in which early intervention improves clinical outcomes.With the rising population-based disease burden, identified shortage of rheumatologists in Canada and wait times exceeding target benchmarks, there is an urgent need for a strategic approach to the planning and delivery of rheumatology care.

### Evaluating and diagnosing fibromyalgia and comorbid psychiatric disorders [^0cc43ba1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling chronic pain syndrome that is often accompanied by other chronic pain and/or psychiatric comorbidities, which impact fibromyalgia course and outcome. Although a primary care provider will likely take the lead in caring for patients with fibromyalgia, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may play a role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of fibromyalgia. Psychiatrists' familiarity with many of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments that are currently being used for fibromyalgia make them valuable partners in the multidisciplinary team of clinicians addressing fibromyalgia and its comorbidities. In this activity, experts on fibromyalgia discuss the nature of the syndrome and its diagnosis and evaluation.

### Office management of fibromyalgia [^7d92a974]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The office management of fibromyalgia (FM) is best determined by two variables: (1) the severity and complexity of each patient's symptoms, and (2) the specialization and interest of the treating physician. Because there are 6 to 10 million Americans with FM, most patient visits will be to the primary care physician. Rheumatologists, physiatrists, and other musculoskeletal specialists must work with primary care physicians to foster the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of FM. Primary care physicians are faced with enormous challenges in caring for patients with chronic pain disorders like FM. Our managed health care system insists that patient encounters be brief. Specialty referrals are often discouraged. There is little if any reimbursement for patient education. FM treatment is labor-intensive. Therefore, optimal planning and use of precious office time and resources are most important. Rheumatologists should train our primary care colleagues to recognize FM. Many patients still go months or years before this common syndrome is diagnosed. Rheumatologists should also spearhead teaching primary care physicians the basic treatment principles of FM. If the diagnosis is made early, patients with FM in community practice do very well with simple management techniques. As consultants, rheumatologists should confirm the diagnosis of FM and suggest basic FM management. Some primary care providers or other specialists will be fully capable of bypassing this consultation, especially if the patient responds to simple management suggestions. Manpower surveys have not studied the cost-effectiveness of specialty care in FM. Rheumatologists should also assume the responsibility for the management of FM patients who have not responded to basic FM management. Additionally, some rheumatologists may wish to subspecialize in FM, a major career commitment to this perplexing disorder. These situations constitute advanced FM management.

### Design and validation of a predictive model for determining the risk of developing fibromyalgia [^a8fa2f5f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia is a prevalent disease of unknown aetiology and is difficult to diagnose. Despite the availability of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis, it continues to be a challenge in the field of primary health care in terms of identifying individuals with susceptibility to developing the disease. The aim of this study is to design and validate a predictive model of fibromyalgia in subjects with a history of chronic pain.

Methods

This multicentre observational retrospective cohort study was performed on patients aged >18 years, who visited four primary health centres between 2017 and 2020, with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia or arthritis. The Bootstrapping resampling method was used for the validation of the model.

Results

A total of 198 subjects with fibromyalgia (93 with osteoarthritis, 20 with other types of arthritis, 4 with rheumatoid arthritis) and 120 without fibromyalgia (116 with osteoarthritis, 23 with other types of arthritis, 7 with rheumatoid arthritis) participated in the study. The predictive factors of the final model were self-reported age at onset of symptoms, first-line family history of neurological diseases, exposure to levels of stress, history of post-traumatic acute emotional stress, and personal history of chronic widespread pain prior to diagnosis, comorbidity, and pharmacological prescription during the year of diagnostic confirmation. The predictive capacity adjusted by Bootstrapping was 0.972 (95% CI: 0.955-0.986).

Conclusions

The proposed model showed an excellent predictive capacity. The risk calculator designed from the predictive model allows health professionals to have a useful tool to identify subjects at risk of developing fibromyalgia.

### Factors in the building of effective patient-provider relationships in the context of fibromyalgia [^7a2fc408]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There are other factors that may exacerbate issues that patients experience as they seek out help from health care providers. For example, receiving a diagnosis can be one of the biggest obstacles to receiving treatment. Survey research has reported that a significant portion of physicians, including both primary care providers and specialists, do not have adequate knowledge of the fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria, and that up to 54% of physicians experience difficulty diagnosing it.

Fibromyalgia patients also experience the need for information. Patients are uncertain about the definition of the syndrome and the symptoms that are part of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia patients seek information on a diverse set of topics, including symptom management, treatments, medications, the cause of fibromyalgia, health outcomes, methods to cope, and impact on daily life. Although the majority prefer acquiring information face-to-face from providers, a significant proportion of participants seek information from different sources because of a lack of information, indistinct information, or lack of attention from health care providers.

In this article, we take a qualitative approach to examining patient–provider interactions using data that were collected during an interview study focused on fibromyalgia patients’ illness journeys. Similar to the findings reported in this literature review, study participants shared stories of negative interactions with physicians, particularly early in their illness journeys. However, in contrast to this literature, study participants were eventually successful in building long-term relationships with their physicians. We explore, from the patient’s perspective, key factors that influenced the formation of these relationships: information interactions, finding providers, and realizing shared responsibilities.

### A questionnaire using the modified 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia: specificity and sensitivity in clinical practice [^b302bced]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Modified 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Diagnostic Criteria for Fibromyalgia (given as a self-administered questionnaire) in clinical practice.

Methods

A cohort of patients with widespread pain, referred by primary care physicians to rheumatologists, completed the questionnaire for the Modified ACR 2010 criteria. Prior to completion of the questionnaire, patients were diagnosed by at least 1 rheumatologist as either having fibromyalgia (FM) or not having FM, using the rheumatologist's clinical assessment as the gold standard for diagnosis of FM. The Modified ACR 2010 criteria were then applied to determine whether a diagnosis of FM was satisfied by the criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were determined, using the rheumatologist's clinical assessment as the gold standard. A score ≥ 12 on the Modified ACR 2010 criteria questionnaire was also tested as the criterion to satisfy a diagnosis of FM, and subsequently to determine sensitivity and specificity. We examined the effect of using a cutoff score ≥ 13, as previous research indicated that this may be a more useful cutoff value.

Results

A total of 451 subjects completed the questionnaire: 174 with an a priori diagnosis of FM by a rheumatologist and 277 with widespread pain who did not have an a priori clinical diagnosis of FM by a rheumatologist. The Modified ACR 2010 criteria were satisfied by 90.2% of patients with an a priori diagnosis of FM, and by 10.5% of subjects who had widespread pain, but were not diagnosed with FM when previously assessed by a rheumatologist. Thus, sensitivity and specificity are 90.2% and 89.5%, respectively, using the Modified ACR 2010 criteria. A score ≥ 12 on the Modified ACR 2010 criteria was observed in 97.4% of patients with an a priori diagnosis of FM, and 14.8% of subjects who had widespread pain, but were not diagnosed with FM when previously assessed by a rheumatologist. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity are 97.4% and 85.2%, respectively, using a cutoff score ≥ 12. Using a score of ≥ 13, however, the sensitivity was 93.1% and the specificity was 91.7%.

Conclusion

The Modified ACR 2010 criteria questionnaire can be used in primary care as a tool to assist physicians in the diagnosis of FM with high specificity and sensitivity. Calculating the total score on a Modified ACR 2010 criteria questionnaire, and setting the value of ≥ 13 as the cutoff for a diagnosis of FM appears to be the most effective approach. The Modified ACR 2010 criteria may reduce the need for rheumatology referral simply for the diagnosis of FM.

### Is there benefit in referring patients with fibromyalgia to a specialist clinic? [^d38512d0]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the benefit of specialist rheumatology consultation and followup for the first 238 patients referred to a tertiary care fibromyalgia (FM) clinic with emphasis on final diagnosis and outcome.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for the first 238 patients attending a rheumatology subspecialty FM clinic. The main variables of interest were management received at the clinic, final diagnosis, and outcome.

Results

The final diagnosis was FM in 68%, and some other condition in the remaining 32%. Specialist contact was identified as useful in 73% of the total patient group, 96 with FM and 74 with non-FM. In the patients with FM who received followup in the clinic, outcome was judged favorable in 54%, whereas 46% showed no change or decline in health status.

Conclusion

An important value of specialist rheumatology contact for patients with a symptom suggestive of diffuse musculoskeletal pain is to ensure that some other potentially treatable condition is not overlooked, rather than the provision of ongoing care for those with FM. Continued followup in a specialist clinic for patients with a primary diagnosis of FM is of questionable benefit.

### Results of a multidisciplinary program for patients with fibromyalgia implemented in the primary care [^cdc9d873]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of unknown origin with a high prevalence. Multimodal approaches seem to be the treatment of choice in fibromyalgia. A multidisciplinary program was developed and implemented for patients with fibromyalgia in the primary care setting. The program included education (seven sessions) and physical therapy (25 sessions).

Method

Patients were referred to the program by their general practitioner or by a medical specialist. A prospective non-controlled treatment study was performed, patients were evaluated before, after and three months after the program (single group time series design). The following measurements were performed: The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, RAND 36, the Pain Coping and Cognition List, the Tampa scale for kinesiophobia, two physical tests and a qualitative evaluation. Data of 65 patients with fibromyalgia were analysed, of whom 97% were female. The mean age was 44 and the mean duration of pain was nine years.

Results

Data of 65 patients with fibromyalgia were analysed, patients significantly improved on the domains feeling good, pain, fatigue, stiffness, quality of life, catastrophizing and on the physical tests.

Conclusion

The multidisciplinary program fibromyalgia implemented in primary care seems feasible and the results are promising.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^4ad2eb6f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop simple, practical criteria for clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia that are suitable for use in primary and specialty care and that do not require a tender point examination, and to provide a severity scale for characteristic fibromyalgia symptoms.

Methods

We performed a multicenter study of 829 previously diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and controls using physician physical and interview examinations, including a widespread pain index (WPI), a measure of the number of painful body regions. Random forest and recursive partitioning analyses were used to guide the development of a case definition of fibromyalgia, to develop criteria, and to construct a symptom severity (SS) scale.

Results

Approximately 25% of fibromyalgia patients did not satisfy the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria at the time of the study. The most important diagnostic variables were WPI and categorical scales for cognitive symptoms, unrefreshed sleep, fatigue, and number of somatic symptoms. The categorical scales were summed to create an SS scale. We combined the SS scale and the WPI to recommend a new case definition of fibromyalgia: (WPI > or =7 AND SS > or =5) OR (WPI 3-6 AND SS > or =9).

Conclusion

This simple clinical case definition of fibromyalgia correctly classifies 88.1% of cases classified by the ACR classification criteria, and does not require a physical or tender point examination. The SS scale enables assessment of fibromyalgia symptom severity in persons with current or previous fibromyalgia, and in those to whom the criteria have not been applied. It will be especially useful in the longitudinal evaluation of patients with marked symptom variability.

### Real-life assessment of the validity of patient global impression of change in fibromyalgia [^e2f1890d]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a single centre prospective observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with FM and followed at the Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit, a tertiary care multidisciplinary clinic in Canada, between May 2005 and March 2013. The mission of this clinic is the evaluation and management of patients with FM according to the specific needs of the patients. The study cohort has been previously described.Treatment was not predetermined; patients received a tailored treatment according to best clinical practice. Patients with another primary cause of pain, even with an associated diffuse pain syndrome, were excluded from the study. Moreover, patients who refused to participate or who were unable to answer French or English questionnaires were further excluded. Most patients were referred by primary care physicians though some were referred by other specialists. Finally, to be eligible for this analysis, men and women were clinically diagnosed with FM, were at least 18 years old and had at least one follow-up assessment.

The registry is approved by the institutional review board of the Montreal General Hospital. All patients signed informed consent forms prior to enrolment.

### Identifying patients with chronic widespread pain in primary care [^474ea801]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is characterized by long-lasting pain in multiple body regions and is associated with other physical symptoms such as fatigue, concentration problems, and psychologic distress. CWP is common, with an estimated general population point prevalence of 10%.

In the American College of Rheumatology 1990 (ACR-1990) definition,CWP is the fundamental feature of fibromyalgia, defined as pain lasting ≥3 months, located axially, above and below the waist, and on both sides of the body. The updated definition (ACR-2010)emphasizes additional physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, waking unrefreshed) associated with fibromyalgia and placed fibromyalgia at one extreme on a spectrum of polysymptomatic distress that includes CWP.

Because of the range of symptoms experienced and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, it has been argued that fibromyalgia and CWP should be managed in primary care.,, However, general practitioners (GPs) may not recognize fibromyalgia as a valid diagnosis,,,, may receive inadequate formal training in fibromyalgia,,, and may have limited awareness of diagnostic criteria. Most UK primary care uses Read codes to summarize patient encounters within electronic records. There is no Read code for CWP, although the syndrome will be included in the forthcoming International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition.However, although a code does exist for fibromyalgia, the disparity between its estimated community and primary care prevalences suggests that the label of fibromyalgia is not often used in general practice. This may reflect the controversial nature of fibromyalgia and CWP, or concern about the wider implications of labeling.Patients fulfilling CWP criteria may instead be diagnosed and treated in primary care for individual regional pains (eg, knee pain), rather than for a generalized pain condition.

### Diagnosis of fibromyalgia: comparison of the 2011 / 2016 ACR and AAPT criteria and validation of the modified fibromyalgia assessment status [^9e281cf1]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the concordance of the three diagnostic criteria, respectively the 2011 ACR criteria (ACR 2011 Cr), the ACR 2016 criteria (ACR 2016 Cr) and the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks (ACTTION)-APS Pain Taxonomy criteria (AAPT Cr), and to explore the performance of an additional set of criteria, the modified Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS 2019 modCr), in the diagnosis of FM syndrome.

Methods

Consecutive patients with chronic widespread pain, referred by the primary care setting, underwent rheumatologic assessment that established the presence or not of FM and were investigated through the four sets of proposed criteria. For the FAS 2019 modCr, discriminant validity to distinguish patients with FM and non-FM was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

A total of 732 (405 with FM and 327 with other common chronic pain problems) patients were evaluated. Against the clinical diagnosis of FM, the sensitivity, specificity and correct classification were, respectively: 79.8, 91.7 and 85.1% for ACR 2011 Cr; 78, 90.5 and 83.6% for the ACR 2016 Cr; and 73.8, 91.7 and 81.8% for the AAPT Cr. The alternative set, proposed on the FAS 2019 modCr, provided a maximal diagnostic accuracy with a score ≥20 (Youden's index), with a sensitivity of 84.2%, specificity 89.0% and positive likelihood ratio 7.65.

Conclusion

There is a considerable agreement between criteria-based diagnoses of FM, although the AAPT Cr perform least well in terms of percentage of correct classification. The FAS 2019 modCr had comparable characteristics.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^26b6c795]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Chronic pain and fibromyalgia are associated with significant patient disability. This study found that no patients referred to rheumatology care for fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome had evidence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease. Rheumatology consultations for patients referred for fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome incurred health system costs and resource utilisation. Wait times were lengthy, an average of approximately 6 months, and patient experiences were not universally positive.

Diagnostic accuracy

Fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes carry a wide differential diagnosis.It is not an inflammatory disorder but a chronic pain syndrome. It may present like a rheumatological disease, but the pattern of pain is often distinct. For example, patients with fibromyalgia may present with musculoskeletal pain and possibly morning stiffness, but the pain is often described as diffuse and not typically isolated from joints or muscles. In addition, fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion, and referral to rheumatology is often done in order to rule out an inflammatory arthritis or connective disease. A previous study found that almost 60% of patients referred for fibromyalgia were found to be misdiagnosed, and instead had a primary rheumatological condition to account for their symptoms, with inflammatory arthritis making up 40% of these misdiagnoses.This delay has been shown to alter disease progression, where timely referral to a rheumatologist for the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis significantly increases early initiation of treatment, improves patient outcomes, reduces disability, reduces the need for costly surgical interventions and decreases global disease burden.As such, diagnostic accuracy is of increased importance.

This present study found that no patients referred for fibromyalgia or chronic pain had evidence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease after their rheumatologist consultation at that time. This is different from previous studies noted above. The findings in our study can be associated with the use of a well-developed centralised triage algorithm for potential inflammatory arthritis, connective tissue disease and chronic diffuse pain referrals.In this powered study, the sensitivity and specificity of a P3 diagnosis at triage were calculated to be 82% and 94%, respectively; sensitivity and specificity of a P1 diagnosis at triage were calculated to be 92% and 81%, respectively.Patients in this study were discharged back to their referring provider as current guidelines recommend that the diagnosis and management be followed in the primary care setting and that specialist consultation be reserved for patients with atypical symptoms that suggest an alternate diagnosis.This study offers new evidence in the diagnostic accuracy by the referring provider. Although this was a quality study and not powered, it also reaffirms the accuracy of the centralised triage model in identifying P3 versus P1 patients.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^acf8c977]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.Acute pain is usually self-limiting and serves a protective function, influencing behavior to avoid further tissue damage and limiting movement to support healing. In contrast, in much the same way that a small flame from a match can cause a large forest fire, inadequately treated acute pain causes changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems that maintain persistent pain independent of the initial inciting painful stimulus.–

Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists beyond the normal time expected for tissue healing (usually accepted as 3 months) and without apparent benefit.Treatment can be complex and difficult.While there are guidelines to direct management of chronic pain associated with specific disorders such as cancer,osteoarthritis,,fibromyalgia–or neuropathic pain,–often there is no obvious cause for pain that persists despite treatment.Under these circumstances, uncertainty and frustration on the part of both practitioner and patient can lead to inappropriate polypharmacy and escalating doses of medications, exposing patients to unnecessary treatments and associated side effects.

For most patients with chronic pain, the general practitioner remains the most appropriate health care professional to treat and, where necessary, coordinate multidisciplinary management. However, to do so requires an understanding of why pain becomes chronic, the multitude of factors that may complicate ongoing pain, and management of chronic pain needs to be differentiated from management of acute exacerbations. It requires careful establishment of realistic expectations and formulation of an individualized, tiered, multimodal plan that can successfully bring pain relief and improve function.

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^18637588]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

If the research question demands a broad clinical sample of patients, we propose the following pain-related domains for consideration. As major eligibility criteria, these would be more inclusive than what is usually found in efficacy trials, and indeed pragmatic trials are opportunities to conduct research for people from diverse or disadvantaged communities and with co-occurring medical or mental health conditions. Recruiting a representative sample may, in many cases, mean specifically targeting members of certain populations and reducing barriers to trial participation, for example, through early patient partner involvement.

Rather than offering generic advice on desirable eligibility criteria, however, we encourage researchers to consider what is warranted depending on their individual research objectives. Apart from necessary diagnostic criteria, we recommend:
(1) Consider including pain of any intensity, not just ≥ 4/10, balancing clinical relevance with risk for flooring effects and the ability to detect meaningful changes. Chronic daily mild pain can be burdensome, and few clinical trials have examined treatments for this common clinical condition. Indeed, acetaminophen/paracetamol, NSAIDs, and their combination are widely available as over-the-counter medications, but little is known about their efficacy and effectiveness when used to self-treat mild pain. In addition, enrolling patients with mild pain intensity but impaired function or mood may provide adequate assay sensitivity if pain intensity is not the primary outcome, but an adverse consequence of such pain is (eg, quality of life, function, satisfaction, etc).
(2) Consider including any pain duration that fulfills diagnostic criteria.
(3) Consider not excluding patients for previous treatment nonresponse unless aligned with the pragmatic research question.
(4) Consider not excluding medical or psychiatric comorbidities and substance use disorder unless for safety reasons.

While broader eligibility criteria increase trial heterogeneity, they also enable subgroup analyses, which may be able to answer clinically relevant questions. In line with applicable CONSORT reporting recommendations (item 3), authors should discuss “… the degree to which [the eligibility criteria] include typical participants and/or, where applicable, typical providers (eg, nurses), institutions (eg, hospitals), communities (or localities eg, towns) and settings of care (eg, different healthcare financing systems).”We extend this recommendation to encourage statistical subgroup assessment where informative.

Finally, pragmatic trials are almost absent for several prevalent pain conditions, including headaches, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and injury-related pain.We encourage trials with pragmatic objectives for pertinent research questions in these groups of patients.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^53eaf564]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Validation of the Spanish version of the fibromyalgia rapid screening tool to detect fibromyalgia in primary care health centres [^7936e023]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST), a brief questionnaire for the detection of fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with diffuse chronic pain seen at primary care health centres.

Methods

The original FiRST French questionnaire was adapted to a Spanish version following the guidelines of the Rheumatology Spanish Society Study Group of FM, and the help provided by professors of French and Spanish Language. In a prospective and multicentre study, patients with chronic pain were initially divided into two groups: a group that included patients that had been diagnosed with FM according to the 1990 ACR criteria and the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria (n=404), and a non-FM (control) group composed of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n=147) and osteoarthritis (OA) (n=219) patients. Patients from the FM group were evaluated by assessing tender point assessment, Widespread Pain Index (WPI), Symptom Severity Scale (SSS), FiRST questionnaire and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). The non-FM group was evaluated by means of FiRST, WPI and SSS. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value as well as the correlation between the global score and other parameters were assessed.

Results

356 of 404 FM (88.1%) patients who met the 1990 ACR criteria and the ACR 2010 preliminary criteria had a positive FiRST. In the control group (AR plus OA), only 16 (4.4%) subjects had a positive FiRST. The sensitivity value was 92% (95% confidence interval CI: 88.9-95.1), specificity 87.4% (95% CI: 80.8-94.0), positive predictive value 95.7% (95% CI: 93.3-98.1), and negative predictive value 78.2% (95% CI: 70.6-85.9). A significant correlation between the total FiRST score (patients with score 5 or 6) and WPI (p<0.0001), SSS (p<0.0001), time to disease progression (p<0.0001) and FIQ (p<0.0001) was found.

Conclusions

FiRST questionnaire is a useful tool for the detection of FM in primary care health centres.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management [^f7055a7e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered processing of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more frequently in women and occurs globally, affecting 2% of people in the United States. Patients with fibromyalgia have diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions, such as functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present. The Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful screening method for patients with diffuse chronic pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary testing. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education, exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective medications for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^ba0c8212]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### "No one wants to look after the fibro patient". understanding models, and patient perspectives, of care for fibromyalgia: reviews of current evidence [^b6207f06]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and complex long-term pain condition. Despite advancements in our understanding and treatment of fibromyalgia, patients report patchy health care provision and frustrating journeys through the health care system. To inform how best to deliver care, we undertook 2 narrative reviews examining existing evidence on (1) models of care for fibromyalgia and (2) patients' experiences, preferences, and unmet needs regarding their health care. Seven databases were systematically searched. Quantitative data was narratively synthesised and qualitative data thematically analysed. No evidence-based model of care covering the patient journey through the entire health care system was identified. Limited evidence suggests no clear benefit for ongoing care in secondary care settings. Patients with fibromyalgia report difficult interactions with the health care system that might equally be expressed by those with other long-term conditions, such as inconsistent and poorly coordinated care. However, they also face unique problems; fibromyalgia was often not viewed as a real condition, resulting in difficult encounters with health care staff, in particular not feeling believed or listened to. Significant delays in diagnosis were commonplace. Positive care experiences such as being listened to and shared decision-making made patients feeling better informed, well supported, and more satisfied. There is little evidence to inform how best to organise health care for patients with fibromyalgia and ensure care is delivered in a coordinated and consistent way. These findings provide a strong rationale for developing a new model of care for fibromyalgia.

### Electronic medical record data to identify variables associated with a fibromyalgia diagnosis: importance of health care resource utilization [^75da9166]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Widespread pain is the hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic, complex musculoskeletal condition that remains undiagnosed in a substantial proportion of patients with this disease.While the pain is generally defined as bilateral both above and below the waist and includes axial skeletal pain,FM is also characterized by a variety of other symptoms and comorbidities, including fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and irritable bowel syndrome.The substantial socioeconomic burden of FM is well recognized, resulting from reductions in patient function, productivity, and quality of life, as well as high health care resource utilization.–

The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have long provided guidance for the diagnosis of FM based on the primary criteria of widespread pain and a manual tender-point exam for demonstrating the presence of tenderness at a minimum of 11 of 18 specified points. These criteria were updated in 2010 by adding a symptom-severity assessment and eliminating the tender-point exam.Despite the availability of these diagnostic criteria and various screening tools, FM patients still cycle through the health care system for several years before receiving a diagnosis; patients have reported delays of up to 5 years from when they first presented to a physician about their FM symptoms to receiving an actual diagnosis.

Identifying variables associated with, or predictive of, developing FM can enhance understanding of the disease and provide a focus for development of appropriate management strategies. Previously, patient-reported registry data demonstrated that the widespread pain that is characteristic of FM was predicted by somatic symptoms, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, fatigue, sleep problems, and workplace stress.A recent narrative review of biologic markers further highlighted the need for such identification, since while several markers can be considered suggestive of FM, none has unequivocally been shown to be a clinically useful predictor of developing this condition.

Another relevant approach is to identify variables associated with an FM diagnosis, which can be used to inform health care providers of patients in the clinical setting who have a high likelihood of FM, thus reducing the diagnostic delay and facilitating earlier treatment initiation. To identify such variables, it may be necessary to go beyond the demographic and clinical characteristics that have been evaluated based on their ready availability in databases that are frequently used for these types of analyses.

### The accuracy of a fibromyalgia diagnosis in general practice [^87b1bcbb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the characteristics of people with fibromyalgia (FM) with those with other forms of nonmalignant chronic pain.

Design

A prospective cohort study conducted in a chronic pain management clinic within an academic medical center.

Setting

Many symptoms of the chronic pain syndrome FM are common to other pain or musculoskeletal syndromes. FM may be misdiagnosed by clinicians.

Subjects

Thirty-three patients with a working diagnosis of FM were identified: 26 (78.8%) participated in the study. They were matched by age (mean = 53.0years) and gender (80.8% female) to a control group with other forms of chronic nonmalignant pain.

Methods

Standardized physical examinations for FM were undertaken using the 1990 and revised 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. The groups were compared using diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and responses to the Pain Disability Index, Personal Health Questionnaire, Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and Rapid Estimate Adult Literacy in Medicine.

Results

The most common psychiatric disorders were depression (44.4%) and anxiety (27.3%). Incidence of at least one psychiatric condition was 80.8%, and the only difference (P=0.002) between the two populations was the mean number of tender points: 5.6 (±4.2) vs controls 3.2 (±2.2). Only three (11.5%) participants with a prior diagnosis of FM fulfilled the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria, increasing to 38.5% when the 2010 criteria were applied; however, 46.1% of controls also met the revised diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

FM is commonly misdiagnosed: all patients with a working diagnosis should be reassessed and reviewed to ensure that the most appropriate treatment is provided.

### Gender-stratified prevalence of psychiatric and pain diagnoses in a primary care patient sample with fibromyalgia [^188a40f8]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Comorbid psychiatric and pain-related conditions are common in patients with fibromyalgia. Most studies in this area have used data from patients in specialty care and may not represent the characteristics of fibromyalgia in primary care patients. We sought to fill gaps in the literature by determining if the association between psychiatric diagnoses, conditions associated with chronic pain, and fibromyalgia differed by gender in a primary care patient population.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting and Subjects

Medical record data obtained from 38,976 patients, ≥18years of age with a primary care encounter between July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2016.

Methods

International Classification of Diseases-9 codes were used to define fibromyalgia, psychiatric diagnoses, and conditions associated with chronic pain. Unadjusted associations between patient demographics, comorbid conditions, and fibromyalgia were computed using binary logistic regression for the entire cohort and separately by gender.

Results

Overall, 4.6% of the sample had a fibromyalgia diagnosis, of whom 76.1% were women. Comorbid conditions were more prevalent among patients with vs without fibromyalgia. Depression and arthritis were more strongly related to fibromyalgia among women (odds ratio [OR]=2.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.50-3.13; and OR=5.19, 95% CI = 4.62-5.84) compared with men (OR=2.16, 95% CI = 1.71-2.71; and (OR=3.91, 95% CI = 3.22-4.75). The relationship of fibromyalgia and other diagnoses did not significantly differ by gender.

Conclusions

Except for depression and arthritis, the burden of comorbid conditions in patients with fibromyalgia is similar in women and men treated in primary care. Fibromyalgia comorbidities in primary care are similar to those found in specialty care.

To assess whether the decrease in medical resource use and cost after diagnosing fibromyalgia, observed in a large primary care population in the United Kingdom can be extrapolated to France.

Methods

A questionnaire was created based on medical resource use by 2,260 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia between 01/01/1998 and 31/03/2003 in the General Practice Research Database in the UK. Sixty French experts (general practitioners, rheumatologists) assessed whether the data from that database are in line with their clinical practice and, if not, were asked to provide data reflecting their own experience. The evaluation period went from 4 years before to 4 years after diagnosis using 1-year cross-sections. Evaluated resources were drug use, diagnostics tests, general practitioners and specialist visits, and also paramedical or alternative treatments. Data regarding inpatient care and productivity loss were not collected. Medical resource use if no diagnosis had been established was estimated, so the impact of diagnosis could be evaluated.

Results

Whereas costs gradually increase before diagnosis, stagnation in costs occurs in the year after diagnosis, followed by a moderate decrease afterwards. The same trend was observed whether the panel consisted of general practitioners or rheumatologists. The savings made as a result of fibromyalgia diagnosis add up to 126 euros per patient per year for the health care payer. General practitioner visits, diagnostic tests and drug use represent respectively 57%, 23% and 12% of the savings.

Conclusions

Also in France, early diagnosis of fibromyalgia leads to a decrease in resource use and health care costs.

### Description of a half-day interprofessional fibromyalgia clinic with an evaluation of patient satisfaction [^096a8d5a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate patient satisfaction of a half-day interprofessional fibromyalgia clinic.

Design

A convenience sample of 167 consecutively enrolled patients were evaluated retrospectively for clinical and laboratory findings. After 2 yrs, a patient satisfaction survey and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were mailed for follow-up analyses.

Results

Sixty-five patients returned the mailed questionnaire (54.2 % response rate). More than 90% of the patients rated their clinic experience and provider visits as very positive or positive. Notably, those patients who reported that their primary care provider regarded fibromyalgia as a valid diagnosis were willing to implement the consultant's recommendations, and those who were prescribed medications were more likely to experience an improvement in symptoms and function. Sleep, fatigue, pain, and work interference were the variables most likely to improve, whereas mood was largely unchanged. Finally, the patients with insulin-like growth factor-1 levels that were within the reference range based on age had a better Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire response compared with those with low insulin-like growth factor-1 levels.

Conclusions

A half-day fibromyalgia treatment program is feasible and acceptable to patients. This program was designed to provide an expert interprofessional assessment and treatment recommendations to the referring primary care provider. Overall, the program was positively rated by the participants who, overall, experienced a modest improvement in their fibromyalgia symptoms over a 2-yr period.

### A randomized controlled trial of group aerobic exercise in primary care patients with persistent, unexplained physical symptoms [^c9a1ff89]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The management of persistent, unexplained physical symptoms is challenging and often unsatisfactory for patients and doctors. Aerobic exercise training has benefited patients referred to secondary care with symptoms of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. It is not known if this approach is either possible or beneficial for patients with the broader range of persistent, unexplained symptoms found in primary care.

Objectives

To examine the feasibility and effects of aerobic exercise training in primary care patients with unexplained physical symptoms persisting more than 12 months.

Methods

Randomized comparison (n = 228) of aerobic exercise with stretching as control among patients recruited from primary care. Training comprised 20, one-hour, sessions led by NHS physiotherapists. Adherence to training was recorded along with two groups of outcome measures: (i) documented symptoms and health care use, monitored from six months before to six months after training; and (ii) self-reported measures including emotional state and perceived disability, assessed before, during and six months after training.

Results

Exercise training proved feasible: more than 70% of referred patients attended for assessment and were randomized to aerobic or control exercise; 78% of eligible patients attended the first session; and median attendance was 11 sessions for both programmes. Primary care consultations and prescriptions were significantly reduced in the 6 months after training; extent of reduction was related to attendance at training sessions, irrespective of type. Whilst self-reported measures improved similarly during both training programmes, improvements were unrelated to level of attendance.

Conclusion

For primary care patients with persistent, unexplained physical symptoms willing to be involved in exercise training, aerobic exercise offers no benefits over non-aerobic exercise. Whilst the observed reduction in primary health care use following exercise training is potentially of practical importance in a group of patients characterized by high consultation rates, improvement in patients' subjective state was not clearly attributable to exercise training.

### Prevalence of fibromyalgia in fourteen Korean tertiary care university hospital pain clinics [^8e9b731d]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Despite improvements, the 2010 ACR criteria, as the 1990 criteria before them, also required a physician to assess the presence and severity of comorbid symptoms. In 2011, diagnostic criteria (the modified ACR 2010 criteria) were developed, which were the partially modified 2010 diagnostic criteria without the requirement for physician assessment of somatic symptoms.The modified ACR 2010 criteria could thus be implemented more easily and at a lower cost.The physician assessment of somatic symptoms was replaced with a summary score representative of three, self-reported symptoms. By using these modified ACR 2010 criteria in primary care, physicians were able to diagnose FM with adequately high sensitivity and specificity.

Despite the extensive application and use of these modified ACR criteria elsewhere,,their use in assessing the prevalence of FM in Korea has not yet been investigated. There are only two epidemiological studies of FM in Korea, both of which are based on the 1990 ACR criteria.A further study compares the fit of 1990 and 2010 ACR criteria in 98 patients already diagnosed with FM.In addition, most previous studies have been conducted in patients recruited from a general population or recruited directly from rheumatology clinics. No studies have specifically assessed patients at multicenter pain clinics. Recently, it has been reported that FM presents as a continuous spectrum, rather than as a single disease form, and is often accompanied by various other chronic pain disorders.For these reasons, we targeted patients with chronic pain who visited tertiary care university hospital pain clinics for our assessments of FM in the present study. In addition, we employed the modified ACR 2010 criteria, which can be employed without a physician and thus are potentially more useful than the 1990 diagnostic criteria, which required significant physician’s time and effort.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of FM in patients who visited outpatient pain clinics in Korea using the modified 2010 ACR criteria and to examine them for comorbid conditions that may be associated with FM.

### Computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy in medical care settings [^3dc22fbe]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We reviewed research on computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy (CCBT) performed in medical settings with the goals of assessing the effectiveness of this newer method of treatment delivery, evaluating the need for clinician support of therapeutic computer programs, and making suggestions for future research and clinical implementation.

Recent Findings

The overall results of randomized, controlled trials suggest that CCBT can be an effective treatment for depression in primary care patients and health care anxiety. Also, it can be a useful component of treatment for somatic conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and chronic pain. The amount and type of clinician support needed for maximizing effectiveness remains unclear. CCBT offers promise for overcoming barriers to delivering effective psychotherapy in medical settings. We recommend that next steps for researchers include more definitive studies of the influence of clinician support, investigations focused on implementation in clinical practices, cost-benefit analyses, and use of technological advances.

### Identifying patients with chronic widespread pain in primary care [^4f8b7f64]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

4. Discussion

The first phase of our study determined a prevalence of recurrent regional pain consultation to primary care similar to estimates based on self-reported CWP in the general population.Three-quarters of recurrent regional pain consulters did not have a code recorded for generalized pain conditions related to CWP (eg, fibromyalgia). They therefore had widespread pain potentially unrecognized as such by their GP.

In the second phase, we established some overlap between consultation-based and self-reported widespread pain, with half of all recurrent regional pain consulters over a 5-year period self-reporting widespread pain at least once. However, only one-quarter reported persistent widespread pain during this period. Conversely, only a minority of all those who self-reported CWP (37%) fulfilled the recurrent regional consulter definition during the 5-year period.

There were similar patterns of poor health (eg, more somatic complaints) with recurrent regional pain consultation and self-reported CWP, although this was more marked for consultation measures of poor health in recurrent regional pain consulters and for survey measures in those with self-reported CWP.

The primary care coding prevalence of fibromyalgia was considerably lower than that predicted by community prevalence, even accounting for a proportion of patients not consulting for their symptoms. This is consistent with findings from 2 large database studies. The combined 5-year prevalence of recurrent regional pain consultation (“unrecognized” CWP) and nonspecific pain complaints (“recognized” CWP), after excluding specific generalized musculoskeletal diagnoses, was slightly higher, at 13%, than general population point prevalence estimates for CWP (10%).Combined with our findings from Phase 2, this indicates that prevalence of widespread pain based on consultation data may give similar prevalence estimates to general population surveys based on strict CWP criteria, but will not represent an identical group of people.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^28a2be57]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia" for fibromyalgia.

The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. The criteria are designed to provide a standardized approach to diagnosis, facilitating early intervention and management.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria include the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score. The WPI assesses the number of areas in which the patient has experienced pain over the past week, while the SSS score evaluates the severity of three common symptoms: fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms. 

The diagnostic criteria are met if the patient has a WPI of 7 or more and an SSS score of 5 or more, and these symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, with no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. Alternatively, the criteria are also met if the patient has a WPI between 3 and 6 and an SSS score of 9 or more, with the same conditions regarding symptom duration and exclusion of other disorders. 

These criteria provide a comprehensive and objective measure for diagnosing fibromyalgia, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and treatment.

The diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia helps determine if a person meets the criteria for a diagnosis by evaluating specific conditions. Here's how it works:

- The tool considers the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity (SS) scale scores in two scenarios:
- WPI of 7 or more and an SS score of 5 or more.
- WPI between 3 and 6 and an SS score of 9 or more.

- It also considers whether the symptoms have persisted at a similar level for at least three months.

- Additionally, it verifies that no other disorder explains the pain.

To determine if the diagnostic criteria are met, the tool checks the following conditions:

- The first condition is met if WPI is 7 or more, SS score is 5 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

- The second condition is met if WPI is between 3 and 6, SS score is 9 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

If either of these conditions is satisfied, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are met. Otherwise, it concludes that they are not met. This approach systematically uses established measurements to assess whether a fibromyalgia diagnosis is justified based on pain index, severity, duration, and exclusion of other disorders.

### Management of fibromyalgia [^2834094e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Around 1 in 25 of the UK population has fibromyalgia, a lifelong condition involving widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and functional impairment, without any known structural or inflammatory cause. This problem is costly in terms of consultations, prescriptions and sick leave. The main aims of therapy are to reduce symptoms, to improve function, and to help patients adapt to the condition. Here we consider the management of adults with fibromyalgia.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^472c08e2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^879868cd]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Results

There were 79 new P3 consultations seen in clinic between June 2017 and June 2018 (table 1). The average age of patients with a P3 triage level was 48.3 years. Most of these patients were female (n=70, 89%). A majority of P3 referrals were from a PCP (n=71, 90%). Most patients triaged as P3 had at least one previous medical consult for the same concern as their rheumatology consult (n=52, 66%).

Table 1 
Patient and consult characteristics

Diagnostic accuracy

On referral and after their initial consult, patients were designated with an incoming and outgoing priority level, respectively. For patients triaged as P3, 81% (n=64) maintained their incoming P3 designation. Of these patients, 27% (n=21) had further investigations which did not impact their outgoing priority ranking and 5% (n=4) had a P2 designation after investigations. Notably, 0% (n=0) of patients with an incoming P3 priority designation were subsequently diagnosed with a P1 priority ranking (table 2).

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^11aafc7c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia 18 years ago, there have been an ever-increasing number of research articles and reviews. From the National Library of Medicine alone there are more than 10,000 articles related to fibromyalgia. The major clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia have not changed, but their prevalence, associations, relative importance to the patient, and scientific underpinnings are increasingly better understood. This article provides an update on fibromyalgia symptomatology and looks at issues that need to be considered in the development of updated diagnostic guidelines. There is still no gold standard for making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but there is an increasing consensus for the development of new guidelines for diagnosis that modifies the currently proscribed tender point evaluation.

### A prospective study of the 1-year incidence of fibromyalgia after acute whiplash injury [^632919f2]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

The incidence of fibromyalgia after whiplash injury is a controversial topic.
This study excludes pre-existing fibromyalgia to avoid selection bias encountered in previous studies.
In the current study, the one year incidence of fibromyalgia after whiplash injury is on the order of 0.8%.
This study provides an upper limit for the incidence of fibromyalgia after whiplash injury, but does not deal with causation.

It has been demonstrated, in the primary care setting, that a significant proportion of patients will recover from whiplash injury by 3 months postinjury,and even at 1 year postinjury the recovery rate can approach 80%.This still leaves 20% who fail to recover, and who are at risk not only for chronic pain, but according to some, for fibromyalgia.There are a number of studies or reports that have considered the incidence of fibromyalgia after whiplash or other physical injury, and the matter remains controversial.For the most part, studies have suffered from severe selection biasand failure to account for pretrauma fibromyalgia.Besides selection bias, misclassification is of particular concern, where patients with acute whiplash who have precollision widespread pain, with or without a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, are included in the study. In addition, there is the problem that the denominator for calculation of incidence of fibromyalgia after trauma may be underestimated. That is, many patients with whiplash often do well, recovering quickly, and are thus not included in the prospective or retrospective determination of incidence because they do not come to medical attention. Thus, the denominator for considering the incidence of fibromyalgia is much reduced, falsely elevating the incidence.

Even in the primary care setting, there is selection bias, as some patients with whiplash can be injured yet choose never to see a physician or any therapist, but fully recover.Nevertheless, the primary care setting is a better opportunity to reduce selection bias and provide a more accurate estimation of the incidence of fibromyalgia following acute whiplash injury than are secondary treatment centre population samples or non-consecutively collected participants. The purpose of the current study was to prospectively evaluate acute whiplash-injured participants in the primary care setting and determine the incidence of fibromyalgia at 1-year postinjury.

### Identifying patients with chronic widespread pain in primary care [^84bba81b]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

The recurrent regional pain consulter definition represents a promising phenotype for EHR studies as it identifies patients with nonlocal pain who have higher rates of disability and health care use. However, given the disparity between self-reported CWP and recurrent regional pain consultation, it is possible we should consider other approaches to developing a consultation-based definition of CWP, based on 2 observations. First, only 7% of all those with persistent widespread pain had no record of a musculoskeletal consultation during the study period; musculoskeletal consultation thereby represents a reasonable sampling frame for identifying and managing CWP in the population. Second, single-site musculoskeletal consultation seems to represent a low-severity group (by both consultation and self-report measures). Given this, it may be that systematically seeking information about other pain sites could be a simple way to ensure that GPs consider the extent of pain in their care and management of patients and may be useful for future development of EHR-based pain phenotypes. The highest severity group—those with combined recurrent regional pain consultation and self-reported CWP—suggests that both sources of information could be useful for care and prevention.

We performed this study in 2 large samples of patients, using high-quality primary care data and validated self-report instruments. The studies were limited to one area of the United Kingdom (North Staffordshire) and the use of an older age group in Phase 2. However, sensitivity analyses using the CiPCA data (not presented) demonstrated minimal differences in the number of recorded somatic symptoms and musculoskeletal consultations between recurrent regional pain consulters from all age groups and the subgroup aged ≥45 years. Less than a third of the eligible population (ie, those invited to take part in the baseline study) was included in analyses in Phase 2, and we cannot exclude participation bias. However, we demonstrated that differences between the study sample and nonresponders and partial responders were small.

Not all patients with a problem will consult their GP for it; consequently, consultation prevalence will be lower than community population prevalence estimates. For chronic conditions, a diagnostic label for a repeatedly consulted complaint may only be coded at diagnosis.The use of a 5-year period to define recurrent regional pain consultation would mean it is less likely we have missed a relevant diagnosis in the Phase 1 study, but it is possible some patients were recorded with fibromyalgia or other diagnosis outside of this period.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c7c68778]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science electronic databases in August 2022 to identify studies that addressed associations between fibromyalgia and mortality. The search was conducted using the key words ‘fibromyalgia’ and ‘mortality’. There was no limitation by date or language of publication. To identify additional studies, we reviewed the bibliographies of the full text papers that were included in the systematic review.

To ensure that the studies introduced into the review included patients with fibromyalgia, we selected studies that used the following fibromyalgia definitions:

In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was extracted from medical records, the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) codes 729.1 (for version 9) and M79.7 (for version 10) were used.
In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was verified by interview/physical examination, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (versions 1990, 2010, 2011, or 2016), or referring rheumatologist diagnosis by criteria in effect at the time of enrolment, if before 1990, were used.

Although the criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved over the years and may identify different sets of patients, the strategy adopted was deemed appropriate since the aim of our review focused on question of whether clinical, real-life cohorts of fibromyalgia patients suffer from excess mortality. In real-life clinical practice, fibromyalgia patients are a mixed population, diagnosed in different years by different criteria relevant at the time of diagnosis, who were diagnosed by rheumatologists or family physicians.

3. Results

3.1. Phase 1

The 5-year denominator (all ages) in CiPCA was 79,796. Nine thousand one hundred seventy-two patients fulfilled the recurrent regional pain consultation criteria and 6466 patients were recorded with nonspecific generalized pain conditions.

3.1.1. Prevalence

Standardized 5-year consultation prevalence ranged from 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32%-0.40%) for recorded fibromyalgia to 14.61% (95% CI: 14.36%-14.86%) for the combined prevalence of recurrent regional pain consultation or a code recorded for a nonspecific generalized pain condition (Table 1). Five-year prevalence of recurrent regional pain consultation was 9.87% (95% CI: 9.66%-10.07%). The age and sex distribution of recurrent regional pain consultation was similar to those of nonspecific generalized pain conditions, except that prevalence dipped slightly for nonspecific generalized pain consultation in the highest age band but continued to increase for recurrent regional pain consultation (Fig. 1).

3.1.2. Overlap of recurrent regional pain consultation with nonspecific generalized pain

Of the 6466 patients with a record of a nonspecific generalized pain condition, 290 (4%) were recorded with a specific fibromyalgia code. Thirty-three percent (2106/6466) of nonspecific generalized consulters also fulfilled the recurrent regional pain consulter definition. The recurrent regional pain consultation algorithm identified 42% (123/290) of those recorded with fibromyalgia codes. Twenty-three percent (2106/9172) of recurrent regional pain consulters had a recorded nonspecific generalized pain condition.

### Influences on the decision to use an osteoarthritis diagnosis in primary care: a cohort study with linked survey and electronic health record data [^aba5955a]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Recording of a potential differential diagnosis in the primary care records was also assessed.

Differential diagnoses were determined by consensus of 3 GPs and identified in the primary care records for the 12 months preceding and 12 months following the date of the index consultation. These included inflammatory musculoskeletal diagnoses such as rheumatoid arthritis, joint specific diagnoses such as bursitis and enthesopathy, and generalised conditions such as fibromyalgia (Supplementary table).

A subgroup of the NorStOP respondents who reported knee pain also had plain radiographs taken of their knee with three views to capture both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA,,,. Mild knee OA was defined as a Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) score of 2 in the posteroanterior or skyline view, or a score of 1 or 2 on posterior or lateral osteophytes. Moderate/severe knee OA was defined as a K&L score of ≥3 in the posteroanterior or skyline view, or a score of 3 on posterior or lateral osteophytes. A single reader scored all films and was blinded to all questionnaire data. Intraobserver and interobserver (with a second reader) agreement of posteroanterior K&L score, skyline K&L score and lateral osteophytes were assessed on 100 knees. Unweighted kappas for intraobserver reliability were between 0.81 and 0.98; interobserver kappas were between 0.49 and 0.76. The proportion of these respondents classified as having no, mild or moderate/severe radiographic knee OA in their most problematic knee was compared between the knee OA and joint pain groups.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^ce67bf69]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A protocol for the overview was published. Amendments to the protocol PRIOR statement are in Supplementary Data S1 and Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online.

We included Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies in adults (≥18 years) diagnosed with FMS using an established diagnostic criterion. Reviews of children or mixed populations not reporting outcomes separately were excluded. Any pharmacological therapy and any comparator were eligible. We sought outcomes as close as possible to three months (13 weeks) after treatment; those earlier than one month (four weeks) after beginning treatment were not eligible.

Eligible study designs were RCTs or non-RCTs providing details of inclusion and exclusion criteria; databases searched and search strategies; patient-reported pain or pain relief; and summary results for at least one desired outcome. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2021 issue 12 of Cochrane Library Wiley interface on 1 January 2022, using no limits on date or language, and checked again on 1 May 2024.

Two reviewers independently selected reviews for inclusion, carried out assessments of methodological quality, extracted data, analysed data if required, assessed how the review authors used the GRADE criteria, and made their own GRADE assessments based on the information provided. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus among all authors; all authors saw all data.

Information was collected on the number of included studies and participants; medicine, dose and route of administration; baseline demographic characteristics and pain; and any additional methodological information of importance. Outcomes sought are listed in Supplementary Data S3, available at Rheumatology online.

Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2 criteria, with additional validity checks of potentially critical factors in the evaluation of analgesic efficacy (Supplementary Data S4, available at Rheumatology online).

Susceptibility of results to publication bias was estimated by calculating the number of participants in studies with zero effect [risk ratio (RR)=1] needed to give a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) too high to be clinically relevant. Cut-off values for clinical relevance were NNTB values of 10 and 20 for the outcome of participant-reported pain relief of ≥30% or ≥50%.

### Brief, self-report fibromyalgia screener evaluated in a sample of chronic pain patients [^eaf21c44]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate a self-report fibromyalgia screener in a chronic pain population.

Design

Adults with chronic pain were evaluated with a six-item, self-report fibromyalgia screening tool based on revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria, with fibromyalgia diagnosed when patients experienced chronic pain and scored ≥13 on the ACR fibromyalgia symptom severity scale. Patients were independently assigned clinical diagnoses by treating clinicians.

Setting

University-based, tertiary care pain clinic.

Subjects

Three hundred thirty-seven mixed chronic pain patients.

Results

Agreement between the clinical diagnosis and screener diagnosis was good (P<0.001), with 76% sensitivity and 82% specificity.

Conclusion

A self-administered, brief fibromyalgia screening questionnaire can effectively identify chronic pain patients who will likely have clinical fibromyalgia.

### Hospitalization in fibromyalgia: a cohort-level observational study of in-patient procedures, costs and geographical variation in england [^1ce6ebfb]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia is a complex, debilitating, multifactorial condition that can be difficult to manage. Recommended treatments are usually delivered in outpatient settings; evidence suggests that significant inpatient care occurs. We describe the scale and cost of inpatient care with a primary diagnostic code of fibromyalgia within the English National Health Service.

Methods

We conducted a cohort-level observational study of all patients admitted to hospital due to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2018 inclusive, in the National Health Service in England. We used data from Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care to study: the age and sex of patients admitted, number and costs of admissions, length of stay, procedures undertaken, class and type of admission, and distribution of admissions across clinical commissioning groups.

Results

A total of 24 295 inpatient admissions, costing £20 220 576, occurred during the 4-year study period. Most patients were women (89%) with peak age of admission of between 45 and 55 years. Most admissions were elective (92%). A number of invasive therapeutic procedures took place, including a continuous i.v. infusion (35%). There was marked geographical variation in the prevalence and cost of inpatient fibromyalgia care delivered across the country, even after accounting for clinical commissioning group size.

Conclusions

Many patients are admitted for treatment of their fibromyalgia and given invasive procedures for which there is weak evidence, with significant variation in practice and cost across the country. This highlights the need to identify areas of resource use that can be rationalized and diverted to provide more effective, evidence-based treatment.

### Identification and management of chronic pain in primary care: a review [^c68fc8ce]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Mindfulness in Chronic Pain

Mindfulness, an approach aimed at developing beneficial reactions to both mental and physical processes that contribute to dysfunctional behaviour and emotional distress, has featured as a tool in emerging research in chronic pain management. McCubbin et al. demonstrated that mindfulness was associated with improvements in patient-centered outcomes for over a year after initial intervention and with a reduced utilization of healthcare services for up to 18 months. In their study of Mindfulness Based Functional Therapy (MBFT) in primary care, Schutze et al. showed good patient adherence and satisfaction, reduced pain catastrophising and improved physical functioning among people with chronic LBP. In spite of a number of recent studies in this area, however, in their meta-analysis, Bawa et al. demonstrated only limited evidence in support of mindfulness-based interventions for patients with chronic pain and called for more and better studies in this area.

Telecare

The use of telecare in patients with chronic pain is growing an evidence base suggesting it is beneficial in chronic pain management. Kroenke et al. demonstrated that telecare doubled the number of patients who achieved a reduction in their pain of over 30 %. This pain reduction was sustained at 12 months.

Decision Support Tool for Clinicians

The BPS has produced patient care pathways for chronic pain, in collaboration with “Map of Medicine”, intended for use in primary care. These decision maps are tools which are available online to any healthcare professional, as well as members of the public, via. They are designed to present evidence-based medicine in clinical flowcharts to help clinicians apply the best evidence to the patient in front of them. They have developed five evidence-based pain pathways covering chronic pelvic pain, chronic widespread pain including fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, low back and radicular pain and initial assessment and early management of pain. Such interactive flowcharts have the potential to improve the management of chronic pain.

### Identifying patients with chronic widespread pain in primary care [^878f0821]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

2. Methods

The study consisted of 2 phases. In Phase 1, we used routinely recorded primary care data to investigate prevalence of recurrent consultation for regional pain conditions and determined the overlap with recorded nonspecific generalized pain that may be related to fibromyalgia, to assess the extent to which widespread pain may be unrecognized in UK primary care. In Phase 2, we used linked survey and primary care consultation data to investigate whether patients with recurrent regional pain consultation have survey-reported CWP and have similar characteristics to those self-reporting CWP.

2.1. Phase 1

We used anonymized routinely collected primary care data from general practices contributing to the Consultations in Primary Care Archive (CiPCA) in North Staffordshire, United Kingdom. The North Staffordshire Research Ethics Committee gave ethical approval for the use of the CiPCA database for research (reference 03/04). In the United Kingdom, 98% of the population is registered with a National Health Service (NHS) GP,access to care is free, and GPs act as the entry point to all routine health care. Although North Staffordshire is more deprived than the average for England, the practices cover both affluent and deprived areas. Routine clinical data recorded by the practices are regularly audited.Prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in CiPCA has been demonstrated to be similar to that of larger national primary care consultation databasesand international databases.We included the 12 CiPCA practices for which there were complete data for the years 2005 to 2009, with a denominator population base of 79,796 people registered (all ages, with full registration for the 5-year study period).

We used the Read-coded consultation data for this 5-year period to identify: (1) patients fulfilling the original recurrent regional pain consultation algorithm (Box 1) based on a published list of all regional musculoskeletal morbidity codes (n = 4482); and (2) individuals recorded with nonspecific (ie, with no clear established underlying diagnosis) generalized pain conditions related to CWP. These included fibromyalgia, fibrositis, rheumatism, myalgia, arthralgia, and polyalgia. The code lists are available from. We excluded patients without complete registration; that is, those who were not registered with the same primary care practice for the full 5-year period from 2005 to 2009.

### Comparison of physician-based and patient-based criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^6d112b7e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 preliminary fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria require symptom ascertainment by physicians. The 2011 survey or research modified ACR criteria use only patient self-report. We compared physician-based (MD) (2010) and patient-based (PT) (2011) criteria and criteria components to determine the degree of agreement between criteria methodology.

Methods

We studied prospectively collected, previously unreported rheumatology practice data from 514 patients and 30 physicians in the ACR 2010 study. We evaluated the widespread pain index, polysymptomatic distress (PSD) scale, tender point count (TPC), and fibromyalgia diagnosis using 2010 and 2011 rules. Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (LOA), kappa statistic, Lin's concordance coefficient, and the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) were used to measure agreement and discrimination.

Results

MD and PT diagnostic agreement was substantial (83.4%, κ=0.67). PSD scores differed slightly (12.3 MD, 12.8 PT; P=0.213). LOA for PSD were -8.5 and 7.7, with bias of -0.42. The TPC was strongly associated with both the MD (r=0.779) and PT PSD scales (r=0.702).

Conclusion

There was good agreement in MD and PT fibromyalgia diagnosis and other measures among rheumatology patients. Low bias scores indicate consistent results for physician and patient measures, but large values for LOA indicate many widely discordant pairs. There is acceptable agreement in diagnosis and PSD for research, but insufficient agreement for clinical decisions and diagnosis. We suggest adjudication of symptom data by patients and physicians, as recommended by the 2010 ACR criteria.

### Are the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia better than the 1990 criteria? [^4d0b3687]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is difficult to diagnose and manage chronic pain condition whose symptoms have no clear pathophysiological cause, although it is thought that patient hypersensitivity to a range of stimuli may give rise to mechanical hyperalgesia as a result of altered central nociceptive processing. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, which have been widely used in clinical practice, require the existence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) for >3months, and the presence of at least 11 out of 18 specified tender points upon digital palpation, although this latter criterion has long been criticised. The newer 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria state that FM can be defined as CWP associated with somatic symptoms, and recommend the use of a widespread pain index and a scale to rate symptom severity. A modified version of the 2010 criteria removed the physician assessment of the extent of somatic symptoms and replaced it by a summary score of three self-reported symptoms, thus making it easier to use while maintaining its sensitivity. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of all of these criteria.

### The number of central nervous system-driven symptoms predicts subsequent chronic primary pain: evidence from UK biobank [^1659370d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This study uses UK Biobank, a multicentre cohort study comprising British adults aged 40–69 yr registered with the NHS and living within 25 miles of one of 22 assessment centres. Between 2006 and 2010, approximately 500 000 adults attended a baseline visit and provided written consent. Primary care record linkage was available for a subset, with records starting in 1990 and available until 2017. The completeness of data varied throughout this period, as more primary care practices engaged in electronic coding. In 2019, a follow-up pain questionnaire was conducted online. UK Biobank received ethical approval from the NHS National Research Ethics Service (Ref. 11/NW/0382). This study used application 45465.

Participants self-reporting no recent (<1 month) or chronic pain (3+ months) at baseline were included. Those with a previous diagnosis of primary pain conditions in their primary care record, self-reported fibromyalgia, or serious neurological conditions which may affect cognition or pain reporting were excluded. However, we cannot fully exclude past painful experiences owing to the limitations of available data, and the ubiquity of pain over the course of the lifespan. The analysis of incident primary pain conditions included those with available primary care record data, and the analysis of pain type and severity comprised participants who completed the 2019 pain questionnaire.

Data collection

At baseline, participants completed questionnaires on lifestyle, family, and social history, and a series of cognitive tasks, using a touchscreen interface. A research nurse collected additional clinical information through face-to-face interviews.

In 2019, participants were invited to complete an online pain questionnaire that comprised the 2016 revised Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria (FSC), which includes the widespread pain index (WPI),and the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) interview, a seven-item questionnaire on pain quality.Although the DN4 is typically used to diagnose neuropathic pain, it may also suggest central sensitisation, a key feature of nociplastic pain.The WPI was utilised as a measure of nociplastic pain severity.

Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome affecting children and adolescents. In part one of this review, we discussed the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of JPFS. Part two focuses on the treatment and prognosis of JPFS. Early intervention is important. The standard of care is multidisciplinary, combining various modalities-most importantly, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy. Prognosis varies and symptoms may persist into adulthood.

### Consistency between the 2016 ACR criteria and a previous diagnosis or hypothesis of fibromyalgia in a specialised referral clinic [^a1503281]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome whose hallmark features are chronic widespread pain, sleep disturbances, fatigue and cognitive dysfunctions. However, it is still difficult to apply validated diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study is to examine the accuracy of a previous diagnosis/diagnostic hypothesis of FM according to the 2016 ACR diagnostic criteria.

Methods

All of the patients newly referred to a private rheumatological clinic with the specific request for a consultation because if FM over an 18-month period were evaluated by means of a standardised protocol in order to determine whether they fulfilled the 2016 ACR diagnostic criteria for FM. They were initially divided into three groups: those with a previous diagnosis of FM (group 1), those with a physician's diagnostic hypothesis of FM (group 2) and those who personally hypothesised FM (group 3). They were subsequently classified as having FM, IFM (borderline scores) or not having FM (non-FM) on the basis of the 2016 ACR diagnostic criteria.

Results

The study involved 216 patients (25 males and 191 females): 112 in group 1, 49 in group 2, and 55 in group 3. Only 89 patients (41.2%) fulfilled the ACR criteria; 42 (19.44%) met the study protocol-defined scores for IFM; and 85 (39.35%) were diagnosed as not having FM. Only 50% of the patients with a previous diagnosis of FM fulfilled the ACR criteria, and just under 25% did not have FM. Almost 50% of the patients with a physician's diagnostic hypotheses of FM did not have FM, whereas 20% of the patients who personally hypothesised FM fulfilled the ACR criteria. GP scores and TPCs were significantly different (FM > IFM, FM > non-FM, and IFM > non-FM) as were WPI, SSS and PSD scores for FM > IFM group. Rheumatologists made the previous diagnosis in 92.85% of patients, 53.84% of whom met the ACR criteria and about 20% did not have FM; and as many as 37.5% of the patients with a previous diagnosis made by a non-rheumatologist did not have FM. The non-FM patients were given 84 alternative diagnoses, 78.5% of which referred to rheumatic diseases. One hundred and thirty-one patients had 86 closely pain-related co-morbidities, 94.1% of which were rheumatic diseases.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm the inaccuracy of FM diagnoses and highlights the possibility that in everyday clinical practice, they are not always made with reference to very specific criteria and that there is a high risk of classifying non-FM patients as having FM. They also underline the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis. Separately classifying as IFM those patients who do not meet the ACR criteria, but have clinical findings indicating FM, may help to prevent their exclusion from specific treatment(s).

### Complementary and alternative medicine to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. A systematic review [^45e27feb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of generalized chronic pain, skin hypersensitivity, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep problems, and cognitive and psychological impairments (ie, higher prevalence of anxiety and depression).The diagnosis of FM is based predominately on the presence of chronic pain, as established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), which includes chronic widespread pain in at least 4 of 5 regions and for a minimum of three months. Likewise, they should present a Widespread Pain Index (WPI) ≥7 and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score ≥5 OR a WPI of 4–6 and SSS score ≥9.Since diagnosis is based on clinical tests and not accompanied by laboratory or radiological tests, FM is still underdiagnosed.

Other multiple factors contribute to this underdiagnosis, such as stigmatization due to gender issues (eg, FM considered a ‘disease of females’),and the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and their updates and suggestions (ie, 1990, 2010, 2011 and 2016).The most common treatment offered to these patients is pharmacological treatment (ie, opioid analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications, antidepressants). However, many of these drugs have important adverse effects and do not completely alleviate the symptoms of patients.Other commonly used therapies for FM are physical exercise (aerobic and resistance training) and lifestyle, which proved to be effective in the literature as well.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^fb92e116]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Comprehensive search of the professional literature—systematic review currency and scope decisions are specified as follows: IOM (2011a) standards require the use of one or more systematic reviews for guideline development, and the panel aimed to use reviews that are at most 3 years old so that the reviews are not more than 5 years old at the time of approval and publication, given that a systematic review is considered outdated after 5 years. For the current guideline, the panel used a systematic review of noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic noncancer pain, then, after reviewing public comments and identified systematic reviews, it decided to exclude headaches and also excluded fibromyalgia as outside the scope of the guideline. Due to gaps in comparisons, approaches, and outcomes in the first review, two more reviews were identified and used, and the panel followed best practices of using reviews current within the past 5 years.

### Fibromyalgia position paper [^67922361]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome is one of the most common causes of chronic widespread pain, but pain accompanies a wide range of ancillary symptoms. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains elusive, and diagnosis is exquisitely clinical, due to the lack of biomarkers or specific laboratory alterations in fibromyalgia patients. This position paper has the purpose to summarise the current scientific knowledge and expert opinions about the main controversies regarding fibromyalgia syndrome, namely: (i) fibromyalgia definition and why it is still not recognised in many countries as a distinct clinical entity; (ii) fibromyalgia severity and how to evaluate treatment outcome; (iii) how to treat fibromyalgia and which is a correct approach to fibromyalgia patients.

### Inaccuracy in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome: analysis of referrals [^c8213190]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine prospectively the accuracy of an initial diagnosis for fibromyalgia (FM).

Methods

All patients newly referred for rheumatology consultation in a 6-month period were evaluated prospectively for either a preceding, current or subsequent diagnosis of FM. Clinical characteristics, previous and subsequent management and health care utilization were assessed. The final diagnosis at 6 months was verified and accuracy regarding the diagnosis of FM was assessed.

Results

Seventy six (12%) of all new patients were either referred with a question of FM or finally diagnosed with FM. At the final evaluation the accuracy of the diagnosis regarding FM by either the referring physician or by the rheumatologist at the time of the initial visit was correct in 34% of patients. The FM group in comparison with those with some other rheumatological diagnosis had more tender points (12.5 vs 4) and were more fatigued. In contrast, prolonged early morning stiffness and limitation of lumbar spinal mobility in more than one plane was more common in the non-FM group.

Conclusion

There is a disturbing inaccuracy, mostly observed to be overdiagnosis, in the diagnosis of FM by referring physicians. This finding may help explain the current high reported rates of FM and caution physicians to consider other diagnostic possibilities when addressing diffuse musculoskeletal pain.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Health care use and costs of children, adolescents, and young adults with somatic symptom and related disorders [^9b5f6ec7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs) are highly prevalent and account for a large proportion of health system visits.,, Presentation of these psychiatric disorders can be varied, but the core features are physical symptoms inconsistent with history, physical examination, or laboratory or imaging investigations., Types of SSRDs include somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder (also called functional neurological symptom disorder), illness anxiety disorder, and psychological factors affecting medical conditions.In these disorders, psychological or emotional distress is experienced through physical symptoms, known as somatic symptoms. Associated terms include functional disorders and, historically, medically unexplained symptoms. There is overlap in the diagnostic classification of SSRDs with other conditions, such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome. SSRDs are associated with considerable impairment in functioning, including school absenteeism, social isolation, reduced quality of life, unnecessary and sometimes harmful diagnostic testing, and delays in appropriate treatment and intervention for what is actually a primary mental health disorder. Delays in diagnosis and treatment often lead to frustration and worry in patients and families who may feel dismissed.Similarly, health care professionals experience distress in failing to improve their patients’ functioning.

An SSRD contributes to substantial personal, health system, and societal costs., Some work has been done in adults to better characterize health system use and costs in these populations, but little has been done in children, adolescents, and young adults., Although most patients with somatic symptoms are seen in primary care settings,, a proportion of individuals may be so distressed or impaired by their symptoms that they seek care in an emergency department (ED) or are hospitalized (becoming inpatients). In these latter settings, patients may present with a more severe form of the disorder, with high intensity and often unmet health care needs. Identification or diagnosis of the disorder, regardless of setting, represents an opportunity for intervention, but acceptance of diagnosis and navigation of treatment pathways are often not easy.Given the barriers to appropriate care that these patients face, characterizing the patterns of health care use, including the setting in which patients receive their diagnosis and the care received after somatic symptoms have been identified along with associated costs, will shed light on the magnitude of the issue and opportunities for intervention. Our objectives were to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of children, adolescents, and young adults with an SSRD in Ontario, Canada’s largest province with a population of almost 14 million, and to describe the patterns of health care use and costs in the population in the year leading up to and the year after diagnosis.

### Patients' perspectives on the impact of a new COPD diagnosis in the face of multimorbidity: a qualitative study [^569724e0]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide and is expected to become the third by the next decade.In Australia, 4% of all deaths in 2006 were attributed to COPD.Primarily caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, COPD is an independent risk factor for lung cancerand causes a progressive, irreversible deterioration in patients’ quality of life.

COPD often occurs in the presence of other chronic health conditions, known as comorbidities,which might be related (concordant), such as asthma or depression, or unrelated (discordant), like diabetes or fibromyalgia.Irrespective of being concordant or discordant, comorbidities may influence experience and management of the disease by patients.This coexistence of two or more chronic health conditions in the same individual is known as multimorbidity,which is the rule rather than the exception in primary care.Multimorbidity contributes to higher healthcare utilisation with associated increase in time and costs, especially in older adults.In 2008, multimorbidity data extraction from two Australian primary care practices revealed respiratory diseases to be the third most common domain.

There are numerous clinical outcome measures available to quantify the health-related impact of COPD and its comorbidities,, but a need exists for qualitative research to better understand coping strategies in patients with COPD.Though there is a growing amount of literature about the impact of comorbidities on COPD and vice versa,, research focused on patients’ experience of these interactions is limited. While some studies have explored patients’ attitudes and beliefs of living with the disease,there is a dearth of qualitative research regarding patients’ perspectives on the impact of COPD diagnosis.In particular, no studies seem to have focused on the experience of newly diagnosed COPD patients with comorbidities, especially in primary care.

Our qualitative research study is an attempt to fill this gap by exploring primary care patients’ perspectives regarding the impact of a new diagnosis of COPD in the context of multimorbidity.

### Patient-reported improvements in health are maintained 2 years after completing a short course of cognitive behaviour therapy, exercise or both treatments for chronic widespread pain: long-term results from the MUSICIAN randomised controlled trial [^23b4c58e]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have shown that after a short-course of tCBT and/or a personalised exercise programme, approximately one-third of patients with CWP reported a positive primary outcome (change in condition) 24 months after end of treatment, significantly better than patients receiving TAU, where the improvement was one in eight. tCBT and exercise appeared to be similarly beneficial, and there was no advantage gained from providing both. Combined treatment, however, did appear to produce greater improvements in several secondary outcome measures 24 months post-treatment (compared to usual care and after correction for multiple testing). tCBT was highly cost-effective in the long-term, with the cost per QALY ranging between approximately £4k and £6k, depending on the method of analysis.

A number of points should be considered when interpreting our results. First, participants reported CWP (rather than having a diagnosis of fibromyalgia) and were recruited through primary care. Thus, many in the study population had symptoms that were less severe, as evidenced by the CPG and reported work status, than would typically be seen by rheumatologists. Second, it could be argued that the positive results were due to non-specific benefits from participating in a trial rather than the specific effects of the interventions delivered. Supporting such an interpretation is the similarity of positive effects across all active intervention groups (including the group receiving both interventions). Against this interpretation, CWP has proved very difficult for rheumatologists and others to treat, and so it seems unlikely that such strongly positive improvements resulted from simply ‘attention’. We also demonstrated improvements in some of the secondary outcomes related to participants’ perceptions of improvement in their condition. If our initial results were due to non-specific effects, we would expect such effects to wane with time. Instead, we have observed persistence of strong effects over 2 years. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that persons more likely to benefit from tCBT have characteristics that tCBT seeks to change. We recognise, however, that not all patients with CWP will necessarily be willing to consider undertaking exercise or participating in a CBT programme. Our results, therefore, can only be extrapolated to those willing to do so and, in this study, 70% of persons randomised to tCBT completed at least six sessions while 50% of persons randomised to exercise attended the gym at least two times per week. Third, the study was not powered to undertake a robust analysis of those patients who might benefit most from each treatment. However, our strongly positive results for the primary outcome, and given the current interest in stratified medicine, provide an indication of those persons with CWP who may be most likely to benefit. This may be helpful given that CBT is not available everywhere in the UK or elsewhere. Finally, we did not restrict the usual care provided by the GP. However, no participant in the TAU arm reported receiving ‘talking therapy’ or exercise therapy at follow-up. With no pharmacological therapies licensed in the UK for fibromyalgia (of which CWP is the cardinal feature), management is likely to have focused on advice, investigation and management of specific reported symptoms.

### Progression of fibromyalgia: results from a 2-year observational fibromyalgia and chronic pain study in the US [^c3c967e8]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic transitions

Among the 76 FM+CWP+ subjects who completed the baseline and follow-up assessments, the majority (56 [73.7%]) still met the study definition of FM at follow-up. Ten subjects (two from FM−CWP− and eight from FM−CWP+) transitioned into the FM+CWP+ group (Figure 1). Twenty subjects no longer met the study definition for FM at follow-up and transitioned to the FM−CWP− (eleven) or FM−CWP+ (nine) group (Figure 1). Analysis by site and geographic region did not suggest that the transitions were driven by any particular site(s).

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^a93ab4da]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Alternatives in diagnosing FM are needed

Analogous to the Complex Regional Pain Syndromes (CRPS), we support the paradigm which defines FM as a Complex Generalized Pain Syndrome (CGPS). Neurogenic inflammatory modulation processes have been demonstrated to play a role in both CRPS and FM.However, for both pain disorders there is no generally accepted neurochemical surrogate-marker to identify the disorders (yet). Subsequently, the diagnosis must further be made phenotypically. Analogous to the “Budapest Criteria” for CRPS, the “ABC Indicators” presented in this study introduce a method to diagnose FM phenotypically. By retaining the SSS, they reflect a possible further development of the 2011 ACR criteria.

However, before proposing new ways to optimize FM diagnosis, the function of the medical-diagnostic process of FM criteria must undoubtedly be clarified: As experts share the opinion that FM may occur alongside, for example, rheumatological diseases, FM may neither represent an exclusion diagnosis, nor a residual category within rheumatological diseases (Figure 1).–

Figure 1 
The fibromyalgia syndrome and the ABC indicators within the context of functional pain syndromes and rheumatological diseases.

Based on the above-mentioned possibility of a comorbid rheumatological disorder, peripheral biomorphologic pain correlates must be identified or ruled out in clinical practice, as is the case with any other complex pain syndrome.

Additionally and independent of this first step, patients should be tested specifically for FM symptoms. In absence of a simple diagnostic surrogate-marker-test for FM, patients should be tested for positive clinical characteristics of FM. These clinical indicators should be in line with the current medical understanding of the syndrome. The combination of the indicators should capture the clinical phenotype of FM as accurately as possible and correctly identify it within the spectrum of other pain syndromes.

### Prevalence of fibromyalgia in fourteen Korean tertiary care university hospital pain clinics [^769deb43]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a condition characterized by chronic soft tissue pain with a number of comorbidities.Epidemiological studies have reported that the prevalence of FM is ~2%–4% in the general population and is much more common in women than in men, as well as among the elderly.FM is typically associated with chronic widespread pain and tenderness to palpation, resulting from a generalized low pain threshold. Currently, this change in threshold is attributed to changes in various neurotransmitters in patients with a genetic predisposition to FM.

The first uniform diagnostic criteria for FM were developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990. These 1990 ACR criteria required the presence of at least 11 of 18 specified tender anatomical points upon palpation. Although “palpation” is defined as the application of about 4 kg of force, in clinical practice this procedure may vary depending on the physician. Therefore, this criterion has been criticized as subjective and time-consuming.The 1990 ACR criteria also failed to account for many typical comorbid symptoms experienced by most FM patients. Due to these shortcomings, in 2010, new ACR criteria (2010 ACR criteria), with an emphasis on easy application in clinical practice, were proposed.In these revised 2010 criteria, a widespread pain index (WPI), a specific type of self-report scale, was included in place of the previous tender point diagnostic criteria. A symptom severity (SS) scale was also proposed, with a focus on the comorbid symptoms experienced by FM patients.

### Temporal relationship between osteoarthritis and comorbidities: a combined case control and cohort study in the UK primary care setting [^28f60bff]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study estimated the burden of comorbidities prior to the diagnosis of OA and the risk of developing comorbidities following the diagnosis of OA using a nationally representative large UK primary care database. The key findings are that people diagnosed with OA are significantly more likely to have multimorbidity both prior to and following the diagnosis of OA; while MSK, GI, cardiovascular and psychological conditions were associated with OA in both directions, dementia and SLE were only associated with OA after its diagnosis.

Associations in both retrospective and prospective analyses

In this study, OA was found to be associated with large numbers of conditions. This is the first-ever study to examine the association of OA with a large number of conditions in the same primary care cohort. Multimorbidity associations with OA before and after the diagnosis reveal the important role of MSK conditions. Both multimorbidity and OA have positive relationships with ageing. Multiple shared risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, medication use and the possible role of inflammation in multimorbidity might lead to OA, and vice versa. Age-related changes in widespread structural components such as collagen and reduced reparative potential with age may also play a role in development of ‘degenerative diseases’ in multiple tissues and systems.

Associations of OA with some of the identified MSK comorbidities in this study agree with previous studies, such as for RA. The bidirectional associations with discrete chronic pain–related conditions such as fibromyalgia, back pain and IBS could result from shared non-restorative sleep and central pain sensitization, which causes a decreased pain threshold and exacerbation of other causes of pain. The association of OA with gout was stronger before the diagnosis of OA than after, and this might be explained in part by the ‘amplification loop’ of cartilage damage enhancing urate crystal deposition and urate crystals causing cartilage damage. We also found the risk of osteoporosis following a diagnosis of OA was higher than the risk before the diagnosis of OA, but the evidence of their association remains speculative and controversial. Care must be taken in interpreting these associations, especially where joint pain is the reason for the consultation, since GP diagnoses are predominantly clinical and not pathological. Also, although characteristics of these various MSK conditions differ, there is still the possibility of misdiagnosis, especially for atypical cases.

### Health inequities and societal costs for patients with fibromyalgia and their spouses: a Danish cohort study [^a0dcc08d]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent chronic pain disorder reported to affect approximately 2% of the general population worldwide,and up to 6% of the general European population.The typical patient is female in her 40s or 50s presenting with widespread pain and tenderness, for which no apparent tissue-based pathology can be identified. Other defining symptoms include sleep disturbance, fatigue and cognitive impairment, as well as symptoms related to internal organ systems.FM is strongly associated with disability affecting daily life activities,incapacity for normal employment and poor social participationand has been shown to also influence the physical health, mental well-being and healthcare use of spouses of people with FM.

Although common, management of FM continues to represent a clinical challenge. Confirming a diagnosis of FM is often difficult and prolonged and excessive healthcare utilisation with numerous clinical visits, investigations and specialist consultations prior to obtaining a diagnosis have been documented by several studies.This delay is unfortunate as studies have shown that a diagnostic label provides the patient with meaning and value for symptoms, which facilitate management and reduce healthcare utilisation, with cost reduction further augmented by early diagnosis.Additional research indicates that a diagnosis of FM fails to provide definitive answers or bestow validity and significance to the illness experience of patients unless followed by an immediate and targeted intervention.Despite this, research persistently illuminates issues across countries in service provision and access for individuals with FM. These include challenges facing general practitioners seeking involvement of secondary care services for people with FM, lack of multidisciplinary, specialised services to support those affected and low levels of patient satisfaction.

Cost-of-illness studies are necessary to inform the public and the healthcare system as well as the policy makers of the socioeconomic impact of health disorders and how to best organise service provision. Previously published studies have evaluated the economic burden of FM finding a heavier economic burden of FM compared with other disorders or healthy subjects.However, these cost-of-illness studies are not easily comparable to a Danish setting for several reasons such as the perspective of the cost analysis, the healthcare system varying per country and the cost components considered. Most studies are based on small and highly selected patient samples, and few have had access to high-quality register data for both patients and spouses. Thus, the overall objectives of the Danish FM cost-of-illness study were to assess the burden of illness of individuals with FM and their spouses compared with selected match populations in Denmark.

### Electronic medical record data to identify variables associated with a fibromyalgia diagnosis: importance of health care resource utilization [^af74403a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

A unique and important observation of this analysis is the identification of health care resource utilization categories as variables associated with an FM diagnosis. Previous studies that evaluated health care utilization in FM patients have found substantial utilization of these services.Results of the current study not only support the high utilization of health care resources in patients diagnosed with FM, but expand on the previous literature by comparing these patients with a control cohort that did not receive a diagnosis of FM. These results suggest that the statistically significant differences between these two cohorts may be of use to identify those having a higher likelihood of a future FM diagnosis. In particular, in addition to inpatient and outpatient visits and prescriptions, “Visits in which diagnostic/laboratory tests were ordered” was also significantly different between cohorts, with respect to both frequency and number of units. Indeed, “Visits in which diagnostic/laboratory tests were ordered” had the highest OR (5.8) of all the evaluated health care resource categories. This variable may be of special interest as a predictor of an FM diagnosis, since there is often a gap between FM symptom onset and diagnosis that results in high resource use in the years before diagnosis when patients may be searching for the cause of their symptoms.Recognition of a higher use of diagnostic/laboratory tests may indicate those patients requiring further evaluation using a guideline-based approach for identifying the presence of FM.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^96454b9d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia have been subject to debate and controversy for many years. The preliminary diagnostic criteria introduced in 2010 and 2011 have been criticized for different reasons, including questionable diagnostic specificity and a lack of an etiopathogenetic foundation. The “ABC indicators” presented in this study reflect a further development of the 2011 criteria and refer to (A) algesia, (B) bilateral, axial-symmetric pain distribution, and (C) chronic distress.

Patients and methods

We compared the diagnostic performance of the ABC indicators with that of the 2011 criteria by analyzing the data of 409 inpatients with chronic functional pain divided into two subgroups of pain patients: Those with whole-body pain and those with pain not involving the whole body. Under the premise that FM phenotypically represents a whole-body pain disorder, sensitivity, specificity, correct classification and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated.

Results

The 2011 criteria demonstrated a specificity of 68.1%, a sensitivity of 75.5%, a correct classification of 71.0% and a diagnostic odds ratio of 6.56 (CI: 4.17–10.31). The ABC indicators achieved a specificity of 88.3%, a sensitivity of 62.3%, a correct classification of 78.6%, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 12.47 (CI: 7.30–21.28).

Conclusion

The ABC fibromyalgia indicators demonstrated better specificity, lower sensitivity, and better overall diagnostic effectiveness than the original 2011 criteria.

### Criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia: validation of the modified 2010 preliminary American College of Rheumatology criteria and the development of alternative criteria [^e95b6a8e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate the 2011 modification of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia (2011ModCr) and develop alternative criteria in a sample of patients with diverse pain disorders that are commonly seen in everyday practice by pain specialists, rheumatologists, and psychologists.

Methods

Eight clinicians from geographically varied locations in the US evaluated patients with chronic pain and psychiatric disorders using a standard set of questions that included the 2011ModCr questions, the Symptom Impact Questionnaire (SIQR), a 28-area pain location inventory (PLI), and the Short Form 36. Alternative diagnostic criteria were developed from the same data set using logistic regression and receiver operating curve analysis.

Results

Complete data on 321 patients were evaluated; there were 135 patients with fibromyalgia (according to the 1990 ACR criteria) and 186 patients with 16 other common chronic pain problems. Comparing the 2011ModCr with the 1990 ACR criteria provided a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 67%, and a correct classification of 74%. Alternative criteria were derived from the 10-item symptom score from the SIQR symptoms and the 28-area PLI. Maximal diagnostic accuracy was obtained with ≥17 pain sites (range 0-28) and an SIQR symptom score of ≥21 (range 0-50). These alternative criteria had a diagnostic sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 80%, and a correct classification of 80%.

Conclusion

The 2011ModCr had robust operating characteristics. Alternative criteria based on symptom items from the SIQR and pain locations from the PLI had comparable operating characteristics, with somewhat better specificity and ease of use.

Selection of Studies and Data Extraction

Two independent researchers meticulously screened the literature and extracted pertinent data. Following the initial extraction, they cross-examined each other’s findings to ensure accuracy and consistency. In cases of disagreement, the researchers either engaged in a discussion to resolve the issue or, if necessary, sought the opinion of an independent third party for resolution. The extracted data encompassed: a. General information about each study; b. Baseline characteristics of the research subjects and the treatment methods employed; c. Key elements for assessing the risk of bias; d. Outcome measures and related data.

Risk of Bias of the Included Studies

The risk of bias in the included studies was independently assessed by two researchers, Ye and Miao. They also cross-examined their assessments to confirm consistency. In instances where differing opinions arose regarding the quality of a study, a third author, Huang, was consulted for a re-evaluation. The assessment of the risk of bias in RCTs was guided by the tool recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, version 5.1.0.

### Fibromyalgia [^0bf57ea8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and associated fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other cognitive and somatic symptoms. For many patients, these symptoms persist for years and lead to frequent health care use; for some, fibromyalgia and its symptoms can be debilitating. Although many treatments are available, management remains challenging. This article highlights the clinical features of fibromyalgia, discusses diagnostic criteria and their evolution, and reviews treatment options.

### Comparison of medical costs generated by IBS patients in primary and secondary care in the Netherlands [^2e8e73f6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Comparison with similar studies

It is remarkable that in our study, the costs for other functional disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia, fatigue and unexplained pain) in IBS patients are not very high, although high rates of co-occurrence of IBS with other functional diseases have been reported. In the Netherlands, both in primary and secondary care, only one diagnosis per specialty can be designated per treatment. The general practitioner and specialist may be inclined to select the diagnosis with the highest reimbursement value as a result of this policy. Because the reimbursement value for functional disorders is relatively low, this result might lead to an under diagnosis.

The increase in antacid use after the IBS diagnosis in secondary care may be explained by the fact that more than in primary care, gastroenterologists are aware of the overlap between IBS and upper gastrointestinal symptoms. This results is frequent co-prescription of antacids, H 2 blockers and PPI’s in patients diagnosed with IBS.

Strengths and limitations

The extrapolated incidence of IBS in our study population was 5. 4/1000/year, which is in line with the IBS incidence reported for primary care in the Netherlands. This indicates that the patients sample we extracted is representative for primary care IBS patient group in the Netherlands.

A strong point of this study is the long observation period. Whereas the majority of previous studies have gathered information for up to one year [,–], we gathered total costs over four years. Because data from the insurance company are based on reimbursement, the dataset provide insight into valid medical costs and not proxy costs calculated from medical file research or questionnaire data.

The demographic characteristics of our IBS population are notable. The Achmea population is slightly older than the mean Dutch population. In the Netherlands, approximately 15 % of the population is 65 years or older; for the Achmea population, this is 18 %. In the studies of Akehurst et al. Creed et al. and Hillillä et al. the mean ages of the studied populations were 47, 39 and 42 years, respectively. The mean age of our IBS population (i.e. 49 for primary care; 53 for secondary care) is higher. Total health care costs increase with age and decrease with a higher educational level. College-educated subjects incur significantly lower health care costs through their insurance program. The Achmea population has a lower educational level (as measured by the postal code) compared to the average Dutch population.

### A prospective study of the 1-year incidence of fibromyalgia after acute whiplash injury [^3ab6a3d2]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of fibromyalgia

The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was established by the Modified 2010 (ACR) criteria questionnaire.The Modified 2010 ACR criteria for fibromyalgia indicate that a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is satisfied when the following three conditions are met: (1) the Widespread Pain Index is ≥7 and the Symptom Severity Score is ≥5, or the Widespread Pain Index is 3–6 and the Symptom Severity Score is ≥9; (2) symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months; and, (3) the patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. Recent studies have shown that these criteria can be examined by a questionnaire that can be completed by patients without a clinical examination, and that a total score of >12 (of a maximum of 31) has a high sensitivity and specificity for the gold standard diagnosis of fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist.In order to not bias the author or other treating physicians, the participants completed the Modified 2010 ACR criteria questionnaire on their own, then the patient placed the questionnaire results in an envelope, numbered and matched to their name at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postinjury. This data were kept from the author's knowledge until 1 year follow-up was complete. Then, after an anonymisation process (each patient's name removed and replaced with their envelope number), data entry took place.

Participants were asked to return for 3-month, 6-month and 1-year assessments even if improved or recovered. Since the author was also involved in the care of these participants for other medical problems, the author also used these opportunities to capture data on recovery and obtain completed the Modified 2010 ACR criteria questionnaires at or near the follow-up periods, as did the involved primary care physicians and associated nursing staff. Where necessary, the questionnaires were mailed to patients or they were contacted to come to the clinic to complete them, and multiple efforts were made to obtain the highest rate of questionnaire return. At the same time, staff and other physicians assisted in ensuring the patients completed and returned their questionnaires as near to the follow-up times as possible. The Modified 2010 ACR criteria questionnaire was not labelled as a ‘fibromyalgia’ questionnaire, but rather a ‘follow-up general health questionnaire’.

### Progression of fibromyalgia: results from a 2-year observational fibromyalgia and chronic pain study in the US [^157a254f]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Follow-up assessment

The follow-up assessment (2013–2014) was conducted ∼2 years after the baseline data collection, and subjects who completed the screening survey, site visit, and questionnaire at baseline were eligible to participate for a follow-up assessment. Eligible subjects received an e-mail invitation from Toluna to participate in the follow-up assessment. Subjects for whom an e-mail address was no longer in use or a response was not received after five e-mail attempts were called by the study site that performed the subject’s baseline evaluation. Study sites made three call attempts, each on separate days at different times, before considering the subject lost to follow-up. Subjects were reassessed for FM by the site physician and completed the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening Questionnaire at the site visit. Subjects then completed an online questionnaire, which included the same PROs as the baseline questionnaire.

Seventeen physicians (five from West, four from Midwest, four from South, and four from Northeast) participated during the follow-up assessment, including nine rheumatologists, two pain specialists, and six primary care physicians. Three sites could not participate at follow-up; subjects who attended one of these three sites at baseline were invited to complete the online subject questionnaire at follow-up but were not assessed by a physician. As they did not have a physician assessment for FM at follow-up, they were excluded from the current analysis.

This observational study received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from Quorum Review IRB, Seattle, Washington and Western Institutional Review Board, Olympia, Washington. At baseline and follow-up subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects and sites received compensation commensurate with their time.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^100c5332]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This systematic review and NMA was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

Search strategy

Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist with input from our expert advisers to identify RCTs in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PyscINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

Study selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel‐group, cross‐over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention. Studies that compared two or more regimens of the same treatment (eg, varying doses of the same drug) were excluded if a placebo or another intervention group was not considered. Two reviewers (MI and CR) independently screened a sample of 100 titles and abstracts at the beginning of the study selection process and compared results to ensure consistency. The remaining citations were divided into two sets and allocated to the same two reviewers. All potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full and assessed by one reviewer for inclusion with a second reviewer checking all articles that were labeled unclear and 10% of the excluded articles. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers.
