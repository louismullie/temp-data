## Question

For detecting a brain tumor, should the MRI be done with contrast or without contrast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether MRI for detecting a brain tumor should be done with contrast or without contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the consensus from major guidelines to anchor the standard of care. Then, I should verify the incremental diagnostic value of gadolinium and where it changes management. Next, I need to consider important exceptions, like non-enhancing tumors and leptomeningeal disease. After that, I should assess safety, contraindications, and risk mitigation strategies for gadolinium. Finally, I will synthesize a practical protocol tailored to common scenarios and note validated alternatives and emerging techniques where contrast is limited or deferred, ensuring each step is evidence-linked to NCCN, EANO, and AANS/CNS guidance [^111N89ic] [^115ddpWc] [^116wmHE8] [^1152kFNX].

> Let me first confirm the baseline standard of care. Across NCCN, EANO, and AANS/CNS guidance, brain tumor MRI should be performed with and without gadolinium as the first-line diagnostic and surveillance imaging modality, because MRI is more sensitive than CT for brain metastases and comprehensive anatomic coverage requires pre- and post-contrast sequences for gliomas and glioblastoma as well as for surveillance of treated disease [^111N89ic] [^115ddpWc] [^116wmHE8] [^1152kFNX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without quantifying why contrast matters; I should verify the diagnostic yield. Gadolinium-based contrast increases lesion conspicuity and detects additional lesions, with reports that approximately 20% of brain metastases are missed on pre-contrast imaging alone, which can alter staging and radiosurgical eligibility, while FDA-reviewed data show that paired pre- and post-contrast sets improve lesion enhancement, border delineation, and internal morphology over non-contrast alone [^113yALKB] [^116hGVbR]. Let me also consider management implications: precise definition of enhancing tumor informs surgical planning and stereotactic radiosurgery targeting, and higher-relaxivity or optimized sequences can further sharpen margins and extent of disease for resection and radiotherapy planning [^111eF6oi] [^115t3eCL].

> Wait, I should confirm the caveat that enhancement is not synonymous with malignancy and its absence does not exclude high grade. Up to 18% of high-grade gliomas can be non-enhancing, and population data show that roughly one-third of non-enhancing supratentorial gliomas are malignant, especially in older adults; this is exactly why T2 and FLAIR are indispensable for detecting infiltrative, non-enhancing tumor and should be included alongside pre- and post-contrast T1 in any minimum exam for suspected low-grade glioma or infiltrative lesions [^112sRdCp] [^114gfoLc] [^112X9fsw]. Let me reconsider the sequence weighting: T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities often extend beyond enhancing borders, so non-contrast anatomic and diffusion sequences remain critical even when contrast is used [^112X9fsw].

> I need to check safety and contraindications carefully. I initially said "absolute contraindication" in severe renal failure; hold on, I should verify and correct that nuance: the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is highest with certain linear agents in advanced renal failure, while current practice favors macrocyclic agents with far lower NSF risk even in reduced GFR, used only after risk–benefit analysis; gadolinium deposition in deep gray nuclei is documented but with unclear clinical significance, prompting dose vigilance especially in children and those requiring repeated exams, and environmental concerns are increasingly acknowledged in GBCA stewardship [^111Kvjx5] [^111FDqWS] [^111fVBGm]. I should confirm that pediatric protocols still generally recommend a single macrocyclic dose at diagnosis and follow-up when contrast is needed, balancing risk mitigation with diagnostic necessity [^111FDqWS].

> Next, I should review risk mitigation strategies. Let me first confirm dosing: a single 0.1 mmol/kg dose is standard and supported by labeling, and using macrocyclic agents is preferred to minimize NSF and deposition risks, with careful justification for each administration in surveillance settings [^116hGVbR] [^111FDqWS]. I need to ensure technical optimization as well: higher field strengths permit dose reduction while preserving or improving contrast, and adjusting acquisition timing to slightly delayed post-contrast can increase measurable enhancing tumor volume and conspicuity; black-blood or dark-blood 3D T1 techniques with magnetization transfer can further suppress background blood/tissue signal and improve lesion detection compared with conventional MPRAGE [^115DrdVG] [^115pJtdb] [^116PphnP] [^111BHcyb] [^11114ucX].

> But wait, what if contrast is contraindicated or we aim to reduce it; can we safely omit it. In selected benign or stable lesions or known non-enhancing low-grade gliomas on surveillance, a non-contrast protocol augmented with advanced techniques can be reasonable if clinical questions are addressed, whereas suspected or known brain metastases generally require contrast because small lesions are frequently missed without it, and leptomeningeal disease assessment is markedly enhanced by post-contrast 3D T1 and 3D FLAIR when available [^111fVBGm] [^113yALKB] [^113ZJtTH]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives when GBCAs are avoided: diffusion, ASL perfusion, SWI, MRS, and APTw can provide complementary information that increases specificity, although they do not fully replace contrast for many indications, especially for small metastases or meningeal disease [^111Kvjx5] [^115FPptX] [^114cbm88].

> I will now examine the core protocol elements I would recommend for a comprehensive brain tumor MRI. Let me first confirm the anatomic backbone: pre-contrast axial T1, T2, and FLAIR with diffusion-weighted imaging and ADC are baseline, followed by high-resolution post-contrast 3D T1 (MPRAGE or 3D TSE black-blood with magnetization transfer) acquired with adequate delay for conspicuity; when leptomeningeal spread is a concern, add post-contrast 3D FLAIR; for physiologic characterization and therapy response, include DSC or DCE perfusion and consider MRS as feasible [^112X9fsw] [^111BHcyb] [^113ZJtTH] [^116Wh4iY] [^115DZbGx]. I should double-check that technical timing matters: a modest delay after injection can increase measurable enhancement and lesion visibility, which can be operationalized without prolonging overall slot time when planned prospectively [^116PphnP].

> Let me consider key clinical scenarios to tailor the protocol. For suspected or known brain metastases, contrast-enhanced 3D T1 with black-blood preparation and magnetization transfer improves detection of small lesions and reduces vessel mimics, which is crucial for accurate lesion counts informing SRS eligibility and planning; for pediatric tumors, contrast remains recommended at diagnosis and follow-up but with macrocyclic agents and strict single-dose strategies given deposition concerns, while advanced diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopy provide incremental value beyond enhancement patterns alone [^111BHcyb] [^111tgQB5] [^111eF6oi] [^111FDqWS] [^1127m3W9]. For diffuse low-grade glioma, because malignant transformation can precede enhancement, multiparametric markers such as focal low ADC, elevated rCBV, and abnormal spectroscopy should be tracked longitudinally even when enhancement is absent, maintaining pre- and post-contrast imaging when safe to do so [^112X9fsw] [^115DZbGx] [^115K1oxH].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging options and their current limitations. APT-weighted imaging and other CEST methods can add molecular contrast without gadolinium but require careful artifact management and are best interpreted alongside conventional and perfusion imaging; deep-learning approaches can enhance low-dose contrast images or predict "virtual contrast", yet generalization across tumor types and clinical settings remains a work in progress, so these should complement, not replace, standard GBCA-enhanced MRI at this time; at centers with 7T, improved lesion conspicuity and potential dose reduction are feasible but availability and standardization vary [^114cbm88] [^111TfG8b] [^117TQMmq] [^111VhDUc] [^112sXFq5].

> In summary, I should confirm that the default, evidence-aligned protocol for brain tumor evaluation is MRI with and without gadolinium, anchored by T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, and a high-quality post-contrast 3D T1 sequence, expanding to post-contrast 3D FLAIR for leptomeningeal disease and adding perfusion and spectroscopy for characterization and response assessment, while using macrocyclic agents at single standard dose with timing and sequence optimization; contrast-sparing strategies are reserved for selected scenarios or contraindications, where advanced non-contrast techniques can partially substitute but generally do not supplant GBCA for metastasis detection or meningeal assessment [^115ddpWc] [^116wmHE8] [^111N89ic] [^1152kFNX] [^113ZJtTH] [^111Kvjx5] [^111fVBGm].

---

MRI with contrast is **the standard for brain tumor imaging** [^116wmHE8] [^111N89ic] because it detects and delineates tumors by highlighting blood–brain barrier disruption [^111Kvjx5], improving diagnostic confidence and treatment planning [^116hGVbR] [^111eF6oi] [^115ddpWc]. Non-contrast MRI is **reserved** for patients with severe renal impairment [^111Kvjx5], allergy, or pregnancy [^111fVBGm]. For initial diagnosis [^115ddpWc], follow-up, or suspected recurrence [^1152kFNX], **use MRI with and without contrast**; for low-grade gliomas or when contrast is contraindicated [^111fVBGm], use **non-contrast MRI with advanced sequences** (DWI, ASL, MRS) [^115FPptX].

---

## Clinical indications for MRI with contrast

MRI with contrast is **indicated** for:

- **Initial diagnosis and characterization**: Detects and delineates tumors by highlighting blood–brain barrier disruption [^111Kvjx5] [^115ddpWc].

- **Differentiation of tumor types**: Helps distinguish primary tumors, metastases, and lymphoma.

- **Treatment planning**: Guides surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy by defining tumor extent and margins [^111eF6oi].

- **Monitoring treatment response and recurrence**: Detects residual or recurrent tumor and differentiates from treatment effects [^1152kFNX].

---

## Clinical indications for MRI without contrast

MRI without contrast is **indicated** when:

- **Contraindications to contrast**: Severe renal impairment, allergy, or pregnancy [^111Kvjx5] [^111fVBGm].

- **Low-grade gliomas**: Often non-enhancing; advanced non-contrast sequences (DWI, ASL, MRS) can provide diagnostic information [^112X9fsw] [^115FPptX].

- **Screening and follow-up**: Useful for benign or stable lesions, especially with advanced non-contrast techniques [^115FPptX].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity

MRI with contrast has **higher sensitivity and specificity** than non-contrast MRI [^116hGVbR] for detecting and characterizing brain tumors, particularly small lesions and metastases [^111N89ic], and leptomeningeal disease [^113ZJtTH]. Non-contrast MRI may miss small or subtle lesions, especially metastases [^113yALKB], and is less accurate for tumor grading and differentiation [^111Kvjx5].

---

## Risks and limitations

MRI with contrast **carries risks**, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in renal impairment and gadolinium deposition in the brain [^111FDqWS], although the clinical significance is unclear [^111Kvjx5]. Non-contrast MRI avoids these risks but may have lower diagnostic accuracy and may miss small or subtle lesions [^111Kvjx5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **MRI with and without contrast** as the first-choice imaging modality [^116wmHE8] for brain tumors, including gliomas [^115ddpWc] and metastases [^111N89ic]. Non-contrast MRI is reserved for specific scenarios, such as when contrast is contraindicated [^111Kvjx5] or for low-grade gliomas.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended MRI protocol** |
|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis and characterization | MRI with and without contrast |
| Treatment planning | MRI with and without contrast |
| Monitoring treatment response and recurrence | MRI with and without contrast |
| Contraindications to contrast | MRI without contrast (advanced sequences) |
| Low-grade gliomas | MRI without contrast (advanced sequences) |

- **Question**: What is the optimal imaging technique to be used in the diagnosis of a suspected low grade glioma, specifically: which anatomic imaging sequences are critical for most accurately identifying or diagnosing a low grade glioma (LGG) and do non-anatomic imaging methods and/or sequences add to the diagnostic specificity of suspected low grade gliomas?

- **Target population**: These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed lesion with a suspected or histopathologically proven LGG.

- **Level II evidence**: In patients with a suspected brain tumor, the minimum magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam should be an anatomic exam with both T2-weighted and pre- and post-gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Critical imaging for the identification and diagnosis of low grade glioma includes:

	- In patients with a suspected brain tumor, anatomic imaging sequences should include T1 and T2-weighted and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR sequences, and will include T1-weighted imaging after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast.

	- Computed tomography (CT) can provide additional information regarding calcification or hemorrhage, which may narrow the differential diagnosis. At a minimum, these anatomic sequences can help identify a lesion, its location, and potential for surgical intervention.

	- Improvement of diagnostic specificity with the addition of non-anatomic (physiologic and advanced imaging) to anatomic imaging: Class II evidence from multiple studies and a significant number of Class III series support the addition of diffusion and other advanced imaging techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### Recommendations on the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the diagnosis and monitoring of common adult intracranial tumours [^111fVBGm]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have been indispensable in intracranial tumour imaging, particularly for detecting and characterising malignant lesions, as well as assessing treatment response and disease progression. However, growing concerns about gadolinium deposition in the central nervous system and its environmental impact have prompted a re-evaluation of its use, particularly in the management of benign or stable lesions.

This review examines the role of GBCAs in imaging the most common types of intracranial tumours, including gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cranial nerve tumours, and metastases. Recent advancements in high-field MRI scanners and the increasing adoption of 3D T2-weighted sequences, which provide excellent soft-tissue contrast, offer significant opportunities to minimise or eliminate GBCA use. Moreover, advanced MRI methods, such as arterial spin labelling for perfusion imaging and the obtention of synthetic images, have emerged as non-invasive alternatives that further enable contrast-free imaging.

The development of ultra-high-relaxivity contrast agents offers the potential to reduce doses when GBCAs are required. While GBCAs remain essential for imaging certain high-grade gliomas and complex tumour cases, alternative imaging techniques can often replace them in many benign or stable lesions, ensuring diagnostic accuracy and prioritising patient safety. This review highlights strategies to optimise GBCA use, focusing on reducing reliance on GBCAs across different intracranial tumour types.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^111Kvjx5]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase lesion detection and improve disease characterization for many cerebral pathologies investigated with MRI. These agents, introduced in the late 1980s, are in wide use today. However, some non-ionic linear GBCAs have been associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with kidney failure. Gadolinium deposition has also been found in deep brain structures, although it is of unclear clinical relevance. Hence, new guidelines from the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine advocate cautious use of GBCAs in clinical and research practice. Some linear GBCAs were restricted from use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2017.

This review focuses on non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques that can serve as alternatives for the use of GBCAs. Clinical studies on the diagnostic performance of non-contrast-enhanced as well as contrast-enhanced MRI methods, both well established and newly proposed, were included. Advantages and disadvantages, together with the diagnostic performance of each method, are detailed.

### Multiparametric MRI: practical approach and pictorial review of a useful tool in the evaluation of brain tumours and tumour-like lesions [^115DZbGx]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

MRI plays a vital role in the assessment of intracranial lesions. Conventional MRI has limited specificity. Multiparametric MRI, utilizing diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allows for a more accurate assessment of the tissue microenvironment. This educational pictorial review aims to demonstrate the role of multiparametric MRI in diagnosis, treatment planning, and assessing treatment response. It also provides a practical approach for performing and interpreting multiparametric MRI in the clinical setting. A variety of cases are presented to demonstrate how multiparametric MRI can help differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions compared to conventional MRI alone.

### Analysis of neoplastic lesions in magnetic resonance imaging using self-organizing maps [^116iutHs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

To provide an improved method for the identification and analysis of brain tumors in MRI scans using a semi-automated computational approach, this study proposes a more objective, precise, and quantitatively rigorous analysis compared to human visual analysis.

- **Background**: Self-organizing maps (SOM) are an unsupervised, exploratory data analysis tool, which can automatically categorize an image into self-similar regions or clusters based on measures of similarity. SOM can be used to perform image-domain analysis of brain tissue on MR images without prior knowledge.

- **Design/Methods**: We used SOM to analyze T1, T2, and FLAIR acquisitions from two MRI machines in our service from 14 patients with brain tumors confirmed by biopsies: three lymphomas, six glioblastomas, one meningioma, one ganglioglioma, two oligoastrocytomas, and one astrocytoma. The SOM software analyzed the data from the three image acquisitions from each patient and generated a self-organized map for each, containing 25 clusters.

- **Results**: Damaged tissue was separated from the normal tissue using the SOM technique. Furthermore, in some cases, it allowed the separation of different areas within the tumor, like edema/peritumoral infiltration and necrosis. In lesions with less precise boundaries in FLAIR, the estimated damaged tissue area in the resulting map appears larger.

- **Conclusions**: Our results show that SOM has the potential to be a powerful MR imaging analysis technique for the assessment of brain tumors.

### Brain tumours at 7T MRI compared to 3T — contrast effect after half and full standard contrast agent dose: initial results [^115pJtdb]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the contrast agent effect of a full dose and half the dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in brain tumours at 7 Tesla (7 T) MR versus 3 Tesla (3 T) MR.

- **Methods**: Ten patients with primary brain tumours or metastases were examined. Signal intensities were assessed in the lesion and normal brain. Tumour-to-brain contrast and lesion enhancement were calculated. Additionally, two independent readers subjectively graded the image quality and artefacts.

- **Results**: The enhanced mean tumour-to-brain contrast and lesion enhancement were significantly higher at 7 T than at 3 T for both half the dose (91.8 ± 45.8 vs. 43.9 ± 25.3 [p = 0.010], 128.1 ± 53.7 vs. 75.5 ± 32.4 [p = 0.004]) and the full dose (129.2 ± 50.9 vs. 66.6 ± 33.1 [p = 0.002], 165.4 ± 54.2 vs. 102.6 ± 45.4 [p = 0.004]). Differences between dosages at each field strength were also significant. Lesion enhancement was higher with half the dose at 7 T than with the full dose at 3 T (p = 0.037), while the tumour-to-brain contrast was not significantly different. Subjectively, contrast enhancement, visibility, and lesion delineation were better at 7 T and with the full dose. All parameters were rated as good, at the least.

- **Conclusion**: Half the routine contrast agent dose at 7 T provided higher lesion enhancement than the full dose at 3 T, which indicates the possibility of dose reduction at 7 T.

- **Key Points**
- The contrast effect of gadobenate dimeglumine was assessed at 7 T and 3 T.
- In brain tumours, contrast effect was higher at 7 T than at 3 T.
- Tumour-to-brain contrast at 7 T half dose and 3 T full dose were compared.

### Clinical experience with Multihance in CNS imaging [^113wJNDc]. European Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Use of Gd-BOPTA as a contrast agent for morphological and functional MR imaging allows improved detection and delineation of CNS lesions compared with conventional gadolinium agents. This not only leads to more confident diagnoses being made, but also results in a substantially improved differential diagnostic process. The higher relaxivity of Gd-BOPTA helps to optimize functional MR imaging studies, for example, perfusion MR imaging and dynamic MR angiographic protocols.

### State-of-the-art imaging for glioma surgery [^115FNm44]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Discussion

How can imaging aid glioma surgery? Gliomas are often widespread in the brain at the time of diagnosis, making curative resection impossible. However, there is accumulating evidence that removing more of the tumor improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Since glioma is an infiltrative disease, macroscopic recognition of the tumor within the normal brain can be very difficult. Imaging has the potential to visualize the tumor and thus overcome the macroscopic challenges. Ideally, an imaging modality would have 100% sensitivity, not missing any tumors, and 100% specificity, only showing tumors. Unfortunately, available imaging is not yet that accurate.

Use of standard MRI to guide glioma resection, however, has a positive impact on treatment. Intraoperative MRI, fluorescence, and ultrasound can aid in achieving complete resection of standard MRI abnormalities. Given the propensity of gliomas to extend beyond standard imaging abnormalities, the next logical step is to extend the resection beyond these abnormalities. Evidence is accumulating that other modalities like PET and MRSI, or FLAIR MRI in the case of enhancing tumors, could guide these extended resections.

An alternative approach is the use of functional boundaries instead of imaging to guide resection. Intraoperative mapping during awake surgery can define the limits of resection, potentially postponing malignant transformation in low-grade gliomas (LGG). The pitfall of functional boundaries lies in the choice of functions to test; removing more of the brain can lead to more deficits depending on how thoroughly the functions are assessed.

### Tryptophan PET predicts spatial and temporal patterns of post-treatment glioblastoma progression detected by contrast-enhanced MRI [^112CKkcw]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Amino acid PET is increasingly utilized for the detection of regliosmas. Increased amino acid uptake is often observed outside the contrast-enhancing brain tumor mass. In this study, we evaluated if non-enhancing PET+ regions could predict spatial and temporal patterns of subsequent MRI progression in previously treated glioblastomas.

Twelve patients with a contrast-enhancing area suspicious for glioblastoma recurrence on MRI underwent PET scanning with the amino acid radiotracer alpha-[(11)C]-methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT). Brain regions showing increased AMT uptake in and outside the contrast-enhancing volume were objectively delineated to include high uptake consistent with glioma, as defined by previous studies. Volume and tracer uptake of such non-enhancing PET+ regions were compared to spatial patterns and timing of subsequent progression of the contrast-enhancing lesion, as defined by serial surveillance MRI.

Non-enhancing PET+ volumes varied widely across patients and extended up to 24 mm from the edge of MRI contrast enhancement. In ten patients with clear progression of the contrast-enhancing lesion, the non-enhancing PET+ volumes predicted the location of new enhancement, which extended beyond the PET+ brain tissue in six. In two patients, with no PET+ area beyond the initial contrast enhancement, MRI remained stable. There was a negative correlation between AMT uptake in non-enhancing brain and time to subsequent progression (r = -0.77, p = 0.003).

Amino acid PET imaging could complement MRI not only for detecting glioma recurrence but also predicting the location of subsequent progression.

### Human cerebral blood volume measurements using dynamic contrast enhancement in comparison to dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI [^116Bq1E2]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cerebral blood volume (CBV) is an important parameter for the assessment of brain tumors, usually obtained using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. However, this method often suffers from low spatial resolution and high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts and usually does not take into account the effect of tissue permeability. The plasma volume (vp) can also be extracted from dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCE can be used for the measurement of cerebral blood volume in place of DSC for the assessment of patients with brain tumors.

- **Methods**: Twenty-eight subjects (17 healthy subjects and 11 patients with glioblastoma) were scanned using DCE and DSC. vp and CBV values were measured and compared in different brain components in healthy subjects and in the tumor area in patients.

- **Results**: Significant high correlations were detected between vp and CBV in healthy subjects in the different brain components; white matter, gray matter, and arteries, correlating with the known increased tissue vascularity, and within the tumor area in patients.

- **Conclusion**: This work proposes the use of DCE as an alternative method to DSC for the assessment of blood volume, given the advantages of its higher spatial resolution, its lower sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts, and its ability to provide additional information regarding tissue permeability.

### Neuroimaging in pediatric brain tumors: Gd-DTPA-enhanced, hemodynamic, and diffusion MR imaging compared with MR spectroscopic imaging [^1127m3W9]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-enhanced MR images assist in defining tumor borders; however, the relation between tumor cell extent and contrast-enhanced regions is unclear. Our aim was to improve conventional neuroimaging of pediatric brain tumors with hemodynamic, diffusion, and spectroscopic MR imaging.

- **Methods**: We performed conventional MR and MR spectroscopic imaging in 31 children with neuroglial brain tumors. Hemodynamic MR imaging was conducted in 16 patients with a first-pass intravenous bolus of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA); apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured in 12 patients. To account for multiple measurements in a patient, we used a nested analysis of variance.

- **Results**: At MR spectroscopy, choline (Cho)-containing compounds (indicating tumor) and lipid levels (indicating necrosis) did not correlate with percent Gd-DTPA enhancement on MR images. Percent enhancement was positively correlated with relative cerebral blood volumes (rCBVs) (P = .05) and negatively correlated with ADCs (P < .001). Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that rCBV (P = .008), ADC (P = .022), and lipid (P < .001) levels were significant independent predictors of percent enhancement. Tumor spectral patterns were detected in tumor regions and outside enhancing tumor beds in patients with clinical progression, confirmed at neuropathologic analysis.

- **Conclusion**: MR spectroscopic imaging improves the assessment of pediatric brain tumors by adding biochemical information regarding tumor involvement and by depicting residual or recurrent tumors.

### Brain tumor imaging [^111QKpZ8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Modern imaging techniques, particularly functional imaging techniques that interrogate some specific aspect of underlying tumor biology, have enormous potential in neuro-oncology for disease detection, grading, and tumor delineation to guide biopsy and resection; monitoring treatment response; and targeting radiotherapy. This brief review considers the role of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy and positron emission tomography in these areas and discusses the factors that limit translation of new techniques to the clinic, in particular, the cost and difficulties associated with validation in multicenter clinical trials.

### Review and consensus recommendations on clinical APT-weighted imaging approaches at 3T: Application to brain tumors [^1117nhnf]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a molecular MRI technique that generates image contrast based on endogenous mobile proteins and peptides in tissue. As a type of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging, the principles and applications of APTw imaging have been reviewed in several articles. Key abbreviations and nomenclature used in the field of APTw imaging are listed in Table 1.

Data from numerous institutions worldwide have demonstrated that APTw imaging adds important value to the standard clinical MRI sequences in brain cancer diagnoses, such as the detection and grading of tumors, the assessment of treatment effect versus tumor recurrence, prognosis related to tumor progression and survival, and the identification of genetic markers. It is worth mentioning that brain tumor patients require frequent MRI exams, and the exposure to gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents has been indicated as a risk for people with moderate to advanced kidney failure and for Gd deposition in the brain.

Although promising, there are several remaining challenging issues for clinical APTw imaging. These include scanner RF amplifier constraints, specific absorption rate (SAR) limits, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), long scan times, a complicated contrast mechanism with multiple contributions, B1 inhomogeneity, and the possibility of artifacts due to motion, B0 inhomogeneity, and lipids.

The most concerning issue from a radiologist's point of view is that APTw signal intensities depend on the APTw signal intensities.

### Diffusion-perfusion in intra-axial brain tumors with high relaxivity contrast agents [^114o8dTK]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

A high relaxivity contrast agent is indicated for use in MRI of the central nervous system to visualize lesions with an abnormal blood-brain barrier (BBB) or abnormal vascularity of the brain. We evaluated MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine, Gd-BOPTA) on T2✱-weighted perfusion imaging in 33 histologically proven intra-axial brain tumors. The higher T1 relaxivity, and therefore better contrast-enhanced T1 imaging, led to significantly better tumor delineation. The higher T2 relaxivity allowed high quality T2✱ perfusion MRI and post-processed rCBV maps, with a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg MultiHance.

### Synthetic generation of DSC-MRI-derived relative CBV maps from DCE MRI of brain tumors [^111aAkXp]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Perfusion MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents is useful for the diagnosis and treatment response evaluation of brain tumors. Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI are two gadolinium-based contrast agent perfusion imaging techniques that provide complementary information about the tumor vasculature. However, each requires a separate administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the feasibility of synthesizing relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, as computed from DSC MRI, from DCE MRI of brain tumors.

- **Methods**: One hundred nine brain tumor patients underwent both DCE and DSC MRI. Relative CBV maps were computed from the DSC MRI, and blood plasma volume fraction maps were computed from the DCE MRIs. Conditional generative adversarial networks were developed to synthesize rCBV maps from the DCE MRIs. Tumor-to-white matter ratios were calculated from real rCBV, synthetic rCBV, and plasma volume fraction maps and compared using correlation analysis. Real and synthetic rCBV in white and gray matter regions were also compared.

- **Results**: Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the tumor rCBV and tumor-to-white matter ratios in the synthetic and real rCBV maps were strongly correlated (ρ = 0.87, P < .05 and ρ = 0.86, P < .05, respectively). Tumor plasma volume fraction and real rCBV were not strongly correlated (ρ = 0.47). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference between the synthetic and real rCBV tumor-to-white matter ratios of 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval.

### Detection of brain metastases by contrast-enhanced MRI: Comparison of gadopiclenol and gadobenate in a mouse model [^115uGSWs]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Among the 41 animals, 14 mice did not develop detectable tumors, and 9 mice died after the injection of tumor cells or from anesthesia during the imaging procedure. A total of 18 mice met the criteria for inclusion (n = 6 in each group).

A total of 47 enhancing lesions (1 to 7 per animal) were detected in the 18 mice during the blinded analysis of the MR images approximately 4 weeks after cell injection. Brain lesions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 4 mice (randomly chosen) to characterize the metastases and confirm the detected contrast enhancement areas.

### "Comet tail SIGN": A pitfall of post-gadolinium magnetic resonance imaging findings for metastatic brain tumors [^116AAamY]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Metastatic brain tumors occur in 8.5–40% of patients with systemic cancers. Recent advances in the systemic management of cancer patients and novel imaging techniques have led to an increase in the number of long-term survivors with brain metastases. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most reliable diagnostic technique for metastatic brain tumors. Typical MR images show tumor mass lesions with well-circumscribed enhancement; they have isointense or high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images and low-intensity signals on T1-weighted images. These lesions are surrounded by areas of peritumoral edema of various sizes.

A highly enhanced peripheral area was found, attached to an enhanced main tumor mass in the brain parenchyma. This peripheral enhancement exhibited a constant pattern of intense and homogeneous signals, appearing to bud off from the main tumor mass. We recognized this as a unique feature among brain metastases. A series of cases with this characteristic enhancing pattern were compiled. We termed this pattern the "comet tail sign" (CTS) because of its resemblance to a shooting star with a tail.

The purpose of the study was to retrospectively demonstrate the MR features of CTS and to clarify its clinical relevance in our patient series.

### Dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging with contrast agent leakage correction aids in predicting grade in pediatric brain tumours: a multicenter study [^111FDqWS]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, concerns have arisen regarding the use of gadolinium contrast agents. Individuals with poor renal function have been shown to be at risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis following gadolinium exposure, while recent studies have demonstrated increased signal caused by T1 shortening on MRI scans due to contrast agent deposition in areas of the brain, including the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus, after prior exposure to gadolinium. Children are at low risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; however, there are concerns about the long-term effects of gadolinium deposition in children's brains, especially in those undergoing repeated MR examinations with contrast agents.

Guidance mandates the use of macrocyclic rather than linear agents to minimize risks, the administration of a single dose titrated by weight, and a risk-versus-benefit analysis before prescribing contrast agents, with consideration given to non-contrast methods. In patient groups such as children with brain tumors, it is still recommended to administer a single-dose contrast agent during MRI scans at diagnosis and follow-up for the acquisition of post-contrast conventional MRI. While this remains the case, acquiring dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI after the contrast injection presents no added risks compared to routine imaging and provides an efficient use of resources. A power injector is recommended for the reproducible administration of contrast agents during dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI. This procedure requires venous access via a cannula, which is invasive and can be challenging, particularly in children.

### Effect of contrast leakage on the detection of abnormal brain tumor vasculature in high-grade glioma [^1155GFrE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormal brain tumor vasculature has recently been highlighted by a dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI processing technique, which employs independent component analysis (ICA) to separate arterial and venous perfusion. The overlap of the two, i.e. arterio-venous overlap (AVOL), preferentially occurs in brain tumors and predicts response to anti-angiogenic therapy. The effects of contrast agent leakage on the AVOL biomarker have yet to be established.

DSC was acquired during two separate contrast boluses in ten patients undergoing clinical imaging for brain tumor diagnosis. Three components were modeled with ICA, which included the arterial and venous components. The percentage of each component, as well as a third component, was determined within contrast-enhancing tumor and compared. AVOL within enhancing tumor was also compared between doses.

The percentage of enhancing tumor classified as not arterial or venous and instead into a third component with contrast agent leakage apparent in the time-series was significantly greater for the first contrast dose compared to the second. The amount of AVOL detected within enhancing tumor was also significantly greater with the second dose compared to the first. Contrast leakage results in large signal variance classified as a separate component by the ICA algorithm. The use of a second dose mitigates the effect and allows measurement of AVOL within enhancement.

### The optimal use of contrast agents at high field MRI [^115DrdVG]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The intravenous administration of a standard dose of conventional gadolinium-based contrast agents produces higher contrast between the tumor and normal brain at 3.0 Tesla (T) than at 1.5 T, allowing the dose to be reduced to half of the standard amount to achieve similar contrast at 3.0 T compared to 1.5 T. The assessment of cumulative triple-dose 3.0 T images obtained the best results in detecting brain metastases compared to other sequences.

The contrast agent dose for dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging at 3.0 T can be reduced to 0.1 mmol compared to 0.2 mmol at 1.5 T due to the increased susceptibility effects at higher magnetic field strengths. Contrast agent application makes susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) at 3.0 T clinically attractive, with an increase in spatial resolution within the same scan time.

While a double dose of conventional gadolinium-based contrast agents was optimal in SWI with respect to sensitivity and image quality, a standard dose of gadobenate dimeglumine, which has a two-fold higher T1-relaxivity in blood, produced the same effect. For MR-arthrography, optimized concentrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents are similar at 3.0 and 1.5 T. In summary, high field MRI requires the optimization of the contrast agent dose in different clinical applications.

### Optimizing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging characterization of brain metastases: Relevance to stereotactic radiosurgery [^111eF6oi]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Intracranial metastases are the most common form of intra-axial brain tumor. Management approaches to brain metastases include surgical resection, whole-brain radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The management approach that is selected is typically based on algorithms that incorporate the number, size, and location of lesions. SRS is the treatment of choice when metastases detected on imaging are few (maximum, 3–5) and/or of small size (≤ 30 mm) and offers the advantages of noninvasiveness and the ability to treat inaccessible lesions compared with surgical resection.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard imaging technique for determining the number, size, and location of metastatic lesions. In SRS, the capability of MRI to delineate lesion borders precisely in three dimensions helps reduce recurrence rates and minimize radiation necrosis in surrounding tissue. Optimization of the MRI protocol, including selection of the appropriate gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), is paramount for accurate lesion imaging. GBCAs differ in their safety, tolerability, and efficacy because of their diverse physicochemical properties. Gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine are high-relaxivity GBCAs that demonstrate superior efficacy for imaging metastatic lesions compared with other GBCAs, whereas gadobutrol additionally provides macrocyclic stability.

This article reviews recent comparative trials of GBCAs and discusses their relevance for optimizing MRI protocols in the management of brain metastases, with particular relevance to SRS.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^113yALKB]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Brain tumor detection and characterization is an area where contrast-enhanced MRI is frequently used. However, since the first reports on the application of contrast-enhanced MRI, techniques for non-contrast-enhanced MRI have evolved. As tumor localization and extent are two essential issues in pre-operative brain tumor imaging, non-contrast-enhanced MRI should be able to detect and localize primary brain tumors. This can be achieved, for example, by T2 FLAIR imaging showing high signal intensity in low-grade gliomas. In high-grade gliomas, increased signal on T2 FLAIR can encompass tumor edema with tumor cells. Imaging-histology correlation data show that primary malignant brain tumors rarely have surrounding edema without interspersed tumor cells outside the contrast-enhanced area. Compared to contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion imaging can better depict the perifocal tumor density and effects on surrounding white matter tracts.

Further issues in brain tumor imaging relate to the characterization of tumor type and malignancy grade. It is known that contrast enhancement is an imperfect marker of malignancy grade. In comparison to primary brain tumors, cerebral metastases can be multiple and small, with a potential increased lesion detection rate by the use of GBCAs. Although it may be feasible to exclude the use of GBCA without limiting the ability to detect primary brain tumors, imaging of secondary brain tumors cannot be performed without GBCA. One study reported that 20% of cerebral metastasis were undetected on pre-contrast echo-planar imaging.

### VCAM-1-targeted MRI improves detection of the tumor-brain interface [^117XoirX]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

**Translational relevance**: Clinical neuroimaging techniques for characterizing brain tumors are limited in their capacity to detect the invasive margin. Failure to detect and adequately treat the invasive tumor margin contributes to future recurrence and increased patient mortality. We present a novel application of a molecularly targeted MRI contrast agent against VCAM-1, a sensitive marker for microvascular inflammation, to better delineate the interface between tumor and adjacent brain tissue compared with conventional MRI techniques. Thus, VCAM-1–targeted MRI presents an opportunity to augment existing imaging paradigms to tailor treatment planning and delivery. Moreover, avoiding inadvertent treatment of uninvolved tissue would reduce the risk of side effects and therapy-related morbidities.

### Optimization of workflow for detection of brain metastases at 3T: is a black-blood MTC prepared 3D T1 used alone robust enough to replace the combination of conventional 3D T1 and the black-blood 3D T1 MTC [^111BHcyb]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly contrast-enhanced (CE) three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted (T1w) imaging, is the standard of reference in brain metastases detection due to its excellent soft-tissue contrast. T1w sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) is a 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence that is inherently black-blood (i.e. saturation of signal from blood vessels due to intravoxel dephasing among blood spins) and has the advantage of a low specific absorption rate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The corresponding sequences for the SPACE sequence from other MRI manufacturers include CUBE for General Electric, VISTA/BRAINVIEW for Philips, isoFSE for Hitachi, and 3D MOVX for Canon. Critically, as some slow flow distribution (e.g. in cortical veins) may be inaccurately suppressed, the SPACE sequence is generally accompanied by an additional black-blood preparation module, such as delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE), to optimize blood-related signal suppression. A magnetization transfer preparation contrast (MTC) can also be added to the SPACE sequence to suppress the signal from background tissues and render CE areas more conspicuous. This enables the sequence to be highly sensitive in detecting secondary brain lesions. In fact, the combination of MTC and the use of paramagnetic contrast agents improves the contrast between enhancing areas (e.g. intracerebral tumors) and surrounding tissue, thereby enhancing tumor detection.

### CEST MRI of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake and accumulation in brain tumors [^114PKxkc]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to explore the use of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-OMG), a nonmetabolizable structural analog of glucose, as a CEST-contrast agent for tumor detection. We specifically investigate its application for CEST detection of malignant brain tumors and draw comparisons to D-glucose.

- **Methods**: Glioma xenografts of a U87-MG cell line were implanted in five mice. Dynamic 3-OMG weighted images were collected using CEST-MRI at 11.7 T at a single offset of 1.2 ppm. This procedure showed the effect of the accumulation of the contrast agent in the tumor, following an intravenous injection of 3-OMG at a dose of 3 g/kg.

- **Results**: Tumor regions exhibited higher enhancement compared to the contralateral brain. The CEST contrast enhancement in the tumor region ranged from 2.5% to 5.0%, while it was 1.5% to 3.5% in the contralateral brain. Previous studies using D-glucose on the same tumor model demonstrated an enhancement of 1.5% to 3.0% in the tumor and 0.5% to 1.5% in the contralateral brain. The signal gradually stabilized and persisted for the duration of the scan.

- **Conclusions**: 3-OMG demonstrates a CEST contrast enhancement approximately twice that of D-glucose for a similar tumor line. Given its suggested low toxicity and ability to transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 3-OMG presents itself as a viable, nonmetallic contrast agent for evaluating brain tumors.

### Multiparametric MRI: Practical approach and pictorial review of a useful tool in the evaluation of brain tumours and tumour-like lesions [^115K1oxH]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The presence of contrast enhancement in a brain tumour is often regarded as a sign of malignancy; however, non-enhancing gliomas are malignant in approximately one-third of cases. This has an impact upon treatment, patient outcome, and overall survival, as conventional MRI has limitations for the grading of brain tumours. Transforming low-grade gliomas can show changes in multiparametric features before contrast enhancement is seen on conventional imaging. In the case of perfusion imaging, a significant increase in rCBV can be seen up to 12 months before transformation is observed on conventional imaging. Multiparametric MRI features of a transforming low-grade glioma include focal low ADC, high Cho/Cr ratio (> 1.8), low NAA, and the presence of lactate and lipids on MRS.

In the early stages of malignant transformation, only one or two of the above parameters may be abnormal focally within the tumour, and any longitudinal changes in multiparametric information can suggest a transforming tumour. Early detection of malignant transformation, before contrast enhancement is seen on conventional MRI, will allow early initiation of appropriate treatment, which will ultimately improve the patient's overall survival.

Typical multiparametric MRI features of a transforming low-grade glioma are demonstrated in Fig. 4.

- **Figure 4**: Malignant transformation of low-grade glioma. T2W, FLAIR, and post-contrast T1W sequences demonstrate a non-enhancing signal abnormality in the left temporal lobe.

### Computer-aided detection of metastatic brain tumors using magnetic resonance black-blood imaging [^115grf68]. Investigative Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop a computer-aided detection system for automated brain metastases detection using magnetic resonance black-blood imaging and compare its applicability with conventional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) imaging.

Twenty-six patients with brain metastases were imaged with a contrast-enhanced, 3-dimensional, whole-brain magnetic resonance black-blood pulse sequence. Approval from the institutional review board and informed consent from the patients were obtained. Preprocessing steps included B1 inhomogeneity correction and brain extraction. The computer-aided detection system used 3-dimensional template matching, which measured normalized cross-correlation coefficient to generate possible metastases candidates. An artificial neural network was used for classification after various volume features were extracted. The same detection procedure was tested with contrast-enhanced MP-RAGE, which was also acquired from the same patients.

The performance of the proposed detection method was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity values. In the black-blood case, the detection process displayed an AUROC of 0.9355, a sensitivity value of 81.1%, and a specificity value of 98.2%. Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo data showed an AUROC of 0.6508, a sensitivity value of 30.2%, and a specificity value of 99.97%.

The results demonstrate that accurate automated detection of metastatic brain tumors using this method is feasible, showing improved sensitivity and specificity in magnetic resonance black-blood imaging compared to MP-RAGE.

### Exploring the limitations of virtual contrast prediction in brain tumor imaging: A study of generalization across tumor types and patient populations [^111VhDUc]. NMR in Biomedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Accurate and timely diagnosis of brain tumors is critical for patient management and treatment planning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used modality for brain tumor detection and characterization, often aided by the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to improve tumor visualization. Recently, deep learning models have shown remarkable success in predicting contrast enhancement in medical images, thereby reducing the need for GBCAs and potentially minimizing patient discomfort and risks.

In this paper, we present a study aimed at investigating the generalization capabilities of a neural network trained to predict full contrast in brain tumor images from noncontrast MRI scans. While initial results exhibited promising performance on a specific tumor type at a certain stage using a specific dataset, our attempts to extend this success to other tumor types and diverse patient populations yielded unexpected challenges and limitations. Through a rigorous analysis of the factors contributing to these negative results, we aim to shed light on the complexities associated with generalizing contrast enhancement prediction in medical brain tumor imaging, offering valuable insights for future research and clinical applications.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^114fFYYD]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The role of GBCAs and contrast enhancement in neuroimaging is complex. It remains unclear how gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are absorbed and eliminated from the brain. The blood-brain barrier, with its tight junctions in the vessel endothelium and specific exclusion mechanisms, generally prevents large molecules such as GBCAs from entering the brain. However, disease processes that compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, often due to inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions, can lead to the leakage of GBCAs through these compromised blood vessels. This results in increased signal on T1-weighted images, highlighting affected areas compared to the normal brain.

Although the presence of contrast enhancement on brain MRI is indicative of disrupted tight junctions, identifying enhancement alone does not specify the underlying pathological process. This non-specificity can occasionally lead to ambiguity in clinical decision-making, as various disease processes can produce similar imaging findings.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging: A comprehensive overview [^112sRdCp]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Differentiation of brain tumors**: A few recent studies demonstrated that support vector machine-based classifiers using histogram features of the ADC from diffusion MRI (AUC = 0.97) could better discriminate between different types of posterior fossa tumors in children than contrast-enhanced T1 or T2 images (AUC = 0.84). Texture features from conventional non-contrast-enhanced MRI showed sufficient accuracy to separate childhood tumors into the correct classes (accuracy 71–92%), which is higher than the clinical radiological reading of the cases (47% correct diagnosis).

	- Non-contrast-enhanced MRI can also differentiate between cerebral lymphoma and GBM by the use of ADC with an AUC of 0.94. This can also be achieved by ASL with an AUC of 0.91 and an accuracy of 95%. MRS can discriminate between metastases and CNS lymphoma/GBM with equal diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.96) as perfusion MRI with contrast agent injection (AUC = 0.97). Further, ASL, T2 relaxometry, DKI, and APTw imaging can discriminate between cerebral metastasis and GBM with sufficient diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.84, 0.86, 1.00, and 0.91, respectively). Aiming to increase the specificity of contrast-enhanced imaging, one can use perfusion weighting such as dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. This will allow discrimination between glioblastoma, metastasis, and primary central nervous system lymphoma with accuracy between 0.94 and 0.99.

- **Tumor grade discrimination**: High-grade primary brain tumors are not always contrast enhancing. In fact, up to 18% of high-grade gliomas can be non-enhancing. Magnetic reson

### From dose reduction to contrast maximization: Can deep learning amplify the impact of contrast media on brain magnetic resonance image quality? A reader study [^111TfG8b]. Investigative Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a deep learning method designed to increase the contrast-to-noise ratio in contrast-enhanced gradient echo T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. The processed images are quantitatively evaluated in terms of lesion detection performance.

A total of 250 multiparametric brain MRIs, acquired between November 2019 and March 2021 at Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus (Villejuif, France), were considered for inclusion in this retrospective monocentric study. Independent training (107 cases; age, 55 ± 14 years; 58 women) and test (79 cases; age, 59 ± 14 years; 41 women) samples were defined. Patients had glioma, brain metastasis, meningioma, or no enhancing lesion. Gradient echo and turbo spin echo with variable flip angles postcontrast T1 sequences were acquired in all cases. For the cases that formed the training sample, "low-dose" postcontrast gradient echo T1 images using 0.025 mmol/kg injections of contrast agent were also acquired. A deep neural network was trained to synthetically enhance the low-dose T1 acquisitions, taking standard-dose T1 MRI as reference. Once trained, the contrast enhancement network was used to process the test gradient echo T1 images. A read was then performed by two experienced neuroradiologists to evaluate the original and processed T1 MRI sequences in terms of contrast enhancement and lesion detection performance, taking the turbo spin echo sequences as reference.

The processed images were superior to the original gradient echo and reference turbo.

### Improved brain tumor conspicuity at 3 T using dark blood, fat-suppressed, Dixon unbalanced T1 relaxation-enhanced steady-state MRI [^11114ucX]. Investigative Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the cornerstone for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment planning. We have developed a novel dual-echo volumetric dark blood pulse sequence called Dixon unbalanced T1 relaxation-enhanced steady-state (uT1 RESS) that improves the visibility of contrast-enhancing lesions while suppressing the tissue signals from blood vessels and fat. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Dixon uT1 RESS would significantly improve the conspicuity of brain tumors compared with magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), as well as to determine potential limitations of the technique.

This retrospective study was approved by the hospital institutional review board. Forty-seven adult patients undergoing an MRI scan for a brain tumor indication were included. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was performed at 3 T using both MPRAGE and Dixon uT1 RESS. To control for any impact of contrast agent washout during the scan procedure, Dixon uT1 RESS was acquired in approximately half the subjects immediately after MPRAGE and in the other half immediately before MPRAGE. Image quality, artifacts, and lesion detection were scored by three readers, whereas lesion apparent signal-to-noise ratio and lesion-to-background Weber contrast were calculated from region-of-interest measurements.

Image quality was not rated significantly different between MPRAGE and Dixon uT1 RESS, whereas motion artifacts were slightly worse with Dixon uT1 RESS. Comparing Dixon uT1 RESS with MPRAGE, the study aimed to assess the advantages and possible drawbacks of the Dixon technique for improving the conspicuity of brain tumors.

### Neuroimaging of pediatric brain tumors: From basic to advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [^114ZmQap]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

In this review, the basic magnetic resonance concepts used in the imaging approach of a pediatric brain tumor are described with respect to different factors, including understanding the significance of the patient's age. Also discussed are other factors directly related to the magnetic resonance scan itself, such as evaluating the location of the tumor, determining if the lesion is extra-axial or intra-axial, and assessing the contrast characteristics of the lesion. Of note, there are key imaging features of pediatric brain tumors that can provide information about the cellularity of the lesion, which can then be confirmed with advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.

The second part of this review provides an overview of the major advanced MRI techniques used in pediatric imaging, particularly magnetic resonance diffusion, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and magnetic resonance perfusion. The last part of the review delivers more specific information about the use of advanced magnetic resonance techniques in the evaluation of pediatric brain tumors.

### Improving lesion detection and visualization: Implications for neurosurgical planning and follow-up [^116ju2xB]. Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is considered the most sensitive method for detecting tumors in the central nervous system (CNS). The primary objective is to improve lesion detection, delineation, and characterization (benign or malignant) to more accurately define the location, extent, and type of disease, as well as the appropriate treatment option for improved patient outcomes (surgical intervention, radiation therapy, or cytotoxic chemotherapy). This article reviews the various types of tumors occurring in the brain and the specific role of contrast-enhanced MR imaging for the evaluation of these tumors. Emphasis is placed on the value of contrast-enhanced MR imaging in evaluating primary intra-axial brain lesions and how high relaxivity contrast agents, such as MultiHance (Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy), might improve detection, treatment planning, and follow-up.

### Double-echo perfusion-weighted MR imaging: Basic concepts and application in brain tumors for the assessment of tumor blood volume and vascular permeability [^116Wh4iY]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using contrast agents plays a key role in characterizing tumors of the brain. We have shown that double-echo perfusion-weighted MR imaging (DEPWI) is potentially useful in assessing brain tumors. Quantitative indices, such as tumor blood volume, are obtained using DEPWI, which allows correction of underestimation of tumor blood volume due to leakage of contrast agents from tumor vessels, in addition to simultaneous acquisition of tumor vessel permeability. This article describes basic concepts of DEPWI and demonstrates clinical applications in brain tumors.

### Novel membrane-permeable contrast agent for brain tumor detection by MRI [^113o3ZUJ]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

One of the key challenges hindering clinical intervention against brain cancer is the inability to detect brain tumors at an early enough stage to permit effective therapy. The rapid growth and severe lethality of this form of cancer underscore the vital importance of monitoring the development of the pathology and its outcome after therapeutic intervention.

With this in mind, we designed a novel membrane-permeant contrast agent, MN-MPAP-Cy5.5. This agent consists of a superparamagnetic iron oxide core for MRI, conjugated to myristoylated polyarginine peptides as a membrane translocation module, and labeled with the near-infrared dye Cy5.5 for correlative microscopy. This probe displayed remarkable uptake by U-87 human glioma cells in vitro and localized and delineated stereotactically injected tumor in vivo by MRI.

Our findings suggest that the agent mediates its effects by translocation of the magnetic nanoparticles across the leaky tumor vasculature, followed by enhanced accumulation in tumor cells. The noninvasive detection of brain tumors when they are still small represents a formidable challenge from an imaging standpoint. Our study describes an improved strategy to detect brain lesions by utilizing a contrast agent with membrane translocation properties.

### Comparative analysis of synthetic and conventional magnetic resonance imaging features across various brain regions [^114whm5S]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

This study compared the contrast characteristics of synthetic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional MRI in normal brain tissue and tumor-related areas.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was performed on 60 patients who underwent noncontrast synthetic and conventional MRIs. Synthetic MRI was reconstructed to match conventional MRI parameters using magnetization-prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echoes and multiple spin echo sequences. The contrast in T1-weighted (T1WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted images (T2WI) was assessed across various brain regions and tumor-related areas. Relaxation times and dynamic range were analyzed, and a five-point visual assessment was conducted for overall image quality.

- **Results**: Synthetic MRI demonstrated significantly higher contrast in T1WI across all normal brain regions and most tumor-related areas (P < 0.01). For FLAIR, synthetic MRI exhibited superior contrast around the putamen (P < 0.05) but variable results in other regions. In T2WI, synthetic MRI showed higher contrast overall (P < 0.01), though conventional MRI performed better in some comparisons. Relaxation times of synthetic MRI were generally consistent with literature values but differed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lesion areas. The dynamic range of synthetic MRI was narrower. Visual assessments showed that synthetic MRI outperformed conventional MRI in all sequences except FLAIR (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Synthetic MRI provided superior overall image quality for T1WI and T2WI, particularly achieving higher T1WI contrast.

### Application of deep learning for automatic segmentation of brain tumors on magnetic resonance imaging: A heuristic approach in the clinical scenario [^116SdagL]. Neuroradiology (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate brain tumor segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has wide-ranging applications such as radiosurgery planning. Advances in artificial intelligence, especially deep learning (DL), allow the development of automatic segmentation that overcomes the labor-intensive and operator-dependent manual segmentation. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the top-performing DL model from the 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, the impact of missing MRI sequences, and whether a model trained on gliomas can accurately segment other brain tumor types.

- **Methods**: We trained the model using the Medical Decathlon dataset and applied it to the BraTS 2019 glioma dataset. Additional models were developed using individual and multimodal MRI sequences. The Dice score was calculated to assess the model's accuracy compared to ground truth labels by neuroradiologists on the BraTS dataset. The model was then applied to a local dataset of 105 brain tumors, and its performance was qualitatively evaluated.

- **Results**: The DL model using pre- and post-gadolinium contrast T1 and T2 FLAIR sequences performed best, with a Dice score of 0.878 for the whole tumor, 0.732 for the tumor core, and 0.699 for the active tumor. The lack of T1 or T2 sequences did not significantly degrade performance, but FLAIR and T1C were important contributors. All segmentations performed by the model in the local dataset, including non-glioma cases, were considered accurate by a pool of specialists.

- **Conclusion**: The DL model could use available MRI sequences to optimize glioma segmentation and adopt transfer learning to segment non-glioma tumors.

**Key points**: Gadolinium-based contrast agent injection should be used cautiously in neuroimaging. Non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques can depict specific relevant physiological processes.

### Detection of small metastatic brain tumors: Comparison of 3D contrast-enhanced whole-brain black-blood imaging and MP-RAGE imaging [^111tgQB5]. Investigative Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Early and accurate diagnosis of small metastatic brain tumors may affect outcomes and treatment strategies. For this reason, 3-dimensional (3D) thin-section imaging is preferred. However, with conventional contrast-enhanced (CE) 3D imaging, such as magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), many visually enhanced vessels may mimic small metastatic tumors, hindering tumor detection. CE black-blood single-slab 3D turbo-spin echo imaging (BB-ssTSE) was recently developed, which uses variable refocusing flip angles and flow-sensitizing gradient schemes to enhance metastatic brain tumors while selectively suppressing blood vessels. The purpose of this work was to investigate the efficiency of the proposed CE BB-ssTSE in detecting small metastatic brain tumors compared with conventional MP-RAGE.

Numerical comparisons of MP-RAGE and BB-ssTSE were performed by simulation studies to investigate the signal/contrast behaviors of flowing blood and stationary CE tumors. For in vivo studies, we enrolled 35 patients (18 women; mean age, 58.1 years) with breast or lung cancer who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. After administering a double dose of contrast medium, whole-brain 2-dimensional T1-weighted imaging followed by high-resolution isotropic 3D BB-ssTSE and MP-RAGE was performed at 3.0 T. Two reviewers independently evaluated the presence of metastatic brain tumors using:

- **MP-RAGE**
- **BB-ssTSE**
- **MP-RAGE + BB-ssTSE**: Sequential reviews were conducted in 3 sessions, 2 weeks apart.

The lesions were classified by size into 2 groups.

### Review and consensus recommendations on clinical APT-weighted imaging approaches at 3T: Application to brain tumors [^114cbm88]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Although APTw imaging is useful for brain tumor evaluation, there are pitfalls in APTw image interpretation. In addition to artifacts caused by motion and B₀ alterations, areas of large liquefactive necrosis, hemorrhage, or large vessels typically demonstrate high APTw signals and should not be mistaken for viable tumors. Figure 10 presents several representative images of liquefactive necrosis and hemorrhage at different stages. Careful interpretation is needed for post-operative-stage tumors with surgical cavities filled with proteinaceous fluid, unless a fluid suppression method is used (Figure 10C and D).

To distinguish between viable tumor and proteinaceous fluid, APTw images should generally be interpreted alongside anatomic MRI (such as T₂w, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and pre- and post-contrast T₁w), SWI, diffusion, and perfusion (including dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced and dynamic contrast-enhanced) MRI sequences that are acquired during routine clinical tumor protocols. This comparison assists in recognizing and assigning non-tumorous signals and potential artifacts on APTw images and identifying tumor viability characteristics not captured by structural and perfusion-weighted MRI (Figure 10D). The information provided by APTw MRI should be regarded as complementary to existing approaches, further extending the repertoire of diagnostic tools in radiology.

Finally, and importantly, the selection of the color scheme in the APTw images can affect the interpretability of the information contained.

### Using intraoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to identify residual tumor in glioblastoma surgery [^111M2fWL]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of surgery in high-grade gliomas is to maximize the resection of contrast-enhancing tumor tissue without inducing additional neurological deficits. Intraoperative MRI has been shown to improve surgical outcomes. However, when using contrast materials intraoperatively, distinguishing between surgically induced enhancement and residual tumor can be challenging. This study aimed to assess the utility of intraoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI in guiding this differential diagnosis and to test it against tissue histopathology.

- **Methods**: Preoperative and intraoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were performed on 21 patients with histopathologically confirmed WHO Grade IV gliomas using intraoperative 3-T MRI. For each patient, standardized regions of interest (ROIs) were manually placed at two separate contrast-enhancing areas at the resection border. Time-intensity curves (TICs) were generated for each ROI. Every ROI was biopsied, and the TIC types were compared with histopathological results. In the last 10 patients, pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted to confirm the findings of nonparametric TIC analysis.

- **Results**: Among the 42 manually selected ROIs in 21 patients, 25 (59.5%) contained solid tumor tissue, while 17 (40.5%) retained brain parenchymal architecture but contained infiltrating tumor cells. Time-intensity curves generated from residual contrast-enhancing tumor and their preoperative counterparts were comparable and exhibited a quick and persistently increasing slope ("climbing type"). All 17 TICs obtained from regions without solid tumor tissue are consistent with this characterization.

### Clinical 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging: Impact and patient value in neurological disorders [^112sXFq5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The increased magnetic field strength of 7 T MRI enables more detailed visualization of fine structures, such as tumor margins, microvasculature, small lesions, microbleeds, and subtle anatomical changes that might be missed at conventional field strengths. This is particularly useful for identifying early signs of tumor growth or recurrence and for detailed mapping of tumor-associated vasculature.

Compared to 3 T, 7 T can provide greater contrast between healthy white matter and glioblastoma tissue, with enhanced visualization of tumor infiltration into adjacent white matter tracts and improved demarcation of tumor boundaries. The improved delineation of tumor borders can help spare more healthy brain tissue. Incorporating 7 T MRI into neurosurgical navigation and radiotherapy treatment planning is technically feasible and safe.

- **Tumors**: SWI and DWI techniques are instrumental in analyzing brain structures such as microbleeds and tumor vasculature, aiding in preoperative tumor grading, tumor microstructure characterization, and visualizing radiation therapy injuries.

Glioma diagnosis traditionally requires histopathological analysis, with MRI providing grade estimation based on contrast enhancement, which has limitations. Imaging techniques such as SWI are particularly useful in visualizing neovascularization in malignant gliomas and venous structures and have the potential to improve accuracy. Longitudinal studies using 7 T SWI have tracked tumor vasculature changes during anti-angiogenic therapy, highlighting changes in brain edema, microhemorrhages, and intratumoral injuries.

### How often are nonenhancing supratentorial gliomas malignant? A population study [^114gfoLc]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The presence of contrast enhancement in a brain tumor is often regarded as a sign of malignancy. The authors identified 314 patients with malignant and low-grade supratentorial glial neoplasms in an unselected population, 58 of which lacked contrast enhancement on preoperative neuroimaging. Nonenhancing gliomas were malignant in approximately one third of cases, especially in older patients. Histologic confirmation of the diagnosis is therefore important in all patients suspected of harboring a primary glial neoplasm.

### Vcam-1-targeted MRI improves detection of the tumor-brain interface [^112Ko2er]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Low credibility.

Advancing the existing management of brain tumors will require enhanced imaging techniques for better delineating the tumor-brain interface. In preclinical studies, we have shown that it is possible to augment the sensitivity of MRI for detecting subclinical micrometastases in the brain using a contrast agent based on microparticles of iron oxide (MPIO) targeted against the cell adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; refs). These data suggest that an invasive, proliferative tumor profile is associated with endothelial VCAM-1 upregulation.

On this basis, we hypothesized that application of VCAM-1–targeted MRI may enable more sensitive delineation of the tumor-brain interface. Our initial aim, therefore, was to determine whether the tumor-brain interface in rat models of brain metastasis and glioblastoma shows upregulation of VCAM-1. Next, we wanted to assess the sensitivity of VCAM-1–targeted MPIO (VCAM-MPIO) in conjunction with T2✱-weighted MRI for detection of the tumor-brain interface compared with conventional MRI, and further extend this analysis to a xenograft model of medulloblastoma to assess its broader applicability. Finally, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between VCAM-1 upregulation, the tumor margin, and conventional MRI indices in human brain metastasis and glioblastoma samples.

### Dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging with contrast agent leakage correction aids in predicting grade in pediatric brain tumours: a multicenter study [^112Qsthn]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

This study was approved by the East Midlands–Derby research ethics committee (NRES REC ref.: 04/MRE04/41) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki (and as revised in 1983). Informed parental consent was obtained from all subjects. Suitable patients were those undergoing dynamic susceptibility-contrast MRI scans with a primary brain tumor where histological data — tumor type and grade — were subsequently obtained. We anonymized the dynamic susceptibility-contrast and clinical MRI scans and uploaded them to the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group Functional Imaging Database.

### Can virtual contrast enhancement in brain MRI replace gadolinium? A feasibility study [^117TQMmq]. Investigative Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have become an integral part of daily clinical decision-making over the last three decades. However, there is a broad consensus that GBCAs should be used exclusively when no contrast-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is available to reduce the amount of applied GBCAs in patients. This study investigates the possibility of predicting contrast enhancement from noncontrast multiparametric brain MRI scans using a deep-learning (DL) architecture.

- **Materials and methods**: A Bayesian DL architecture for predicting virtual contrast enhancement was developed using 10-channel multiparametric MRI data acquired before GBCA application. The model was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on 116 datasets from glioma patients and healthy subjects by comparing the virtual contrast enhancement maps to the ground truth contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Subjects were divided into three groups: enhancing tumors (n = 47), nonenhancing tumors (n = 39), and patients without pathologic changes (n = 30). The tumor regions were segmented for a detailed analysis of subregions. The influence of the different MRI sequences was determined.

- **Results**: Quantitative results of the virtual contrast enhancement yielded a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 91.2%. T2-weighted imaging, followed by diffusion-weighted imaging, was the most influential sequence for the prediction of virtual contrast enhancement. Analysis of the whole brain showed a mean area under the curve of 0.969 ± 0.019, indicating a peak signal-to-noise ratio.

### MR imaging of CNS tumors: Are all contrast agents created the same [^112gE2rP]. Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

The challenging and multiple goals and requirements of CNS tumor imaging necessitate the optimization of CNS imaging protocols, including the selection of the optimal contrast medium. Several gadolinium compounds are available for imaging the CNS, and all except the compound Gd-BOPTA have nearly identical profiles. The unique protein interaction of Gd-BOPTA results in double T1 and T2 relaxivity. This article summarizes the advantages of Gd-BOPTA over conventional gadolinium compounds in both conventional and functional MR imaging.

Results from recent studies in adults and pediatric patients are presented and discussed. The principal conclusion of this article is that not all contrast agents approved for MR imaging of the CNS behave the same way. The use of the high-relaxivity agent Gd-BOPTA for morphological and functional MR imaging allows improved detection and delineation of CNS lesions compared to conventional gadolinium agents. This not only permits more confident diagnoses but also results in a substantially improved differential diagnostic process. The higher relaxivity of Gd-BOPTA helps to optimize functional MR imaging studies, such as perfusion MR imaging and other dynamic MR imaging protocols.

### Evaluation of intraaxial enhancing brain tumors on magnetic resonance imaging: Intraindividual crossover comparison of gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine for visualization and assessment, and implications for surgical intervention [^115t3eCL]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The goal in this article was to compare 0.1 mmol/kg doses of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and gadopentetate dimeglumine, also known as gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), for enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of intraaxial brain tumors.

- **Methods**: Eighty-four patients with either intraaxial glioma (47 patients) or metastasis (37 patients) underwent two MR imaging examinations at 1.5 tesla, one with Gd-BOPTA as the contrast agent and the other with Gd-DTPA. The interval between fully randomized contrast medium administrations was 2 to 7 days. T1-weighted spin echo and T2-weighted fast spin echo images were acquired before administration of contrast agents, and T1-weighted spin echo images were obtained after the agents were administered. Acquisition parameters and postinjection acquisition times were identical for the two examinations in each patient.

- **Evaluation**: Three experienced readers, working in a fully blinded fashion, independently evaluated all images for degree and quality of available information (lesion contrast enhancement, lesion border delineation, definition of disease extent, visualization of the lesion's internal structures, and global diagnostic preference) and quantitative enhancement (the extent of lesion enhancement after contrast agent administration compared with that seen before its administration, or "percent enhancement", lesion/brain ratio, and contrast/noise ratio). Differences were tested with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Reader agreement was assessed using kappa statistics.

### Gadavist [^116hGVbR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients referred for an MRI of the central nervous system (CNS) with contrast were enrolled in two clinical trials that evaluated the visualization characteristics of lesions. In both studies, patients underwent a baseline, pre-contrast MRI prior to the administration of Gadavist at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg, followed by a post-contrast MRI. In Study A, patients also underwent an MRI before and after the administration of gadoteridol. The studies aimed to demonstrate the superiority of Gadavist MRI over non-contrast MRI for lesion visualization.

For both studies, pre-contrast and pre-plus-post contrast images (paired images) were independently evaluated by three readers for contrast enhancement and border delineation using a scale of 1 to 4, and for internal morphology using a scale of 1 to 3. Lesion counting was also performed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of paired Gadavist image sets compared to pre-contrast MRI. Readers were blinded to clinical information.

Efficacy was determined in 657 subjects. The average age was 49 years (range 18 to 85 years) and 42% were male. The ethnic representations were 39% Caucasian, 4% Black, 16% Hispanic, 38% Asian, and 3% from other ethnic groups.

Gadavist provided a statistically significant improvement for each of the three lesion visualization parameters when averaged across three independent readers for each study.

### Increased delay between gadolinium chelate administration and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging acquisition increases contrast-enhancing tumor volumes and T1 intensities in brain tumor patients [^116PphnP]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of delayed T1-weighted (T1-w) MRI acquisition after gadolinium chelate administration on brain tumor volumes and T1-w intensities.

Fifty-five patients with histologically confirmed, contrast-enhancing intra-axial brain tumors were analyzed in this prospective test-retest study. Patients underwent two consecutive 3 T MRI scans (separated by a 1-minute break) during routine follow-up with contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1-w), T2, and FLAIR acquisition. The macrocyclic gadolinium chelate-based contrast agent was administered only before the first ceT1-w acquisition; the median latency to ceT1-w acquisition was 6.72 minutes (IQR, 6.53–6.92) in the first and 16.27 minutes (IQR, 15.49–17.26) in the second scan. Changes in tumor volumes and relative ceT1-w intensities between the two acquisitions were quantitatively assessed following semiautomated tumor segmentation (separately for contrast-enhancement [CE], necrosis [NEC], and nonenhancing [NE] tumor).

Semiautomatically segmented CE tumor volumes were significantly larger in the second acquisition (median +32% [1.2 cm]; IQR, 16%-62%; P < 0.01), which corresponded to a 10% increase in CE tumor diameter (+0.3 cm). Contrarily, NEC and NE tumor volumes were significantly smaller (median -24% [IQR, -36% to -54%], P < 0.01 for NEC and -2% [IQR, -1% to -3%], P = 0.02 for NE tumor). Bland-Altman plots confirmed a proportional bias toward higher CE and lower NEC volumes for the second ceT1-w acquisition.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^115HjvBF]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Useful non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques

While contrast-enhancement is important to increase signal-to-background ratio for small lesions, depict an impaired blood-brain barrier, accentuate vessel structures, and estimate tissue perfusion, new non-contrast-enhanced MRI techniques must offer reliable alternatives to answer these clinical questions. There are useful sequences without GBCA, which shall be introduced here.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^113mjirV]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Limitations of static contrast enhancement in neuroimaging**: While contrast enhancement in neuroimaging is used clinically to increase sensitivity in detecting abnormalities, the specificity is often lower. For instance, static contrast enhancement alone cannot distinguish between low-grade and high-grade tumors in adults and children, pseudoprogression and true intracranial tumor progression after radiation therapy, or pseudoresponse and true response after anti-angiogenic or immunotherapy. Correctly defining treatment response is crucial for selecting optimal treatment for the patient and avoiding premature cessation of effective therapy.

	- Further examples include discriminating between a ring-enhancing metastasis and glioblastoma or abscess, and indicating low tumor grade in vascularized oligodendroglial tumors. Additionally, contrast enhancement fails to detect tumor cells infiltrating beyond the contrast-enhancing lesion into the surrounding white matter, as seen in high-grade gliomas. Moreover, the diffusion time of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is often not considered in clinical practice, potentially hindering the detection of small lesions. The variability in sensitivity of different T1-weighted sequences to the T1-shortening effects of GBCA also contributes to variable detectability.

	- **Development of time-resolved MRI techniques**: As contrast enhancement itself is unspecific for disease categorization relating to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, time-resolved MRI techniques using GBCAs have been developed. Examples include MRI perfusion or perfusion-related techniques such as dynamic susceptibility contrast.

### Brain tumor segmentation for multi-modal MRI with missing information [^116VZSuN]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown promise in brain tumor segmentation from multi-modal MRI sequences, accommodating heterogeneity in tumor shape and appearance. The fusion of multiple MRI sequences allows networks to explore complementary tumor information for segmentation. However, developing a network that maintains clinical relevance in situations where certain MRI sequence(s) might be unavailable or unusual poses a significant challenge.

One solution is to train multiple models with different MRI sequence combinations, but it is impractical to train every model from all possible sequence combinations. In this paper, we propose a DCNN-based brain tumor segmentation framework incorporating a novel sequence dropout technique, in which networks are trained to be robust to missing MRI sequences while employing all other available sequences.

Experiments were performed on the RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 Challenge dataset. When all MRI sequences were available, there were no significant differences in the performance of the model with and without dropout for enhanced tumor (ET), tumor (TC), and whole tumor (WT) (p-values 1.000, 1.000, 0.799, respectively), demonstrating that the addition of dropout improves robustness without hindering overall performance.

When key sequences were unavailable, the network with sequence dropout performed significantly better. For example, when tested on only T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences together, the DSC for ET, TC, and WT increased from 0.143 to 0.486, 0.431 to 0.680, and 0.854 to 0.901, respectively. Sequence dropout represents a re
