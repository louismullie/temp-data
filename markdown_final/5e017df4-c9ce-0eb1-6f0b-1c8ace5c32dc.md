## Question

Can Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis get mis diagnosed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis can be misdiagnosed for one another. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic location and classic clinical phenotypes of each condition. Then, I should verify the overlapping presentations that could lead to confusion. Next, I will examine specific diagnostic pitfalls and real-world misdiagnosis scenarios. After that, I need to check the comparative diagnostic tools and their limitations. Finally, I will synthesize the risk of misdiagnosis and outline practical differentiators and a diagnostic approach to minimize error.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals. Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital true diverticulum of the distal ileum, typically within 80–100 cm of the ileocecal valve, and it becomes symptomatic via bleeding from ectopic gastric mucosa, obstruction, or diverticulitis, with complications more common in children and males, though it can present at any age [^cadad053] [^db591095]. Ulcerative colitis, by contrast, is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease confined to the colon, characterized by continuous mucosal inflammation with bleeding, diarrhea, urgency, and endoscopic/histologic features that exclude other causes, and it is diagnosed primarily by colonoscopy with biopsy rather than small-bowel studies [^e6116b5a] [^7c790823].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about separateness just because the anatomy differs. I need to check where confusion arises clinically. Both entities can present with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and altered bowel habits, and in children, rectal bleeding is a common shared signal that can blur the differential, especially when the source is not immediately localized [^d3d71600] [^2875ad70]. Let me verify the age pattern: Meckel's bleeding predominates in early childhood, whereas UC is more typical after age 15–20, but exceptions occur, so age alone cannot reliably exclude either diagnosis [^cadad053] [^e6116b5a].

> Next, I should review concrete misdiagnosis scenarios. Wait, let me verify the directionality of error. The literature documents Meckel's diverticulum being mistaken for inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and, by extension, UC in the broader IBD spectrum, because ileitis near a Meckel's diverticulum can mimic IBD clinically and radiologically, and conversely, IBD can be misattributed when a Meckel's diverticulum is incidentally found or when small-bowel inflammation is misread as Crohn's rather than diverticulum-associated ileitis [^222c12fe] [^138d6a3e]. I should double-check that these reports emphasize the need for careful endoscopic and histologic correlation to avoid overcalling IBD when the inflammation is segmental and adjacent to a diverticulum [^138d6a3e].

> I will now examine the diagnostic pitfalls that enable misclassification. Let me consider imaging first: CT may show a blind-ending ileal pouch with surrounding inflammation in complicated Meckel's, but this can be misread as Crohn's disease or even appendicitis, particularly when the diverticulum is inflamed or perforated, and MR enterography has also been reported to mimic Crohn's disease in children with perforated Meckel's diverticulitis [^8f541469] [^226a07f1]. But wait, what if we rely on a Meckel's scan? Sensitivity is high in children but drops in adults, and false positives can occur with small-bowel inflammation or bleeding unrelated to ectopic gastric mucosa, so a negative scan does not exclude Meckel's and a positive scan in the wrong clinical context can mislead toward a Meckel's source when the bleeding is actually colonic from UC [^db591095] [^b997afc0]. I should confirm that capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy improve small-bowel visualization but still require clinical integration to distinguish Meckel's from IBD-related ulcers or angioectasias [^220f31b2] [^2875ad70].

> Let me think about the reverse error: UC being mistaken for Meckel's. Initially, I thought this would be uncommon because UC is colonic and Meckel's is ileal, but wait, I should verify whether colonic diverticular disease can confound the picture. Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) can mimic IBD clinically and endoscopically, and in the broader diverticular-IBD overlap literature, misclassification of colonic inflammatory processes as IBD has been described, underscoring that inflammatory colitides can be misattributed when the full colonic mucosa is not adequately sampled or when diverticular inflammation coexists [^58403309] [^013b1b9d]. Hold on, I should clarify: this is not a direct UC–Meckel's swap, but it illustrates how inflammatory colonic disease can be misread, and in the setting of obscure bleeding or overlapping symptoms, a Meckel's source might be prematurely invoked if colonoscopy is incomplete or non-diagnostic [^e6116b5a] [^220f31b2].

> Next, I should review the comparative diagnostic strengths to avoid misdiagnosis. For suspected Meckel's, a multimodality approach is often needed: Meckel's scintigraphy in children, CT/MR for complications, and device-assisted enteroscopy for direct visualization and biopsy when small-bowel sources are suspected, recognizing adult sensitivity limitations of scintigraphy and the need to correlate with bleeding pattern and age [^db591095] [^2875ad70]. For suspected UC, colonoscopy with biopsies from rectum to cecum is the gold standard to establish chronicity, distribution, and histology and to exclude infection and other mimics; if the colon is normal, UC is effectively excluded and attention should shift to small-bowel etiologies rather than anchoring on IBD [^e6116b5a] [^7c790823]. I need to ensure we also remember that in adults with obscure bleeding, age under 40 increases the likelihood of Meckel's or Crohn's disease, which should temper overcalling UC when the colon is normal or only shows nonspecific changes [^2875ad70].

> Let me synthesize the misdiagnosis risk. Yes, Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis can be misdiagnosed, but the directionality and mechanism differ. Meckel's is more often mistaken for IBD (including Crohn's) due to ileitis, obstruction, or bleeding that mimics IBD on imaging and clinical presentation, whereas UC is less commonly mistaken for Meckel's because UC is colonic and Meckel's is ileal; however, incomplete colon evaluation or coexisting inflammatory processes can lead to diagnostic error, particularly when small-bowel studies are overinterpreted in the absence of colonic confirmation of UC [^222c12fe] [^138d6a3e] [^e6116b5a]. I should double-check that the practical consequence is a high index of suspicion for Meckel's in children with lower GI bleeding and for UC in adolescents and adults with colonic symptoms, with cross-checking by age-appropriate testing and complete endoscopic evaluation to avoid premature closure [^d3d71600] [^e6116b5a].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic approach minimizes error. In children with rectal bleeding, prioritize Meckel's evaluation with scintigraphy and consider repeat imaging or enteroscopy if the first study is negative but suspicion remains high, because missing Meckel's is a key pitfall in this age group [^db591095] [^efedd36a]. In adolescents and adults with colonic symptoms, complete ileocolonoscopy with biopsies is essential to confirm or exclude UC; if the colon is normal, pursue small-bowel evaluation for Meckel's or other sources rather than assuming IBD, and interpret Meckel's scan results cautiously in adults given lower sensitivity and potential false positives in the setting of inflammation [^e6116b5a] [^b997afc0]. Hold on, I should verify that multidisciplinary review of imaging, endoscopy, and pathology is emphasized when the presentation is atypical or when inflammation is segmental and adjacent to a diverticulum, to avoid mislabeling IBD when a focal Meckel's process is the driver [^138d6a3e] [^220f31b2].

---

Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis can be misdiagnosed because their symptoms overlap (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhea) [^e6116b5a] and because Meckel's diverticulum can mimic IBD on imaging [^226a07f1] or endoscopy [^notfound]. Misdiagnosis is more likely when **colonoscopy is incomplete** or when **small-bowel disease is not evaluated** [^220f31b2]. Accurate diagnosis relies on **complete colonoscopy with biopsies** [^e6116b5a] for UC and **small-bowel imaging** (CT/MR enterography, capsule endoscopy, or Meckel scan) [^db591095] for Meckel's diverticulum. Persistent or atypical symptoms should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis and further testing [^7781f08e].

---

## Clinical overlap and diagnostic challenges

Both Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis can present with **similar clinical features**, leading to diagnostic confusion:

| **Symptom** | **Meckel's diverticulum** | **Ulcerative colitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Rectal bleeding | Common (especially in children) [^e81288e6] | Common [^e6116b5a] |
| Abdominal pain | Common (especially with diverticulitis or obstruction) [^19cc541b] | Common [^e6116b5a] |
| Diarrhea | Less common, but can occur [^notfound] | Common [^e6116b5a] |
| Anemia | Common due to chronic blood loss [^bbcabf48] | Common due to chronic blood loss [^notfound] |

---

The overlapping symptoms can lead to **initial misdiagnosis**, particularly when the clinical evaluation is incomplete or when specific diagnostic tests are not performed [^7781f08e].

---

## Diagnostic methods and limitations

### Meckel's diverticulum

- **Imaging**: CT enterography, MR enterography, and capsule endoscopy are useful for detecting Meckel's diverticulum, especially when complications such as inflammation, obstruction, or bleeding are present [^db591095] [^1dbad242].
- **Meckel scan**: Technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy is highly sensitive and specific in children but less reliable in adults, leading to potential false negatives or false positives [^db591095] [^b997afc0].
- **Endoscopy**: Double-balloon enteroscopy allows direct visualization and biopsy of the diverticulum, but it is invasive and technically challenging [^db591095] [^2d2765db].

---

### Ulcerative colitis

- **Colonoscopy with biopsies**: The gold standard for diagnosing ulcerative colitis, providing direct visualization of the colonic mucosa and histopathological confirmation [^e6116b5a].
- **Laboratory tests**: Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) and fecal calprotectin may be elevated, but these are nonspecific and can be elevated in other inflammatory conditions [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: Not routinely used for diagnosis but may be helpful in acute settings to exclude complications or alternative diagnoses [^cf809cac].

---

## Clinical scenarios leading to misdiagnosis

Several clinical scenarios can lead to **misdiagnosis** between Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis:

- **Incomplete colonoscopy**: If colonoscopy is incomplete or not performed, ulcerative colitis may be missed, and symptoms may be attributed to Meckel's diverticulum or other small-bowel diseases [^notfound].
- **Overlap with inflammatory bowel disease**: Meckel's diverticulum can present with inflammation and ulceration that mimic Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, particularly in adults [^138d6a3e] [^226a07f1].
- **Atypical presentations**: Meckel's diverticulum can present with atypical features, such as colonic involvement or fistula formation, further complicating the diagnostic process [^d7a17962].

---

## Consequences of misdiagnosis

Misdiagnosis can lead to **inappropriate management**, including unnecessary surgeries, delayed treatment, and ongoing morbidity. For example, misdiagnosing Meckel's diverticulum as ulcerative colitis may result in unnecessary immunosuppressive therapy, whereas misdiagnosing ulcerative colitis as Meckel's diverticulum may delay appropriate medical management and increase the risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Strategies to prevent misdiagnosis

To minimize misdiagnosis, clinicians should:

- **Maintain a high index of suspicion**: Consider both Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis in patients presenting with rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and diarrhea [^d3d71600].
- **Perform complete diagnostic evaluations**: Ensure complete colonoscopy with biopsies for suspected ulcerative colitis and appropriate small-bowel imaging for suspected Meckel's diverticulum [^e6116b5a] [^db591095].
- **Use multidisciplinary approaches**: Involve gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists in complex cases to ensure accurate diagnosis and management [^6a786ff4].
- **Re-evaluate persistent symptoms**: If symptoms persist despite initial treatment, reconsider the diagnosis and repeat necessary tests [^7781f08e].

---

Meckel's diverticulum and ulcerative colitis can be misdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms and limitations of diagnostic tests. Accurate diagnosis requires a **comprehensive evaluation**, including complete colonoscopy with biopsies for ulcerative colitis and appropriate small-bowel imaging for Meckel's diverticulum. Persistent or atypical symptoms should prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis and further testing.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It is usually asymptomatic but may present with complications of acute diverticular inflammation, ulceration, hemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, perforation, retained foreign bodies, enterolith formation, and neoplasm development. Thus, the preoperative radiological diagnosis is crucial for proper management of the patients. This article reviews the anatomic and clinical features of Meckel's and describes the role of imaging in the detection of Meckel's and evaluation of its associated pathological processes.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most commonly encountered true diverticulum in the small bowel. Although overall a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, it remains an important differential in a child/young adult presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. We present two MD cases, one associated with brisk bleeding resulting in haemodynamic instability and the other in insidious blood loss causing symptoms of chronic iron deficiency. These cases illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the clinical picture associated with Meckel's diverticulae, a condition most gastroenterological and surgical units will encounter. We subsequently discuss the diagnostic and management dilemma Meckel's diverticulae pose and appraise the latest evidence and management strategies in this regard.

### Multimodality imaging manifestations of the Meckel diverticulum in children [^222c12fe]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, occurring in approximately 2% of the general population. The lifetime complication rate from a Meckel diverticulum is 0.5%-2%. The most common complications include bleeding, obstruction, inflammation and perforation. However, the clinical manifestations of a Meckel diverticulum are frequently nonspecific. As a result, complications secondary to Meckel diverticulitis can mimic a variety of more common intra-abdominal processes, such as appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease and any other cause of small bowel inflammation or obstruction. The radiologist should be aware of potential manifestations of the disease on different imaging modalities. In this pictorial essay, we illustrate several complications related to the Meckel diverticulum, in multiple modalities.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small bowel. The majority of patients with this anomaly will remain asymptomatic; however, several complications may occur, including obstruction, intussusception, perforation, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. These complications may produce a variety of different clinical features and radiological appearances. The purpose of this article is to review the potential imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the imaging techniques available.

### Demystifying Meckel's diverticulum-a guide for the gastroenterologist [^db591095]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a common congenital ileal diverticulum. Whilst mostly asymptomatic, 4–9% develop complications, such as small bowel obstruction, diverticulitis or bleeding. In 1933, Charles Mayo wrote that MD is 'frequently suspected, often looked for and seldom found', and it continues to pose a diagnostic challenge today. With advancements in small bowel imaging and endoscopy, this review outlines the gastroenterologist's approach to MD.

Recent Findings

There are a number of strategies for diagnosing MD. Meckel's scan has a sensitivity of 80–92% in children but 62–88% in adults. The diagnostic yield of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is only up to 50%. Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) has a sensitivity of 84–100% for MD but is invasive. The definitive treatment for symptomatic MD is surgical resection, but the management of asymptomatic cases are controversial. A recent systematic review favoured resection of incidental MD.

Summary

A high index of suspicion and a multimodality combination of SBCE, Meckel's scan, CT and DAE is often required to diagnose MD. Complicated MD is treated by surgical resection. Management of incidental MD remains debated, although current evidence appears to favour resection.

Figure 1
Incidentally found Meckel's diverticulum.

Majority of the meckel's diverticulum remain silent and are diagnosed incidentally during small bowel contrast study, laparoscopy or laparotomy done for unrelated conditions, or until complications arise from the diverticulum. A person with Meckel's diverticulum has a 4–6% lifetime risk of developing a complication. The most common clinical presentation is gastrointestinal bleeding, which occurs in 25% – 50% of the patients having complication. Other complications include obstruction, intussusception, diverticulitis and perforation. Age wise statistics reveals that hemorrhage is the most common presentation in children aged 2 years or younger and intestinal obstruction being the commonest among adults, although some studies have found reverse. Overall, the complications have been found more common in males, with the ratios varying in different studies from 1.8:1 to 3:1. The pathogenesis of ulceration in a Meckel's diverticulum is secondary to peptic ulceration from heterotopic gastric mucosa. Although colonization of Helicobacter pylori in this ectopic gastric mucosa has been reported but its role in pathogenesis of complication is yet to established.

Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine that generally comes to attention due to a variety of complications, such as gastrointestinal tract bleeding, bowel obstruction or acute inflammation. These diverticula frequently are difficult to prospectively diagnose by imaging. Clinically, acute Meckel diverticulitis can be mistaken for acute appendicitis or Crohn disease. We present a 6-year-old boy with perforated acute Meckel diverticulitis that mimicked Crohn disease both clinically and by CT imaging and was definitively diagnosed using MR enterography.

### Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of intestinal obstruction… [^ef1f4261]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Johann Friedrick Meckel, 1, 2 a German anatomist and surgeon, in 1808 first described and explained the embryological origin of the diverticulum that now bears his name. Meckel described the diverticulum as being solitary, antimesenteric, and congenital. He found it to be located in the ileum at the site where the original yolk stalk coursed between the gut and the yolk sac. The diverticulum is a result of the incomplete disappearance of the omphalomesenteric or vitelline duct. He also observed that occasionally the obliterated umbilical vessels or the duct itself may persist as fibrous strands between the umbilicus and the ileal diverticulum. This observation was confirmed and its importance stressed by Cullen4 in 1916. Cullen observed that the vitelline duct normally is obliterated in the sixth to seventh week of embryonic life. Obliteration of none or only part of this duct leads to a number of congenital anomalies, the commonest. ROMIG RS.

### CT of Meckel's diverticulitis in 11 patients [^8f541469]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study reviews the CT findings of Meckel's diverticulitis in 11 patients and, to our knowledge, represents the largest series of such cases reported to date.

Conclusion

The inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may be visualized on CT in most patients, appearing as a blind-ending pouch of variable size and mural thickness and containing fluid, air, or particulate material with surrounding mesenteric inflammation. The location of the diverticulum may vary from the right lower quadrant to the mid abdomen, with most cases in this series located near midline. Optimal luminal opacification of the ileocecal bowel with oral contrast material facilitated detection of the diverticulum and also proved invaluable in enabling identification of the normal appendix. The diagnosis is most difficult in the setting of secondary intestinal obstruction.

### Retrospective study of the differential diagnosis between cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis and small bowel Crohn's disease [^bbe86d06]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

This was a retrospective study in a single center. The medical records of 14 patients with CMUSE from August 1984 to March 2017 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China were reviewed. The control group of 61 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD) was selected from our IBD database using the simple random method with the procedure of "SURVEYSELECT" of SAS package. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. Patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease with colorectal lesions, ulcerative colitis, intestinal tuberculosis, Behcet's disease, neoplasms, or other recognized causes of intestinal inflammation were excluded.

Diagnostic criteria of small bowel Crohn's disease

A diagnosis of SBCD was established by clinical evaluation and a combination of endoscopic, histological, radiological, and/or biochemical investigations according to 3rd European Evidence-based Consensus on the Diagnosis and Management of Crohn's Disease 2016.

Diagnostic criteria of cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis

The diagnostic criteria for CMUSE were: (1) unexplained small bowel strictures or ileus; (2) superficial ulcer in the mucosa and submucosa; (3) chronic or relapsing ulcerative stenosis of the small bowel after surgical resection; (4) no signs of systemic inflammation; (5) improvement after administering corticosteroids; (6) excluding other small intestine ulcerative disease. We recommended that a complete CMUSE be diagnosed if pathologic findings show that superficial ulcer is limited within mucosal and submucosal layers, and a suspected CMUSE be diagnosed if lacking of surgical resection and pathologic examination could not been done. In this study, 10 (71.4%) and 4 (28.6%) patients were diagnosed as complete and suspected CMUSE, respectively. In fact, seven CMUSE patients had been misdiagnosed with CD, and one with intestinal tuberculosis, Meckel diverticulum and ischemic bowel disease, respectively.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^61120f8b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract but the life time risk of developing complications in this vestigial organ is 4–6%. Complications which require emergency treatment includes bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis and perforation and the appropriate knowledge of various pathophysiologies by which a Meckel's diverticulum can cause complication should be kept in mind for the better management and to prevent recurrences. The diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum needs a high degree of suspicion as the preoperative clinical and investigational diagnosis is difficult to be made with accuracy. Open surgery has long been used as an effective method to deal with complicated Meckel's diverticulum. However, in this age of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic management of complicated Meckel's diverticulum is safe, cost effective and efficient as proved by various reports and studies. Although both the methods have their own limitations, still the choice of management depends on patients condition, surgeon's experiences, and availability of the laparoscopic instruments.

Meckel's diverticulum

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract without association with other congenital anomalies. A higher prevalence of Meckel's diverticulum in Crohn's disease patients is considered.

Meckel's diverticulum is the result of incomplete atrophy of the omphalomesenteric duct. This is a true diverticulum on the anti-mesenteric side of the distal ileum containing three layers of the bowel wall. Ectopic gastric or pancreatic mucosa is present in 50% of all Meckel's diverticula. There is no gender predilection for the development of Meckel's diverticulum; however symptoms and complications are considered to be more common in men. The clinical diagnosis is challenging, depending on the patient's age and the clinical findings, which may overlap more common diseases. The diagnosis is often suspected at cross-sectional imaging, scintigraphy or video capsule endoscopy.

Meckel's diverticulum itself is asymptomatic; clinical symptoms are caused by complications. Peptic ulceration with bleeding from heterotopic gastric mucosa located within or close to the diverticulum is the most frequent complication in the paediatric population, and it may appear in adults as well (Fig. 4). Meckel's diverticulum is diagnosed when a saccular, blind-ended structure continuous with the ileum is identified on imaging. An inflamed diverticulum has a distended lumen and surrounding infiltration.

### Imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum [^e22df9dd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, found in 2% of the population in autopsy studies. Most patients remain asymptomatic during their lifetime. Complications of Meckel's diverticulum are reported to occur in approximately 4–40% of patients and include inflammation (diverticulitis), hemorrhage, intussusception, small-bowel obstruction, stone formation, and neoplasm. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the radiologist with the current imaging of Meckel's diverticulum and its presenting complications. The spectrum of diagnostic findings on various imaging techniques will be reviewed.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum and its complications are a serious health problem. Familiarity of the radiologist with the appearance of this pathologic entity enables an accurate diagnosis in emergent settings.

### Ileitis associated with Meckel's diverticulum [^138d6a3e]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Histological features of chronic active ileitis in the small intestine neighbouring a Meckel's diverticulum raise the possibility of concurrent Crohn's disease. Several studies have reported a significant association between Meckel's diverticulum and Crohn's disease, whereas some case reports have proposed that the ileitis is attributable to acid-secreting gastric heterotopia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, histomorphology and clinical follow-up of Meckel's diverticulum-associated ileitis.

Methods and Results

Medical records and slides from 48 consecutive surgical resections performed for Meckel's diverticulum were reviewed. Nine of 48 adults had significant inflammatory changes in the small intestine neighbouring the diverticulum. Two were transmural ulcers attributable to ingestion of a sharp object. Two patients had established Crohn's disease, both with long segments (> 95 mm) of transmural inflammation located > 100 mm from the diverticulum. The remaining five patients had inflammatory changes (ulceration, pseudopyloric metaplasia, submucosal fibrosis, and muscularis mucosa hyperplasia) confined to a short segment (< 20 mm) of mucosa/submucosa within 50–60 mm of the diverticulum. Two had gastric heterotopia in the diverticulum. None of these five patients used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). On follow-up, none had symptoms, imaging or pathology suggestive of Crohn's disease.

Conclusions

Ileitis affecting a short segment of mucosa and submucosa in the small intestine near a Meckel's diverticulum is relatively common, and is not necessarily related to Crohn's disease.

### Meckel's diverticulum: a disease associated with a colored clinical picture [^491c2e17]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is reported in only 1 or 2% of the population. In most cases, it is free of clinical symptoms. The diagnostic modalities are effective in only 60–70% of all cases. The diagnostic laparoscopy is a safe and effective method for patients suffering from unclear abdominal pain with the option of a definitive surgical therapy. We describe the case of a 10-year-old girl with recurrent abdominal pain caused by a chronic subileus due to a Meckel's diverticulum in combination with a fibrous cord from the base of diverticulum to the mesenterial root. Both were resected in a laparoscopic technique.

### Meckel diverticulum presenting as abdominal pain and subsequent bowel perforation [^29002915]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with a broad array of potential etiologies. Meckel diverticulum (MD), the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation, classically presents with painless gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it can also lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, manifesting as abdominal pain.

Case Report

A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Abdominal ultrasound findings were consistent with ileitis and ileocolic intussusception, but no such intussusception was seen during fluoroscopic air enema. The patient was admitted for serial abdominal examinations and subsequently developed an acute abdomen. Emergent laparotomy revealed a perforated MD. Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed and no complications developed. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of an MD can lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, putting the patient at risk of bowel perforation. As such, it is important to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain. In cases in which sonographic findings are ambiguous or transient, additional observation or alternative imaging, such as computed tomography, should be strongly considered.

### Incidental Meckel's diverticulum at time of laparotomy for perforated diverticulitis [^3fb9b76e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

Correct answer: F

Given purulent contamination in bilateral lower quadrants, immunocompromised patient, and significant fecal loading, it was not safe to perform a sigmoid resection and primary anastomosis alone. Therefore, sigmoid resection with primary anastomosis and proximal fecal diversion was considered most appropriate for this patient. The optimal site of a diverting loop ileostomy was near the incidental MD, presenting a challenge in this case. A Hartmann's procedure would have been the most conservative approach, however, primary anastomosis with proximal diversion was favored given higher rates of stoma reversal without additional morbidity. Additionally, a Hartmann's procedure would not address the MD. Other options (3, 4, and 5) were excluded given the risk of additional staple lines, anastomosis, and potential for small bowel devascularization with mesenteric division.

Resection is recommended when an incidental, asymptomatic MD has any of these factors: patients less than 50 years old, narrow base, length greater than 2 cm, palpable abnormality, or a fibrous band connecting the diverticulum to the umbilicus. The presence of any of these factors significantly increases the risk of future complications, with multiple factors increasing cumulative risk. In this case, the MD was narrow based and long (> 2 cm). Moreover, the patient was immunocompromised, and future complications related to the MD could be problematic. Finally, the patient's age supported resection for risk mitigation. Thus, the decision was made to perform a diverticulectomy, and use this site as the loop ileostomy. A standard ostomy orifice was created in the right lower quadrant. The MD was extirpated through the orifice (figure 3), then transected at its base using a linear tissue stapler. The staple line was removed to create a loop ileostomy.

### From the archives of the AFIP. Meckel diverticulum: radiologic features with pathologic correlation [^7fd8ddfa]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, occurring in 2%-3% of the population. It results from improper closure and absorption of the omphalomesenteric duct. Meckel diverticulum is the most common end result of the spectrum of omphalomesenteric duct anomalies, which also include umbilicoileal fistula, umbilical sinus, umbilical cyst, and a fibrous cord connecting the ileum to the umbilicus. The formation of Meckel diverticulum occurs with equal frequency in both sexes, but symptoms from complications are more common in male patients. Sixty percent of patients come to medical attention before 10 years of age, with the remainder of cases manifesting in adolescence and adulthood. Heterotopic gastric and pancreatic mucosa are frequently found histologically within the diverticula of symptomatic patients. The most common complications are hemorrhage from peptic ulceration, small intestinal obstruction, and diverticulitis. Although the clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features of the complications of Meckel diverticulum are well known, the diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum is difficult to establish preoperatively.

Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy — pitfalls and repeat study considerations: False-positive activity suggestive of Meckel diverticulum can result from duplication cyst with ectopic gastric mucosa, bowel inflammation, intussusception or small-bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer, and vascular lesions with increased blood pool; false-negative findings usually result from anatomic or physiologic causes, and may also occur with gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to ectopic gastric mucosa; in a patient with significant recent gastrointestinal bleeding and no other etiology over several weeks, a negative Meckel scan may warrant a repeated study, optimally using pretreatment with an H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor.

### Meckel's diverticulum causing intestinal obstruction [^07a12a4d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain and small bowel obstruction in adults. We present a case of a 31-yr-old man with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain in whom the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum was not suspected until CT of the abdomen revealed multiple fluid-filled, dilated loops of ileum with distal collapse after normal abdominal radiographs. We suggest that CT may be helpful when the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is suspected.

Potential for a false-positive Meckel's scan is highlighted in this patient with intermittent, low-volume small bowel bleeding. Meckel's scan showed late appearance of focal activity mimicking a positive diverticulum finding. This was secondary to extravasated tracer during a coincidental bleeding as shown by a Tc-99m tagged red blood cell scan obtained 2 days earlier. Inaccurate diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum was avoided by: 1) noticing the late appearance in relationship to the gastric uptake, and 2) showing motility of the focus on delayed dynamic imaging that confirmed transit of extravasated tracer along the small bowel with peristalsis. Subsequent capsule endoscopy showed a bleeding ulcer in the ileum.

Wireless capsule endoscopy demonstrated the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum. At a repeat laparotomy, the ulcerated Meckel's diverticulum was identified and resected. The patient had no further bleeding and had a normal haemoglobin level on repeat blood tests up to 12 months after surgical excision of the diverticulum.

### Small bowel diverticulosis: imaging appearances, complications, and pitfalls [^a7b5274d]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverticula of the small bowel can be categorised as true, with Meckel's being the only example, or false. False small bowel diverticula (SBD) are acquired through herniation of the internal layers of the bowel wall through the muscularis propria. Peri-ampullary duodenal diverticula are a well-recognised example; however, the importance of more distal SBD in the jejunum and ileum is underappreciated, and they are under-reported on cross-sectional imaging. SBD are a known cause of anaemia, malabsorption, and diarrhoea, and there are myriad complications of SBD and Meckel's diverticula, which range in severity from inflammation and perforation to haemorrhage, tumour formation, and obstruction. Before the advent of computed tomography (CT), SBD were readily diagnosed on fluoroscopic oral contrast studies; however, radiologists are less comfortable with their cross-sectional imaging appearances. This imaging review combines our experience of multiple proven cases, with illustrative diagrams and radiological images of SBD to provide distinct imaging characteristics, allowing for confident diagnosis of SBD and their numerous complications. We discuss the importance of SBD as a cause of benign, non-surgical pneumoperitoneum. We additionally provide important pitfalls to be aware of such as SBD masquerading as other abnormalities.

### Reminiscing on remnants: imaging of Meckel diverticulum and its complications in adults [^1dbad242]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Meckel diverticulum may become symptomatic if it is complicated by hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, diverticulitis, or tumor. Although classically described in children, it is often missed in adults because of lack of suspicion and difficulty in detection. The purpose of this article is to review the imaging findings and management of Meckel diverticulum and its complications.

Conclusion

Although it is infrequently encountered incidentally, Meckel diverticulum should be considered especially when interpreting examinations for abdominal pain, small-bowel obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum in an atypical position [^35824dbe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

What we did and why

Correct answer: E

Surgical consultation was obtained emergently after the patient's deterioration in the ICU and identification of active contrast extravasation on re-review of imaging by the interventional radiology team. Although IR was consulted and angiographic embolization considered, it was not favored in this patient. The bleeding source was located in the terminal ileum, and embolization carried a high risk of compromising the proximal blood supply, potentially leading to bowel ischemia and the need for surgical resection regardless. Endoscopic intervention was also not pursued due to the lack of bowel preparation, making visualization unreliable in the setting of ongoing massive hemorrhage and a suspected proximal source. The patient was urgently taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. On exploration, there was no hemoperitoneum or source of hemorrhage identified. The cecum and terminal ileum revealed large quantities of intraluminal blood. Careful inspection uncovered a firm lesion approximately 2×2 cm within the terminal ileal mesentery near the ileocecal junction, corresponding to the area of bleeding noted on the CT scan (figure 2). Although no classical projection of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) was externally visible, the suspicious area suggested the presence of ectopic tissue associated with MD. Subsequent pathological findings identified a diverticulum arising in association with the small bowel lumen and mucosal ulceration.

Figure 2
Intraoperative terminal ileum lesion.

An ileocecectomy with a functional side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's hemodynamic status stabilized. He recovered well, tolerated a regular diet, and was discharged on postoperative day 9 with stable vital signs and improved hemoglobin levels.

Discussion

MD is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Although it often remains asymptomatic, it can lead to significant complications, including massive bleeding. This bleeding is more commonly observed in pediatric patients but should not be overlooked in adults. Diagnostic imaging, including CT angiography and Meckel's scans, can aid in localization but often yield false negatives.

In this case, active bleeding localized to the terminal ileum raised suspicion for MD, which was ultimately confirmed intraoperatively. This case presents two major challenges:

Rarity in adults: Symptomatic MD in older individuals is uncommon.

Atypical location: The diverticulum was found within the mesentery, a rare presentation. MD typically arises on the antimesenteric border.

### Subacute Meckel's diverticulum perforation [^233df518]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common intestinal congenital defect, its prevalence is 0.2%-4.0% and it occurs more commonly in children younger than 2-year old with intestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Perforation in the elderly is very rare with no more than 35 articles reported worldwide. Here we report the case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with a history of acute abdominal pain with a 20-day onset. The patient was treated with laparotomy and 30cm ileal resection was performed for an 8×5cm perforated ileum tumour at 50 from ileocecal valve with a side-to-side mechanical anastomosis for reconstruction. Having morbidity Clavien-Dindo scale I in postsurgical and good outcome in 6-month follow-up. Meckel's diverticulum is an infrequent pathology in paediatric and even rarer in adult population, however, it is always important to keep in mind how to act when is seen either as a finding or as a complication.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^838ed241]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

When bleeding is massive and can not be controlled by conservative methods, then this is an emergency situation which needs to be dealt promptly with surgical resection of Meckel's diverticulum after initial resuscitation of the patient with blood transfusion. The approach can be through laparotomy, laparoscopy or laparoscopic assisted. The aim of the surgery is to resect the Meckel's diverticulum, all ectopic gastric mucosa, and any ulcerated adjacent ileum to prevent recurrent bleeding. During surgery if we find a narrow base without any mass in the lumen, then a wedge resection of the diverticulum with transverse closure of the ileum is the ideal method. We can use linear stapler in this situation to close the ileum. But when the base is wide or mass of ectopic tissue is palpable or when there is inflammation, it is preferable to resect the involved bowel followed by end-to-end ileoileostomy. The rationale of this procedure is derived from the observation that in short Meckel's diverticulum, ectopic mucosa can be seen even in the proximal portion, as compared to long diverticulum where the mucosa has been found mostly in the apical region.

Bleeding

Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage is the most common presentation in children with a symptomatic Meckel diverticulum, with incidence rates recorded as high as 50%. The average age of presentation is 2 years but it may occur in older children and adults. The presence of heterotopic gastric and pancreatic mucosa within the Meckel's diverticulum, which secretes acid and highly alkaline pancreatic secretion respectively, causing ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa is the main pathophysiology behind this. However, in adults, other rare causes of bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum have been noted which include the stromal tumors of the same. Children often present with dark red or maroon stools or stools with blood or mucus, whereas adults usually present with melena and crampy abdominal pain. This is perhaps attributable to slower colonic transit time in adults. The bleeding is typically painless and it may be brisk or massive giving the appearance of stool a bright red, brick red or black. Other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children which include polyps, clotting disorders, arteriovenous malformations, and Crohn's disease, need to be excluded by proper investigations. Technetium -99m pertechnetate radioisotope scintigraphy has been utilized universally for the diagnosis of bleeding Meckel's diverticulum and is at present the investigation of choice in a suspected Meckel diverticulum bleed. In this method the injected radioisotope is readily taken up by the ectopic gastric mucosa within the Meckel diverticulum. The diagnostic sensitivity has been reported as high as 85% with a specificity of 95% and accuracy of 90% in the pediatric age group. The accuracy of such scanning may be increased with the use of pentagastrin (to stimulate the uptake of the radioisotope), histamine-blockers (to inhibit the secretion of the pertechnetate once it is taken up), and glucagon (to inhibit peristalsis and thereby decrease "wash-out" of the pertechnetate). Capsule endoscopy has proved to be of diagnostic value in some cases of bleeding Meckel's diverticulum, however, the reports are very few and a concluding statement regarding its diagnostic value cannot be made at this time. Colonoscopy cannot diagnose the bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum because the colonoscope usually cannot reach the part of the small intestine in which the Meckel's diverticulum is located. But we can think of this pathology when we get blood filled colon without another source of bleeding particularly if accompanied by an abnormal radioisotope scan. Angiography may be useful in the evaluation of an adult patient with occult or intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding for the localization of the site of bleeding, specific diagnosis, and therapeutic preoperative embolization. A vascular blush may also be identified at the site of the Meckel diverticulum. When active hemorrhage is occurring at the time of angiography, luminal extravasation of contrast material will be present.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of suspected small-bowel bleeding [^220f31b2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Small-bowel bleeding terminology, definitions, and epidemiology — Obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (OGIB) is defined as overt or occult bleeding of unknown origin that persists or recurs after a negative bidirectional endoscopic evaluation including ileocolonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD); overt OGIB is visible bleeding, whereas occult OGIB is fecal occult blood positivity and/or unexplained iron deficiency anemia. Advances in video capsule endoscopy (VCE), angiography, and device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) have enabled identification of small-bowel sources and management of the majority of OGIB patients, and a recent clinical guideline recommends a shift from "obscure GI bleeding" to "small-bowel bleeding", reserving OGIB for patients with no source identified anywhere in the GI tract after comprehensive evaluation including the small bowel. Of all GI bleeding, only a small percentage (5%) is attributed to small-bowel sources; angioectasias account for 20% to 30% of small-bowel bleeding and are more common in older patients, small-bowel tumors can present in both younger and older patients, other benign causes include NSAID-related erosions/ulcers and Crohn's disease, and rare causes include Meckel's diverticula–associated ulceration, radiation enteropathy, Dieulafoy's lesions, small-bowel varices, and aortoenteric fistulas. In patients with OGIB, upper and lower GI tract endoscopies often are repeated before small-bowel evaluation.

### Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis: is it the coexistence of colonic diverticulosis and inflammatory bowel disease? [^58403309]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis (SCAD) is an inflammatory process that affects colonic luminal mucosa in segments that are also affected by diverticulosis. Its prevalence varies between 1.15% and 11.4% amongst those suffering from diverticular disease (DD). Being closely associated with DD, it is slightly commoner in males and usually presents in the sixth decade of life. Although the exact pathogenesis of SCAD is unknown, it is probably heterogeneous and includes mechanisms that also play a part in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The clinical presentation is non-specific and similar to that of other pathologies involving the sigmoid colon, and its diagnosis is based on endoscopic findings in correlation with histology. Currently, there are no guidelines for its management, which is usually based on the administration of salicylates and antibiotics, with surgery being reserved for refractory cases. The rarity of SCAD may be multifactorial: whereas milder forms go undiagnosed or are attributed to DD, more severe forms can be misdiagnosed as IBD. This latter distinction is an important one to make, since SCAD and IBD differ as regards their natural history and prognosis, while very often no long-term medications are required in SCAD.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^2d2765db]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. About 98% of affected patients are asymptomatic. Small intestinal examination has become easier since the development of double-balloon enteroscopy. The present case series describes 10 patients with Meckel's diverticulum in whom double-balloon enteroscopy was useful for diagnosis.

Case presentation

Ten patients (8 men, 2 women) with Meckel's diverticulum underwent double-balloon enteroscopy at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital from May 2004 through May 2013. Their median age was 31.5 years (range, 14–83 years). Ten retrograde and two anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy procedures were performed. Double-balloon enteroscopy showed Meckel's diverticulum in nine patients, but an inverted Meckel's diverticulum was diagnosed as a lipoma in one patient. Meckel's diverticulum was detected by iodinated contrast medium during anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy in one of the two patients who underwent this procedure. Meckel's diverticulum was suspected using capsule endoscopy in one of two patients who underwent this procedure. Abdominal computed tomography was performed in all patients and revealed abnormalities in six, but Meckel's diverticulum was suspected in only two. Technetium-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy and a small bowel series were carried out in six patients, revealing Meckel's diverticulum in one and three patients, respectively. Surgery was performed in eight patients, and endoscopic resection was carried out in one; the remaining patient was transferred to another hospital. Ulcer formation was found in or near Meckel's diverticulum in eight patients.

Conclusion

Compared with other modalities, double-balloon enteroscopy is excellent for the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum because direct observation of both Meckel's diverticulum and ulceration is possible. Double-balloon enteroscopy should be used complementarily to other less invasive examinations when needed to confirm or establish the diagnosis.

*Some patients received more than one diagnosis.

Finally, in patients with rectal bleeding 16.7% of men and 14.5% of women had received a diagnosis at 90 days, and at three years 32.3% of men and 32.4% of women had a clear diagnosis (table 4). The most common diagnosis made at both times was haemorrhoids (10.0% in men and 7.8% in women at 90 days and 19.0% and 16.8% at three years), followed by anal fissure and diverticulitis. New diagnoses of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were made in less than 1% of women at 90 days, with these figures rising to around 1% for Crohn's disease and 2% for ulcerative colitis in both men and women at three years. Small numbers of patients were found to have bleeding disorders, angiodysplasia, intussusception, and Meckel's diverticulum.

Table 4

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^19cc541b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis

Diverticulitis represents 20% of the symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum and is common in adult patients. Clinical manifestation mimics acute appendicitis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with right lower quadrant pain. This feature necessitates the exploration of distal ileum when normal looking appendix is found during operation of suspected acute appendicitis. Pathophysiology is analogous to that of acute appendicitis, with inflammation being secondary to stasis and bacterial infection, which occurs due to the obstruction of the lumen by Enterolith or foreign body or by parasites (Ascaris lumbricoides or Taenia saginata). Alternatively, peptic ulceration of ileal mucosa due to ectopic gastric mucosa can cause diverticulitis. It may also result from diverticular torsion that causes secondary ischemia and inflammatory change. If this condition is left untreated, it usually leads to perforation and peritonitis.

This condition should be dealt with a surgical approach that can be open or laparoscopic, with resection of diverticulum at its base and closure perpendicular to the axis of intestine to minimize the risk of subsequent stenosis. And if perforation has occurred, thorough peritoneal toileting is done after resection.

Perforation

It is difficult to diagnose the site of perforation prior to exploration although duodenal and ileal perforation can be distinguish to a lesser extent by observing the nature of the aspirates from abdomen i.e. whether it is bilious or feculent. Various etiologies that can lead to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum are (a) Progression of diverticulitis, (b) Ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa secondary to acid produced by ectopic gastric mucosa, (c) Secondary to ingested foreign body like fish bone, chicken bone and bay leaf, (d) Traumatic. (e) Perforation associated with tumors like Leiomyoma in Meckel's diverticulum has also been reported. It typically presents with the features similar to that of the perforation of other hollow viscera, with features of either localized or generalized peritonitis. Perforation of Meckel's diverticulum is usually managed by initial resuscitation and antibiotics followed by diverticulectomy or segmental resection along with peritoneal irrigation.

### Occult bleeding from a false-in-true non-meckelian ileal diverticulum [^c340bdd0]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Ileal diverticula can be congenital or acquired and are rare even among the already rare entity of small bowel diverticula. What has never been reported, as far as we know, is false diverticula arising within the true non-Meckelian diverticulum with mesenteric erosion causing an occult gastrointestinal bleed. We present a patient with occult gastrointestinal bleeding from a false-in-true ileal diverticulum. Multiple investigations were required to localise the bleeding site after which the patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic ileocaecectomy with complete resolution of symptoms. Preoperative localisation of the bleeding site may be difficult but is critically important in occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Procedure choice for a bleeding ileal diverticulum is dictated by the distance from the ileocaecal valve and the etiopathology of the bleed.

### Meckel's diverticulum in an adult: an obscure presentation of gastrointestinal bleeding [^32508200]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 17-year-old boy, with a background of haemophilia A, presented to hospital with an episode of brisk and painless per rectal (PR) bleeding. Initial investigation with gastroscopy and colonoscopy revealed no source of bleeding. Examination of the small bowel including MRI, CT angiogram and capsule endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) from an antegrade position was attempted, with no abnormalities noted. The symptoms persisted and DBE was attempted again from a retrograde approach and a diverticulum was subsequently noted. Laparoscopic surgery was performed identifying a diverticulum as the source of bleeding, 110cm from the ileocaecal valve, which is more proximal than is normally seen. Histological examination revealed a Meckel's diverticulum. The case described here, although more unusual in adults, demonstrates that complete visualisation of the small bowel remains challenging and that newer modalities of enteroscopy including DBE can help aid in the diagnosis of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^c8c500e3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. About 98% of affected patients are asymptomatic. Small intestinal examination has become easier since the development of double-balloon enteroscopy. The present case series describes 10 patients with Meckel's diverticulum in whom double-balloon enteroscopy was useful for diagnosis.

Case Presentation

Ten patients (8 men, 2 women) with Meckel's diverticulum underwent double-balloon enteroscopy at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital from May 2004 through May 2013. Their median age was 31.5 years (range, 14–83 years). Ten retrograde and two anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy procedures were performed. Double-balloon enteroscopy showed Meckel's diverticulum in nine patients, but an inverted Meckel's diverticulum was diagnosed as a lipoma in one patient. Meckel's diverticulum was detected by iodinated contrast medium during anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy in one of the two patients who underwent this procedure. Meckel's diverticulum was suspected using capsule endoscopy in one of two patients who underwent this procedure. Abdominal computed tomography was performed in all patients and revealed abnormalities in six, but Meckel's diverticulum was suspected in only two. Technetium-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy and a small bowel series were carried out in six patients, revealing Meckel's diverticulum in one and three patients, respectively. Surgery was performed in eight patients, and endoscopic resection was carried out in one; the remaining patient was transferred to another hospital. Ulcer formation was found in or near Meckel's diverticulum in eight patients.

Conclusion

Compared with other modalities, double-balloon enteroscopy is excellent for the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum because direct observation of both Meckel's diverticulum and ulceration is possible. Double-balloon enteroscopy should be used complementarily to other less invasive examinations when needed to confirm or establish the diagnosis.

### Ulcerative colitis: making the diagnosis [^e6116b5a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory condition of the colon. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on clinical presentation, endoscopic evaluation, and histologic parameters in the absence of demonstrable alternate etiology. The differential diagnosis remains broad, and infection in particular must be considered and excluded. Although laboratory and radiographic findings can aid in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, endoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. A correct diagnosis and disease staging are imperative because these factors affect treatment options and prognosis.

An 18-year-old woman presented to the emergency department for bloody stools. A CT scan of the abdomen ruled out intussusception. Meckel's scan was ordered to rule for Meckel's diverticulum before upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. After proper pretreatment with H2 blocker, Tc-pertechnetate Meckel's scan was performed. Dynamic planar imaging revealed a focus of gradual increase in uptake in midabdomen suggestive of Meckel's diverticulum. A SPECT/CT was done to localize the focus of uptake. Surprisingly, the focus of uptake localized to the periumbilical region on SPECT/CT images. The cause of uptake could be due to local inflammation from umbilical ornamentation.

### Massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum in an atypical position [^33d02569]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Case summary

The patient presented with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. During the operation, intraluminal blood was discovered, but the source was not immediately evident. Definitive treatment involved surgical resection of the diverticulum en bloc with the adjacent intestinal segment. Meckel's diverticulectomy has been described, but given the location of the MD in this patient, bowel resection was indicated.

Although prophylactic resection of incidentally discovered MD remains controversial, symptomatic MD requires prompt surgical intervention. In this case, surgical consultation was obtained after the patient became unstable and imaging revealed active bleeding. Embolization was not pursued due to the risk of bowel ischemia, and endoscopy was not feasible given poor visualization in an unprepped colon. Awareness of atypical MD anatomy was critical to localizing the source and achieving hemorrhage control. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a multidisciplinary challenge, and an operation was ultimately chosen as the safest and most definitive approach in this context.

Case 9

A 16-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain, vomiting, and hematochezia. Abdominal CT and ultrasound revealed a small bowel intussusception. A high enema was performed using physiological saline and contrast media. The intussusception was released by the high enema. Retrograde DBE revealed MD. Meckel's diverticulectomy was performed.

Case 10

An 83-year-old man visited another hospital because of melena and hematochezia. The patient was referred to our hospital for close examination. Abdominal CT showed a polypoid lesion in the distal ileum. An inverted MD was suspected. Retrograde DBE revealed an inverted MD. Its surface comprised normal intestinal mucosa. Meckel's diverticulectomy was performed.

### An internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum: a case report [^b78c484a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. It can lead to intestinal perforation, obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding. While the internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum is rarely reported.

Case Presentation

We report a case of a 45-year old female patient who presented with intestinal obstruction and on laparotomy was found to have Meckel's diverticulum with internal hernia causing intestinal gangrene. Segmental bowel resection was performed and the patient had uneventful recovery.

Conclusions

In patients with acute intestinal obstruction without previous abdominal surgery, Meckel's diverticulum and its complications should be suspected.

A 1-year-old boy presented at our hospital with common gastroenteritis symptoms such as fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical and laboratory findings were normal. An emergency ultrasound examination was performed and excluded abdominal complications. After 2 days of complete regression of symptoms, the patient began to vomit again, diarrhoea stopped with a sudden worsening of clinical conditions. Laboratory and radiological findings showed signs of an acute abdomen with differential diagnosis between an infectious and an obstructive cause. Owing to the rapid and progressive toxic condition, an emergency laparoscopy was performed. An axial torsion of a swollen and gangrenous Meckel's diverticulum was detected.

### Localization and etiological stratification of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding via CT imaging: a 10-year study [^63db6627]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to assess the diagnostic efficacy of contrast-enhanced CT scans for small bowel bleeding.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated patients diagnosed with non-neoplastic small intestinal bleeding (including duodenum) who underwent abdominal CT at our institution from December 2013 to March 2023. Patients were categorized into diverticulum and non-diverticulum groups based on the cause of bleeding. Active bleeding was defined on the CT images as extravasation of contrast material in the intestinal lumen during the arterial phase and/or progressive accumulation of contrast material during the venous phase. We have documented the original report (extracted from the medical record system and additional consultation opinions from senior radiologists), including the presence of active bleeding and its potential bleeding location. Furthermore, two radiologists reassessed the CT images, seeking consensus on the diagnosis between them.

Results

The study included 165 patients, predominantly male, with a median age of 30 years. Active bleeding was identified in 48.3% of patients. Notably, all identified bleeding diverticula in the diverticulum group exhibited cul-de-sac termination. Among the identified causes of bleeding, Crohn's disease was most prevalent (46.7%, N of causes = 64). Significant differences were observed in the diagnostic methods between the diverticulum and non-diverticulum groups, with surgery predominantly applied in the diverticulum group, and endoscopy in the non-diverticulum group (n = 49 vs n = 15, p = 0.001). Contrast agent extravasation was significantly higher in the diverticulum group (n = 54 vs n = 16, p = 0.001), and Meckel's diverticulum cases appearing tubular were significantly higher than in other diverticulum cases (n = 25 vs n = 3, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

CT allows for a higher detection rate of diverticular bleeding, even if asymptomatic, guiding classification into multiple potentially clinically relevant categories.

Critical Relevance Statement

Contrast-enhanced CT imaging is effective in determining the location and cause of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding, especially diverticular bleeding. Therefore, the use of enhanced CT should be prioritized in the diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding.

Key Points

CT has potential value in the diagnosis of small bowel bleeding. CT imaging suggests possible surgical intervention for active bleeding detection. CT diagnoses and localizes small bowel bleeding, aiding in treatment and prioritizing in guidelines.

### Laparoscopic management of Meckel's diverticulum in adults [^764e1e8b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon entity. A high index of suspicion is necessary for opportune diagnosis and prompt treatment. Technetium (TC) 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy is a sensitive and specific test for Meckel's diverticulum. In adults, the scan contributes little to clinical decision making and often will not change the need for surgical intervention. We describe our experience with four patients.

Methods

Between August 2000 and August 2001, four patients were seen with Meckel's diverticula. Three were male and one was female. The mean age was 39 years (range, 18–64). Three patients presented with anemia and one with an acute abdomen. A 99mTc pertechnetate scan was performed at a cost of 900 dollars in the three anemic patients after other endoscopic and radiographic tests were nondiagnostic. Only one patient had a positive scan. All four patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy and small bowel resection. In one patient, a minilaparatomy had to be performed.

Results

All patients had a satisfactory outcome without complications. Three patients were discharged within 3 days of surgery. The remaining patient had a prolonged hospital stay because of ongoing chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer. In the three anemic patients who underwent enterectomy, ulcerated small bowel outside the diverticulum was found by the pathologist.

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is safe, cost-effective, and efficient for the diagnosis and definitive management of Meckel's diverticulum. Technetium 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy scanning adds considerable time and expense to the care of the patient without significant benefits in adults. The practice of exploratory laparoscopy rather than scintigraphy is recommended.

### Perforated Meckel diverticulum: a rare cause of acute abdomen in children [^51107e8c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract and the most common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Although it usually follows the rule of 2's, exceptions to this rule are reported in the literature. Often asymptomatic, MD is commonly an incidental finding during surgical interventions. When symptomatic, the most common presentation of this condition is painless rectal bleeding. A myriad of other nonspecific symptoms are however possible, especially in adults, thus making this diagnosis difficult. Meckel diverticulum has been reported to mimic other abdominal pathologies like appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and pancreatitis to name a few. We report a patient with acute abdomen in whom the more common causes of acute abdomen were ruled out and a diagnosis of MD was established on exploratory laparoscopy, only after he developed perforation. This report emphasizes the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion towards a possibility of a complicated MD in patients presenting with an acute abdomen, once other causes of acute abdomen are ruled out.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^9a811919]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. MD is usually located about 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Although MD is usually asymptomatic, about 2% of cases are symptomatic. Sixty percent of patients who develop complications are younger than 2 years old. Among patients with symptomatic MD, the male: female ratio is approximately 3:1.

Observation of the small intestine has become easier since the development of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and single-balloon enteroscopy. The number of reports of MD observed by DBE is increasing. The present case series describes 10 patients with MD in whom DBE was useful for diagnosis.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in a child: is It a Meckel diverticulum? [^a4ccc658]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 2-year-9-month-old boy with multiple episodes of melena and hematochezia with unclear cause was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin of 5 g/dL) and positive fecal occult blood test. Single-operator double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) through the anal route was performed and revealed multiple patchy mucosal eminence consisted of ectopic gastric pit and loss of villi observed by electronic stain in the distal jejunum, approximately 2 m from the ileocecal valve. The bowel cavity was deformed like a maze in the distal jejunum. There are several mucosal bridging structures and focal stricture, making it difficult to determine the direction of the lumen. Two irregular deep ulcers were found near the stricture (A [a–f] and Video 1). Emission computer tomography Tc 99m pertechnetate scan showed multiple areas of radioisotope uptake in the middle and lower abdomen. At laparotomy, a 46-cm-long cyst was noted on the mesentery aspect that protruded alongside from the distal jejunum (B [a–c]). Resection of 58 cm of the jejunum was performed including the cyst. Pathology showed a duplication cyst located on the mesenteric aspect with ectopic gastric mucosa (C). The postoperative diagnosis was a duplication cyst of the jejunum. The patient was discharged 14 days after surgery and remained symptom-free thereafter. Intestinal duplication cysts are rare congenital malformations that can appear anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The preoperative diagnosis of a duplication cyst is difficult and can be easily misdiagnosed as Meckel diverticulum. Duplication cysts usually locate on the mesenteric aspect as in our case, in contrast to Meckel diverticulum that localizes on the antimesenteric aspect. In our case, the deformed intestine was found approximately 2 m from the ileocecal valve, which was not common in Meckel diverticulum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported tubular type of jejunal duplication cyst case with an DBE video. DBE can be a useful tool for the diagnosis of intestinal duplication in young children. Watch the Video, Supplementary Digital Content 1.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^5082aa8e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

If the indication of diverticulectomy is bleeding then segmental ileal resection should be done. It is also indicated if tumor is detected or if the base is inflamed or perforated. The diverticulum is excised along with 2 to 3 cm of adjacent ileum. Then single layer end- to- end anastomosis is performed using 000 mersilk and lumen is tested for its patency between thumb and index finger.

Role of laparoscopic surgery in the management of complicated Meckel's diverticulum.

Laparoscopy as a minimally invasive approach has emerged as both diagnostic as well as therapeutic means to deal with various surgical conditions including Meckel's diverticulum. Its ability to visualize whole of the abdomen makes it a diagnostic choice for various undiagnosed intraabdominal pathologies. There are several studies stating the safe and effective use of laparoscopy in case of complicated Meckel's diverticulum. It can be used in undiagnosed acute abdominal pain, in obstruction and perforation. But its role in removing bleeding Meckel's diverticulum has been argued by some due to the fact that, the base of the diverticulum and the ileum cannot be palpated, hence ectopic mucosa could be left behind thus leaving the risk of recurrence, but others have successfully dealt with this situation. The criteria of external appearance to deal with such condition has been studied, with conclusion that long diverticula can be removed by simple transverse resection with a stapling device because long diverticula usually have ectopic tissue at its distal end, but in short diverticula it can occur in almost any area so ileal resection with end-to-end anastomosis or wedge resection after exteriorization is recommended in short type of diverticula. Another study presented the external appearances in terms of height to diameter ratio (HDR) of 2 as a cut off value to decide whether to do simple transverse resection or ileal resection with end-to-end anastomosis. The development of endostapling devices has made the resection safer, faster and more efficient. The most important advantage is its simultaneous cutting and closing properties making the chance of contamination very less.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^be8531e0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Small bowel diverticular (SBD) disease is often overlooked in clinical practice. Due to its discrete location and limited access, the true incidence of SBD remains unknown. Currently, many researchers have reported different clinical manifestation, treatment and complications of SBD, but has been limited to individual reports of cases studies or case series. Available cohort studies from the past were unable to highlight the advancements of small bowel diagnostic modalities, such as DBE and VCE, in recent years. The present study is one of the few that demonstrates SBD and its associated characteristics in a single cohort population, with analysis of different clinical characteristics and diagnostic approach.

A total of 149 cases of SBD were included in the present study. Majority of the patients had duodenal SBD, while jeujunal ileal SBD were rare in incidence. SBD can be asymptomatic, or associated with nonspecific abdominal discomfort, due to bacterial overgrowth. However, jejunoileal SBD are often associated with more severe clinical manifestations such as small bowel obstruction, bleeding or acute perforation. For instance, congenital small bowel diverticula like Meckel's diverticulum are frequently linked to gastrointestinal bleeding. In contrast, acquired forms, such as pseudodiverticula (false diverticula lacking full bowel wall layers), are more commonly found in the duodenum and typically present with milder symptoms, including diverticulitis or complications like bacterial overgrowth. Due to the wide range of symptoms of SBD, it is not a commonly suspected disease in clinical practice, so it is still very difficult to diagnose SBD timely and accurately. Generalized abdominal discomfort may be dismissed as functional dyspepsia, as evident in our case highlights. GI bleeding may remain inconclusive after upper and lower GI endoscopic examinations. Therefore, the diagnosis of SBD is heavily reliant on diagnostic modalities of the small bowel, preferably with direct visualization. In clinical practice, traditional methods such as small intestinal CT or BaFT are usually used to diagnose SBD, but the above methods have poor diagnostic accuracy and cannot directly show the detailed characteristics of SBD. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an examination method that can directly visualize small intestinal lesions. Compared with traditional examination methods, double balloon enteroscopy has obvious advantages such as wide field of vision and clear image, and allows for biopsy and corresponding treatment at the lesion. Due to the lengthy anatomy of the small bowel, SBD may be easily missed in radiological studies, even with small intestinal CT or BaFT. Advancements in endoscopy has allowed for increased recognition of SBD in clinical practice, which is also an important tool to help differentiate common diseases of the small bowel, such as Crohn's disease. As presented in our case highlights, Patient C may have received treatment with corticosteroids or immunomodulators given the "severity" of his disease based on CT findings. Luckily, a DBE was performed for the patient and rectified his diagnosis, which was ultimately curative with surgery. Although DBE and VCE may not be available in primary or secondary healthcare facilities, we would like to emphasize the importance of considering small bowel disease, such as SBD, especially in patients with inconclusive diagnosis. The treatment for SBD should be directed based on clinical symptoms and location of SBD. Asymptomatic small bowel diverticulosis usually does not require treatment. Although ileal SBD often require surgical intervention, due to its association with more severe clinical presentation. The purpose of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. The use of medicine and diet control can relieve dyspepsia and anemia caused by diverticulum. For those cases that respond to supportive treatment, surgery is not recommended to prevent recurrence. Complications generally include bleeding, obstruction, and perforation, serious complications often require surgical intervention. If Meckel's diverticulum occurs during the operation as an incidental finding, the removal of Meckel's diverticulum often requires further discussion. Antibiotics can be prescribed for bacterial overgrowth, while surgery is reserved for SBD associated with severe complications. Several tertiary centers in China, with expertise in GI endoscopy and DBE, has been exploring the possibility of endoscopic resection of SBD with techniques modified from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). According to the Ma LL' case report, a novel technique called enteroscopic intestinal diverticulum dissection (EIDD) was proposed for the treatment of intussuscepted intestinal Meckel's diverticulum.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^c3776944]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum with intestinal ascariasis may remain asymptomatic or present with complications. Ascaris lumbrocoides can lead to direct complications of Meckel's diverticulum or secondarily after having complications of ileal segment on which it is located. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Silent Meckel's diverticulum encountered during the course of surgery for obstructive intestinal ascariasis in children is to be removed in view of anticipated complications. Diverticulectomy wound can be used as enterotomy site for complete removal of intestinal worms.

### Management… [^6995679a]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with intractable abdominal pain. She was given nothing by mouth and was placed on maintenance intravenous fluids. The next day, examination revealed right lower quadrant tenderness with slight guarding and rebound, which was confirmed on pelvic examination. The patient's stool was still guaiac-negative. However, her temperature had climbed to 37. 5°C, and her white blood cell count had fallen to 5, 000 per mm. 3 with a left shift. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, remained normal. During her previous abdominal surgery, an incidentally discovered wide-mouthed, relatively short Meckel's diverticulum had been noted. The physician had determined that it was asymptomatic and elected to leave the diverticulum in place. In light of the patient's current condition, surgery was recommended for suspected Meckel's diverticulum.

In addition to the normal layers of the intestinal wall, approximately 50 percent of diverticula contain ectopic tissue. 2 In surgical exploration, this ectopic tissue has been described as "strange granular tissue"; however, in one 15-year study, diagnosis by palpation at surgery led to 14 false-positive results. 14 This overdiagnosis indicates that palpation at surgery is not a definitive indication of pathology.
14. Diagnosis The diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is difficult to make, especially in adults. 7, 11, 21 The diagnosis must be considered in anyone with unexplained abdominal complaints, nausea and vomiting, or intestinal bleeding. 22, 23 Meckel's diverticulum can mimic a variety of more common ailments, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroenteritis, biliary colic, colonic diverticulitis and milk allergy. In children, the scan has a sensitivity of 85 percent and a specificity of 95 percent, but in adults, the sensitivity falls to 62.

5 percent and specificity to only 9 percent. 25, 28 Many conditions can cause a false-positive diagnosis in adults: mucosal hyperemia of any cause, angiomas, urinary tract obstruction, an ectopic kidney or uterine pooling of blood. 3 False-negative results are less common but causative conditions include impaired vascular supply, recent barium gastrointestinal study, premedication with atropine, a small diverticulum or hemorrhage washing out the isotope. 3, 16.

### Small bowel emergency surgery: literature's review [^7a3d9161]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum and acquired jejunoileal diverticulosis

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, interesting 2% to 4% of population. It is a true diverticulum due to the persistence of omphalo-mesenteric duct, which connects in fetal life the yolk sac to the intestinal tract and usually obliterates in the 5 th to 7 th week of life. It is localized on anti-mesenteric border of the distal ileum, usually 30–40 cm far from the ileo-cecal valve. Meckel's diverticulum is lined mainly by the typical ileal mucosa as in the adjacent small bowel. However, in 20% of cases ectopic gastric mucosa may be found. Globally the incidence of complications ranges from 4% to 16%. Although there is no sex differences in the incidence of Meckel's diverticulum, its complications are 3–4 times more frequent in males. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of bleeding in the pediatric age group. The risk of complications decreases with increasing age. The most frequent complications in adults are obstruction due to the intussusceptions or adhesive band, ulceration, diverticulitis and perforation. Preoperative diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is difficult, especially in patients with symptoms other than bleeding. In doubtful cases, laparoscopy is the preferred diagnostic modality. However, technetium 99-m pertechnate scan is the most common and accurate non-invasive investigation, although it is specific to ectopic gastric mucosa, not to Meckel's diverticulum. In the presence of symptoms, the treatment of choice is the surgical resection. This can be achieved either by diverticulectomy or by the segmental bowel resection and anastomosis, especially when there is palpable ectopic tissue, intestinal ischemia or perforation.

Figure 5
Our hospital's diagnostic flowchart of Meckel's diverticulum.

In Case 8, the histological findings indicated an inverted MD, but it was not inverted when DBE was performed. How inversion of MD occurs is unknown. It has been suggested that abnormal peristaltic movement caused by ulceration or ectopic tissue at the bottom of MD may cause it to invert. In Cases 4, 8, 9, and 10 (and possibly Case 3), MD was inverted at least once. In Cases 4, 8, and 10, there was no ectopic gastric tissue, but ulceration of MD was observed. Endoscopic observation of the ulcers in MD provides important evidence of bleeding. How ulcerations develop without ectopic gastric tissue is unknown. Chronic mechanical trauma or ischemia due to intermittent intussusception can be a cause. A persistent omphalomesenteric artery, which is a feeding artery of MD, is an end branch of the superior mesenteric artery and does not anastomose with other ileal branches. Therefore, this may provide another theory regarding ischemic ulceration of MD, whether inverted or not. As shown in Case 9, an ulcer is not always seen in MD with ectopic gastric tissue. An ulcer may recover automatically; however, it is necessary to consider other factors as the cause of bleeding. In Case 9, mechanical stimulation and ischemia due to intussusception were considered to be the cause of bleeding, as in MD without ectopic gastric tissue.

Endoscopic resection of an inverted MD was carried out in Case 4. Adverse events did not occur, but perforation due to endoscopic resection has been reported. Diagnosis of inverted MD is difficult; however, careful observation of the surface pattern of MD and abdominal CT lead to the diagnosis.

DBE and single-balloon enteroscopy are excellent for MD diagnosis; however, it is necessary to use other modalities complementarily. Symptomatic MD (gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, intussusception, and so on) necessitates surgery.

### Computed tomography of complicated Meckel's diverticulum in adults: a pictorial review [^efcc3dbc]. Insights Into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To show various CT aspects of complicated Meckel's diverticulum in adult patients to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of this rare pathology in emergency settings. METHODS: A computer search of medical records over a 15 year period identified 23 adult patients who underwent surgery for acute abdomen generated by a complicated Meckel's diverticulum. CT images available for review were analyzed, and some specific patterns leading to the diagnosis of complicated Meckel's diverticulum are presented in this review. RESULTS: Complications were related to inflammation (14 patients), bleeding (5 patients), intestinal obstruction (3 patients), and penetrating foreign body (1 patient). The presence of a Meckel's diverticulum was usually suggested at CT scan by an abnormal outpouching, blind-ending digestive structure connected to the terminal ileum by a neck of variable caliber. Depending on the type of complications, the diverticulum was surrounded by mesenteric inflammatory changes, or presented as a localized fluid or air-fluid collection contiguous with the terminal ileum. The diverticulum was also the source of active bleeding or acted as the lead point to intestinal obstruction or intussusception. CONCLUSION: CT findings of complicated Meckel's diverticulum are polymorphic and should be considered in the evaluation of adult patients with acute abdomen.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeds: false-negative and false-positive tests [^30fb89c9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in infants and children is a symptom with a broad differential diagnosis. The diagnosis depends on the quantity and quality of the bleeding and on the patient's age. We describe a case of a 10-month-old infant who presented to our pediatric emergency department 4 times with lower gastrointestinal bleeding before a diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum was made. Although this pathology was strongly suspected at an earlier visit, the initial Meckel scan result was interpreted as normal, and the result of a stool test for Clostridium difficile was positive. The case illustrates that repeat scintigraphy might be necessary when significant bleeding is present even if the results of other tests for diagnosis are positive.

Case 5

A 40-year-old man presented to our hospital because the intermittent epigastralgia that he had experienced for 2 years had become stronger. Abdominal CT revealed a large cystic mass in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Retrograde DBE showed MD. He visited our emergency room because of strong abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant 1 month later. Acute appendicitis or Meckel's diverticulitis was suspected. Emergent surgery was conducted because of the development of panperitonitis. Histological findings revealed gangrenous appendicitis with perforation and MD with ectopic gastric tissue. Meckel's diverticulitis was not seen.

Case 6

A 59-year-old man was transferred to our hospital because of hematochezia with hypovolemic shock. Emergent retrograde DBE was performed without bowel preparation, but we were not able to insert the endoscope ahead of the cecum because of massive stool and blood. Retrograde DBE after bowel preparation was performed again the next day. MD was detected, and Meckel's diverticulectomy was performed.

Case 7

A 29-year-old man was admitted to another hospital because of hematochezia and syncope. The patient was transferred to our hospital for close examination. Abdominal CT showed an extended part in the distal ileum. It was suspected that the extended part was MD because the continuity between the extended part and small intestine was unknown. Anterograde DBE was performed because of the potential inability to reach the lesion with a retrograde approach due to massive clots and blood. We reached the middle ileum but did not detect a hemorrhagic lesion. Because the endoscope could not be inserted any deeper, we used iodinated contrast medium through the scope while the balloons were inflated. MD was detected at about 20 cm on the anal side. Emergent Meckel's diverticulectomy was performed.

Case 8

A 34-year-old man was admitted to another hospital because of hematochezia. The patient was transferred to our hospital for examination and treatment. CE detected hemorrhage and a branch of the intestinal tract in the ileum; therefore, MD was suspected. Anterograde DBE was performed for the same reason as in Case 7. No abnormalities were found within the observed region. We used iodinated contrast medium through the scope while the balloons were inflated; however, no abnormalities were detected. The gastrointestinal bleeding stopped, so retrograde DBE was performed. MD was detected. Meckel's diverticulectomy was performed.

### Giant colonic diverticulum: radiographic and MDCT characteristics [^2b71a8fd]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis and other diagnostic tools

Symptoms and signs of colonic diverticular disease and colorectal cancer are similar, and thus imaging is required to exclude malignancy. The general occurrence of GCD in the sigmoid colon may suggest diagnosis, but may also be misleading, since 10% of GCD do not occur in the sigmoid colon.

Radiological differential diagnosis should include abdominal abscess, localized pneumoperitoneum, large-bowel volvulus, enteric duplication cyst, Meckel's diverticulum, duodenal and jejunal diverticula, pneumatosis intestinalis, emphysematous cholecystitis, emphysematous cystitis, and infected pancreatic pseudocyst. However, on radiographs, duplication cysts are rarely found on the sigmoid colon and Meckel's diverticulum is generally located in the distal ileum and affects young children. CT scan of the abdomen may determine the differential diagnosis of GCD (Fig. 5). On CT, duplication cysts are usually fluid filled and fusiform, contrasting with round or oval gas-filled GCD. Further, the quantity of gas is generally greater in GCD than in abscesses; the explanation of such lies in the connection between the GCD and the colonic lumen.

Fig. 5

Colonoscopy is a widely available and effective tool for assessing the colonic lumen and for ruling out carcinoma. However, it is not very useful for diagnosing GCD, since the connection point between the GCD and the colon cavity is small and hard to detect. In addition, colonoscopy is generally avoided due to the risk of perforation. Further, the diverticular ostium is frequently small and easily missed.

Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy — interpretation criteria and temporal patterns: After injection of 99mTc-pertechnetate, stomach activity appears early on dynamic scintigraphy and is most prominent after 10–15 min; ectopic gastric mucosa appears as a focal area at the same time as normal gastric mucosa and increases with stomach activity, Meckel diverticulae are typically in the right lower quadrant, urinary tract activity usually appears after gastric activity and a small diverticulum may appear later than the stomach, and a lateral view at study end helps differentiate posterior urinary tract activity from usually anterior diverticular activity; small-bowel accumulation of secreted 99mTc-pertechnetate can be distinguished from a Meckel diverticulum by delayed appearance and a mildly, ill-defined increased activity pattern.

### The overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease [^5f79d51e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

An overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease has long been recognized. Crohn's disease and diverticulitis share clinical and radiologic features but usually differ in histopathologic findings. There is a suggestion, however, that even the characteristic pathology of Crohn's disease can be a secondary reaction to diverticulitis. It is possible, moreover, that the presence of Crohn's disease in association with diverticulosis predisposes to the development of diverticulitis. Finally, an apparently distinct form of segmental colitis associated with sigmoid diverticula has been described further contributing to the overlap of inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^c93e60cd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the remain of the prenatal yolkstalk (Vitellointestinal duct). The yolk sac of the developing embryo is connected to the primitive gut by the yolk stalk or vitelline (i.e. omphalomesenteric) duct. This structure normally regresses between the fifth and seventh weeks of fetal life. If this process of regression fails, various anomalies can occur. The spectrum of defects includes a Meckel diverticulum, a fibrous cord attaching the distal ileum to the abdominal wall, an umbilical-intestinal fistula, a mucosa-lined cyst, or an umbilical sinus. Of these, Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract in humans occurring in approximately 2% of the population with equal incidence in males and females. It is located on the antimesentric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve and is usually 3–5 cm long [fig 1]. It possesses all the three layers of the intestinal wall and has its own blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery, which makes it vulnerable to infection and obstruction like appendix. Since cell lining of vitelline duct are pluripotent, we may get heterotopic gastric mucosa (50%), pancreatic mucosa(5%) and less commonly colonic mucosa, endometriosis, hepatobiliary tissue, which are responsible for other complications like hemorrhage, chronic peptic ulceration and perforation.

### Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy: technique, findings and diagnostic pitfalls [^efedd36a]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meckel diverticulum, the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, results from the aberrant involution of the omphalomesenteric duct and accounts for more than 50% of unexplained lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the pediatric population. The most accurate imaging tool to identify a Meckel diverticulum containing ectopic gastric mucosa is the Technetium-99m pertechnetate Meckel scan, a scintigraphic study with a reported accuracy of 90% in the pediatric population. In addition to depicting a Meckel diverticulum with ectopic gastric mucosa, careful attention to the normal biodistribution of the radiotracer can lead to the identification of unexpected pathology with implications for patient management. This article serves to review the embryological origin and anatomical features of Meckel diverticulum, highlight the role of scintigraphy in evaluating Meckel diverticulum, and discuss the proper imaging technique when performing this test. We will focus on pitfalls that can lead to an erroneous diagnosis as well as incidental findings that can affect patient management.

### Tc-pertechnetate in diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum in an adult [^8f0df40d]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the most common malformations of the gastrointestinal tract is Meckel diverticulum (MD). MD complications can range from minor to major, such as intestinal obstruction, intussusception, hemorrhage, ulceration, vesicodiverticular fistulae, and tumors. Bleeding from ectopic gastric mucosa is more common in children than in adults. In the current case, MD in a 25-y-old man was diagnosed by 99m Tc-pertechnetate scanning. 99m Tc-pertechnetate scanning helps to diagnose MD noninvasively and has a potential role in the evaluation of MD even in adults.

### Bleeding Meckel's diverticulum: a study of the accuracy of pertechnetate scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool [^892901e6]. European Journal of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The reported accuracy of pertechnetate scintigraphy (Meckel scan) in investigating children with a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum has increased steadily since it was first introduced into clinical practice in 1970. Recent studies have indicated that the examination has a sensitivity of up to 94% and a specificity of up to 97% in this scenario. There have also been several misleading reviews from Departments of Surgery, suggesting that the Meckel scan has a poor predictive value, and should not be relied upon to exclude a bleeding Meckel's Diverticulum (MD).

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of pertechnetate scintigraphy performed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (OLCHC) on children with clinical suspicion of a bleeding MD.

Method

This was a retrospective study of all the Meckel scans performed over a 10year period (2005–2015) in OLCHC, 144 in total.

Results

Of the total 144 scans performed, 22 were considered to be positive, and all patients were found to have a MD at surgery. 122 were negative, and in 53 of these patients, an alternative cause for symptoms was found, often at endoscopy. In the remaining 69 patients, no cause was found, despite full medical work-up. In all of these cases, symptoms resolved, and have not yet recurred, making MD very unlikely.

Discussion

Pertechnetate scintigraphy, when performed using meticulous technique, can provide up to 100% sensitivity CI [85.1, 100.0] and 100% specificity CI [93.2, 100.0] in diagnosing a bleeding MD in a paediatric population. This examination is seldom of value in children with no history of rectal bleeding.

In Afghanistan, inaccessibility to healthcare facilities, low socioeconomic status, poor literacy rates, and lack of awareness regarding emergency conditions contribute to delayed presentations and increased morbidity and mortality. Misdiagnosis due to a shortage of experienced clinicians and imaging professionals (mostly on an outpatient basis), along with the unavailability of advanced diagnostic tools such as the technetium-99 scan, further complicates timely diagnosis and treatment. Despite the challenges of a resource-limited setting, including the absence of a well-equipped intensive care unit (ICU), we made every effort to ensure the patient's full recovery.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^ed0615f2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The area evaluated during small bowel examination has increased with the development of DBE, single-balloon enteroscopy, and CE. In the diagnosis of MD, DBE and single-balloon enteroscopy are useful especially because direct observation of MD and ulceration is possible. DBE and single-balloon enteroscopy also enable the performance of biopsy and endoscopic hemostasis. We directly observed MD using DBE in nine cases. MD is usually situated about 100 cm from the ileocecal valve, so retrograde DBE is particularly useful. A restriction of emergent retrograde DBE is that bowel preparation is required. In Case 7, we could not reach MD by anterograde DBE, but we identified MD using iodinated contrast medium through the scope. This method is useful when retrograde DBE is difficult because of massive hemorrhage and clots; however, this method is not always successful, as shown in Case 8. CE is also effective; however, the movement of the capsule is passive, making biopsy, insufflation, and endoscopic hemostasis impossible. The capsule could become trapped in MD. CE may be more useful to determine the approach of DBE (peroral or anal). Whether DBE or CE is performed first depends on the current clinical situation. DBE should precede CE in an emergency. Abdominal CT, Tc-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy, and small bowel series are also effective. Abdominal CT is particularly useful to detect bleeding, intussusception, and similar conditions. However, DBE is comparatively better able to identify MD as shown in the present report. Tc-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy revealed MD in only one of six patients. If Tc-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy results are negative, the presence of MD cannot be denied. Tc-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy is a good diagnostic modality for children because of its minimal invasiveness. Our hospital's diagnostic flowchart for MD is shown in Figure 5.

### Meckel's masquerade: penetrating the disguise [^10d21c5e]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Children with abdominal pain are frequently seen in emergency departments. Physicians and parents worry about appendicitis; physicians are also concerned about intussusception and bowel obstruction in patients with previous surgical procedures. Sometimes the patient is ill, and the diagnosis is elusive. In a 6-month period at our pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 57,400 patients, we cared for 4 patients who presented with abdominal pain due to complications of Meckel's diverticulum. None presented with painless rectal bleeding, the complication of which physicians are most aware. We are reporting these patients to raise awareness of Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of acute abdomen in children. Meckel's diverticulum may masquerade as appendicitis, an abdominal mass, intussusception, or a complication of severe constipation.

### Diverticular disease associated with inflammatory bowel disease-like colitis: a systematic review [^013b1b9d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Diverticular-associated colitis significantly overlaps clinically with primary inflammatory bowel disease. However, the clinical and the pathologic features of diverticular-associated colitis suggest that it is a distinct clinical entity.

Methods

We performed a systematic review by use of multiple health care databases and gray literature, following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine the clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features of diverticular-associated colitis, and recurrence rates following medical and surgical treatment.

Results

Two hundred twenty-seven participants were selected from 18 eligible studies, including our own patients (n = 13). The average age of disease onset was 64 years. The typical symptoms included tenesmus, hematochezia, and diarrhea. One hundred sixty-three of the 227 patients in these studies were classified as having diverticular-associated colitis, of which 142 were managed medically. Twenty-eight patients eventually required an operation. One-quarter (37 of 163) of the patients had recurrence of symptoms with an average follow-up time of three years.

Conclusions

Diverticular-associated colitis is a distinct entity that presents with segmental colitis and a variety of clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic features. Diverticular-associated colitis should be considered in the presence of recurrent symptoms after resection for diverticulitis.

### Meckel's diverticulum: review and management… [^68637172]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum results from incomplete obliteration of the omphalomesenteric or vitelline duct. Although several anomalies can occur, 90 percent of vitelline duct abnormalities are Meckel's diverticulum with or without connection to the umbilicus or mesentery. Meckel's diverticulum contains all layers of normal intestinal wall and is usually located within 100 cm of the ileocecal valve. The lifetime complication rate for Meckel's diverticulum is approximately 4 percent, with complications most often caused by ectopic tissue or bands. More than 50 percent of those who develop symptoms are younger than 10 years. Symptoms have also been found to be more common in males than in females. Complications can include obstruction or inflammation, bleeding, and tumors.

The diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum can be made by small bowel enema. Computed tomography and ultrasonography generally are not helpful because it is often difficult to distinguish between diverticulum and intestinal loops. Radionuclide scanning and arteriography may be useful when bleeding is present. Laparoscopy has been reported to be a helpful tool in diagnosing the anomaly. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is treated with surgical resection using open or laparoscopic techniques. The indications for incidental diverticulectomy in patients with asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum are unclear, and there are no definite intraoperative anatomic or biologic criteria to predict the likelihood of future complications.

Recent epidemiologic studies compared patients who underwent surgery for Meckel's diverticulum–related complications over time with early and late diverticulectomy-associated complications in patients who underwent prophylactic removal of incidentally discovered Meckel's diverticulum. Among the patients with complications, the incidence of surgery increased steadily through the age of 80 years. The study findings showed that the risk of complications was higher in patients with Meckel's diverticulum than in those who underwent prophylactic removal of the anomaly. The authors concluded that because the risk of complications from Meckel's diverticulum does not decrease with age, the benefits of incidental diverticulectomy outweigh the morbidity and mortality of surgery.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of small bowel bleeding [^2875ad70]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and etiology of small bowel bleeding — prevalence of small bowel lesions has been estimated to be ~5–10% in patients presenting with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and common causes are found in ~75% of patients with suspected small bowel bleeding. A 2008 meta-analysis reported small bowel vascular lesions 24% for both video capsule endoscopy (VCE) (N = 371) and double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) (N = 364), inflammatory findings 18% for VCE (N = 343) and 16% for DBE (N = 336), and mass lesions 11% (VCE, N = 343 and DBE, N = 336). Comparative analyses showed patients undergoing DBE in Asian countries were more likely to have neoplastic findings, whereas angioectasia were more common in Western countries. Age patterns included that patients under the age of 40 years are more likely to have inflammatory bowel disease or Meckel's diverticulum, while angioectasia, other vascular lesions, and ulcers secondary to anti-inflammatory agents are more likely in patients over the age of 40 years.

### Diverticular disease and colorectal cancer: incidental diagnosis or real association? Final answer [^f7c9da49]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Associations between diverticular disease of the colon and the colorectal cancer has been studied for > 60 years. Observational, cross-sectional, and case-control studies as well as large population-based studies gave conflicting results and association was not fully proven. Obtaining the proof was difficult because both diseases share similar clinical characteristics, both increase with age, and both involve similar dietary factors. Long-term observations are difficult as diagnostic methods changed over time from barium enema 50 to 60 years ago, through endoscopy, up to CT and MR in recent years. Cancer or adenomas may be missed within diverticular segment; diverticula may be underreported in patients with colon cancer diagnosis. Most recent 2 large cohort studies have solved the dilemma. These studies have clearly shown that diverticular disease does not increase the risk of colon cancer after the first year of diagnosis. Within the first year of diagnosis the association is strong, most probably due to difficulties with differential diagnosis and misclassifications and shared symptoms. Findings of these studies have led to the conclusion that colon cancer has to be excluded using modern techniques after the first episode of suspected diverticulitis.

### Post-appendicectomy small bowel obstruction due to internal hernia involving Meckel's diverticulum [^c2459b4d]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small bowel, present in about 2% of the population. A man in his 20s underwent a laparoscopic appendicectomy for acute appendicitis and recovered uneventfully. He presented to the emergency department 1month later with features of acute small bowel obstruction. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a band adhesion between the apex of a Meckel's diverticulum to the appendicectomy stump. Internal herniation of ileum under this band adhesion resulted in small bowel obstruction and ischaemic necrosis of the Meckel's diverticulum. The band adhesion was divided, and the Meckel's diverticulum was resected at the base with a linear cutting stapler. This complication has not been reported previously. A Meckel's diverticulum is an important differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis and should routinely be searched for among other pathologies. It can rarely cause a postoperative complication of internal hernia.

Abstract

A 17-year-old adolescent boy presented with multiple episodes of hematochezia. After a negative 99mTcO4 scan, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and CT angiography, the patient underwent a second 99mTcO4 scan with ranitidine. The anterior images demonstrated a faint, delayed focus of uptake in the midabdomen without correlate on lateral projections. SPECT/CT was performed for localization with the focus of activity seen in an anterior loop of distal small bowel adjacent to the umbilicus. The patient subsequently underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and resection of the diverticulum with postoperative resolution of the symptoms.

### An internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum: a case report [^4b26f5e4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year old female patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting for 1 day. The body mass index (BMI) of the patient was 22.86 kg/m 2. She had no previous medical or surgical illness. On admission, her pulse rate was 101 beats per minute, blood pressure was 95/65 mmHg, and body temperature was 38.4 °C. On physical examination, there was abdominal distension, periumbilical tenderness and rebound tenderness. Preoperative laboratory examinations revealed white blood cell count of 15.54 × 10 9 /L (normal range 3.5 × 10 9 /L -9.5 × 10 9 /L). C-reactive protein was 24.07 mg/L (normal range 0–3 mg/L). Contrast enhanced computed tomography revealed focal dilatation and thickening of the small bowel loop with surrounding fat stranding raising possibility of intestinal obstruction due to internal herniation (Fig. 1). The provisional diagnosis of strangulated intestinal obstruction was made. After initial resuscitation, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy.

At surgery, a 5-cm-long Meckel's diverticulum was found one meter away from the ileocecal junction. The tip of the diverticulum was densely adhered to the adjoining mesentery forming a narrow ring. A part of the small intestine was seen drilled into the narrow ring formed by the diverticulum and mesentery causing gangrene of the herniated small intestine (Fig. 2). Adhesiolysis and resection of the Meckel's diverticulum with the gangrenous bowel with anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day. At 3-month postoperative follow-up, the patient is symptom-free and has restored normal activity and diet.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: cohort study [^210c5d41]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

In this study we included only patients who had a first ever alarm symptom, with a complete date, recorded between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2000, and whose data were up to standard at the date of the symptom.

We constructed a list of pre-specified, potentially important diagnoses (that is, conditions that generally require treatment or are likely to be progressive, or both) for each of the alarm symptoms by referring to recently published standard textbooks describing differential diagnoses in primary care and validated these lists by circulating and discussing them with general practitioner colleagues. For haematuria we included urinary tract cancer, kidney stone, benign prostatic hyperplasia, orchitis, urinary tract infection, menstrual disorders, glomerulonephritis, urethritis, bleeding disorders, renal tuberculosis, polycystic kidneys, infective endocarditis, schistosomiasis, and cancers of the uterus and prostate. For haemoptysis we included respiratory tract cancer, acute upper respiratory infection, acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, asthma, influenza, pulmonary embolism, bleeding disorders, pulmonary oedema/left ventricular failure, mitral stenosis, polyarteris nodosa, pulmonary tuberculosis, aspergillosis, Goodpasture's syndrome, and pulmonary atrioventricular malformation. For dysphagia we included upper gastrointestinal cancers, oesophagitis, oesophageal stricture, hiatus hernia, gastritis, stomach disorders, peptic ulcer (including gastric and duodenal ulcer), globus hystericus, pharyngeal pouch, Chagas' disease, scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, achalasia, and gastric cancer. Finally, for rectal bleeding we included colorectal and anal cancer, diverticulitis, anal fissure, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, infectious gastroenteritis, haemorrhoids, peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, angiodysplasia, intussusception, and Meckel's diverticulum.

### SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for Meckel diverticulum scintigraphy 2.0 [^fba61240]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2014). Medium credibility.

Common clinical indications — Meckel scintigraphy is indicated to localize ectopic gastric mucosa in a Meckel diverticulum as the source of unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding; bleeding Meckel diverticulum usually occurs in young children, whereas when bleeding occurs in an older child it is more likely from a benign polyp or small-bowel tumor, and even in young children active bleeding is best studied by radiolabeled red blood cell (RBC) scintigraphy.
