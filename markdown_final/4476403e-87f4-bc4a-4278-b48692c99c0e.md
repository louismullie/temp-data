## Question

Lead screening ages

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended ages for blood lead screening in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that screening should be risk-based and locally driven. Then, I should verify the federal Medicaid requirement and its exact ages. Next, I will examine CDC's current reference value and how it influences action thresholds. After that, I need to check AAP/Bright Futures guidance on risk assessment and when to test. Then, I will consider special high-risk populations and any exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, age-based algorithm and confirm follow-up and confirmation protocols, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from different sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: screening for lead exposure is not universally mandated for all children nationwide; instead, it should be targeted to children at higher risk based on local housing age, sociodemographic factors, and environmental hazards, with universal screening reserved for areas lacking a local plan or for populations with documented elevated risk, which is the current CDC stance and aligns with AAP policy emphasizing local data-driven strategies [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236] [^75ae634a].

> Wait, let me verify the federal Medicaid requirement because that is the clearest age-based mandate. CMS requires that all children enrolled in Medicaid receive a blood lead test at 12 months and again at 24 months; if a child aged 24–72 months has never been screened, they must be tested at that time, and states cannot adopt a Medicaid plan that does not include this requirement, which establishes a universal screening floor for Medicaid-enrolled children regardless of local prevalence [^442de96a] [^b6543413] [^19fa3060].

> I need to check the current CDC blood lead reference value (BLRV) because it shapes when to act. In 2021, CDC updated the BLRV to 3.5 μg/dL based on the 97.5th percentile of NHANES data for children 1–5 years; this is a population-based benchmark to trigger case management and public health follow-up, not a toxicity threshold, and it applies to children aged 1–5 years, which operationalizes action for results at or above this level [^0fbb546b] [^c0fbc504] [^eb40e55f].

> Next, I should review AAP/Bright Futures guidance to ensure I'm not missing routine risk assessment ages. The AAP recommends a risk assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months, and at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years, with blood lead testing guided by that assessment; importantly, many children who test positive are identified at 1–2 years, reinforcing the need to prioritize screening in early childhood when exposure risk and absorption are highest [^6841f8a3] [^75ae634a].

> Hold on, I should verify special high-risk populations that warrant testing outside routine schedules. Children in foster or kinship care, recent immigrants, refugees, and internationally adopted children are considered high risk and should be screened on arrival and managed per AAP guidance; refugee children 0–16 years should have an initial blood lead test with repeat testing at 3–6 months for those ≤ 6 years, and adolescents with risk factors or elevated results should also be retested, reflecting higher prevalence and unique exposure sources in these groups [^095f366d] [^adef6fbe] [^17fe0219] [^82990946].

> Let me consider the timing rationale to ensure the ages make physiologic sense. Blood lead levels tend to peak around 24 months due to hand-to-mouth behavior and environmental exposures, which is why screening at 12 and 24 months is strategic; if a child is missed at those ages, catching up between 24 and 72 months is essential to avoid persistent exposure and its neurodevelopmental consequences [^a5f8297b] [^7001ecc6].

> I should double-check the follow-up and confirmation protocol because screening alone is insufficient. Capillary screening tests should be confirmed with a venous blood lead level, and the urgency of confirmation depends on the initial result: within 3 months for 3.5–9 μg/dL, within 1 month for 10–19 μg/dL, within 2 weeks for 20–44 μg/dL, and as soon as possible for ≥ 45 μg/dL; case management steps escalate with higher levels, including environmental investigation, nutritional counseling, and consideration of chelation at very high levels [^42f1ce05] [^dff93660].

> But wait, what if local prevalence is high or there is no local plan? In the absence of a jurisdiction-specific, data-driven screening plan, CDC recommends universal blood lead testing, which means clinicians should default to testing all children in those settings; conversely, in jurisdictions with robust local plans, testing should follow the targeted risk criteria, which often include housing built before 1960, low income, or other locally validated risk factors [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236] [^75ae634a].

> Let me synthesize a practical, age-based algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. For all children, conduct risk assessment at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months, and at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years; for Medicaid-enrolled children, universally test at 12 and 24 months, and test any child 24–72 months who has never been screened; for non-Medicaid children, test if the risk assessment is positive or if local risk is high; for high-risk populations such as foster care, refugees, immigrants, and internationally adopted children, test on arrival and follow refugee-specific retesting schedules; confirm elevated capillary results venously and manage per the updated BLRV and AAP guidance [^6841f8a3] [^442de96a] [^0fbb546b] [^17fe0219] [^42f1ce05].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the CDC mandated universal screening for all children at 1 and 2 years regardless of risk, but that overstates federal policy; I should correct that. CDC supports targeted screening based on local risk and recommends universal screening only in the absence of a local plan, whereas the universal 12- and 24-month mandate is a CMS requirement for Medicaid-enrolled children, not a blanket CDC mandate for all children nationwide, so I need to keep those distinctions clear in counseling and documentation [^0fbb546b] [^442de96a].

---

Lead screening is recommended at **12 and 24 months** for all children enrolled in Medicaid, and at **24–72 months** if not previously tested [^442de96a] [^b6543413]. For non-Medicaid children, screening is **targeted** based on local risk factors such as older housing, low income, or immigration/refugee status [^0fbb546b] [^19fa3060]. The CDC's 2021 update lowered the blood lead reference value to **3.5 µg/dL**, prompting earlier intervention for levels ≥ 3.5 µg/dL [^0fbb546b] [^c0fbc504]. Universal screening is advised in high-prevalence areas or when local risk data are unavailable, while targeted screening is preferred in low-risk communities [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236].

## Recommended screening ages and intervals

### Medicaid-enrolled children

Medicaid-enrolled children should be screened at **12 and 24 months**; if not previously tested, screen at 24–72 months [^442de96a] [^b6543413]. This schedule is **federally mandated** and aligns with CDC guidance [^442de96a].

---

### Non-Medicaid children

For non-Medicaid children, screening is **targeted** based on local risk factors; universal screening is recommended only when local risk data are unavailable or prevalence is high [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236]. Risk factors include:

- Living in or visiting homes built before 1978, especially if deteriorated or renovated [^19fa3060] [^a7adb62e].
- Low socioeconomic status or residence in high-risk neighborhoods [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236].
- Immigration, refugee status, or international adoption [^17fe0219] [^82990946].
- Parental occupations or hobbies involving lead exposure [^19fa3060].

---

## Rationale for screening at 12 and 24 months

Screening at 12 and 24 months targets the **peak exposure risk** period, when children are mobile, exhibit hand-to-mouth behavior, and have higher absorption of lead [^a5f8297b] [^bc2440af]. Early detection enables timely intervention to prevent neurodevelopmental harm [^bc2440af].

---

## Updated blood lead reference value (BLRV)

In 2021, CDC lowered the BLRV to **3.5 µg/dL** (from 5 µg/dL), reflecting the 97.5th percentile of BLLs in children 1–5 years [^0fbb546b] [^c0fbc504]. This change expands the pool of children eligible for case management and environmental intervention [^eb40e55f].

---

## Follow-up and management protocols

Follow-up depends on the **initial BLL**:

| **Blood lead level (bll)** | **Recommended follow-up actions** |
|-|-|
| < 3.5 µg/dL | Routine care, retest in 6–12 months if high risk [^dff93660] |
| 3.5–9 µg/dL | Confirm with venous test within 3 months; environmental assessment; nutritional counseling [^42f1ce05] [^eb40e55f] |
| 10–19 µg/dL | Confirm within 1 month; environmental investigation; case management [^42f1ce05] [^dff93660] |
| 20–44 µg/dL | Confirm within 2 weeks; urgent environmental intervention; medical evaluation [^42f1ce05] [^dff93660] |
| ≥ 45 µg/dL | Confirm within 48 hours; hospitalization; chelation therapy [^42f1ce05] [^dff93660] |

---

## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening rates

During the COVID-19 pandemic, screening rates declined by about 34% in early 2020, causing an estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLLs to be missed [^f55451a0] [^bc2440af]. Rates have since recovered but remain below pre-pandemic levels, especially in high-risk communities [^4f1dc057] [^788e28ec].

---

## Current challenges and disparities

Persistent disparities affect screening and outcomes, with higher risks among **low-income, non-Hispanic Black, and immigrant/refugee children** [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236]. Barriers include limited access to care, provider adherence, and follow-up gaps [^f08c8043] [^ff247b41].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Medicaid-enrolled children**: Screen at 12 and 24 months; if not previously tested, screen at 24–72 months [^442de96a] [^b6543413].
- **Non-Medicaid children**: Use targeted screening based on local risk; universal screening if local data are unavailable or prevalence is high [^0fbb546b] [^1b166236].
- **BLRV**: 3.5 µg/dL; initiate case management at or above this level [^0fbb546b] [^c0fbc504].
- **Follow-up**: Confirm elevated capillary results venously and manage according to BLL-based protocols [^42f1ce05] [^dff93660].

---

Lead screening is **targeted to 12 and 24 months** for Medicaid-enrolled children, with broader screening guided by local risk; the 2021 BLRV of 3.5 µg/dL supports earlier intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental harm [^0fbb546b] [^c0fbc504].

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^7001ecc6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening and targeted risk assessment — CDC recommendations specify ages and high-risk follow-up: CDC recommends that locally developed targeted risk assessment and blood lead screening strategies be applied at ages 1 and 2 years, and children aged 36–72 months who have been identified as being at high risk and who have not been screened previously also should receive a blood lead test. For clinicians in areas that lack a state or local screening plan, CDC recommends that a blood lead test be performed on all children at ages 1 and 2 years and on children aged 36–72 months who have not been screened previously. Because exposures may change, two routine screenings are recommended (at approximately ages 1 and 2 years). Among children in Chicago at high risk with blood lead levels (BLLs) < 10 μg/dL at age 1 year, 21% had a BLL of ≥ 10 μg/dL when tested again at age ≥ 2 years. Certain local health departments recommend BLL testing starting at ages 6–9 months in high risk areas, testing every 6 months for children aged < 2 years, and additional education and more rapid follow-up testing for children aged < 12 months with BLLs 6–9 μg/dL.

### Who to test? A retrospective study of lead testing in high-risk children [^86a9b8b5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nearly all pediatric patients in our setting meet high-risk criteria for lead exposure based on screening recommendations and guidelines. Implementation of screening and testing has been inconsistent.

Objective

To assess the utility and efficacy of performing universal lead testing between ages 1 and 5 at an urban academic pediatric practice.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with routine lead testing between 2010 and 2015. Key variables included demographics, serum lead level, and behavioral diagnoses.

Results

A total of 6597 serum lead levels from 3274 patients were reviewed. Forty-seven samples (0.7%) from 24 patients (0.7%) were elevated. Of the 24 patients with elevated lead, 75% were identified at age 1 or 2. Sixty-seven percent of patients with first elevated lead level at age 3 or older had a diagnosis of developmental delay.

Conclusion

Routine testing of high-risk patients yielded minimal specificity in identifying elevated lead levels, especially in patients older than 3 years and without developmental delay.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^8e5ec2b5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Summary of recommendations — For clinicians, provide anticipatory guidance to parents of all young children regarding sources of lead and help them identify sources of lead in their child's environment. Evaluate laboratory performance by reviewing the laboratory's quality control chart or statistical quality control summary, and review office procedures and policies to ensure that lead exposure risk assessment or blood lead screening is performed on all children as required by state or local health officials or as recommended by CDC. Consider the child's age, season of testing, and exposure history when deciding when to obtain follow-up blood lead tests; for a child whose blood lead level (BLL) is approaching 10 µg/dL, more frequent blood lead screening (i.e., more than annually) might be appropriate, particularly if the child is aged < 2 years old, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures. Perform a diagnostic blood lead test on all children suspected of having lead exposure or an elevated BLL and institute the recommended management guidelines if a child's BLL increases to ≥ 10 µg/dL. Help parents to understand the uncertainty of a blood lead value and potential reasons for its fluctuation, including error introduced by the sampling methods and laboratory-, age-, and season-related exposures. Whenever possible, utilize laboratories that can achieve routine performance of ± 2 µg/dL for blood lead analysis.

### Lead poisoning in children [^09988c60]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning has become more common in children. Blood lead levels of less than 5 µg per dL are associated with impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral development that are irreversible. Risk factors for lead poisoning include age younger than five years, low socioeconomic status, living in housing built before 1978, and use of imported food, medicines, and pottery. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation in 2019 citing insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of universal screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. Local risk factors can be substantial, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that states and cities formulate their own targeted screening guidelines. In the absence of local guidance, the CDC recommends screening all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 months and again at 24 months, or at least once between 36 and 72 months if not previously screened. The CDC also recommends universal screening in areas where more than 27% of the housing was built before 1950, or where at least 12% of children 12 to 36 months of age have blood lead levels greater than 10 µg per dL. Life-threatening lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, and lower levels should prompt case management and environmental investigations to identify and remove the source of exposure. Primary prevention strategies are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of lead on child development.

### Screening for elevated lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: an updated summary of evidence for the US preventive services task force [^adad8501]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force provided recommendations for routine screening of asymptomatic children and pregnant women for elevated blood lead levels. This review updates the evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and intervention for elevated blood lead in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Methods

We searched Medline, reference lists of review articles, and tables of contents of leading pediatric journals for studies published in 1995 or later that contained new information about the prevalence, diagnosis, natural course, or treatment of elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years and pregnant women.

Results

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among children and women in the United States, like that in the general population, continues to decline sharply, primarily because of marked reductions in environmental exposure, but still varies substantially among different communities and populations. Similar to the findings in 1996, our searches did not identify direct evidence from controlled studies that screening children for elevated blood lead levels results in improved health outcomes, and there was no direct evidence identified from controlled studies that screening improves pregnancy or perinatal outcomes. No new relevant information regarding the accuracy of screening for lead toxicity was identified during the update, and we did not identify evidence that demonstrates that universal screening for blood lead results in better clinical outcomes than targeted screening. Substantial new relevant information regarding the adverse effects of screening and interventions was not identified.

Conclusions

There is no persuasive evidence that screening for elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children will improve clinical outcomes. For those children who are screened and found to have elevated levels, there is conflicting evidence demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of early detection and intervention.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^a5f8297b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening policies — CDC policies transitioned from universal to targeted approaches with specified testing ages. As early as 1978, CDC recommended universal screening of all children aged 9 months–6 years but emphasized screening children with specific risk factors. In 1997, CDC replaced universal screening of children aged 9 months–6 years with targeted screening, called for states to analyze their BLL data and develop state screening plans, and recommended continued universal screening of Medicaid-eligible children "unless there [are] reliable, representative BLL data that demonstrate the absence of lead exposure in this population". As an interim measure, CDC recommended two blood lead tests for higher-risk children — one at age 9–12 months and one at age 2 years — because BLLs peak at 24 months, and also recommended that high-risk children who have never been tested be retested at age 3 years.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^14429ecc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Future research needs — priorities for children with low blood lead: Further study is needed to assess the effects of BLLs < 10 μg/dL on children. Additional research also is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to lower exposures to lead. Blood lead screening strategies should be evaluated to determine the most appropriate ages for screening and the utility of screening strategies applied at the community level. Evaluations of lead surveillance strategies should test ways to identify changing patterns of environmental risks and subpopulations exposed to established and emerging sources of lead.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^9c2911bb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — for blood lead screening of children aged 1–5 years who are eligible for Medicaid, CDC recommends that state and local public health officials 1) update blood lead screening policies for Medicaid-eligible children, 2) improve rates of blood lead screening among Medicaid-eligible children determined to be at increased risk for lead exposure, and 3) design and implement updated surveillance and evaluation strategies.

---

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^b6543413]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening strategies — CDC and AAP have recommended that health-care providers conduct blood lead tests on children enrolled in Medicaid and those identified as being at risk on the basis of the state or local screening plan or the risk assessment process, and federal policy requires that all children enrolled in Medicaid receive screening blood lead tests at ages 12 and 24 months and that blood lead screening be performed for children aged 36–72 months who have not been screened previously.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^8afc6e83]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Universal blood lead screening — states without screening plans: The nine states without lead screening plans should continue to perform universal blood lead screening of Medicaid-enrolled children until these states have completed assessments of risk for lead exposure among these children, reached consensus on data-driven primary and secondary lead poisoning prevention strategic plans for the community (including blood lead screening), and implemented these plans, and the 1997 CDC lead screening recommendations include guidance on involving community stakeholders in such a process.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^7ac043fa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Blood lead screening of Medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years — update blood lead screening policies for Medicaid-eligible children: At the population level, evaluate risk data among all children and the risk for lead exposure among Medicaid-eligible children; in states with data-driven lead screening recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children, health officials should initiate a participatory process among all stakeholders that involves screening Medicaid-eligible children according to established local risk factors per the targeted statewide lead screening recommendations; in states without data-driven lead screening recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children, health officials should provide basic lead screening guidance online and through other communication channels that reach health-care providers.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^75ae634a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Testing asymptomatic children — screening tools and targeted criteria: Screening questionnaires frequently used in primary care fail to identify children with elevated blood lead concentrations, but they may be useful to identify lead hazards in children who have a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb). In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended universal blood lead testing for all children; in 2005 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that states and cities formulate their own screening recommendations on the basis of local data. The AAP, consistent with the CDC, recommended universal screening if communities had more than 27% of housing built before 1950 or a prevalence of blood lead concentrations ≥ 10 μg/dL in children 12 to 36 months old of 12% or greater. Screening is not efficient after 36 months of age unless specific high-risk factors are identified, and the likelihood of a child having a blood lead concentration > 10 μg/dL after 36 months of age is low. A detailed evaluation and follow-up of children who have blood lead concentrations < 10 μg/dL (< 100 ppb) is now indicated.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^0fbb546b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The negative impact of lead exposure on young children and those who become pregnant is well documented but is not well known by those at highest risk from this hazard. Scientific evidence suggests that there is no known safe blood lead level (BLL), because even small amounts of lead can be harmful to a child's developing brain (1). In 2012, CDC introduced the population-based blood lead reference value (BLRV) to identify children exposed to more lead than most other children in the United States. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. The BLRV is based on the 97.5th percentile of the blood lead distribution in U.S. children aged 1–5 years from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. NHANES is a complex, multistage survey designed to provide a nationally representative assessment of health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized civilian adult and child populations in the United States (2). The initial BLRV of 5 μg/dL, established in 2012, was based on data from the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles. Consistent with recommendations from a former advisory committee, this report updates CDC's BLRV in children to 3.5 μg/dL using NHANES data derived from the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 cycles and provides helpful information to support adoption by state and local health departments, health care providers (HCPs), clinical laboratories, and others and serves as an opportunity to advance health equity and environmental justice related to preventable lead exposure. CDC recommends that public health and clinical professionals focus screening efforts on populations at high risk based on age of housing and sociodemographic risk factors. Public health and clinical professionals should collaborate to develop screening plans responsive to local conditions using local data. In the absence of such plans, universal BLL testing is recommended. In addition, jurisdictions should follow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requirement that all Medicaid-enrolled children be tested at ages 12 and 24 months or at age 24–72 months if they have not previously been screened (3).

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^3ad05fbc]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead level is associated with serious, often irreversible, health consequences.

Objective

To synthesize evidence on the effects of screening, testing, and treatment for elevated blood lead level in pregnant women and children aged 5 years and younger in the primary care setting to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Cochrane CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through June 2018) and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June 2018); surveillance through December 5, 2018.

Study Selection

English-language trials and observational studies of screening for and treating elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent critical appraisal and data abstraction by 2 reviewers using predefined criteria.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Elevated blood lead level, morbidity, mortality, clinical prediction tools, test accuracy, adverse events.

Results

A total of 24 studies (N = 11 433) were included in this review. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening vs no screening in children. More than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 48% (95% CI, 31.4% to 65.6%) and specificity of 58% (95% CI, 39.9% to 74.0%) for identifying children with a venous blood lead level greater than 10 μg/dL (5 studies [n = 2265]). Adapted versions of the CDC questionnaire did not demonstrate improved accuracy. Capillary blood lead testing demonstrated sensitivity of 87% to 91% and specificity greater than 90%, compared with venous measurement (4 studies [n = 1431]). Counseling and nutritional interventions or residential lead hazard control techniques did not reduce blood lead concentrations in asymptomatic children, but studies were few and had methodological limitations (7 studies [n = 1419]). One trial (n = 780) of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelation therapy found reduced blood lead levels in children at 1 week to 1 year but not at 4.5 to 6 years, while another trial (n = 39) found no effect at 1 and 6 months. Seven-year follow-up assessments showed no effect on neuropsychological development, a small deficit in linear growth (height difference, 1.17 cm [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.93]), and poorer cognitive outcomes reported as the Attention and Executive Functions subscore of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (unadjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -4.5 to 1.0]; adjusted P = 0.045) in children treated with DMSA chelation. Evidence was too limited to determine the accuracy of screening questionnaires or benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening questionnaires were not accurate for identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Chelating agents in children were not significantly associated with sustained effects on blood level levels but were associated with harms.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^ee79132f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Use surveillance strategies to track blood lead levels — NHANES remains an effective tool for generating national estimates of children aged 1–5 years with elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) and for evaluating nationwide primary prevention interventions.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^686d7aef]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for blood lead screening of Medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years — targeting high-risk groups — emphasize that "children who are at risk for lead poisoning are identified and treated appropriately"; policy guidance specifies that "decisions regarding the level of risk for EBLs among Medicaid-eligible children should be made by state and local health departments"; that "lead screening tests should be provided at WIC sites, and new blood lead testing technologies should be considered"; and that "existing surveillance systems should be refined to include other measures of risk of exposure, including environmental measures, so that they are not solely dependent on BLL testing for identifying risk for lead poisoning".

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^bc76a14d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant, and exposure to lead is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. Lead is associated with negative outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, CDC defined the blood lead level (BLL) that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, CDC also recognized that a BLL of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL. This report summarizes the findings of a review of clinical interpretation and management of BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL conducted by CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. This report provides information to help clinicians understand BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL, identifies gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outlines strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. In addition, this report summarizes scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of BLLs, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As local and patient circumstances permit, clinicians should consider early referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and consider more frequent rescreening of children with BLLs approaching 10 microg/dL, depending on the potential for exposure to lead, child age, and season of testing. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health-care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2b852a5d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Lead screening policies for Medicaid-eligible children — state and local risk–based approaches emphasize that state-issued recommendations might be more implementable and improve screening, and that providers might follow policies they helped develop and that reflect local risk for elevated blood lead levels (EBLs). State and local health authorities should consider practicality and ensure feasibility when developing recommendations. Many policies might not require individual risk assessment before testing; states could choose to screen all Medicaid-eligible children, apply the same screening policies to Medicaid-eligible and general-population children, or use objective criteria to select populations. In most CDC-funded programs, surveillance and Medicaid enrollment data can be matched to assess screening rates and examine blood lead levels (BLLs). Personal risk questionnaires often have limited effectiveness and might be impractical in some settings.

Blood lead levels (BLL) in children — Lead has been associated with numerous adverse health effects in humans, and in children, even BLLs < 10 μg/dL can result in decreased cognitive function, developmental delays, and behavior problems; these adverse effects reinforce the importance of screening and continued measures to eliminate or control lead sources in children's environments.

Improve rates of blood lead screening — Medicaid-eligible children at increased risk: State and federal Medicaid agencies and their partners should work to improve screening rates of Medicaid-eligible children at risk for lead exposure, and although children who are eligible for Medicaid can no longer be assumed to have an increased risk for EBLLs, certain Medicaid-eligible children will still need blood lead screening and would benefit from follow-up services.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^2a377b1a]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Screening for cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents focuses on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occurring relatively early in life (e.g., before ages 50–60 years) and highlights two complementary strategies: primordial prevention for all children and primary prevention targeted to those with dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or other identified factors, with primary prevention requiring screening to determine individual risk levels. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal newborn screening for metabolic conditions, hemoglobinopathy, and hearing loss, and selective screening for elevated levels of lead in infancy and early childhood. Universal screening carries a high burden of proof because screening targets asymptomatic individuals, downstream consequences can be both beneficial and harmful, and widespread programs are costly. The highest quality evidence for screening utility comes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of screening versus no screening, with children followed for decades to determine disease incidence and enable balancing of benefits, risks, and costs; however, for dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, such large, long-term trials are unlikely due to time, cost, adherence, and follow-up challenges, and initial tests may be obsolete by the time definitive endpoints accrue. An RCT with shorter-term follow-up assessing changes in risk factors or surrogate outcomes may be more feasible, but subclinical measures of atherosclerosis do not perfectly predict clinical CVD outcomes. As an example supporting the rationale for screening, children with coarctation of the aorta have elevation of upper body blood pressure (BP) from infancy, and when surgical repair is delayed, early death from heart attack, stroke, and aortic rupture has been documented.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^a7adb62e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Childhood lead testing and targeted screening in primary care are outlined as follows: Pediatricians and other primary care providers should test asymptomatic children for elevated blood lead concentrations according to federal, local, and state requirements, and immigrant, refugee, and internationally adopted children also should be tested when they arrive in the United States because of their increased risk; blood lead tests do not need to be duplicated, but the pediatrician or other primary care provider should attempt to verify that screening was performed elsewhere and determine the result before testing is deferred during the office visit. Pediatricians and other primary care health providers should conduct targeted screening of children for elevated blood lead concentrations if they are 12 to 24 months of age and live in communities or census block groups with ≥ 25% of housing built before 1960 or a prevalence of children's blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb) of ≥ 5%. Pediatricians and other primary care providers should test children for elevated blood lead concentrations if they live in or visit a home or child care facility with an identified lead hazard or a home built before 1960 that is in poor repair or was renovated in the past 6 months, and pediatricians and primary care providers should work with their federal, state, and local governments to ensure that a comprehensive environmental inspection is conducted in the housing units of children who have blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb) and that they receive appropriate case management.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^eedb8ac3]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric screening practice and burden — screening is common in regular pediatric care with age-based recommendations, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal newborn screening for metabolic conditions, hemoglobinopathy, and hearing loss, with selective screening for elevated lead; however, such programs are "not always evidence-based", and "a recommendation for universal screening requires a high burden of proof" because screening is performed on "asymptomatic individuals", downstream consequences may be "not obvious", and "widespread screening programs are costly".

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^4f9462cb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention — updated screening recommendations for Medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years emphasize targeted strategies and local flexibility. Because state and local officials are more familiar than federal agencies with local risk for EBLLs, CDC recommends that these officials have the flexibility to develop blood lead screening strategies that reflect local risk for EBLLs, and rather than provide universal screening to all Medicaid children, which was previously recommended, state and local officials should target screening toward specific groups of children in their area at higher risk for EBLLs. This report presents the updated CDC recommendations and provides strategies to 1) improve screening rates of children at risk for EBLLs, 2) develop surveillance strategies that are not solely dependent on blood lead surveillance results but use evaluation of screening programs, and it reviews available data especially among children aged 1–5 years who are eligible for Medicaid; the rationale highlights that children in low-income families are experiencing decreases in BLLs and the EBLL disparity between Medicaid-eligible and non–Medicaid-eligible children is diminishing.

### Screening for autism spectrum disorder in young children: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0e259d33]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening — children aged 18 to 30 months for whom no concerns of ASD have been raised by their parents or a clinician: No recommendation. Grade: I (insufficient evidence). Although multiple potential risk factors for ASD have been identified, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether certain risk factors modify screening test performance, including the age at screening or child/family characteristics. The most commonly studied tool is the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its subsequent revisions, and a positive finding should lead to a follow-up interview, which, if positive, should lead to a full diagnostic workup for ASD. Treatments for ASD include behavioral, medical, educational, speech/language, and occupational therapy and complementary and alternative medicine approaches, with treatments for young children primarily behavioral, particularly early intensive behavioral and developmental interventions. The USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for ASD in young children for whom no concerns have been raised; the USPSTF also has a recommendation on screening for speech and language delays and disorders in children 5 years or younger.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels of less than 10 microg / dL in children and reducing childhood exposure to lead: recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention [^8a28f1d0]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant. Lead exposure is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. In children, lead is associated with impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined the blood lead level that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recognized that a blood lead level of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at blood lead levels of < 10 microg/dL. In this report we provide information to help clinicians understand blood lead levels < 10 microg/dL, identify gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outline strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. We also summarize scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead-exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of blood lead levels, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead-prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As circumstances permit, clinicians should consider referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and more frequent rescreening of children with blood lead levels approaching 10 microg/dL. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

States without data-driven recommendations — non–Medicaid-eligible children: States that do not have lead screening recommendations in place or that have no CDC funding for such plans should analyze community-level data on risk for lead exposure, including the age and condition of local housing, and periodically, or on an ongoing basis, these states should also conduct comprehensive reviews of potential local environmental lead sources to ensure that prevention policies reflect local risk; industrial and government data on lead releases or environmental lead measurements are available from various sources, such as the EPA's National Ambient Air Quality program, Toxic Release Inventory, and Superfund program.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^dff93660]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP recommendations on management of childhood lead exposure and poisoning — actions by blood lead level: For < 5 μg/dL (< 50 ppb), review results with families and note that among US children 1–5 y old the geometric mean is < 2 μg/dL (< 20 ppb) and 2.5% have ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); repeat the blood lead concentration in 6–12 mo if the child is at high risk, and for those initially screened before 12 mo of age, consider retesting in 3–6 mo. For 5–14 μg/dL (50–140 ppb), retest venous blood lead concentration within 1–3 mo and, if stable or decreasing, retest in 3 mo; take a careful environmental history, screen for iron sufficiency with complete blood cell count, ferritin, and C-reactive protein, provide nutritional counseling related to calcium and iron, and perform structured developmental screening evaluations at child health maintenance visits. For 15–44 μg/dL (150–440 ppb), confirm with repeat venous sample within 1–4 wk, consider abdominal radiography with gut decontamination if lead foreign bodies are visualized, and ensure any treatment in this range is provided in consultation with an expert. For > 44 μg/dL (> 440 ppb), confirm with repeat venous lead level within 48 h and consider hospitalization or chelation therapy managed with an experienced provider.

Children in homes built before 1978 For children living in or visiting homes or structures built before 1978, adults can reduce lead exposure from lead-based paint by: If the patient's BLL is < 3. 5 micrograms per deciliter
- Provide education about common sources of lead exposure and information on how to further prevent exposure.
- During well-child visits, check development to make sure age-appropriate milestones are being met.
- During well-child visits, discuss diet and nutrition with a focus on iron and calcium intake.
- Conduct follow-up blood lead testing at recommended intervals based on the child's age.
- Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires all children enrolled in Medicaid to get tested for lead at ages 12 and 24 months, or age 24. –72 months if they have never been screened.
- For children not enrolled in Medicaid, CDC recommends focusing screening efforts on high-risk neighborhoods and children.

Identify risk for lead poisoning based on the age of housing and social and demographic risk factors.
- Public health personnel and healthcare workers should use local data to develop screening plans that are responsive to local conditions. In the absence of such plans, CDC recommends universal blood lead testing.
- Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires all children enrolled in Medicaid to get tested for lead at ages 12 and 24 months, or age 24. Table 1 Recommended schedule for obtaining a confirmatory venous sample Blood Lead Level Time to Confirmation Testing ≥ 3. 5–9 Within 3 months 10–19 Within 1 month 20–44 Within 2 weeks ≥ 45 Within 48 hours The higher the BLL is on the initial screening capillary test, the more urgent it is to get a venous sample for confirmatory testing.

Greater exposure in the summer months may necessitate more frequent follow ups. Some case managers or healthcare providers may choose to repeat blood lead tests on all new patients within a month. Repeated testing may confirm that the child's BLL is decreasing.

Targeted screening strategy development — Medicaid-eligible subpopulations: Assessments in pediatric health-care settings can be used to identify subpopulations of Medicaid-enrolled children who are at risk for EBLLs, and states should examine whether specific targeted screening strategies should be incorporated for children in populations who have been identified as being at risk for EBLLs, such as recent immigrants, refugees, or foreign adoptees; until state-level recommendations are revised to include targeted strategies, states with existing recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children should decide whether to continue to require testing of all Medicaid-eligible children or to immediately subsume Medicaid-eligible children under the existing targeted strategy for the non–Medicaid-eligible population.

Implementing a change in policy will involve an update of the State Medicaid Manual by CMS, and in states where the risk for EBLs is determined to be no higher for Medicaid-eligible children than for other children, CMS will either update the State Medicaid Manual or provide a letter to Medicaid directors informing them that blood lead screening is no longer required for all Medicaid-eligible children.

Blood lead screening of Medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years — improve rates of blood lead screening for Medicaid-eligible children determined to be at increased risk for lead exposure: Alert health-care providers to known risks for lead exposure; link data from the blood lead surveillance system and Medicaid encounter system to monitor screening performance, track blood lead levels (BLLs), and identify gaps in screening; provide incentives or penalties for health-care providers according to rates of blood lead screening; collaborate with the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to encourage blood lead testing at WIC sites; consider alternative screening technologies as part of a strategy to increase testing of children at high risk for lead exposure.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^1b166236]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

CDC's CLPPP remains committed to eliminating lead hazards in the environment before children are exposed. Unfortunately, because lead hazards are ubiquitous in the environment, secondary prevention is necessary to identify and follow children who are exposed to lead. CDC recommends that public health and clinical professionals focus screening efforts on neighborhoods and children at high risk based on age of housing and sociodemographic risk factors. Public health and clinical professionals should collaborate to develop screening plans responsive to local conditions using local data. In the absence of such plans, universal BLL testing is recommended. In addition, jurisdictions should follow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requirement that all Medicaid-enrolled children be tested at ages 12 and 24 months or at age 24–72 months if they have not previously been screened.

Non-Hispanic Black children, those living in low-income households, and those who are immigrants or refugees are more likely to live in communities where lead is pervasive. These communities often have homes built before 1978, many of which contain lead-based paint. Although it is encouraging that progress has been made toward lowering population average BLLs, geographic, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities in lead exposure, especially among young children, persist. Efforts should be put in place focusing on eliminating lead exposure among the most vulnerable in the population, young children aged 1–5 years, and should become an environmental public health priority.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^dd07b58a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood lead level (EBLL) surveillance in Medicaid-eligible children — states that discontinue universal lead screening after updating the State Medicaid Manual "should conduct active surveillance of known groups and geographic areas at high risk for EBLLs to monitor trends and confirm that risk remains low". "Children who are recent immigrants, refugees, or foreign adoptees also should be monitored for EBLLs", and one CDC-supported community study found "approximately 30% of children aged 1–5 years had EBLLs". Identification "should be based primarily on data" indicating whether presumed low-risk children remain low risk; sources "might include census data, nutritional evaluations (e.g. WIC records), housing surveys, adult and occupational lead registry data, and identification of new products or practices resulting in lead exposure within the community". Newly identified or increased EBLL risk "might prompt updated screening recommendations", and an EBLL surveillance system "should include routine collection of data on well-defined populations and environmental indicators", including "the number of prescriptions filled for lead-chelating agents" and "environmental indicators (e.g., lead dust in housing that receives federal subsidies)". Such a system "should help states identify previously unrecognized lead exposures" and partners are "well positioned to identify a core set of measures for an EBLL surveillance system".

Provide scientific risk information to health-care providers — In 2000, CDC recommended sharing scientific information on Medicaid blood lead screening policies with providers, and evidence suggests physician perceptions influence screening practices. Studies of physician screening behaviors support these observations. Effective risk communication includes locally customized lead hazard maps created with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that plot EBLs and housing age; GIS can generate maps showing where high-risk children live by displaying BLLs alongside housing age and location, clarify neighborhood risk changes over time, and evaluate screening strategy impact. CDC has developed guidance for the use of GIS in lead poisoning prevention.

### Elevated blood lead levels and blood lead screening among US children aged one to five years: 1988–1994 [^e7bd2676]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the proportion of children 1 to 5 years of age who received blood lead testing during 1988–1994 and to assess whether predictors of testing coincided with predictors of elevated blood lead levels.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants. US children 1 to 5 years of age. Outcome Measures. Prevalence of blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels among children 1 to 5 years of age and odds ratios for factors predicting blood lead testing and elevated blood lead levels.

Results

Overall, 6.3% had elevated blood lead levels and 10.2% had undergone previous blood lead tests. Being of minority race/ethnicity, living in an older home, residing in the Northeast or Midwest regions of the United States, being on Medicaid, having a head of household with < 12 years of education, and having a history of anemia were significant factors in both models. Additional independent risk factors for an elevated blood lead level included being sampled in phase 1 of the survey, being 1 to 2 years of age, not having a regular doctor, and being sampled during the summer months. Additional independent correlates of a previous blood lead test included having moved less than twice in one's lifetime, having a female head of household, and having parents whose home language was English. Of an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age who had elevated blood lead levels and no previous screening test in 1993, 62% were receiving Medicaid, 40% lived in homes built before 1946, and 34% were black, non-Hispanic.

Conclusions

Lead screening was more frequent among children with risk factors for lead exposure. However, among children with elevated blood lead levels, only one third had been tested previously. In 1993 an estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age had elevated blood lead levels but were never screened. Physicians should screen Medicaid-eligible children and should follow state or local health department recommendations about identifying and screening other at-risk children. In areas where no health department guidelines exist, physicians should screen all children or screen based on known risk factors.

### Testing for lead poisoning in children… [^19fa3060]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Who should be screened All children who are at risk for lead exposure should be tested for lead poisoning. Some children are more likely to be exposed to lead than others. These include children who:

- Live or spend time in a house or building built before 1978.
- Are from low-income households.
- Are immigrants, refugees, or recently adopted from less developed countries.
- Live or spend time with someone who works with lead
- Live or spend time with someone has hobbies that expose them to lead. Parents should talk to their child's healthcare provider about whether their child needs to be tested for lead. The child's healthcare provider may ask questions to see if the child is at risk for lead poisoning. The best way to know if a child has been exposed to lead is to have their blood tested. Children enrolled in Medicaid are required to get tested for lead at ages 12 and 24 months.

They are also required to get tested if they are ages 24–72 months and have no record of ever being tested. For children not enrolled in Medicaid, CDC recommends focusing testing efforts on high-risk neighborhoods and children. Recommended schedule for obtaining a confirmatory venous sample Capillary blood lead level Time to confirmation testing ≥ 3. 5–9 μg/dL 10–19 μg/dL 20–44 μg/dL ≥ 45 μg/dL Healthcare providers and most local health departments can test for lead in the blood. Many private insurance policies cover the cost of testing for lead in the blood. The cost of blood lead testing for children enrolled in Medicaid is covered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. CDC uses a blood lead reference value of 3. 5 μg/dL. This value helps identify children with blood lead levels that are higher than most children's levels in the United States. This level is based on the on the 97. 5th percentile of the blood lead values among U. S.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^35fe018f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Conclusion — "BLLs decreased in the United States population overall and in every subpopulation during 1976–2004". "BLLs decreased among certain Medicaid-enrolled children, but the geographic disparities increased". These findings indicate that "a national blood lead screening policy that requires universal screening of all young Medicaid-eligible children is not justified", and that "State and local public health authorities are better positioned, with assistance from CDC, to assess local risk variations, develop appropriate screening policies to identify EBLLs among Medicaid-eligible children, and develop and evaluate lead screening strategies".

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^9f24022b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Lead is a potent, pervasive neurotoxicant, and elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) can result in decreased IQ, academic failure, and behavioral problems in children. Eliminating EBLLs among children is one of the 2010 U.S. national health objectives. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate substantial decreases both in the percentage of persons in the United States with EBLLs and in mean BLLs among all age and ethnic groups, including children aged 1–5 years. Historically, children in low-income families served by public assistance programs have been considered to be at greater risk for EBLLs than other children. However, evidence indicates that children in low-income families are experiencing decreases in BLLs, suggesting that the EBLL disparity between Medicaid-eligible children and non — Medicaid-eligible children is diminishing. In response to these findings, the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention is updating recommendations for blood lead screening among children eligible for Medicaid by providing recommendations for improving BLL screening and information for health-care providers, state officials, and others interested in lead-related services for Medicaid-eligible children. Because state and local officials are more familiar than federal agencies with local risk for EBLLs, CDC recommends that these officials have the flexibility to develop blood lead screening strategies that reflect local risk for EBLLs. Rather than provide universal screening to all Medicaid children, which was previously recommended, state and local officials should target screening toward specific groups of children in their area at higher risk for EBLLs. This report presents the updated CDC recommendations and provides strategies to 1) improve screening rates of children at risk for EBLLs, 2) develop surveillance strategies that are not solely dependent on BLL testing, and 3) assist states with evaluation of screening plans.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2882c503]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Update Blood Lead Screening Policies for Medicaid-Eligible Children — since the 1997 CDC recommendation for targeted blood lead screening, certain jurisdictions have collected reliable blood lead level (BLL) data that do not show higher rates of EBLs among children enrolled in Medicaid compared with children not enrolled in Medicaid, challenging the assumption that all Medicaid-eligible children are at increased risk for EBLs. These findings suggest blood lead screening of children in Medicaid populations should be targeted toward subgroups at higher risk rather than all Medicaid-eligible children, with the decision regarding whether to screen all Medicaid-eligible children made at the state and local levels rather than the national level; in 1997, CDC endorsed continued universal screening of Medicaid children unless reliable data demonstrated "the absence of lead exposure in this population".

### Should children with constipation undergo blood lead level screening? [^dffcd3ad]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of elevated blood lead level in children with constipation to the population prevalence. We reviewed the charts of 441 children who were screened with a blood lead level on presenting to the gastroenterology clinic at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for evaluation of constipation. The prevalence of blood lead level greater than 5 µg/dL was 1.36% (6/441; 95% confidence interval = 1.23% to 1.49%), which is significantly lower than the 4.01% prevalence in the population reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. No patients had a blood lead level greater than 10 µg/dL. Age under 5 years old showed an increased odds of lead level greater than 5 µg/dL (odds ratio = 7.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 47.3, P < .05). We concluded that children seen in the gastroenterology clinic for constipation are unlikely to have an elevated blood lead level on routine screening.

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ff04df55]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead levels in children are associated with neurologic effects such as behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ, hyperactivity, hearing problems, and impaired growth. In pregnant women, lead exposure can impair organ systems such as the hematopoietic, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems, and increase the risk of preeclampsia and adverse perinatal outcomes. Many of the adverse health effects of lead exposure are irreversible.

Objective

To update the 2006 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of elevated blood lead levels. In this update, an elevated blood lead level was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 μg/dL.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels are inaccurate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that capillary blood testing accurately identifies children with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women.

### Who tests for lead and why? A 10-year analysis of blood lead screening, follow-up and CNS outcomes in a statewide US healthcare system [^ff247b41]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to determine (1) which providers in US healthcare systems order lead tests, why and at what frequency and (2) whether current patient population lead levels are predictive of clinical outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective medical record study of all blood lead tests in the Medical University of South Carolina healthcare system 2012–2016 and consequent evidence of central nervous system (CNS)-related disease across a potential 10-year window (2012–2022).

Results

Across 4 years, 9726 lead tests resulted for 7181 patients (49.0% female; 0–94 years), representing 0.2% of the hospital population. Most tests were for young (76.6% ≤ age 3) and non-Hispanic black (47.2%) and Hispanic (26.7%) patients. A wide variety of providers ordered tests; however, most were ordered by paediatrics, psychiatry, internal medicine and neurology. Lead levels ranged from ≤ 2.0µg/dL (80.8%) to ≥ 10µg/dL (0.8%; max 36µg/dL). 201 children (3.1%) had initial lead levels over the reference value for case management at the time (5.0µg/dL). Many high level children did not receive follow-up testing in the system (36.3%) and those that did often failed to see levels fall below 5.0µg/dL (80.1%). Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients were more likely to see lead levels stay high or go up over time. Over follow-up, children with high lead levels were more likely to receive new attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder diagnoses and new psychiatric medications. No significant associations were found between lead test results and new CNS diagnoses or medications among adults.

Conclusions

Hospital lead testing covers a small portion of patients but includes a wide range of ages, presentations and provider specialities. Lack of lead decline among many paediatric patients suggests there is room to improve provider guidance around when to test and follow-up.

### Notes from the field: COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in blood lead screening-Chicago, Illinois, 2017–2022 [^4f1dc057]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Investigation and Outcomes

All children residing in Chicago should be screened for their BLL at age 12, 24, and 36 months. Illinois requires that all BLL results be reported to the state surveillance system; data are shared with CDPH. * The current analysis included all BLL test results from Chicago residents aged 11–48 months, to include recommended screening ages and a makeup period given potential delayed screening at the onset of the pandemic. March–September was selected as the comparison period to account for observed seasonality of lead testing, † effects of the stay-at-home mandate, and the largest disruptions to health care during the first year of the pandemic. The total number of lead tests performed during March–September was divided by the American Community Survey 5-year population estimate of children aged < 5 years. § The average during 2017–2019 was assigned as the prepandemic baseline. The effect was evaluated geographically by assigning community areas (77 static administrative units were defined by the city for long-term statistical and tracking purposes) as low, medium, or high risk for BLLs exceeding the Blood Lead Reference Value on the basis of historic lead levels (average rank during 2010–2018). Within each of the three risk categories, the total decrease was calculated as well as the median decrease of the community areas making up each risk category (from 2019 to 2022). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. ††

The ratio of BLL tests performed among Chicago children aged 11–48 months per 100 children aged < 5 years in 2020 (14.7) was 29.1% lower than the annual average during 2017–2019 (20.7) (Figure). The ratio increased during 2021 (17.5) and 2022 (18.5) but remained 15.4% and 10.6% lower than during the 2017–2019 baseline, respectively. The prepandemic testing ratio was highest among the 25 community areas with the highest risk for BLLs exceeding the Blood Lead Reference Value; the decrease in testing was also greater in these highest risk areas (total decrease = 18%; median decrease = 17.7%) than in the 25 at medium risk (total = 10.1%; median = 7.6%) and the 24 at low risk (total = 8.8%; median = 7.7%).

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^0a009bdc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

States with data-driven lead screening recommendations for non–Medicaid-eligible children — background and next steps for Medicaid populations: Since the 1997 CDC recommendations were made, all 42 CDC-funded childhood lead poisoning prevention programs in 37 states have developed data-driven targeted screening recommendations, with agencies assessing local lead exposure risks, reviewing surveillance and census data, identifying relevant factors of local importance, and developing infrastructures for involving relevant persons; in addition, state blood lead surveillance systems have improved through more complete collection and analysis of blood lead data, and many states have established community-wide lead exposure assessment and analysis programs; after the State Medicaid Manual is updated to allow targeted, rather than universal, blood lead testing of children enrolled in Medicaid, state-level lead poisoning prevention programs, in partnership with state Medicaid agencies and members of state lead advisory committees, should analyze available data on lead screening and exposure patterns in the Medicaid-eligible population and modify their lead screening recommendations on the basis of local factors; for example, one such analysis involved a study of physician screening practices in Michigan to determine risk factors associated with rates of blood lead testing and the proportion of children with EBLLs among Medicaid-enrolled children.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^c0fbc504]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Policy Update

The BLRV is a population-based measurement which indicates that 2.5% of U.S. children aged 1–5 years have BLLs ≥ 3.5 μ g/dL. It is not a health-based standard or a toxicity threshold. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Whether a BLL measurement at or above the BLRV triggers medical or environmental follow-up will depend on existing jurisdictional laws, regulations, and resource availability. Follow-up lead testing to confirm BLLs is recommended. CDC strongly advises that providers follow CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^2366adc6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

State surveillance data and local relevance — As disparities among subpopulations have decreased, accurately assessing risk nationally has become more difficult because NHANES is not constructed to measure prevalence in small populations, and thus state and local data have gradually become more important for developing lead exposure prevention policies. State-reported surveillance corroborates NHANES: results from tests of children aged < 72 months screened at least once during January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2004, show decreasing numbers of confirmed EBLL cases and decreasing percentages of confirmed EBLLs among children tested; however, because of small proportions and variability of the estimates, the statistical significance of the difference between these percentages could not be determined.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19-34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^bc2440af]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

CDC identifies no safe BLL in children and considers a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 5.0 μ g/dL* sufficient to prompt clinical and public health intervention. Among children aged < 6 years, very high BLL (> 70 μ g/dL) can cause neurologic problems (e.g. seizures or coma), organ failure, and death. Lower, but still elevated, BLL can affect the nervous system, causing permanent neurologic damage, behavioral disorders, and cognitive impairment. In the United States, the most common childhood lead exposures are from lead-based paint that was used in pre-1978 housing, † lead-contaminated soil or lead-containing pollutants from industrial sources, and water from old lead pipes and fixtures. Very young children might ingest lead dust or paint because of their tendency to put fingers or objects (toys or paint chips) in their mouths, and they more readily absorb lead because their bodies are rapidly developing. Primary prevention focuses on reducing lead exposures in homes, schools, and communities. Secondary prevention consists of BLL screening as part of routine well-child examinations. Early identification of children with lead exposure can help identify and eliminate lead sources (and future exposures for other children); reduce their BLL over time; and link children with high BLLs to medical, nutritional, and educational services. Medicaid-enrolled children are required to be screened at ages 12 and 24 months; many states have additional screening requirements.

In 1995, elevated BLLs became a nationally reportable condition. CDC funds 53 state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs to conduct ongoing surveillance of BLL testing among children. § During May and June 2020, CDC received anecdotal reports of declines in BLL testing. To understand BLL testing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic, including after a national emergency was declared in March 2020, CDC requested that state and local health departments report the total number of children aged < 6 years with BLL tests by month during January–May 2019 and January–May 2020. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. Health departments could also submit qualitative information. Based on the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and subsequent trends, an estimated 2.0% of children who did not have a BLL test were conservatively assumed to have levels exceeding the BLRV.

### Screening and preventive interventions for oral health in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^67777ccd]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral health is fundamental to health and well-being across the lifespan. Oral health conditions affect the daily lives of school-age children and adolescents, leading to loss of more than 51 million school hours every year. Untreated oral health conditions in children can lead to serious infections and affect growth, development, and quality of life.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening and preventive interventions for oral health conditions in children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.

Population

Asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for oral health conditions (eg, dental caries) performed by primary care clinicians in asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of preventive interventions for oral health conditions (eg, dental caries) performed by primary care clinicians in asymptomatic children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years.

Recommendations

### Amblyopia screening effectiveness at 3–4 years old: a cohort study [^c179782c]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Hypothetically theorising that treating all our new diagnosis before age 3–4 would lead to all those children with BCVA ≥ 0.7 (what might be an excessive speculation), screening before age 3–4 would have a maximal difference in ARR of 0.3%, with the possible burden of as much as 70% children wearing unnecessary glasses before age 3–4.

Finally, although not being a screening programme, but rather a complete eye examination, the present study gives valuable information for future screening programmes and policies. If a high-sensitivity screening method is provided (which should be looked at in future studies to avoid this complete examination), screening at ages 3–4 is highly effective. Using lower sensitivity screenings may not lead to the same outcomes.

In conclusion, diagnosing and treating amblyopia at ages 3–4 (in a whole-population setting, without a previous screening programme) is highly effective. This study reinforces the current evidence that amblyopia screening in a whole-population setting before age 3 may not be necessary. Basic ophthalmological evaluations by primary care (red reflex since birth, plus cover test and corneal reflexes), as well as recognising high-risk children need to continue and be encouraged since they result in earlier high-risk children referrals

Evaluate CDC and CMS blood lead screening policies — CDC and CMS "will evaluate regularly the effectiveness of federal lead screening and treatment policies" and "will develop an evaluation framework" including: "Number and proportion of children targeted for screening who received screening for lead", "Number and proportion of tested children who are identified as having EBLLs", "Number and proportion of children with EBLLs who received complete environmental investigations, for whom lead hazards were identified, and for whom lead hazards were remediated", "Information about follow-up services provided, including the number of children with EBLLs who received case management services", and "Data system measures and goals". Data sources will include "CDC-funded and non–CDC-funded state surveillance systems and program documentation, state Medicaid agencies (e.g., data from the CMS EPSDT report [form 416] on the number of lead screening tests reported for Medicaid enrollees), GIS analysis of environmental and health data, focused survey results, private-sector data collection instruments (e.g. Medicaid HEDIS), and other federal agencies (the Consumer Product Safety Commission, FDA, EPA, or HUD)".

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^8d6a6fe5]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Risk groups for lead poisoning and background note that no safe blood lead threshold in children has been established and that exposure to lead causes harm to children even at levels once thought "safe", resulting in IQ reduction, learning impairment, and behavioral problems. Children under six years of age are highly susceptible to lead poisoning, and a study of trends in blood lead levels among US children from 1988–2004 using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data revealed additional risk groups, namely non-Hispanic blacks, low-income individuals, Medicaid recipients, and residents of pre-1950 housing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies high-risk groups of children who should be screened for elevated blood lead.

### Detection of lead poisoning-AAP… [^6841f8a3]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

How is Lead Poisoning Detected. Lead poisoning usually is detected by measuring the level in blood. Many screening procedures use capillary blood as point-of-care testing. While finger-prick samples are appropriate for screening tests, all elevated capillary levels should have confirmation with a venous blood draw since capillary tests can yield frequent false positives. An elevated capillary lead level indicates that lead is in the child's environment even if the venous level is low, however, so primary prevention and education should be initiated. The current Bright Futures/AAP Periodicity Schedule recommends a risk assessment at the following well-child visits: 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and at 3, 4, 5 and 6 years of age. The recommendation is to do a risk assessment. Most initial blood lead level tests are now performed as a result of a positive risk assessment or parental concern rather than because children have symptoms that suggest lead poisoning.

However, children of all ages who are recent immigrants, refugees, or adoptees are more likely to have elevated blood lead levels and should be screened at the earliest opportunity. Additionally, children who live in lower socioeconomic areas may be at higher risk. Medicaid-eligible patients also tend to be at higher risk for lead exposure because many live in these lower socioeconomic areas. Many state Medicaid/Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment programs require a universal blood lead level test at the 12-month and 24-month visits, no matter the prevalence of elevated levels based on factors such as where the patient lives. When is Diagnostic Testing Warranted. Some experienced clinicians measure the blood lead level in children with growth retardation, speech or language dysfunction, anemia, and attentional or behavioral disorders, especially if the parents have a specific concern about lead or about health effects from environmental chemicals.

However, elevated blood lead levels that continue into school age are unusual, even if peak blood lead level at 2 years of age was high and the child's home exposures have not been addressed. Therefore, a relatively low blood lead level in a school-aged child does not rule out earlier lead poisoning. If the question of current lead poisoning arises, however, the only reliable way to make a diagnosis is with blood lead measurement. Hair or urine lead levels give no useful information and should not be performed. Additional Resources.

### Vision screening in children aged 6 months to 5 years: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^b86f64fc]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of early detection and treatment in preschool-aged children: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children aged 3 to 5 years leads to improved visual acuity, determined that the magnitude of improvement in visual acuity is of moderate benefit, and found inadequate evidence that treatment reduced the incidence of long-term amblyopia or improved school performance, functioning, or quality of life; limited evidence suggests that screening can potentially reduce psychosocial harms; and the USPSTF found inadequate evidence that treatment of amblyopia or its risk factors in children younger than 3 years leads to improved vision outcomes (ie, visual acuity) or other benefits.

### Screening for anemia in children: AAP recommendations – a critique [^c10d8033]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening for anemia between the ages of 9 to 12 months with additional screening between the ages of 1 and 5 years for patients at risk. The screening may be universal or selective depending on the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the population. Improved infant rearing practices-including wider availability, acceptance, and use of iron-fortified formulas; iron fortification of foods; and increased awareness of the importance of dietary iron supplementation especially early in life-have lead to significant decline in the incidence of anemia in the first year of life. However, incidence of iron deficiency and ensuing anemia in children between 1 and 2 years continues to be significant and an important issue. Although iron deficiency may develop soon after cessation of or inadequate iron intake, anemia secondary to iron deficiency develops gradually over a period of several weeks to months. For children who have received/are receiving iron-fortified infant formulas and foods, hemoglobin screening at 9 to 12 months of age is inappropriate as there may not have been sufficient time to develop anemia, despite the rapid growth rate at this age. Widespread implementation of hemoglobin electrophoresis included in the neonatal metabolic screening programs in many states in the United States now has resulted in earlier diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies. Screening children at 9 to 12 months of age for hemoglobinopathies is somewhat redundant now. Screening for anemia before or around 1 year of age should continue to be important for communities and children at risk. Universal screening of toddlers at a later time allows sufficient time for nutritional anemia to become evident after the child has been weaned off iron-fortified formulas, for the influence of toddler dietary fads to manifest, and for evaluation of tolerance of cow's milk protein. This may be addressed via 2 approaches. The first involves postponing the currently recommended screening or an additional screening for anemia between 15 to 18 months of age. Determination of hemoglobin (or hematocrit) is not the optimal way to identify children at risk from effects of iron deficiency as it fails to identify patients who are iron-deficient but are not anemic. Long-term psychomotor, behavioral, and developmental effects secondary to iron deficiency anemia are known but sufficient data are lacking regarding the role of iron deficiency without anemia. Development and evaluation of sensitive, specific, and cost-effective screening tools to identify children at risk for iron deficiency is important. Until such methods are instituted, the AAP should emphasize and recommend universal screening for anemia during the second year of life.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^115b699c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The greatest reductions in the proportion of children with elevated BLLs have been made over the past four decades in those racial/ethnic and income groups that had the highest BLLs. Persistent differences between the mean BLLs of different racial/ethnic and income groups can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors. Resources should be targeted to areas and communities where children are most at risk to achieve the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing mean BLLs for all children in the United States (EH 8.2).

The greatest reductions have occurred among children in racial/ethnic and income groups that historically were most likely to have BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL. These reductions reflect the impact of strategies coordinated and implemented at national, state, and local levels. They include elimination of lead in vehicle emissions, elimination of lead paint hazards in housing, reduction in lead concentrations in air, water, and consumer products marketed to children, and identification and increased screening of populations at high risk. However, the small numbers of NHANES participants with BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL means that national estimates of the prevalence of BLLs this high are unstable, and year-to-year changes in prevalence are difficult to interpret. In the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles, nine and six survey participants, respectively, aged 1–5 years had BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL.

Childhood exposure to lead can have lifelong consequences. The significant differences between the GM BLLs by race/ethnicity and income indicate a persistent disparity. In January 2012, ACCLPP observed that these disparities can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors designed to control or eliminate lead exposure.

CDC concurred with ACCLPP that primary prevention (i.e. ensuring that all homes are lead-safe and do not contribute to childhood lead exposure) is the only practical approach to preventing elevated BLLs in children. Prevention requires reducing environmental exposures from soil, dust, paint, and water, before children are exposed to these hazards. Efforts to increase awareness of lead hazards and nutritional interventions to increase iron and calcium, which can reduce lead absorption, are other key components of a successful prevention policy. Given the continued disparity in BLLs, resources should be targeted to those areas where children are most at risk. NHANES provides useful data for measuring progress towards eliminating high BLLs and ensuring that resources are targeted toward the most vulnerable children.

### Notes from the field: COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in blood lead screening-Chicago, Illinois, 2017–2022 [^ca82ba0e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Lead is an environmental hazard that can cause serious harm to young children. Early childhood lead exposure can damage the brain and nervous system, slow growth and development, and cause hearing and speech problems. Screening for elevated blood lead levels (BLL) is essential for routine care of young children. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial disruptions to health care access occurred for routine, preventive care. At the onset of the pandemic (January–May 2020), 34% fewer U.S. children aged < 6 years received blood lead level testing than during the same months in 2019. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) characterized patterns of blood lead testing among young children in Chicago from the onset of the pandemic in 2019 through 2022.

### Identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders in the medical home: an algorithm for developmental surveillance and screening [^5dd42560]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Early identification of developmental disorders is critical to the well-being of children and their families. It is an integral function of the primary care medical home and an appropriate responsibility of all pediatric health care professionals. This statement provides an algorithm as a strategy to support health care professionals in developing a pattern and practice for addressing developmental concerns in children from birth through 3 years of age. The authors recommend that developmental surveillance be incorporated at every well-child preventive care visit. Any concerns raised during surveillance should be promptly addressed with standardized developmental screening tests. In addition, screening tests should be administered regularly at the 9-, 18-, and 30-month visits. (Because the 30-month visit is not yet a part of the preventive care system and is often not reimbursable by third-party payers at this time, developmental screening can be performed at 24 months of age. In addition, because the frequency of regular pediatric visits decreases after 24 months of age, a pediatrician who expects that his or her patients will have difficulty attending a 30-month visit should conduct screening during the 24-month visit.) The early identification of developmental problems should lead to further developmental and medical evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment, including early developmental intervention. Children diagnosed with developmental disorders should be identified as children with special health care needs, and chronic-condition management should be initiated. Identification of a developmental disorder and its underlying etiology may also drive a range of treatment planning, from medical treatment of the child to family planning for his or her parents.

### Notes from the field: COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in blood lead screening-Chicago, Illinois, 2017–2022 [^788e28ec]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Preliminary Conclusions and Analysis

BLL testing in young children decreased at the pandemic onset in 2020. Testing increased in 2021 and again in 2022 but did not return to prepandemic baseline in Chicago. Community areas with the highest average rank of BLLs exceeding the Blood Lead Reference Value during 2010–2018 were most affected by pandemic-related decreases in testing. Pandemic-related changes in blood lead testing might have exacerbated longstanding health inequities. The most affected community areas should receive increased attention to promote BLL testing among children at the highest risk for lead exposure. It is important for jurisdictions to evaluate pandemic-related changes in blood lead testing for young children and consider including geographic or demographic unit analyses to assess impact on the most vulnerable communities.

### Screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children aged 5 years or younger: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9601ec3e]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This report is an update of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2006 recommendation on screening for speech and language delay in preschool-aged children.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children aged 5 years or younger, including the accuracy of screening in primary care settings, the role of surveillance by primary care clinicians, whether screening and interventions lead to improved outcomes, and the potential harms associated with screening and interventions.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic children aged 5 years or younger whose parents or clinicians do not have specific concerns about their speech, language, hearing, or development.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for speech and language delay and disorders in children aged 5 years or younger (I statement).

Prenatal lead exposure has known adverse effects on maternal health and infant outcomes across a wide range of maternal blood lead levels. Adverse effects of lead exposure are being identified at lower levels of exposure than previously recognized in both children and adults.

### Screening for visual impairment in children ages 1–5 years: update for the USPSTF [^2f4b2796]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Screening could identify preschool-aged children with vision problems at a critical period of visual development and lead to treatments that could improve vision.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of screening preschool-aged children for impaired visual acuity on health outcomes.

Methods

We searched Medline from 1950 to July 2009 and the Cochrane Library through the third quarter of 2009, reviewed reference lists, and consulted experts. We selected randomized trials and controlled observational studies on preschool vision screening and treatments, and studies of diagnostic accuracy of screening tests. One investigator abstracted relevant data, and a second investigator checked data abstraction and quality assessments.

Results

Direct evidence on the effectiveness of preschool vision screening for improving visual acuity or other clinical outcomes remains limited and does not adequately address whether screening is more effective than no screening. Regarding indirect evidence, a number of screening tests have utility for identification of preschool-aged children with vision problems. Diagnostic accuracy did not clearly differ for children stratified according to age, although testability rates were generally lower in children 1 to 3 years of age. Treatments for amblyopia or unilateral refractive error were associated with mild improvements in visual acuity compared with no treatment. No study has evaluated school performance or other functional outcomes.

Conclusions

Although treatments for amblyopia or unilateral refractive error can improve vision in preschool-aged children and screening tests have utility for identifying vision problems, additional studies are needed to better understand the effects of screening compared with no screening.

### Lead | Immigrant and refugee health… [^17fe0219]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1: Screening recommendations for all newly arrived refugee infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women and girls Recommended Screening Measures Population Initial lead exposure screening with blood test
- All refugee infants and children ≤ 16 years of age
- Refugee adolescents > 16 years of age if there is a high index of suspicion, or clinical signs/symptoms of lead exposure
- All pregnant and lactating women and girls. Follow-up testing with blood test, 3–6 months after initial testing
- All refugee infants and children ≤ 6 years of age, regardless of initial screening result
- Refugee children and adolescents 7–16 years of age who had BLLs at or above 3. 5 μg/dL, and for any child older than 7 years of age who has a risk factor regardless of initial test result.

Recommendations for Post-arrival Lead Screening All refugee infants and children 0–16 years of age should be evaluated for lead exposure with a blood lead test. Older refugee adolescents should be tested if there is a high suspicion or clinical signs/symptoms of lead exposure, or if currently pregnant or lactating. A history of lead exposure includes questions about signs and symptoms, behaviors, and potential exposures such as use of cosmetics, ceramics, spices, food, tobacco, or remedies. Pediatric Recommendations Given the neurodevelopmental and health complications associated with exposure to lead, all refugee infants and children ≤ 16 years of age should be evaluated for lead exposure at the domestic medical screening visit with a blood test. Adolescent refugees > 16 years of age should be tested if there is a high index of suspicion, if there are clinical signs or symptoms of lead exposure, or if pregnant or lactating. *. Repeat testing is also recommended for refugee children and adolescents 7–16 years of age who had blood lead levels at or above CDC's BLRV at initial screening. Repeat testing is also warranted in adolescents > 16 years of age with specific risk factors.

### EMR-based intervention improves lead screening at an urban family medicine practice [^a5e34a93]. Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Elevated blood lead levels have well-described detrimental effects to growth and development in children, yet screening rates remain low. We sought to determine if a reminder within the electronic health record (EHR) could change provider behavior and improve blood lead level (BLL) screening test ordering rates in an urban academic family medicine practice.

Methods

Baseline BLL test ordering rates were calculated for children ages 9–72 months. An update adding reminders to screen was made to the electronic note template used during pediatric well and sick visits at the practice. Data from the 10-week periods both before and after the change was made were compared through a retrospective chart review.

Results

A total of 210 children were seen during the pre-intervention period. Forty-eight percent (n = 101) had already been screened. Of the 109 eligible for screening, 23 had tests ordered, and 18 of those had tests completed. Eighty-four children were eligible for screening in the post-intervention period. Forty-one of those children had tests ordered, and 15 had tests completed. Provider ordering rates increased from 21% of eligible patients to 49%. Test completion rates only increased from 17% to 18%.

Conclusions

An electronic note-based reminder system significantly improves provider ordering rates of BLL tests. Researchers are currently investigating how the use of point-of-care BLL sample collection can improve test completion rates and therefore increase the frequency of successful screening.

### Follow-up testing among children with elevated screening blood lead levels [^f08c8043]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Follow-up testing after an abnormal screening blood lead level is a key component of lead poisoning prevention.

Objectives

To measure the proportion of children with elevated screening lead levels who have follow-up testing and to determine factors associated with such care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective, observational cohort study of 3682 Michigan Medicaid-enrolled children aged 6 years or younger who had a screening blood lead level of at least 10 microg/dL (0.48 micromol/L) between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003.

Main Outcome Measure

Testing within 180 days of an elevated screening lead level.

Results

Follow-up testing was received by 53.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 52.2%-55.5%) of the children. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, screening blood lead level results, and local health department catchment area, the relative risk of follow-up testing was lower for Hispanic or nonwhite children than for white children (0.91; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94), for children living in urban compared with rural areas (0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.96), and for children living in high- compared with low-risk lead areas (0.94; 95% CI, 0.92–0.96). Among children who did not have follow-up testing, 58.6% (95% CI, 56.3%-61.0%) had at least 1 medical encounter in the 6-month period after the elevated screening blood lead level, including encounters for evaluation and management (39.3%; 95% CI, 36.9%-41.6%) or preventive care (13.2%; 95% CI, 11.6%-14.8%).

Conclusions

The rate of follow-up testing after an abnormal screening blood lead level was low, and children with increased likelihood of lead poisoning were less likely to receive follow-up testing. At least half of the children had a missed opportunity for follow-up testing. The observed disparities of care may increase the burden of cognitive impairment among at-risk children.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19-34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^f55451a0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Exposure to lead, a toxic metal, can result in severe effects in children, including decreased ability to learn, permanent neurologic damage, organ failure, and death. CDC and other health care organizations recommend routine blood lead level (BLL) testing among children as part of well-child examinations to facilitate prompt identification of elevated BLL, eliminate source exposure, and provide medical and other services (1). To describe BLL testing trends among young children during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC analyzed data reported from 34 state and local health departments about BLL testing among children aged < 6 years conducted during January-May 2019 and January-May 2020. Compared with testing in 2019, testing during January-May 2020 decreased by 34%, with 480,172 fewer children tested. An estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased BLL testing. Despite geographic variability, all health departments reported fewer children tested for BLL after the national COVID-19 emergency declaration (March-May 2020). In addition, health departments reported difficulty conducting medical follow-up and environmental investigations for children with elevated BLLs because of staffing shortages and constraints on home visits associated with the pandemic. Providers and public health agencies need to take action to ensure that children who missed their scheduled blood lead screening test, or who required follow-up on an earlier high BLL, be tested as soon as possible and receive appropriate care.

### Screening for autistic spectrum disorder in early childhood [^56927a9e]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Age of screening

In their review, McPheeters et al. looked at whether age at which ASD screening is performed modifies the performance characteristics of ASD screening tests. Their findings are the following:

'One study, including a subsample of high- and low-risk children also reported in other M-CHAT studies, attempted to examine screening characteristics of the M-CHAT at different ages but all within the very young age group of younger than 30 months. The researchers examined outcomes for low-risk children between 17 and 23 months of age (n = 4265; mean age, 18.57 months) and at 24 to 30 months of age (n = 1785; mean age, 24.74 months). PPV for children at older ages (61%) was better than the younger group (28%). Because this study had already excluded children who had previously been identified as being of concern for developmental delays, the performance characteristics are likely not reflective of what might be seen in the complete population. It also provides no data on screening children at preschool ages versus older ages. Data on false-negative results were unavailable'.

### Comprehensive health evaluation of the newly adopted child [^82990946]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Table 3 diagnostic testing — hematologic disorders, lead and metabolic screening, and retesting guidance includes screening for hemoglobinopathies and blood disorders in children of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Mediterranean ethnicities, including sickle cell disease screen, thalassemias, and G6PD deficiency. Blood lead concentration is recommended for children up to 6 y of age, with older ages if indicated, along with thyroid function ascertainment in all new international adoptees, a newborn screening panel for young infants, and rickets screening (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase) for selected children. It is recommended that children adopted internationally be retested for hepatitis B and HIV 6 mo after placement in the home; testing does not need to be repeated for children adopted from the US foster care system who recently had verifiable laboratory studies consistent with recommendations from the AAP. A footnote adds that for all children adopted internationally, it is recommended that they be tested for tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted infections.

### Are children still at risk for lead poisoning? [^c98abd20]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) has decreased nationally, creating challenges in identifying children at risk.

Methods

In a community known to have lead hazards, we screened children with a field-administered capillary blood lead test and asked parents to complete a questionnaire about lead risk factors.

Results

Of the 77 child-parent pairs screened with a blood lead test and a parental questionnaire, 4 had finger stick blood lead levels of ≥ 10 µg/dL. Of these, one child had a confirmatory venous blood lead level > 10 µg/dL (1.3%; 95% CI = 0.0%-4.7%), which is near the US prevalence but less than the historic prevalence for this region. A median of 2 risk factors for each of the environmental, behavioral, and knowledge/awareness domains were noted.

Conclusions

Despite a low prevalence of children with EBLL, parental report suggested that approximately 29% of children had lead-based paint in their home environment.

### Using health data to highlight milestones: a cookbook for non-profit program managers [^114e8155]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Blood lead testing in Georgia — most blood lead testing in Georgia is performed by private physicians during physical exams or well-child visits, and a smaller number of tests may be done at county or district health departments or WIC programs. According to a federal requirement, all children enrolled in Medicaid are to be screened at approximately 12 and 24 months of age. All high-risk children should be screened at 12 and 24 months of age. High-risk children in Georgia between ages 36 months and 72 months who have not had previous testing must receive a blood lead test. High-risk children are defined as Medicaid or PeachCare for Kids-eligible children and WIC-eligible children.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^022b8347]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Health-Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) — Medicaid blood lead testing measure and observed plan variation: In 2008, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) began collecting data for a new Health-Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measure of blood lead testing for children enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, and data from NCQA HEDIS surveys are used by consumers, health plan administrators, and purchasers of employee-based group health insurance to compare the quality and effectiveness of health-care services; HEDIS data are used as the basis for health plan report cards and rankings that are published in newspapers and magazines; therefore, HEDIS results can be a powerful incentive for health-care plans to provide quality care; the HEDIS performance measure for lead screening among Medicaid-eligible children will provide baseline data that states can use to determine geographic areas where increased blood lead testing is needed, as well as areas where BLLs are low enough that universal testing is no longer warranted; initial data from a 2005 review of six geographically diverse health plans indicated that blood lead testing rates in the plans ranged from 49% to 85% during the year.

Link and share data between Medicaid and state lead surveillance systems — Since 1998, CDC has encouraged states to link blood lead surveillance with Medicaid encounter databases by requiring CDC-funded programs to maintain ongoing identification of Medicaid-eligible children in the surveillance system. Successfully linking databases can improve screening for children at high risk for EBLs by identifying service gaps and can improve report accuracy. When linked records include Medicaid status, health plan enrollment, race/ethnicity, and address, more focused analyses can be conducted; the information can also be provided to providers and managed care organizations to improve service delivery. Although states have begun linking data and can track screening tests, almost none have reported using these systems to track and analyze EBL rates among Medicaid-enrolled children who are tested.

Preventive services — scope and components from birth to age 26: Preventive services primarily assess risk factors for, or prevent the development of, medical conditions or developmental disorders that affect health or development from birth to 26 years of age, and preventive services include but are not limited to the following. Health supervision with comprehensive preventive care is according to the current version of the AAP "Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care", and Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, with age-appropriate screenings including social determinants of health, maternal depression, attainment of developmental milestones, autism spectrum disorder, anemia, lead screening, dyslipidemia, psychosocial and behavioral conditions, adolescent depression, sexually transmitted infections, HIV infection, tobacco, alcohol, and substance use, and other screenings as may be recommended in the future by the AAP or included in revisions of Bright Futures. Immunizations are according to recommendations included in the most current version of the "Recommended Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule". Educational, counseling, and support services for all children include anticipatory guidance relating to normal growth and development, tobacco-cessation counseling and treatment services for children and/ or household contacts, and services related to the maintenance of a healthy weight — including prevention, management, and treatment of pediatric obesity and overweight, malnutrition, eating disorders, or nutritional deficiency, including nutrition counseling and follow-up with physician or registered dietitian and all necessary laboratory services, including evaluation of risk factors.

### Blood lead levels in young children – United States and selected states, 1996–1999 [^563d435a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2000). Low credibility.

Lead exposure adversely affects the cognitive development and behavior of young children (1). For children aged < 6 years, CDC has defined an elevated blood lead level (BLL) as ≥ 10 microg/dL, but evidence exists for subtle effects at lower levels (2). Data from CDC's Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Phase 2 (1991–1994) (NHANES) showed that average BLLs in children had decreased approximately 80% since the late 1970s but that elevated BLLs remained more common among low-income children, urban children, and those living in older housing (3,4). Although these data provide national estimates of the prevalence of elevated BLLs among children, they do not provide information at the state or local level. To target prevention efforts and monitor progress toward reducing BLLs at the state and local level, CDC's Childhood Blood Lead Surveillance (CBLS) program supports state blood lead surveillance programs on the basis of blood lead tests from public and private clinical laboratories. This report summarizes data on BLLs in children aged 1–5 years from NHANES data collected in 1999 and children aged < 6 years from state surveillance data provided to CDC by 19 state surveillance programs during 1996–1998. The findings indicate that, despite the decreases in mean BLL among children, the problem remains concentrated on a local level. Surveillance efforts should be used to target screening efforts to communities at highest risk.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^058cc2d2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Medicaid eligibility and risk for lead exposure — national and state data describe historical risk concentration and recent convergence. Using 1991–1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, 60% of children with blood lead levels (BLLs) ≥ 10 μg/dL and 83% with BLLs ≥ 20 μg/dL were Medicaid-eligible, and a CDC analysis estimated approximately 93% of children with BLLs ≥ 20 μg/dL were Medicaid eligible. In Minnesota, among children aged < 72 months, elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) decreased from 7.8% to 3.5% among Medicaid enrollees and from 4.1% to 1.9% among nonenrollees during 1999–2003. A CDC analysis of 1999–2004 NHANES data found BLL distributions shifted toward lower values by poverty status (including household income < 1.3 times the poverty threshold) and that Medicaid-enrolled children did not have a statistically significantly higher percentage of EBLLs than non-Medicaid children. These results indicate that children who are eligible for Medicaid can no longer be assumed to have an increased risk for EBLLs, and that "a new blood lead screening strategy is needed that accounts for local variations in risk and disparities at the local level".

### Hearing assessment in infants, children, and adolescents: recommendations beyond neonatal screening [^a362bfe7]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Hearing assessment algorithm within an office visit outlines when to screen and the subsequent branches and actions. For "Any office visit where clinician or caregiver has concern about hearing" and "Health supervision visits designated for objective hearing screen per Bright Futures/AAP Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care (Periodicity Schedule)", and to "Consider at other health supervision visits with risks specifically for delayed-onset hearing loss (Table 1)", clinicians perform an "Objective hearing screen* (For age-appropriate methods, see Table 3)". The "Screen result" can be "Negative or inconclusive" or positive, with action nodes including "Referral to audiology". If the screen is "Negative or inconclusive", the algorithm asks "Risk for delayed-onset hearing change (Table 1) or persistent concern?"; a "Yes" branches to "Referral to audiology", whereas "No" branches to "Usual care". After audiology evaluation, "Evaluation result" that is "Positive" leads to "Relevant referrals and interventions", whereas a "Negative" result leads to "Schedule early return".

### Screening tests for active pulmonary tuberculosis in children [^dfb3205b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis continues to elude traditional control strategies. According to the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2020, an estimated 10 million people in 2019 were ill with tuberculosis worldwide. Of these, over 25% were not diagnosed or reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). Children less than 15 years old represented approximately 12% of incident cases, but 16% of the estimated 1.4 million deaths from tuberculosis in 2019. This relatively higher share of mortality in children highlights urgent needs of improved case detection and subsequent access to treatment in this age group (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2020).

Case finding is a crucial step in the cascade of care for people with tuberculosis; however, for most deaths from childhood tuberculosis, the disease is never diagnosed (Jenkins 2017). In the "Roadmap towards ending TB in children and adolescents", the WHO identifies case finding for childhood tuberculosis as a key activity (WHO 2018). Major factors that lead to underdiagnosis of childhood tuberculosis include the following: 1. symptoms tend to be less specific in children and overlap with those of other common childhood diseases; 2. existing tests for children are invasive and have suboptimal sensitivity; ideally, tests need to be inexpensive, accessible, and usable at the point of care, allowing for actionable information for patient care; and 3. reliance on a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, without microbiological evidence of disease, requires expertise, which is often not available in areas where the burden of disease is greatest. Given these factors, national and international guidelines for child health generally lack systematic screening strategies for tuberculosis (WHO 2018).

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^5b6dac29]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The CDC has historically issued guidelines for blood lead levels. As stated by the CDC, these are not meant as health or toxicity standards but represent the population-based levels for the 2.5% of children in NHANES with the highest blood lead values. These thresholds are referred to as blood lead reference values. In 2021, the CDC lowered the threshold from 5 μg/dL or higher, which was in effect from 2012 to 2021, to 3.5 μg/dL or higher; these thresholds represent the 97.5th percentiles in 2015 through 2018 and 2007 through 2010 samples, respectively. Before 2012, the CDC had 10 μg/dL or higher as a level of concern.

The CDC and other authoritative public health agencies acknowledge that low blood lead levels can still be harmful for child development. However, current thresholds (and those before them) are also meant to guide government and public health (federal, state, and local) processes and resources for further interventions. For lead levels greater than or equal to 3.5 μg/dL, recommendations include additional management and intervention steps for reporting the test, assessing and investigating environmental exposure history, diet checks and assessments especially for calcium or iron deficiency, evaluating development, considering referral to additional services and specialists, and above certain thresholds (> 45 μg/dL) gastrointestinal tract decontamination.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^eb40e55f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

HCPs play a vital role in addressing pediatric lead exposure by initiating recommended follow-up actions based on the child's BLL. The updated BLRV empowers HCPs to take earlier action to mitigate exposures for children aged 1–5 years with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL, who, before this update, would not have been recommended to receive these services for a BLL < 5 μ g/dL. Earlier recognition of lead exposure enables providers and families to intervene by stopping exposure that might otherwise result in higher BLLs, thus likely limiting or preventing potential adverse health effects.

Although there are practical challenges, HCPs who identify children with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL should strive to ascertain possible sources of exposure by taking an environmental history and providing nutritional counseling which can help decrease lead absorption. Before this update, these actions were not recommended to occur for BLLs < 5 μ g/dL. In addition, HCPs can provide guidance on exposure reduction, regardless of whether sources are identified, and link children to health departments for appropriate services. Follow-up testing using venous samples should be conducted after any remediation activities have taken place to ensure that exposure reduction was effective in addition to assessing developmental progress at regular intervals and providing referrals to supportive services as needed.

Health care for children in foster care — screening and laboratory evaluation includes growth and sensory screening, infectious risk assessment, and targeted labs. Head circumference should be measured "in all children up to 3 years of age", and "all children should have age-appropriate vision and hearing screening at entry into foster care and at each periodic preventive health visit". New entrants are "considered at high risk of having HIV infection, hepatitis B and C, and other sexually or vertically transmitted infections". "Adolescent girls should receive a pregnancy test". Labs for environmental and nutritional risk are specified: "Laboratory tests for lead exposure and iron deficiency should be performed in children younger than 6 years or any child with a history of pica or signs of inadequate nutrition". Tuberculosis screening is advised: children "should be screened with the placement of a purified protein derivative". Additional screening "that should be considered includes rapid plasma reagin test, urinalysis, and hemoglobin measurement in menstruating adolescent girls". Other labs "should be problem focused or as per AAP guidelines", invasive procedures should be coordinated "so as to minimize trauma", and "All children should be referred for an oral health assessment".

### Blood lead screening [^ef88b78c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate local procedures for and barriers to testing Medicaid patients for lead toxicity, a retrospective review of 675 charts of Medicaid patients' age 12 to 36 months form the 7 practices who serve the vast majority of Medicaid children in Kalamazoo, Michigan was undertaken. We identified and tested a model for barriers to patients and physicians obtaining blood lead levels. Only 27.6% had blood lead levels substantially lower than the universal testing mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Physicians overestimated the number of children having blood lead tests, even with adjusting for patient non-compliance. Practices varied sharply in their approach to screening. Of 489 patients without findable lead test results, 139 (28.4%) were attributable to previous screening, 98 (20.0%) to patient failure, 181 (37.0%) to physician failure, 52 (10.6%) to patient + physician failure and 19 (3.9%) were indeterminate. There is need for improvement, standardization and unification of lead screening guidelines. Understanding barriers to blood lead testing is also necessary to develop credible data to promote shifts in public policy regarding lead abatement. Further studies should be done, such as interviews and questionnaires to determine why physicians fail to order blood lead tests, and patients fail to appear for a test that has been ordered.

### Erythrocyte protoporphyrin or hemoglobin: which is a better screening test for iron deficiency in children and women? [^044a42ae]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin and erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) tests are commonly used to screen for iron deficiency. However, little research has been done to systematically evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these 2 tests.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of hemoglobin and EP measurements in predicting iron deficiency in preschool children and in women of childbearing age.

Design

We examined data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 2613 children aged 1–5 y and n = 5175 nonpregnant women aged 15–49 y). Children or women with blood lead ≥ 10 microg/dL were excluded from this study. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of hemoglobin and EP measurements in screening for iron deficiency, defined as having abnormal values for ≥ 2 of the following 3 indexes: mean cell volume, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin.

Results

The ROC performance of EP was consistently better than that of hemoglobin for detecting iron deficiency in preschool children. However, in nonpregnant women, we found no significant difference between EP and hemoglobin in ROC performance for detecting iron deficiency. We observed the same results when we stratified the analyses by sex and race of the children and by race of the women.

Conclusions

For children aged 1–5 y, EP is a better screening tool for iron deficiency than is hemoglobin. However, for nonpregnant women, EP and hemoglobin have similar sensitivity and specificity for predicting iron deficiency.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19-34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^0da2b18c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Approximately 500,000 fewer children in the reporting jurisdictions were tested for lead exposure during the first 5 months of 2020 than during the same period in 2019. Estimating from this finding, approximately 10,000 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased testing. Reported challenges to conducting follow-up medical visits and environmental investigations indicate delays in exposure elimination and linkage to critical services for these children. Although socioeconomic data were not collected, a disproportionate impact is anticipated among children at risk for increased lead exposure, including children from racial or ethnic minority groups, from families who have been economically or socially marginalized, and those living in older housing with lead-based paint. These groups have also been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lead testing trends among young children mirror declines in other pediatric medical services during the pandemic, including emergency department visits, well-child visits and screenings, §§ and orders for childhood vaccines and vaccination coverage. As a result of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders and school closures, there is also concern that children spending more time in contaminated environments could have ongoing or increased exposure.

Although telemedicine and other remote service delivery strategies provide an alternative to office and clinic visits during the pandemic, in-person visits are still necessary for many essential health examinations, including BLL testing among children. During the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that well-child examinations occur in person whenever possible and within the child's medical home where continuity of care can be established. CDC guidance recommends that health care providers identify children who have missed well-child visits or recommended vaccinations and contact them to schedule in-person appointments, with prioritization of infants, children aged < 24 months, and school-aged children. * It is important that health care providers ensure that all children receive lead testing, including those who missed routine BLL screening, those with prior elevated BLLs who need follow-up testing, and those with possible lead exposure. Collaborations among health departments; Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children programs; immunization programs; Medicaid; refugee health organizations; and other health service providers for children at risk, including outreach to parents and providers and reminders to test children at risk for lead exposure, can help ensure that these children receive needed health assessments. States and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs can examine data from blood lead surveillance and Medicaid to identify children in need of lead testing.
