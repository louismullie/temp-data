## Question

What are the next steps in managing the mildly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next steps should be to manage a "mildly enlarged" retroperitoneal lymph node. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "mildly enlarged" by imaging criteria and modality. Then, I should confirm how clinical context changes pretest probability and next steps. Next, I will review which imaging features do and do not discriminate malignancy. After that, I need to branch management for incidental nodes, nodes in patients with known malignancy, and nodes arising in syndromic contexts. Finally, I will consider when to use PET, when to biopsy (and how), what labs to order, and tumor-specific nuances such as testicular germ cell tumors and lymphoma, anchoring these decisions to ACR and oncologic guidelines [^1152XNY2] [^115xG3tP] [^117LDTRy].

> Let me first confirm the size definition, because terminology drives downstream decisions. In the retroperitoneum, the ACR Incidental Findings Committee generally flags a short-axis diameter of at least 10 mm as "enlarged", so "mildly enlarged" typically sits around 10–15 mm, right at or just above that threshold, although MRI-based normal size distributions suggest that many retroperitoneal nodes physiologically measure below these cutoffs and modality differences matter for interpretation [^1152XNY2] [^115VPV3Y].

> Next, I should review how clinical context reframes risk. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: an incidental 10–12 mm node in someone without cancer is not the same as the same node in a patient with known malignancy or systemic symptoms. For truly incidental nodes, malignant yield is low, whereas population data show that unexplained lymphadenopathy confers a front-loaded short-term cancer risk that attenuates over time, so a structured follow-up plan is key to avoid both over- and under-treatment [^111QeChx] [^114hegXX].

> I will now examine whether morphology helps me discriminate benign from malignant. Wait, let me verify the ACR-IFC features: round shape, absent hilum, necrosis, hypervascularity, clustering, and multistation involvement are considered "suspicious", but in a single-center validation none of these features, including size ≥ 10 mm, reliably separated benign from malignant nodes, with only about 8.5% proving malignant and some malignant nodes remaining stable at 3–6 months, so morphology informs urgency but should not be used in isolation to rule in or out malignancy [^111QeChx].

> For Scenario A (incidental mildly enlarged node, no known cancer), I should double-check the recommended cadence. The ACR-IFC approach is an initial short-interval CT or MRI at about 3 months; if the node decreases or resolves, it is considered benign and no further work-up is considered benign — wait, I duplicated that; I should correct that to "no further work-up is required"; if stable at 3 months, extend surveillance to 6–12 months; if it enlarges meaningfully or new nodes appear, escalate to tissue diagnosis rather than indefinite imaging, because stability alone early on does not entirely exclude malignancy [^111QeChx]. Let me consider adjuncts: PET may be reserved for larger nodes or evolving systemic concerns, recognizing that a negative PET does not exclude micrometastatic or small-volume disease, and should not replace histology when the result would change management [^116KAgic]. I need to ensure I'm not missing a germ cell tumor or lymphoma in symptomatic patients; pragmatic screening labs when constitutional symptoms or clinical suspicion exist include CBC, LDH, and testicular tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG) in appropriate demographics, but routine labs are not mandated in asymptomatic, truly incidental cases [^115xG3tP] [^117LDTRy].

> For Scenario B (node in a patient with a known primary malignancy), I should confirm the pitfall of assuming metastasis. In a biopsy series of patients with a single known cancer, 23% of biopsied abdominopelvic nodes were either a new primary malignancy or benign, so histologic confirmation is important to avoid misclassification and mistreatment [^115aXYHi]. I need to check biopsy technique: image-guided core needle biopsy is preferred to provide architecture and immunohistochemistry; if lymphoma is in the differential, FNA is typically insufficient and architectural sampling is required, or an excisional/incisional approach may be warranted; if percutaneous access is unsafe or non-diagnostic, laparoscopic nodal biopsy is a reasonable alternative [^112Mogk5] [^111Mm14d] [^114f5hnX]. PET can support whole-body staging but should complement, not replace, tissue diagnosis when results will alter therapy decisions [^116KAgic].

> For Scenario C (nodes within a syndromic or disease-specific presentation), I should review conditions where observation or targeted sampling is appropriate. In suspected sarcoidosis with classic phenotypes (e.g., asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy), guideline panels allow for close clinical observation without immediate nodal sampling on a case-by-case basis, weighing procedural risks, likelihood of alternative diagnoses, and feasibility of follow-up; when tissue is needed, endobronchial ultrasound-guided sampling is favored over mediastinoscopy for thoracic stations, underscoring the principle of tailoring the least invasive, highest yield approach to the suspected disease process [^113AL22R] [^114kxAdp].

> But wait, what if the clinical picture fits a germ cell tumor in a young or middle-aged man with retroperitoneal nodes? I should confirm that a careful testicular examination and serum tumor markers (AFP, β-hCG, ± LDH) are obtained promptly, because seminoma and nonseminoma can initially present with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and management diverges markedly from other solid tumors; indeed, occult seminoma may be diagnosed on nodal biopsy when the testicular lesion is subtle, requiring dedicated testicular imaging and urologic oncology input [^115xG3tP] [^117LDTRy] [^114pcd7H]. Let me reconsider surgical strategy nuances: contemporary guidelines and series describe selective roles for primary or nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in defined seminoma and nonseminoma scenarios at specialized centers, emphasizing multidisciplinary selection rather than routine application [^115xG3tP] [^117LDTRy] [^116YXU6V].

> Next, I should review modality considerations to minimize harm. In younger patients where radiation exposure is a concern and expertise exists, MRI can offer detection of retroperitoneal nodal disease comparable to CT for testicular germ cell tumor follow-up and staging, although local experience and availability should guide modality choice, and serial comparability is crucial for response assessment [^114ZEkdD].

> I need to ensure I am using a consistent definition of meaningful interval growth to trigger escalation. A pragmatic threshold of about a 20% increase in the short-axis dimension is commonly used to denote concerning progression in nodal disease assessments, aligning with lymphoma response frameworks and helping standardize decisions to biopsy or restage rather than reacting to minimal measurement variability [^114gEYP3].

> Hold on, I should verify access routes for tissue diagnosis in challenging retroperitoneal locations. When feasible, percutaneous CT- or US-guided core needle biopsy is first-line; for para-aortic or deep peripancreatic nodes adjacent to the GI tract, endoscopic ultrasound-guided FNA or core sampling can be diagnostic when handled with appropriate cytology and immunohistochemistry; and when percutaneous or endoscopic routes are unsafe or nondiagnostic, laparoscopic nodal biopsy provides a safe surgical alternative with good yield in experienced hands [^114pcd7H] [^114f5hnX].

> In summary, I need to tie the algorithm back to risk and action: define "mild" by the 10 mm short-axis threshold, contextualize risk by clinical scenario, recognize the limited specificity of morphology, use short-interval cross-sectional follow-up for incidental nodes, reserve PET for selected questions, and not hesitate to obtain tissue in patients with known malignancy or evolving nodes — especially when results will redirect therapy — while incorporating disease-specific pathways such as germ cell tumors or suspected lymphoma to choose the right biopsy and the right multidisciplinary plan [^1152XNY2] [^111QeChx] [^115aXYHi] [^115xG3tP] [^117LDTRy] [^112Mogk5] [^116KAgic].

---

The next steps for a mildly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node are to **confirm benign imaging features** and **monitor with interval imaging** [^1152XNY2]. If the node is < 1.5 cm with a preserved fatty hilum and no suspicious features, observe with **repeat CT or MRI at 3–6 months** [^111QeChx]; if stable or smaller, extend intervals to 6–12 months. If it enlarges to > 2 cm, develops suspicious features, or the patient has a known malignancy, obtain **PET/CT** [^116KAgic] and consider an image-guided biopsy [^115aXYHi]. Reserve surgical excision for cases in which malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected.

---

## Clinical assessment and history

Evaluate symptoms for **B symptoms** (fever, night sweats, weight loss), abdominal or back pain, and compressive symptoms [^113pSD2q]. Review the medical history for prior malignancy, infections, autoimmune disease, recent vaccinations, and medications; perform a physical examination to identify lymphadenopathy elsewhere, organomegaly, or other signs of systemic disease [^111uRjxx] [^114LyRWG].

---

## Imaging evaluation

### Initial imaging modality

For initial assessment, **CT** is standard and should assess size, shape, borders, hilum, necrosis, calcification, and enhancement [^1152XNY2]; **MRI** is an alternative when radiation avoidance is preferred (e.g. young patients, pregnancy) [^114ZEkdD].

---

### Imaging features suggestive of benignity

- **Size**: Short-axis < 1.5 cm.
- **Shape**: Oval with preserved fatty hilum.
- **Borders**: Well-defined, smooth.
- **Enhancement**: Homogeneous without necrosis or calcification [^1152XNY2].

---

### Imaging features suggestive of malignancy

- **Size**: Short-axis > 2 cm.
- **Shape**: Round, loss of fatty hilum.
- **Borders**: Irregular, ill-defined.
- **Enhancement**: Heterogeneous, necrosis, calcification [^116KAgic].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

- **CBC**: Assess for anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis.
- **LDH**: Elevated in lymphoma and some solid tumors.
- **ESR/CRP**: Elevated in inflammatory or infectious conditions.
- **Tumor markers**: AFP, β-hCG, CEA, CA-125, PSA as clinically indicated.
- **Infectious serologies**: HIV, EBV, CMV, TB, as indicated [^111uRjxx].

---

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated if the node enlarges to **> 2 cm** on follow-up or has **suspicious imaging features**. Additionally, biopsy is warranted in the presence of known or suspected malignancy or persistent, unexplained systemic symptoms [^1152XNY2] [^115aXYHi].

---

## Biopsy techniques

**Image-guided core needle biopsy** is the preferred initial approach. EUS-FNA is appropriate for nodes near the GI tract, and surgical excision is reserved when percutaneous biopsy is inconclusive or not feasible [^115aXYHi] [^114f5hnX] [^114pcd7H].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

### Recommended follow-up intervals

Initial follow-up consists of **repeat CT or MRI at 3–6 months** [^111QeChx]. If nodes are stable, extend intervals to 6–12 months, with annual imaging for up to 2 years if stability persists.

---

### Criteria for escalation of care

Escalate care if the node enlarges to **> 2 cm** or develops **suspicious imaging features**. Also escalate for new systemic symptoms or for nodal progression in a known malignancy [^1152XNY2].

---

## Multidisciplinary team involvement

**Radiology** interprets imaging and plans follow-up; **oncology** evaluates malignancy risk and directs management. **Surgery** performs biopsy or excision when indicated, **pathology** provides the histopathologic diagnosis, and **primary care** coordinates care and patient communication [^1172EYtW].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Explain the findings, distinguish benign from malignant features, and explain the rationale for surveillance. Instruct patients on **red flags** (B symptoms, rapid growth, pain) and emphasize adherence to scheduled imaging and appointments [^114hegXX].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical assessment and history |
| 2 | Initial imaging (CT/MRI) |
| 3 | Laboratory evaluation |
| 4 | Surveillance if benign features |
| 5 | Biopsy if suspicious features or growth |
| 6 | Multidisciplinary team review |
| 7 | Patient counseling and education |

---

In summary, **confirm benign imaging features**, **monitor with interval imaging**, and escalate to PET/CT and biopsy if the node grows or becomes suspicious; reserve surgical excision for confirmed or strongly suspected malignancy [^116KAgic] [^115aXYHi].

### Image-guided biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes in patients with known primary malignancies [^115aXYHi]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine how often abdominal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy in patients with a known malignancy arises from a second primary cancer or from benign causes, rather than from the cancer already known.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 196 patients with a history of a single biopsy-proven malignancy underwent image-guided abdominal or pelvic lymph node (LN) biopsies between January 2000 and January 2005. Three patients were excluded. The medical records and imaging of the remaining 193 patients were reviewed. Pathologic results were assigned to one of three outcomes: LN involvement by known malignancy, newly diagnosed malignancy, or no malignancy identified. Patients in whom malignancy was not identified required repeat biopsy or stability or reduction in the size of LN on follow-up imaging for confirmation while not receiving treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 193 included biopsies, there was LN involvement by the known malignancy in 148 (76.7%; 95% CI, 70.1%-82.5%), a newly diagnosed malignancy in 19 (9.8%; 95% CI, 6.0%-14.9%), and no malignancy identified in 26 (13.5%; 95% CI, 9.0%-19.1%).

- **Conclusions**: Biopsy of a suspicious abdominal or pelvic LN in patients with known malignancy reveals a newly diagnosed malignancy or no evidence of malignancy in 23% of cases, emphasizing the importance of biopsy.

### The American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee recommendations for management of incidental lymph nodes: A single-center evaluation [^111QeChx]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To assess the American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee's (ACR-IFC) recommendations for defining and following up abnormal incidental abdominopelvic lymph nodes, a study was conducted.

A total of 59 lymph nodes satisfying ACR-IFC criteria as incidental (no malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder) and with sufficient follow-up to classify as benign (biopsy, decreased size, or stability over 12 months) or malignant (biopsy, detection of primary malignancy combined with either fluorodeoxyglucose hyperactivity or increase in size of the node) were included. Two radiologists independently assessed nodes for suspicious features by ACR-IFC criteria: the presence of a round shape with indistinct hilum, hypervascularity, necrosis, a cluster of three or more nodes, a cluster of two or more nodes in two or more stations, and size of 1 cm or greater in the retroperitoneum. Outcomes were evaluated with attention to ACR-IFC's recommendation for an initial 3-month follow-up.

The results showed that 8.5% of the nodes were malignant, whereas 91.5% were benign. Two of the six malignant nodes were stable at a 3 to less than 6-month follow-up before diagnosis, while the diagnosis of four out of five malignant nodes was facilitated by the later development of tumors in non-nodal sites. A total of 13, 5, 8, and 9 nodes were deemed benign based on a decrease in size at less than 3 months, 3 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, or 12 months or more of follow-up, respectively. No ACR-IFC feature significantly differentiated between benign and malignant nodes (P = 0.164–1.0). A cluster of three or more nodes was present in 88.1% to 93.2% of nodes, and 96.6% to 98.3% had at least one suspicious feature according to both readers. Necrosis and hypervascularity were not identified in any node.

### Primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for seminoma metastatic to the retroperitoneum [^116YXU6V]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

The primary surgical treatment with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection aims to accurately stage and treat patients with node-positive pure seminoma while avoiding the long-term risks of chemotherapy or radiation, traditional standard-of-care treatments.

- **Materials and methods**: We reported the pathologic and oncologic outcomes of patients with pure seminoma treated with primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in a retrospective, single-institution case series over 10 years. The primary outcome was 2-year recurrence-free survival stratified by adjuvant management strategy (surveillance vs. adjuvant chemotherapy).

- **Results**: Forty-five patients treated with primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for pure testicular seminoma metastatic to the retroperitoneum were identified. The median size of the largest lymph node before surgery was 1.8 cm. Viable germ cell tumors, all of which were pure seminoma, were found in 96% (n = 43) of patients. The median number of positive nodes and nodes removed was 2 and 54, respectively. The median positive pathologic node size was 2 cm (IQR 1.4–2.5 cm, range 0.1–5 cm). Four of 29 patients managed with postoperative surveillance experienced relapse; 2-year recurrence-free survival was 81%. The median follow-up for those managed with surveillance who did not relapse was 18.5 months. There were no relapses in the retroperitoneum, visceral recurrences, or deaths. Among the 16 patients who received adjuvant treatment, 1 patient experienced relapse in the pelvis at 19 months.

- **Conclusions**: Primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for pure seminoma with a focus on strategic retreatment options.

### Lymph node enlargement and risk of haematological and solid cancer [^114hegXX]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Enlarged lymph nodes may be a marker of occult cancer, but accurate data on cancer risk are limited. We used population-based Danish medical registries to assess cancer risk in a cohort of patients with a first-time inpatient or outpatient hospital contact for enlarged lymph nodes during 1994–2008. Observed cancer incidences were compared with those expected in the general population. We observed 1,750 cancers among 11,284 patients with enlarged lymph nodes during a median follow-up of 4.7 years, while only 389 cases were expected.

- **Cancer risk during the first year**: Cancer risk was 11.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.9–12.1%] during the first year of follow-up, corresponding to an age- and sex-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 21.1 (95% CI: 20.0–22.3). One-year SIRs were more than 100 times increased for head and neck cancer and lymphomas.

- **Cancer risk beyond the first year**: Beyond one year of follow-up, overall cancer risk remained 1.4-fold (95% CI: 1.3–1.5-fold) higher than expected, while the risk of lymphoma remained six to 10 times higher. Cancer risk was also elevated among patients with other conditions known to be associated with enlarged lymph nodes, such as infections and rheumatic disorders.

We conclude that enlarged lymph nodes are a marker of occult cancer and indicate a long-term risk of cancer.

### The management of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in spermatocytic seminoma of the testicle [^117N37aJ]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Spermatocytic seminoma is an extremely rare, clinically and pathologically distinct subtype of testicular cancer that infrequently metastasizes and typically yields a good prognosis. While retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in the typical testicular cancer patient often harbors metastatic disease, in a patient with spermatocytic seminoma, this finding should be viewed with suspicion, and pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease is essential. We present a 49-year-old man with spermatocytic seminoma and retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy who was found to have low-grade lymphoma.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Buki6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic testing**:

	- **Question 1**: Should lymph node sampling be performed in a patient presenting with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy?

	**Rationale for question**:

	- Isolated involvement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a common presentation of sarcoidosis and is readily detected by a routine chest X-ray. Many such patients are asymptomatic, and sarcoidosis is only suspected on the basis of radiographic testing for an unrelated reason. Patients with sarcoidosis with asymptomatic lymph node involvement generally have self-limited disease, and do not require treatment. However, the finding of enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes during radiographic testing is often alarming to healthcare providers and patients alike, primarily out of concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as occult malignancy or latent infection. Previous studies have reported that asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is almost always caused by sarcoidosis, and, given the benign nature of this phenotype, there is clinical equipoise for pursuing diagnostic sampling in such patients.

	**Summary of evidence**:

	- Our systematic review identified 2,106 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 75 was reviewed. One study reported enrolling patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so the panel decided to separately consider 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis.

### Penile cancer: ESMO-EURACAN clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^115Brn9f]. ESMO Open (2024). High credibility.

In the management of penile cancer, particularly concerning the approach to lymph nodes, the ESMO/EURACAN 2024 guidelines advocate for offering dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy to patients with cN0 intermediate or high-risk disease (pT1G2, pT1–4G3/G4, or lymphovascular invasion) before proceeding to a radical inguinal lymphadenectomy in the presence of metastatic nodes.

### Clinical outcome of patients with fibrosis/necrosis at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for advanced germ cell tumors [^113ZXsrW]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Fibrosis accounts for approximately 50% of histological findings at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and is associated with reported relapse rates of 10% to 15%. We characterized patients with fibrosis at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and identified predictors of adverse outcomes in this group.

We reviewed the medical records of men who underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection between 1989 and 2013 with histological findings of necrosis/fibrosis. With few exceptions, post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection after 1999 was performed with a bilateral template. Clinical, pathological, and treatment-related data were reported. Cox regression models were built to identify predictors of disease recurrence.

The study cohort included 598 men with a median age of 32 years (IQR 25–38). Most cases (397 of 547, 73%) were classified as IGCCCG good risk, with no significant differences in risk classification before and after 1999 (p = 0.55). Median follow-up was 7.3 years (IQR 3.2–12.3). The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates were 94% and 96%, respectively. Overall, 36 patients had disease recurrence, most of which were distant or outside the retroperitoneal lymph node dissection template. Procedures performed after 1999 and the presence of embryonal cell carcinoma on primary histology were associated with improved recurrence-free survival on multivariate analysis (p < 0.01).

### Retroperitoneal lymphangioleiomyoma with lymph node involvement: A pathologic-radiologic correlation of a rare form of myomelanocytic tumor [^112QDtXK]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare and slowly progressive disorder that typically arises in the lung, affecting exclusively women in their childbearing years. It usually presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and pneumothorax. Infrequently, extrapulmonary LAM can occur in the retroperitoneum, uterine wall, mediastinum, and intraperitoneal lymph nodes. Histologically, LAM is characterized by a proliferation of perivascular epithelioid cells (PEC) that express markers for both melanocytes and smooth muscle cells.

We report a case of a peripancreatic retroperitoneal mass that was incidentally discovered on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of a 38-year-old female. The morphologic findings and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with a lymphangioleiomyoma. The radiologic and pathologic correlation, along with the differential diagnosis of this rare entity, is discussed.

### The role of primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in the treatment of stage II seminoma [^113a9LkF]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Low credibility.

For men with stage II seminoma, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is an emerging treatment option with reduced long-term toxicity compared to radio- and/or chemotherapy. However, longer follow-up is required to determine the risk of retroperitoneal or systemic relapse and to identify risk factors to personalize treatment plans. As a further step, decision analyses will help determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy after RPLND may decrease the overall treatment burden.

### Beyond PET/CT in Hodgkin lymphoma: a comprehensive review of the role of imaging at initial presentation, during follow-up and for assessment of treatment-related complications [^113pSD2q]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The most typical presentation of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is painless, enlarged superficial lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. Patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain. Chest radiography can be performed as the initial investigation in these patients. Chest X-ray provides preliminary information about the involvement of the mediastinum and lungs. Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy at diagnosis is an unfavourable prognostic factor in patients with HL and can be quantified by measuring the mediastinal mass ratio.

- **Cotswolds modification of the Ann Arbor staging system**: Defines bulky disease as a mediastinal mass exceeding one-third of the internal transverse diameter of the thorax at the T5/6 intervertebral disc level on a posteroanterior chest radiograph. Ultrasound (US) is often helpful in confirming enlarged nodes and guiding biopsy, particularly cervical lymph nodes, the most common nodal group affected in patients with HL. US can be useful for the evaluation of extranodal sites of involvement in the abdomen (e.g. gallbladder, kidney) and for image-guided biopsy of focal lesions in solid organs such as the liver and spleen.

### Predicting teratoma in the retroperitoneum in men undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [^111RV2Zp]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

The biological potential of teratoma remains unpredictable; therefore, identifying its presence in the retroperitoneum is important. We evaluated patients undergoing post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors to determine predictors of teratomatous elements in the retroperitoneum.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 532 patients from 1989 to 2003 who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection following chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors at our institution. Multiple clinical and pathological variables were reviewed from our prospective retroperitoneal lymph node dissection database. A logistic regression model was designed based on preoperative variables to predict the presence of teratomatous elements in the retroperitoneal lymph node dissection specimen.

- **Results**: Of the 532 patients in our series, 450 (85%) received only induction chemotherapy and 82 (15%) required salvage chemotherapy. Teratomatous elements were identified in the orchiectomy specimen in 42% of patients. Retroperitoneal nodal pathology revealed teratomatous elements in 235 (44%) patients and only teratoma in 210 (40%) patients. By multivariate analysis, testicular yolk sac tumor (p = 0.046), teratoma in the orchiectomy specimen (p < 0.005), relative change in nodal size before and after chemotherapy (p < 0.005), and no requirement for salvage chemotherapy (p = 0.03) were independent predictors for the presence of teratoma in the retroperitoneum.

- **Conclusions**: Teratoma remains a common histological finding in the retroperitoneum.

### Current concepts in lymph node imaging [^116KAgic]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes by imaging hold significant therapeutic and prognostic value for patients with newly diagnosed cancers. The presence of nodal metastases limits therapeutic options and generally indicates a worse prognosis in patients; thus, having this information before commencing therapy is crucial.

Cross-sectional imaging modalities rely on insensitive size and morphologic criteria, resulting in a lack of desired accuracy for characterizing lymph nodes. Metastases may be present in non-enlarged lymph nodes, and not all enlarged nodes are malignant. PET has overcome some of these limitations but is still constrained by resolution limits for small nodal metastases. This has fueled the development of targeted techniques for nodal imaging and characterization. In recent years, studies have shown that these newer imaging techniques can bridge some of the limitations of existing imaging for nodal characterization, thereby providing essential staging information before the initiation of therapy.

### Multidisciplinary guidelines for initial evaluation of complicated lymphatic anomalies-expert opinion consensus [^1172EYtW]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Complicated lymphatic anomalies (CLAs) are chronic, progressive, and debilitating conditions that share clinical features, yet key elements for optimal evaluation and management have not been established. The aim was to formulate expert opinion consensus-based guidelines for comprehensive evaluation of CLAs.

Patient support groups dedicated to CLAs organized an international conference for vascular anomaly experts from 16 specialties to address the objective. Participants received a set of questions before the meeting and reviewed the literature. Data extracted from international lymphatic anomaly registries were presented, and the group separated for panel discussions during the conference. The recommendations achieving consensus within the panel were presented to the entire audience. Open debate occurred until majority approval was achieved.

The expert group comprised 52 physicians who defined the clinical elements required to evaluate and diagnose a CLA. The radiology panel established the preferred anatomical and functional imaging methods for diagnosis and the elements required to be described during interpretation. Two medical panels compiled the metabolic and hematologic tests at diagnosis and also recommended functional studies. The surgical group recommended precautions for biopsy, and the pathology panel provided biopsy specimen processing guidelines.

Patients with CLAs require a comprehensive and targeted diagnostic plan for appropriate management, prevention of complications, and conservation of resources.

### ESUR guidelines: ovarian cancer staging and follow-up [^115nww6s]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

To design clear guidelines for staging and follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer, and to provide the radiologist with a framework for use in multidisciplinary conferences, guidelines were defined by the female imaging subcommittee of the ESUR (European Society of Urogenital Radiology). These were based on the expert consensus of imaging protocols from 12 leading institutions and a critical review of the literature.

Computed tomography (CT), with coverage from the base of the lungs to the inguinal region, is regarded as the imaging technique of choice for preoperative staging. Critical diagnostic criteria are presented, and the basis for a structured report for preoperative staging is outlined. Following primary treatment for ovarian cancer, clinical assessment and CA-125 are routinely used to monitor patients. For suspected recurrence, CT remains the imaging modality of choice, with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT emerging as the optimal imaging technique for suspected recurrence, particularly in patients with negative CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In conclusion, CT is the imaging modality of choice for preoperative staging and detection of recurrence in patients with ovarian cancer.

### Giant retroperitoneal lymph node-an uncommon presentation of duodenal neuroendocrine tumour [^114MKjew]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Primary retroperitoneal neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are extremely rare. Many times, these are metastatic lesions with known or unknown primary locations, most commonly arising from the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and rectum. NETs originating from the duodenum are more frequently seen in the first part, followed by the second part of the duodenum. The incidence is increasing due to the easy accessibility of endoscopies and cross-sectional imaging.

In NETs, lymph node (LN) metastasis commonly occurs when the tumour size exceeds 2 cm. However, LN metastasis can occur with subcentimetric lesions, especially in the ampullary variant of NETs. A patient presented with mild abdominal pain and was found to have a retroduodenal mass. Upon evaluation, this mass was determined to be a metastatic LN deposit of NET, with the primary tumours arising from the first part and supra-ampullary part of the duodenum.

### Paradigm shifting research: Key studies in urologic oncology [^112oKieg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Surgery in early metastatic seminoma is a phase II study that establishes retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) as a central treatment in patients with testicular seminoma and limited retroperitoneal lymph node metastases, expanding traditional therapeutic options beyond systemic chemotherapy or radiation. Testicular cancer is the most common solid organ malignancy in men aged 20–40 years, with an estimated 9,190 new diagnoses in the United States in 2023. Survival rates for testicular cancer have markedly improved in the past 50 years and exceed 95%. Although necessary to achieve this high cure rate, chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens are associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular disease and secondary malignancies decades after treatment. These survivorship concerns are important since testicular cancer survivors comprise the eighth largest group of male cancer survivors, given their young age at diagnosis and high survival rate.

Most testicular cancers are germ cell tumors, which can be divided into seminoma and non-seminoma. Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) with limited retroperitoneal lymph node metastases can be offered RPLND or chemotherapy, both with a high primary cure rate. The appeal of primary RPLND in this setting is the avoidance of long-term toxicities, with the exception of retrograde ejaculation in some cases. However, seminomas with limited retroperitoneal metastases have historically been managed with chemotherapy or radiation, both of which have the potential for long-term toxicity, including infertility.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^114SHvve]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) is characterized by swelling of one or multiple lymph nodes in a single station and is typically detected as an incidental finding during routine radiological exams or because of symptoms generated by compression of local anatomical structures. Lymph nodes are often significantly enlarged (2–4 cm, up to 6+ cm), and although UCD can occur in any lymph node station, the most commonly involved regions include the mediastinum, the abdomen, and the cervical region. The majority of patients are asymptomatic or present with symptoms related to mass effect; however, a minority may present with systemic inflammatory symptoms or develop systemic complications such as paraneoplastic pemphigus, bronchiolitis obliterans, polyneuropathy, or hemolytic anemia, some of which can be potentially fatal.

### A new approach for accessing retroperitoneal space using a 5-mm visual access cannula [^113PZNvd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Retroperitoneal lymph node evaluation is a crucial step in planning cancer therapy. Traditional staging laparotomy is too invasive and causes considerable morbidity. However, laparoscopic access to the retroperitoneal space offers the onco-endoscopist a unique, non-invasive, and less dangerous method for assessing and managing women with gynecologic malignancies. The retroperitoneal approach is a non-invasive and less dangerous way of accessing the paraaortic space.

A new minimally invasive approach to accessing the retroperitoneal space using a 5-mm visual access cannula is introduced. A complete paraaortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy was possible for 60 patients with varied gynecologic malignancies using our retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach. Less blood loss and rapid recovery were observed, and no bowel complications were encountered. The use of the 5-mm visual access cannula offers a less invasive surgical procedure and provides cosmetic advantages.

### Time for an individualized approach to first-line management of follicular lymphoma [^112Mogk5]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Most patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) present with asymptomatic disease. The diagnosis is often suspected incidentally during a clinical or radiological examination for symptoms unrelated to FL. When symptomatic, the clinical presentation is dominated by lymphadenopathy or, less frequently, by disease-related complications such as abdominal pain (mesenteric lymphadenopathy) or respiratory signs (e.g. cough, shortness of breath, pleural effusion) in cases of thoracic lymphadenopathy. The general "B" symptoms, including fever > 38°C, drenching sweats, and weight loss > 10%, occur in about 20% of patients and should raise suspicion of histological transformation.

Laboratory investigations focus on detecting cytopenia, particularly anemia, with bone marrow infiltration being the most common cause. However, the possibility of autoimmune cytopenia should not be underestimated. The presence of circulating lymphoma cells, found in fewer than 10% of cases, is associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS). Important prognostic markers include lactate dehydrogenase and beta-2 microglobulin levels. Serum electrophoresis is systematically requested to check for associated monoclonal proteins, and viral serology (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus) should be determined before any treatment involving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

The diagnosis of FL is confirmed by a lymph node biopsy or, in the uncommon occurrence of extranodal FL, an organ biopsy. Initial diagnosis by fine needle aspiration or needle biopsy is not recommended.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113AL22R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

- **Summary of recommendations**:

- **Lymph node sampling**:
	- In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for sarcoidosis (e.g. Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome), we suggest NOT sampling lymph nodes (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks: Patients who do not undergo lymph node sampling require close clinical follow-up.
	- For patients presenting with asymptomatic, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, we make no recommendations for, or against obtaining a lymph node sample. Remarks: If lymph node sampling is not obtained, close clinical follow-up is a reasonable alternative approach.
	- For patients with suspected sarcoidosis and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy for whom it has been determined that tissue sampling is necessary, we suggest endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node sampling, rather than mediastinoscopy, as the initial mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node sampling procedure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### How I treat: Diagnosing and managing "in situ" lymphoma [^111Wv7Bv]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

The "in situ" lymphomas are often incidental findings in an otherwise reactive-appearing lymph node. Notably, the risk of progression to clinically appreciable lymphoma is not yet fully known. The diagnosis of "in situ" lymphoma is feasible when immunohistochemical characterization is carried out and genetic abnormalities are assessed. "In situ" follicular lymphoma is characterized by the presence within the affected germinal centers of B cells that strongly express BCL2 protein, a finding that supports their neoplastic nature, in the absence of interfollicular infiltration. In "in situ" mantle cell lymphoma, the lymphoma involvement is typically limited to the inner mantle zone, where lymphoma cells are cyclin D1(+) and weakly BCL2(+), CD5(+).

A staging workup to exclude other sites of involvement is highly recommended for the possible coexistence of an overt lymphoma. Biopsy of all sites of suspicious involvement should be mandatory. No evidence for starting therapy also in the presence of multifocal "in situ" lymphoma exists, and a "wait-and-see policy" is strongly suggested. A follow-up strategy reserving imaging evaluation only in the presence of disease-related symptoms or organ involvement appears to be a reasonable option. For patients with concomitant overt lymphoma, staging and treatment procedures must be done according to malignant counterpart.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: A pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, as it may be observed in various neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is complex. It may result from a primary immune activation and be a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition. Alternatively, it can represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate with an unrelated immune process (e.g. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

The history should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may suggest infection or malignancy (e.g. a wound or a suspicious nodule) and on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). Constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. 38°C) are most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful due to medications potentially causing serum sickness. The acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whereas a subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

- **Physical examination**: Localized swelling typically indicates an infectious condition in the affected area.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^1171eJsq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). High credibility.

In a recent study, Jiao et al. aimed to evaluate a threshold for clinical PLND-validated nomograms to predict nonregional pelvic and extrapelvic lymph node metastasis in 57 high-risk prostate cancer patients studied with 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT. They observed overall extrareolar spread in nearly 35% of the lymph node metastasis with PSMA uptake. According to Briganti, MSKCC, and Winter nomograms, 70–72% of the patients were candidates for ePLND, according to EAU and NCCN guidelines. Positive lymph node metastasis on PSMA PET/CT led to a change in management in 70% of these patients. Moreover, patients with a nomogram score greater than 64%, 75%, and 67% according to Briganti, MSKCC, and Winter, respectively, were more likely to have nonregional lymph node metastasis. The authors concluded that these nomograms can predict nonregional lymph node metastasis. Interestingly, PSMA PET/CT may provide an additional benefit to nomogram-based clinical decision-making in more than two-thirds of patients, reducing unnecessary PLND.

To summarize, PSMA PET/CT is currently the best diagnostic tool for intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer patients, demonstrating excellent diagnostic performance for both N and M staging and likely superior to mpMRI in detecting locoregional lymph node metastasis. Based on the latest data in the literature, PSMA PET/CT might be crucial for primary therapy assessment because of its capability to detect even small but PSMA-avid pelvic lymph node metastasis outside the surgical template, thus leading to changes in management.

### Detection by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis as the initial presentation of testicular seminoma [^114pcd7H]. Endoscopy (2025).

Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy often causes suspicion of lymphoma or gastrointestinal malignancy, especially when primary lesions are not apparent. However, testicular seminoma may initially present as retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis. We report a case of retroperitoneal seminoma in a patient without an overt testicular mass that required endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA; EUS-FNA) for an accurate diagnosis.

A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Neither upper nor lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed any abnormalities, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) did not reveal a clear primary tumor. However, para-aortic lymph node swelling was observed, and malignant lymphoma was initially suspected. EUS revealed a homogeneous 30-mm lymph node adjacent to the aorta, and EUS-FNA was performed using a 22-G needle. Unlike typical lymphomas, the lesion was firm during puncture.

- **Imaging and procedure details**: Contrast-enhanced CT showed para-aortic lymph node enlargement. EUS revealed a homogeneous 30-mm lymph node adjacent to the aorta, and EUS-FNA was performed using a 22-G needle. Unlike typical lymphomas, the lesion and node felt firm.

Histopathology demonstrated tumor cells positive for c-KIT, SALL4, and Oct-3/4, as well as those negative for AFP and CD30, consistent with seminoma. Subsequent focused CT revealed a 14-mm nodular lesion in the right testicle, confirming the diagnosis.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limb edema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized, with the most commonly involved lymph node stations being mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical, and inguinal.

Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts:

- **Excision specimen findings**: Enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features.
- **Incidental documentation during workup**: Lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease.
- **Post-diagnosis appearance**: Lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after the diagnosis of extranodal disease.
- **First presenting symptom**: Generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, occurring weeks to years before extranodal disease appears.

Recently, IgG4-RD has been categorized into four clinical phenotypes based on patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are:

- **Group 1**: Pancreato-hepatobiliary disease, comprising 31% of patients.
- **Group 2**: Retroperitoneum and aorta, comprising 24%.
- **Group 3**: Head and neck–limited disease, comprising 24%.
- **Group 4**: Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement, comprising 22%.

Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of patients displaying this symptom.

### Primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with clinical stage IS testis cancer [^117T2PUz]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Initial management for clinical stage IS (persistently increased tumor markers) nonseminomatous germ cell tumor has evolved from primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection to induction chemotherapy at most medical centers. We analyzed the outcome in patients treated with primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.

We reviewed the charts of patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Center from 1993 to 2008. All patients with clinical stage IS were identified, and perioperative data were obtained.

A total of 280 patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection were identified, of whom 24 with clinical stage IS underwent primary dissection. Median follow-up was 2.9 years. Histopathology revealed an embryonal carcinoma component in 100% of the 24 orchiectomy specimens, with associated teratoma in 63%. Positive lymph nodes were identified at retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in 38% of patients, including pure embryonal carcinoma in 67%, combined embryonal carcinoma and teratoma in 1, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma in 1, and only teratoma in 1. Of the patients who underwent primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, 21% also received chemotherapy postoperatively due to persistently increased tumor markers in 13%. No retroperitoneal recurrence was noted on follow-up imaging. At surgery, estimated blood loss was 175 cc, operative time was 3.1 hours, and hospital stay was 3.9 days.

### Paracolic recurrence: The importance of wide excision of the spermatic cord at retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [^115gRok1]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate ipsilateral spermatic cord metastatic involvement at retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and to identify the possible etiology of unusual paracolic recurrences. Four patients who underwent the procedure elsewhere and subsequently exhibited radiographic evidence of expanding ipsilateral paracolic recurrence were referred to our institution for further treatment.

- **Materials and methods**: Between January 1988 and February 1998, a total of 34 out of 685 patients who underwent 702 retroperitoneal lymph node dissections had metastatic disease in the spermatic cord specimen. The variables examined included other disease sites, lymphovascular invasion in the primary tumor, histopathological findings of the primary tumor and retroperitoneal disease, clinical and pathological stage, disease side, and the specific site of anatomical involvement of metastatic disease within the spermatic cord specimen, particularly the spermatic vessels and/or surrounding lymphatic tissue.

- **Results**: Among the 34 positive spermatic cord specimens, 18 were from primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissections and 16 from post-chemotherapy specimens. Histopathological evaluation revealed a mixed germ cell pattern in 25 (74%) of the primary tumors and pure embryonal carcinoma in 9 (26%). Similarly, 9 of the 34 retroperitoneal lymph node specimens (26%) showed pure embryonal cell carcinoma, while the remainder exhibited mixed histopathological findings. Disease was classified as clinical stage I in 13 cases (38%), and lymphovascular invasion was absent in the primary tumor in 11 cases.

### Efficacy of laparoscopic mesenteric/retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy [^114f5hnX]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy identified incidentally during computed tomography (CT) mandates a tissue diagnosis. When percutaneous techniques are not possible, surgical tissue diagnosis becomes necessary. Laparotomy is the gold standard; however, a laparoscopic approach offers many potential benefits.

- **Methods**: This institutional review board (IRB)-approved study evaluated all patients undergoing laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy from 2001 to 2007 at the Cleveland Clinic. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, pathologic diagnosis, conversion to laparotomy, and perioperative complications.

- **Results**: A total of 30 cases were reviewed. In this group, 67% were males and 33% were females; the mean age was 48 years. Ten patients underwent mesenteric lymph node sampling, and 20 (67%) underwent retroperitoneal tumor resection. There were four (17%) conversions and no complications. Lymphoma was the most common pathologic finding.

- **Conclusion**: Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is a safe, effective alternative to open surgical biopsy.

### Prospective assessment of MRI for imaging retroperitoneal metastases from testicular germ cell tumours [^114ZEkdD]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim was to determine the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in patients with testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT).

- **Methods and materials**: A prospective study of 52 patients (mean age 34 years, range 18–54 years) was performed. Imaging of the retroperitoneum was conducted using multidetector computed tomography (CT) and 1.5 T MRI systems. The CT and MRI images were read independently by three observers. The number, size, and site of enlarged nodes (≥ 10 mm maximum short axis diameter) were recorded. Retroperitoneal nodal detection on MRI was compared to CT.

- **Results**: Twenty-two (42%) of the 52 patients had no retroperitoneal disease; in the remaining 30 patients, 51 enlarged nodes were identified. On a per patient basis, readers 1, 2, and 3 identified nodal disease in 28 of 29, 29 of 30, and 24 of 30 patients, respectively, using MRI compared to CT. Thus, for experienced radiologists (readers 1 and 2), MRI is comparable to CT for nodal detection (i.e. this study excludes MRI being inferior to CT with 80% power and 5% type 1 error).

- **Conclusion**: MRI offers an alternative method for staging the retroperitoneum in young patients being followed for TGCT and has the major advantage of avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation.

### Periportal lymphadenopathy in patients without identifiable pancreatobiliary or hepatic malignancy [^112P9gdC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Enlarged periportal lymph nodes are often noticed during imaging of the upper abdomen. Malignant infiltration and enlargement of periportal nodes occur in patients with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, and pancreas, as well as lymphoma. However, there are no published data on the significance and differential diagnosis of enlarged periportal lymph nodes in patients without the aforementioned cancers.

- **Methods**: We searched our database for patients who either (1) underwent endoscopic ultrasound for evaluation of enlarged periportal nodes or (2) were found to have enlarged periportal lymph nodes (≥ 10 mm) during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination. Patients with identifiable pancreatic, biliary, gallbladder, or liver cancers were excluded. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of one or more nodes was performed.

- **Results**: Sixty-four patients with periportal lymph nodes 10–40 mm in size met the inclusion criteria. In 24 patients, enlarged periportal nodes were noted in computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fifty-one patients had multiple enlarged periportal nodes. Concomitantly, enlargement was seen in peripancreatic nodes (n = 14), celiac nodes (n = 14), and mediastinal nodes (n = 11). Twelve of the 64 patients (18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 9.2%-28.4%) had a malignant cause of enlarged periportal lymph nodes: 5 with metastatic carcinoma and 7 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Significant cytologic findings in benign nodes included granulomas (n = 4) and lipogranulomatosis (n = 8).

### What is the effect of MRI with targeted biopsies on the rate of patients discontinuing active surveillance? A reflection of the use of MRI in the PRIAS study [^114v4BfY]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Finally, although our results highlight the importance of confirmatory biopsies, performing biopsies regularly (e.g. annually or every three years) results in many unnecessary biopsy sessions. Because prostate biopsies are bothersome and not without risk, these should be avoided as much as reasonably possible. Recently, reporting data from a large cohort of men followed by an MRI-based AS protocol showed a similar rate of patients discontinuing AS, while fewer prostate biopsy sessions were performed in comparison to reported standard AS cohorts. In addition, personalized schedules using clinical data can reduce the number of biopsy sessions without delaying the detection of disease progression. Personalized schedules, including MRI outcomes, are warranted to further reduce the number of biopsy sessions performed during AS. The high cumulative incidence rates of discontinuation in all groups described in this study emphasize that to reduce overtreatment, clinicians should always try to reduce the detection of insignificant PCa at diagnosis, in which MRI can be helpful.

### ACR appropriateness criteria follow-up of Hodgkin lymphoma [^117LK9jm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The main objectives of follow-up studies after completion of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma are the detection of recurrence for salvage therapy and monitoring for sequelae of treatment. Over time, the focus of follow-up shifts from recurrence detection to monitoring long-term sequelae. Most recurrences are detected through history and physical examination, and the yield from routine imaging studies and blood tests is low. Although routine surveillance with CT scans can detect recurrences not identified by history and physical examination, its ultimate benefit in survival and cost-effectiveness is not well defined. While PET scans are useful for assessing treatment response, their routine use for follow-up is not recommended.

Long-term sequelae of treatment include secondary malignancy, cardiovascular disease, pneumonitis, reproductive dysfunction, and hypothyroidism. Follow-up strategies for these sequelae need to be individualized based on the dose and volume of radiation to these organs, chemotherapy, age at treatment, and predisposing factors for each sequela.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review process includes an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

### Primary lymphatic metastatic spread in testicular cancer occurs ventral to the lumbar vessels [^112GxATb]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

To analyze whether primary metastatic spread occurs behind the lumbar vessels and whether removal is necessary for accurate staging in diagnostic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, because dissection of lymphatic tissue behind the lumbar vessels is a challenging maneuver, we conducted a study involving 139 patients.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine patients with clinical Stage I tumor underwent laparoscopic staging lymph node dissection, which included removal of the lymph nodes behind the lumbar vessels. Sixty-four patients with Stage II testicular cancer were retrospectively examined using computed tomography to determine the localization of the enlarged lymph nodes concerning the lumbar vessels. Based on these results, 49 patients with clinical Stage I underwent laparoscopic lymph node dissection within the same template without dissecting the lymphatic tissue behind the lumbar vessels.

- **Results**: In the first group, 10 of 29 patients had pathologic Stage IIA tumors, with positive nodes exclusively ventral to the lumbar vessels. In group 2, 39 patients with solitary metastatic lesions had enlarged lymph nodes always ventral to the lumbar vessels. Only in 3 of 25 patients with multiple metastases was one enlarged node found behind the lumbar vessels. In group 3, no tumor recurrence either before or behind the lumbar vessels could be found in 46 patients following a mean follow-up of 27.8 months.

- **Conclusions**: Based on these data, we believe that primary lymphatic metastatic spread in testicular cancer always occurs ventral to the lumbar vessels.

### The role of primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in the treatment of stage II seminoma [^113UGVWZ]. Current opinion in urology (2023). High credibility.

Seminoma is the most prevalent type of germ cell tumor, and approximately 20% of men are diagnosed with clinical stage II disease. This stage is characterized by enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes between 1 and 5 cm in size and the absence of further metastasis. The implementation of miR-371a-3p as a diagnostic marker is expected to lead to earlier detection of metachronous stage II disease. The decreasing use of adjuvant carboplatin is expected to increase the number of men with disease recurrence in stage II. The standard of care for treatment involves either chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

The recommended chemotherapy consists of either three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) or four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin (EP). Radiotherapy, consisting of 30–36 Gy delivered to para-aortic and high ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes, is primarily recommended for older patients or those unable to tolerate chemotherapy. Both treatments have a high progression-free survival rate of 87–95% at 5 years; however, they are associated with side effects.

- **Short-term adverse effects**:
	- Cisplatin-based chemotherapy includes nausea, fatigue, cytopenia, and hair loss.

- **Long-term side effects**:
	- Include pulmonary toxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, decreased fertility, hypogonadism, and psychosocial problems.

Large-volume radiotherapy is associated with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting during treatment, and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy increase the risk of secondary malignancies and cardiovascular disease.

### Lack of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy predicts survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^113PCbQJ]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to address the survival prediction in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who have a reported 5-year survival rate ranging from 0% to 20%. The study aims to identify patients who would most benefit from nephrectomy and interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy, optimizing therapeutic outcomes and improving quality of life.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on x-rays and charts of patients treated at the National Institutes of Health Surgery Branch between 1985 and 1996. The focus was on patients with metastatic renal cancer who had not undergone treatment and presented with locoregional and primary tumor involvement. Preoperative computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiological reports, when scans were unavailable, were utilized to estimate the volume of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Operative notes helped evaluate whether all lymphadenopathy was resected, if the disease was left in situ, or if extrarenal resection, such as venacavotomy, was performed. The mean survival rate was calculated from the time of nephrectomy to death or last clinical follow-up. In patients who received IL-2 therapy, the response to treatment was recorded. Mean survival and IL-2 response rates were compared in three separate analyses: patients without preoperative lymphadenopathy detection versus those with at least 1 cm³ retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Patients with detectable lymphadenopathy were categorized into subgroups of all resected, incompletely resected, unresectable, and unknown if all disease was resected.

We have been closely following up with him every month, and his lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly have regressed (ultrasound liver 15.7 cm and spleen 10.8 cm). The axillary nodes have disappeared, and the cervical nodes have been just palpable for 2 months. After a 24-month follow-up without any treatment, the patient is asymptomatic and shows no evidence of recurrence. A lymphocyte apoptosis assay and positron emission tomography (PET) scans were programmed to keep the patient under surveillance.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114kxAdp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The committee acknowledged that most patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy will be confirmed to have sarcoidosis, especially among those presenting with Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome. In asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy cases, sampling will be nondiagnostic in a substantial number of patients, and an alternative diagnosis (e.g. malignancy or infections) will be identified in a few cases; those few cases may have important treatment implications.

Factors to consider when weighing the risks and benefits of biopsy may include regional prevalence of alternative infectious etiologies; patient-specific risk factors for malignancy, infection, or enhanced procedural risk; enlarging lymph nodes; likelihood of obtaining close follow-up; and patient preference. Finally, the availability of a maximally safe, efficacious, and cost-effective means of biopsy procedure is considered. Thus, the committee concluded that the decision to biopsy asymptomatic patients with bilateral hilar adenopathy should be made on a case-by-case basis.

- **Recommendations**:
	- In patients for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for sarcoidosis (e.g. Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, or Heerfordt's syndrome), we suggest NOT sampling lymph nodes (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks: Patients who do not undergo lymph node sampling require close clinical follow-up.
	- For patients presenting with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, we make no recommendations for, or against obtaining a lymph node sample.

### MRI and active surveillance: Thoughts from across the pond [^116h1Vfp]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Studies support the use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) with follow-up biopsies for patients on active surveillance. A National Cancer Institute study compared patients with systematic biopsy, mpMRI-targeted biopsy, and combined biopsy at two years. The study found grade progression was detected in 16%, 26%, and 33% of patients, respectively. At two years, mpMRI-targeted biopsy alone detected over 51% of patients who had grade progression. This suggests that if only a systematic biopsy had been performed, half of all patients with progression would have been missed. For patients followed for four years and six or more years, mpMRI-targeted biopsy alone detected more pathologic progression compared to systematic biopsy alone at these time points. These findings support the use of mpMRI-targeted biopsy at surveillance intervals.

### Unilateral lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination: A practical management plan for radiologists across specialties [^114LyRWG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Reports are rising of patients experiencing unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, visible on diverse imaging examinations, after recent coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. With less than 10% of the US population fully vaccinated, we can prepare now for informed care of patients imaged after recent vaccination. The authors recommend documenting vaccination information (date[s] of vaccination[s], injection site [left or right, arm or thigh], type of vaccine) on intake forms and having this information available to the radiologist at the time of examination interpretation.

These recommendations are based on three key factors: the timing and location of the vaccine injection, clinical context, and imaging findings. The authors report isolated unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, which is ipsilateral to recent (prior six weeks) vaccination, as benign, with no further imaging indicated. Clinical management is recommended, with ultrasound if clinical concern persists six weeks after the final vaccination dose.

In the clinical setting to stage a recent cancer diagnosis or assess response to therapy, the authors encourage prompt recommended imaging and vaccination (possibly in the thigh or contralateral arm according to the location of the known cancer). Management in this clinical context of a cancer diagnosis is tailored to the specific case, ideally with consultation between the oncology treatment team and the radiologist.

The aim of these recommendations is to reduce patient anxiety, provider burden, and costs.

### International working group consensus response evaluation criteria in lymphoma (RECIL 2017) [^114gEYP3]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Progression after an initial response: The Lugano response criteria use nadir tumor measurements as the new baseline for defining PD. Therefore, even a small regrowth of one or more lymph nodes is defined as PD, necessitating the stopping or changing of therapy. This definition may paradoxically result in shorter PFS times for patients who achieve the best response. Unlike patients with relapsed and refractory solid tumors, patients with lymphoma frequently achieve CRs and very good PRs, where the nadir tumor measurement can be very low compared with baseline. To avoid premature termination of therapy due to minor fluctuations or a small increase in tumor measurements from the nadir, especially in patients with no available curative options, patients may be allowed to continue receiving therapy beyond the strict definition of PD as long as (i) the patient does not have prohibitive toxicity and (ii) the patient remains free from significant disease-related symptoms. By doing so, the time for changing or discontinuing therapy can be a more useful measure of determining treatment success compared with PFS. However, if used, this endpoint should be prospectively and clearly stated in the objectives of clinical trials.

Recommendation: After an initial response and in the absence of new lesions, PD is defined as an increase of the nadir sum of diameters by more than 20%. Consistent with RECIST 1.1, patients who achieve a CR (normalization of all lymph node measurements and disappearance of extranodal lesions), at least one previously involved lymph node should be measurable.

### Mr evaluation of normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes [^115VPV3Y]. Clinical radiology (2002). Low credibility.

To establish guidelines for normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph node size at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by correlation with computed tomographic (CT) and lymphangiographic (LAG) data, twelve patients previously studied with pre- and post-LAG CT to determine normal pelvic lymph node size were examined with MRI. All were on surveillance for stage I testicular tumour, with a minimum follow-up of 10 years. Three observers recorded, in a blinded manner, the site, size, and number of nodes in the retroperitoneum and pelvis at 11 sites. The results were validated with previous CT imaging.

Eight hundred and fifteen nodes in 12 patients were visible on the MRI initially, and a further 44 nodes were identified after comparison with post-LAG CT. More nodes were seen on MRI than on CT. The 95th percentile values for maximum short axis diameter (MSAD) of pelvic lymph nodes were common iliac and obturator 4 mm, external and internal iliac 5 mm, and hypogastric 6 mm. In the retroperitoneum, the 95th percentile MSAD values were retrocrural, high left para-aortic, paracaval, and interaortocaval 3 mm, post-caval 4 mm, and low left para-aortic 5 mm.

MRI criteria for normal retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph node size are defined. Adoption of these recommendations may improve the sensitivity of MRI for the detection of nodal metastases.

### Renaissance of radiotherapy in intestinal lymphoma? 10-year efficacy and tolerance in multimodal treatment of 134 patients: Follow-up of two German multicenter consecutive prospective phase II trials [^113shtxP]. The Oncologist (2020). Low credibility.

In technically available CT scans of two patients with indolent duodenal lymphoma, the dose calculation for normal tissues of original 3D CRT was compared with standard involved site radiation therapy (ISRT) 30 Gy for estimation of NTCP in both cases. The planning target volume definition for ISRT was conducted according to guidelines of the International Radiation Oncology Group. Thus, the clinical target volume (CTV) for the two cases was defined as the entire duodenum.

Patients were routinely seen eight weeks after finishing treatment for evaluation of potential radiogenic toxicity and initial response by use of esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD). EGD with topographic mapping biopsy, abdominal ultrasound, hematology laboratory results, and monitoring of liver and renal function was performed at standard follow-up intervals. Response was categorized as one of the following: complete response (CR), complete response uncertain (CRu), partial response, no change, and progressive disease. Relapse was classified as a new manifestation of lymphoma following a time interval of at least one month after the first follow-up–proven CR/CRu. Failure in the primary site of the bowel or regional lymph nodes was categorized as locoregional failure or relapse, and relapse at other sites as distant failure. Early relapses occurred within the first…

### Anterior extraperitoneal approach to laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: a novel technique [^112bxY8q]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

We describe a novel technique of laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection via an anterior extraperitoneal approach.

- **Materials and methods**: With the patient in a modified flank position, an 8 mm incision is made along the lateral border of the ipsilateral rectus muscle at the umbilical level. Initial extraperitoneal space creation is performed at this site through finger dissection and adequately enlarged with a balloon dilator, followed by gas insufflation and placement of four laparoscopic trocars. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, based on a left modified template, is then performed in a completely extraperitoneal manner.

- **Results**: Surgical time was 330 minutes, blood loss was 150 ml, and 58 lymph nodes were removed. Resumption of physical activity and oral intake was achieved on postoperative day 1. Hospital stay was 36 hours. Postoperative narcotic requirement was 28 mg morphine sulfate equivalent. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications, and normal antegrade ejaculation returned postoperatively.

- **Conclusions**: This novel surgical technique is technically feasible and associated with satisfactory clinical outcomes in our preliminary study. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its potential as an alternative to the previously reported transperitoneal and retroperitoneoscopic approaches to laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
