## Question

Axiallary fullness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate "axillary fullness" across different possible causes and how to approach management strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the symptom precisely and establishing risk factors. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and align it with imaging and diagnostic tests. Next, I will examine specific post-breast cancer entities such as axillary web syndrome and lymphedema, including their workup and evidence-based management. Finally, I should address broader non-cancer differentials and outline when to refer, emphasizing multidisciplinary coordination and survivorship planning.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of "axillary fullness" and why precise characterization matters. Clinically it may reflect visible or palpable swelling, a mass effect, skin thickening, or a sensation of heaviness, so I need to clarify onset, duration, pain, erythema, fluctuance, fluctuation with menses, trauma or recent surgery, infection risk, vaccination timing, and cancer history including axillary procedures and radiation, because these elements rapidly narrow the differential and guide imaging choices [^115mNHuj] [^115XQ6jT] [^117GB72o].

> I need to ensure a careful exam and targeted history. On inspection I should look for edema, skin changes, sinus tracts, surgical scars, erythema, and cording, and on palpation I should distinguish lymph nodes from soft tissue masses, noting size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, and whether there are multiple or matted nodes, while remembering that early lymphedema may present subtly with heaviness before measurable volume change, which argues for baseline measurements when risk is present [^116aNV2V] [^111YX6hE] [^117RgDHm].

> Hold on, let me construct the differential and not jump to conclusions. Post-breast cancer surgical causes include lymphedema, axillary web syndrome, hematoma or seroma, infection or abscess, and recurrence, while non-cancer causes include accessory breast tissue, hidradenitis suppurativa, vaccine-related lymphadenopathy, primary infectious lymphadenitis, and neoplasms such as lymphoma or metastatic disease, and the imaging entry point is typically ultrasound with mammography when appropriate, with further workup including FNA or core biopsy as indicated [^1166KQ6K] [^116VAxPf] [^115mNHuj].

> Wait, I should verify how COVID-19 vaccination alters pretest probabilities. Ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy after mRNA vaccination is common and often self-limited, and risk-stratified approaches using vaccination timing and clinical context help avoid unnecessary procedures, though I should confirm that any red flags for malignancy still warrant tissue diagnosis and that breast imaging workflows incorporate these nuances rather than delaying cancer care unnecessarily [^115XQ6jT] [^1145LZuJ] [^1145dXTB].

> Let me consider lymphedema specifically. Risk rises with axillary dissection, axillary radiation, infection, and obesity, and early detection relies on objective measures because symptoms alone can misclassify patients, with relative arm volume increase of 5–10 percent by perometry outperforming bioimpedance for predicting clinically meaningful lymphedema, and baseline arm measurements are recommended to contextualize postoperative changes [^113WRJtR] [^116aNV2V] [^117RgDHm].

> I should double-check thresholds for intervention. RAVI greater than 5 percent is a pragmatic early signal for surveillance or compression in many programs, yet randomized data on prophylactic sleeves are mixed, with some studies showing no reduction in lymphedema incidence versus standard care, so I need to individualize decisions and avoid overtreatment of patients with symptoms but minimal objective change, while ensuring education and prompt referral when criteria are met [^116aNV2V] [^114Ggb4e].

> Next, I will examine axillary web syndrome. AWS typically appears within weeks after axillary surgery, presents with palpable cords and pain on shoulder abduction, and is best confirmed clinically though ultrasound can visualize the cords and exclude alternative masses, and importantly, early physiotherapy with stretching and manual techniques accelerates resolution and improves function, with emerging but limited evidence for percutaneous cord disruption or enzymatic approaches in refractory cases [^114eUZ1i] [^113WpyZS] [^111kcGvW].

> But wait, what if the "fullness" is a discrete mass rather than diffuse swelling? I should confirm whether ultrasound shows a solid mass versus fluid collection, and if solid, proceed to image-guided core needle biopsy to establish diagnosis, keeping in mind that accessory breast tissue can mimic nodes and that postoperative hematomas or seromas may require aspiration if symptomatic or compressive, with MRI reserved for complex cases or when malignancy is suspected [^1166KQ6K] [^116kT88m] [^116VAxPf].

> I need to ensure cancer-specific axillary management principles are aligned. For clinically node-negative early breast cancer, sentinel node biopsy is standard and completion axillary dissection is generally omitted for limited nodal burden, whereas clinically node-positive disease or extensive nodal disease may warrant axillary dissection or targeted axillary dissection with multidisciplinary planning, and regional nodal irradiation decisions should integrate nodal status, surgery performed, and systemic therapy to balance recurrence risk with lymphedema and other toxicities [^111iZtpX] [^112M1h6u] [^1172fEch].

> Hold on, I should verify survivorship elements. Patients benefit from pretreatment baseline arm measurements, education on lymphedema signs and risk reduction, early referral to certified lymphedema therapy when indicated, and structured exercise programs, and in selected high-risk surgical contexts, axillary reverse mapping or immediate lymphatic reconstruction can reduce lymphedema risk without compromising oncologic control when performed by experienced teams [^113WRJtR] [^116SsRnZ] [^113c4Ssf].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic flow to ensure nothing is missed. If the presentation is diffuse swelling with heaviness, I should prioritize lymphedema and obtain objective volume measures, if there are palpable cords with pain on movement, I should diagnose AWS and initiate physiotherapy, if there is a focal mass I should obtain ultrasound and biopsy as indicated, and if there are draining, malodorous, or recurrent inflammatory lesions I should consider hidradenitis suppurativa and manage per guidelines, adjusting for vaccination timing and cancer history throughout [^116aNV2V] [^113WpyZS] [^111kgBX7] [^115XQ6jT].

> Finally, I should confirm referral triggers and coordination. Any new axillary mass in a patient with a history of breast cancer warrants expedited breast imaging and surgical or oncologic evaluation, persistent or unexplained lymphadenopathy beyond about four weeks merits tissue diagnosis, and any signs of infection or necrotizing process require urgent surgical consultation, with all pathways coordinated through a multidisciplinary breast team to optimize staging, treatment sequencing, and survivorship care [^115mNHuj] [^113hHaki] [^1161FQUG].

---

Axillary fullness most commonly reflects **axillary lymphadenopathy** (infectious, inflammatory, or malignant) [^113hHaki], **axillary web syndrome** (post-breast surgery cording) [^114eUZ1i], or **lymphedema** (post-surgical/radiation) [^111YX6hE]. Other causes include accessory breast tissue [^117GB72o], hidradenitis suppurativa [^111kgBX7], lipoma, hematoma/seroma, and vaccine-related nodes [^115XQ6jT]. Evaluation should start with a **focused history and exam**, then use **ultrasound as first-line imaging** [^115mNHuj]; obtain tissue diagnosis when malignancy is suspected [^1166KQ6K]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics for infection, cancer-directed therapy for malignancy, and physiotherapy for AWS [^113WpyZS]; lymphedema care includes compression, exercise, and skin care [^113WRJtR].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

During the **history**, elicit onset and duration, associated symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, pain), recent infections or vaccinations, surgical or radiation history, and personal/family cancer history. On **physical examination**, assess the axilla for node size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, erythema, fluctuance, cording, and skin changes, and palpate for breast masses or other masses [^113hHaki].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound**: First-line imaging for axillary masses; evaluates nodes, cysts, hematomas, and guides biopsy [^115mNHuj] [^115QP4b8].

- **Mammography**: For breast-related pathology or suspected metastasis [^116VAxPf].

- **MRI**: For detailed soft-tissue assessment, especially if ultrasound is inconclusive [^113mKCS5].

- **CT scan**: For systemic disease or deep structures [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory tests

Obtain **CBC** to assess for infection or hematologic malignancy; use inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) to screen for inflammatory or infectious causes; and consider **cultures** when infection is suspected.

---

### Biopsy

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides initial cytology for suspected malignancy [^notfound], whereas **core needle biopsy** offers histology for definitive diagnosis and biomarker profiling.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infectious lymphadenopathy**: Antibiotics; drainage if abscessed.

- **Inflammatory conditions**: Immunosuppressive therapy, disease-specific management.

- **Malignant disease**: Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy.

- **Axillary web syndrome**: Physiotherapy, stretching, manual therapy [^113WpyZS].

- **Lymphedema**: Compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise, skin care [^notfound].

- **Accessory breast tissue**: Surgical excision if symptomatic or cosmetically concerning [^113kfiwb].

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: Antibiotics, anti-inflammatory therapy, surgical management [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause**: infectious and inflammatory conditions generally respond well to treatment, whereas malignant disease carries a guarded prognosis and depends on stage and response to therapy. Complications include **chronic pain**, **limited shoulder mobility** [^115Z8mDp], **lymphedema** [^111YX6hE], infection, and recurrence of underlying disease.

---

Axillary fullness spans infectious, inflammatory, malignant, and post-surgical etiologies; a structured approach — history and exam, ultrasound, and selective biopsy — guides diagnosis and therapy [^1166KQ6K]. Early, **cause-specific management** improves outcomes and reduces morbidity.

The diagnosis of axillary masses can be challenging because various tumors can develop in parts of the axilla other than lymph nodes, even though we frequently encounter axillary masses in daily practice. These lesions include soft tissue masses associated with nontumorous conditions (accessory breast tissue and chronic granulomatous inflammation) and benign and malignant tumorous conditions (lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, lymphangiomas, fibroadenomas, schwannomas, malignant neuroendocrine tumors, and lymph node-associated diseases). In this pictorial essay, we display commonly encountered sonographic findings of various axillary lesions to assist in the differential diagnosis of axillary masses.

Evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes is critical in the management of breast cancer because it is a key predictor of survival outcome. Surgeons must not only be able to perform sentinel lymph node dissection with high accuracy but also understand the implications of the results. Management of clinically node-negative and node-positive cases can vary significantly, as described in this review. With emerging data, management of the axilla in breast cancer will continue to evolve.

### Effectiveness of early physiotherapy to prevent lymphoedema after surgery for breast cancer: randomised, single blinded, clinical trial [^113QFzFx]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

We also found that 12 of the 18 women who developed secondary lymphoedema had axillary web syndrome during the second and third week after surgery. The axillary web syndrome is a known but poorly studied complication of surgery. No study has shown any link between the axillary web syndrome and the onset of secondary lymphoedema. We and otherssuggest that the axillary web syndrome may be a sign of injury to the lymphatic system and it could produce a lymphatic overload as a result of failure of the lymphatic system. This overload, together with other factors, could be responsible for the onset of secondary lymphoedema. When axillary web syndrome was diagnosed in the postoperative period in the intervention group, specific manual lymph drainage strokes were applied, together with progressive active and action assisted shoulder and arm exercises. Manual lymph drainage acted on the pain and inflexibility inherent to the vascular inflammation of the lymphatic vessel; also, if the axillary web syndrome did produce a lymphatic overload, and therefore a possible subclinical oedema, the action of the manual lymph drainage could help with reabsorption. Further research on a possible relation between the axillary web syndrome and the development of secondary lymphoedema in women after breast cancer surgery is needed.

Mastectomy — documentation requirements — states that documentation prior to surgery should include an informed consent encompassing all treatment options and a full discussion of risks and benefits. The operative report should include identifiers, operation name, type of anesthesia, and a succinct description of the clinical setting, indication for surgery, and operative findings, and the report should describe the incisions, type/extent of the mastectomy and axillary procedures, intraoperative pathology assessment (if done), and type of reconstruction (if done). A copy of the operative report should go to all treating physicians and should be part of the permanent medical record, and a plan for follow-up, including discussion of pathology results, wound/drain care, exercises, and consultation with medical/radiation oncology should be part of the overall survivorship program.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women around the world and it is one of the leading causes of death among women in developed countries. It is an important public health issue, since according to the World Health Organization, more than two million new cases are diagnosed annually worldwide, becoming almost a quarter of malignant tumors in females. In the Western world, it has been shown that one in nine to twelve women will suffer from this disease in her lifetime.

Most cases occur in post-menopausal women and the main age at diagnosis is around 60 years.

After the diagnosis of breast cancer, the patient normally undergoes surgical and/or cancer treatment. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy are some of the treatment alternatives which are currently adapted with precision to the type of tumor in order to achieve a better response and survival.

Post-mastectomy lymphedema is one of the best-known post-surgical and post-actinic sequelae after breast cancer, with a prevalence of around 20% of mastectomized women. Lymphedema is the swelling of the upper limb due to a lymph node dissection or axillary radiation therapy. The conservative treatment of this health issue is based on decongestive physical therapy and physiotherapy. The physiotherapy technique with the best results and clinical evidence to treat lymphedema is decongestive physical therapy. Pneumatic multicompartmental pressotherapy helps reduce the feeling of heaviness and stiffness of edema. Pressotherapy can be incorporated into decongestive physical therapy in the treatment of some lymphedema to help reduce edema.

In addition to post-mastectomy lymphedema, the patient undergoing surgery for breast cancer may present axillary web syndrome (AWS) or superficial lymphatic thrombosis. AWS is a surgical sequel after breast cancer independent of lymphedema. They have both different clinical manifestations and evolution times. Lymphedema is a chronic health problem while AWS has a spontaneous evolution time of 3 months. They may appear at the same time or independently. As described by Yeung et al. in their systematic review, AWS can appear in the first 8 weeks after the operation and usually resolves spontaneously within 3 months of its appearance.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^116aNV2V]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymphoedema, (swelling of the arm after surgery to the axilla), causes arm pain, heaviness, swelling and psycho-social morbidity in cancer patients. – Lymphoedema increases risk of infections (cellulitis), and increases fears of cancer recurrence. Although recent trials suggest clinically node negative breast cancers found at surgery with two or fewer positive nodes can avoid further axillary surgery, clinically node positive patients (Stage 2/3) continue to receive axillary clearance (ANC) or radiotherapy after sentinel node biopsy. Both of these predispose to lymphoedema development. Whilst prevention of cancer recurrence is the priority for treatment, it is important to identify which patients are at risk of complications is of considerable importance in order to target ancillary management strategies to prevent those complications.

Although screening for lymphoedema is recommended, the evidence base for diagnosis is limited. There is currently no internationally agreed gold standard definition of what constitutes lymphoedema following ANC.– The incidence of lymphoedema varies according to the definition used, ranging from 21.5% in studies using objective measures to over 50% when using patient reported symptoms.–

Proposed definitions for lymphoedema include: (a) 200 mL limb volume difference,– (b) 10% relative arm volume increase (RAVI), (c) 2.0 cm circumferential difference at any point between arms, and (d)-Dex bioimpedance increase of either 7.5 (2sd) or 10 units or greater. – Although widely accepted as diagnostic criteria, these different definitions are not equivalent. External compression-sleeves are used as treatment for lymphedema but the threshold criterion for identifying patients benefiting from their use is not evidence based.

### Postmastectomy radiotherapy: an American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of Surgical Oncology focused guideline update [^1172fEch]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The consensus of the panel, on the basis of the EBCTCG meta-analysis and the Canadian and EORTC RNI trials, is that both the IMN and supraclavicular-axillary apical areas should generally be treated when PMRT is used. However, certain subgroups may experience limited benefit from such treatment, and as noted, treating the supraclavicular and IMN areas can result in additional toxicities, with pulmonary and cardiac morbidities being particular concerns even with improved radiotherapy techniques. Additional analyses of these trials and other studies are needed to determine which patients should undergo irradiation of only one or neither of these areas.

In general, the full axilla is not irradiated in those who have had ALND, because recurrence in the dissected axilla is rare, and its inclusion may further increase toxicities, particularly lymphedema. However, there are circumstances where full axillary irradiation may be considered, such as when ALND is not performed or after ALND in cases with extensive bulky involvement. There are insufficient data to propose recommendations in this area at present.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy in axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Vzmyp]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Review limitations

This review has limitations that must be considered. One of the main limitations to the interpretation of findings from this review is the risk of bias in the included studies, due to the lack of randomized clinical trials with large sample sizes and good design. The authors of this review considered that most included studies have methods susceptible to bias.

### Imaging axillary lymph nodes in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [^113mKCS5]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The presence of axillary lymph node metastasis in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer carries significant prognostic and management implications. As a result, there is increasing interest to stage accurately the axilla with preoperative imaging to facilitate treatment planning. Currently, the most widespread imaging techniques for the evaluation of the axilla include ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In many settings, the ability to detect axillary lymph nodes containing metastases with imaging and image-guided biopsy can allow surgeons to bypass sentinel lymph node dissection and proceed with full axillary lymph node dissection. However, no imaging modality currently has sufficient negative-predictive value to obviate surgical staging of the axilla if no abnormal lymph nodes are detected. Promising advanced imaging technologies, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance lymphangiography, hold the potential to improve the accuracy of axillary staging and thereby transform management of the axilla in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer.

### Improving the lateral fullness of the upper eyelid [^113t4Kid]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The lateral fullness of the upper eyelid is its convex surface area from the eyebrow to the eyelid crease. Rejuvenation of upper eyelids can be achieved by accenting their fullness. An S-shaped fusiform skin segment is removed from the upper eyelid, with care taken to spare the orbicularis occuli muscle. Approximately 1 mL of fat tissue is excised from the medial compartment by transmuscular incision. The fat is placed in the crease, and the orbicularis occuli muscle is stitched together over the transplanted fat tissue. Imbrication of the orbicularis occuli muscle and insertion of 1 mL of fat tissue into the muscle layers increase the lateral fullness and significantly emphasizes the aesthetic result of upper eyelid blepharoplasty.

### Unilateral axillary adenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination: a multimodality pictorial illustration and review of current guidelines [^116n2pM7]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

We present a multimodality pictorial review of axillary lymphadenopathy in patients recently vaccinated against COVID-19. As the mass vaccination programme continues to be rolled out worldwide in an effort to combat the pandemic, it is important that radiologists consider recent COVID-19 vaccination in the differential diagnosis of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy and are aware of typical appearances across all imaging methods. We review current guidelines on the management of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy in the context of recent COVID-19 vaccination.

### Management of the axilla in women with breast cancer [^111TUBLw]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

The approach towards axillary surgery should be selective and flexible, with its management tailored to patient choice and tumour characteristics, and concordant with local practice guidelines and available resources. Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy has been embraced as a standard of care in many centres around the world and has revolutionised management of the axilla during the past decade. Nonetheless, data for long-term outcomes remain scarce, and there are persistent variations in practice and inconsistencies in methodology. An international perspective has been sought on important issues relating to management of the axilla, which includes not only the indications and techniques for sentinel-lymph-node biopsy, but also lymph-node sampling, axillary-lymph-node dissection, and observation alone. In this Review, we initially present an overview, which focuses on biological models of lymphatic networks within the breast and patterns of tumour dissemination. A set of key questions are posed with preliminary comments from the authors, followed by a series of collective viewpoints from experts within several different countries.

### European society of breast imaging (EUSOBI) guidelines on the management of axillary lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccination: 2023 revision [^1145LZuJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in late December 2020, axillary lymphadenopathy quickly emerged as a common side effect, as confirmed by two studies published in 2022. Moreover, as expected, compared with the incidence of symptomatic axillary lymphadenopathy reported in phase III vaccine trials, there was an even higher incidence of imaging-detected asymptomatic and symptomatic unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, up to 44% of patients who were followed up with breast imaging after vaccination in the largest published study to date which included 1217 patients and up to 78% in a smaller study.

Considering the far-reaching impact of vaccination campaigns (as of June 2023, around 76% of the European population has received at least one dose) and the boosting recommendations that have been issued, this sudden and marked increase of a previously rare differential diagnosis in the management of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy threatened to negatively impact the workflow of breast imaging services, especially in light of potential unnecessary additional imaging and invasive procedures. Thus, the need to quickly provide a solid consensus framework on the management of post-vaccination lymphadenopathy prompted the release, in August 2021, of ten recommendations by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI).

In acknowledgement of the rapidly changing scenario and the lack of data concerning some aspects (e.g. incidence and persistence of axillary lymphadenopathy, and the rates of vaccination-induced versus cancer-induced lymphadenopathy), these 2021 recommendations, as those published by the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI), kept an overall highly conservative approach, even recommending a delay of screening mammograms around COVID-19 vaccinations. However, since then, predictive models developed based on data from the first pandemic waves revealed that delayed or missed screening tests have a negative effect on morbidity and mortality, and the proposed management framework of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy has also allowed accurate discrimination between suspicious and non-suspicious cases. Indeed, current evidence points towards a near-zero risk of subsequent malignant findings in asymptomatic patients who have unilateral lymphadenopathy and no suspicious breast findings (no cancer cases in the largest published series to date of 407 women). Consequently, the potential temporal overlap of COVID-19 vaccinations should no longer be considered a reason to reschedule periodic breast examinations, either in spontaneous or organized screening programs, prioritizing the restoration of normal screening and management of symptomatic patients and the appropriately timed follow-up of those with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy in axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116M6Mqu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The lymphatic thrombus is clinically manifested as a cord that frequently occurs in the armpit, although it can also appear along the upper limb, elbow crease even reaching the first finger. Regarding the diagnosis through imaging tests, nuclear magnetic resonance does not manage to clearly identify the axillary network syndrome. Ultrasound, on the other hand, is the most reliable method as it allows movement to the patient's arm while the diagnostic test is being carried out.

The axillary web syndrome produces pain when abducting and flexing the shoulder with the respective loss of functionality and limitation of mobility of the affected upper limb.

According to the American Cancer Society, radiation therapy is applied 3–8 weeks after the operation if chemotherapy is not required. If chemotherapy is used, it is applied 3–4 weeks after completion. It is usually applied 5 days a week from Monday to Friday.

The limitation of mobility often leads to a delay in the application of this useful tool in the oncological therapeutic arsenal to prevent recurrences. Hence, the need and importance of this review. The main objective is to investigate the different physiotherapy treatments for the AWS and how effective they are.

The frequency of the AWS is not clear from the current publications. It depends on the type of surgical intervention, age, BMI, the appearance of the post-operative seroma, and even breast reconstruction. Thus, being 30% the frequency of the operated patients.

After reviewing the relevant literature, it is aimed to systematically retrieve, appraise, and synthesize findings to management the AWS as well as provide a summary of current evidence to inform subsequent research in this field.

### Sonography of axillary masses: what should be considered other than the lymph nodes? [^116kT88m]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the sonographic findings of various axillary masses other than lymph nodes in correlation with other imaging and pathologic findings.

Methods

From a sonographic database, we collected interesting cases of axillary masses with pathologic or other imaging corroboration from the last 10 years.

Results

Images of various soft tissue masses were reviewed. They included masses associated with accessory breasts (fibroadenomas, hamartomas, fat necrosis, and cancer arising from axillary breasts), other soft tissue masses (lipomas, schwannomas, hemangiomas, fibromatosis, epidermoid cysts, and malignant fibrous histiocytomas), and complications presenting as masses after axillary lymph node dissection (seromas, hematomas, suture granulomas, pseudoaneurysms, and lymphangiectasia).

Conclusions

Awareness of the characteristic sonographic findings of various disease entities that cause axillary masses will help in the correct diagnosis of axillary masses.

### Axillary web syndrome following axillary abscess: clinical diagnosis and management [^1147KchN]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her 50s with a background of sarcoidosis and coeliac disease developed axillary web syndrome (AWS) following an axillary abscess. Initially presenting with a red, tender lesion in the right axilla, she was treated with flucloxacillin, which resolved the abscess. Nine days later, she experienced axillary 'stringing', prompting a diagnosis of AWS. Clinical examination revealed no residual abscess or lump. Management included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and heat therapy combined with stretching and topical massage, leading to symptom improvement. This case highlights AWS as a potential complication of axillary infections and emphasises the critical role of early recognition in primary care. AWS is a self-limited syndrome; however, timely diagnosis and appropriate management can aid in preventing prolonged symptoms, improving patient outcomes and minimising unnecessary investigations and patient stress.

### Pressure ulcers of the thorax after shoulder surgery [^116z2e8n]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Of 896 patients having arthroscopic or combined arthroscopic and open shoulder procedures at our institution during a 10 year period, three sustained severe pressure ulcerations to the dependent, opposite thorax (one after an arthroscopic procedure, two after combined procedures). These three patients had an average age of 35 years (range 18–50 years) and an average operative time of 107 min (range 82–121 min). During surgery, each patient had an axillary roll (a bag of intravenous fluids) between the dependent thorax and the operative table. Immediate postoperative signs and symptoms included severe pain in the thorax of the nonoperative side and areas of full-thickness skin loss, and blistering. Biopsy of the lesion in one patient was consistent with skin pressure ulceration. At a minimum of 10 months of follow up, all three patients had recovered full range of motion and strength without skin grafting or additional surgery. The exact cause of these lesions is unknown, but we speculate that they resulted from a combination of the use of an intravenous fluid bag as an axillary roll, fluid between the skin and the roll, and friction from moving the patient.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^1142p7D7]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of axillary findings

There are a wide variety of imaging findings that can be seen while scanning the axilla. Ranging from skin lesions to abnormal lymphadenopathy to posterior chest wall masses, the astute radiologist must apply their anatomic and medical knowledge to recommend the most appropriate management. Findings typically fall into six categories: skin lesions, congenital and developmental anomalies, infectious, inflammatory and metastatic lymphadenopathy, post-operative changes, benign neoplasms and extra-axillary masses (Table 1). Each of these categories is covered in greater detail below.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for nonmetastatic breast cancer (updated January 2001) [^114mE8q8]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Mastectomy

The standard histological report for a mastectomy sample should state the details of the diagnostic work-up and those factors required to establish the prognosis:
the sites and number of malignant lesions;
the size of the malignant lesions (in mm);
the histological type of the tumour;
the histological grade (specifying the grading system used);
the percentage of DCIS, if present;
the presence of peritumoral vascular invasion;
the presence of extension into the nipple (specifying position and type: intraductal, infiltrating, Paget's disease);
the presence if any of cutaneous or pectoralis major fasciomuscular involvement.

For an invasive tumour, the extent of the invasive component should be given, integrating data from macroscopic and microscopic examinations (recommendation). The overall extent of the lesions (including the invasive component and any associated intraductal component) can be documented (option, expert agreement).

If there is intraductal carcinoma only, the size of the lesions should be assessed by integrating the data from radiological and microscopic examinations (recommendation). If this assessment is difficult (multiple foci, etc.), the number of 'positive' sections out of the total number of sections examined should be given (recommendation, expert agreement).

Axillary dissection

All lymph nodes removed by axillary dissection should undergo full histological examination using a series of macroscopic sections (standard).

The standard histological report for the samples from axillary dissection should specify:
the number of lymph nodes examined;
the number of metastatic lymph nodes, including the presence of micrometastases and if a sentinel node biopsy was performed before axillary dissection (standard);
the number of metastatic lymph nodes with capsular rupture.

Optimal quality for axillary examination requires sampling from at least 10 lymph nodes (standard, level of evidence: B1). This is usually achieved by a level I/II axillary dissection (standard, level of evidence: B1). Surgical guide marks should be made to orientate the sample, at least at one end (standard). The technique of sentinel node biopsy may avoid axillary dissection in 85–90% of patients without lymph node involvement (level of evidence: B1), but cannot be recommended until the results of ongoing studies are available (recommendation, expert agreement). This technique requires input from a multidisciplinary team experienced in the area (recommendation, level of evidence: B1).

### Surgical management of axillary necrotizing fasciitis: a case report [^1161FQUG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Axillary necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is quite rare and requires special management with respect to debridement and delayed surgical reconstruction. A 76-year-old man presented to our emergency department with a 2-day history of high fever, severe left axillary pain and redness. A few hours later, he developed discoloration and hemorrhagic bulla in the axilla, and the redness enlarged on the trunk. Emergency surgical debridement was performed. The blackish necrosis in the axilla was completely excised and the erythematous areas in the chest wall were cut down to the level of the fascia. Split-thickness skin grafts were applied during the second debridement on the 30th day of hospitalization and negative pressure wound therapy was used. Although the grafts took partially, full thickness axillary defects remained. We performed reconstruction with a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap on day 78. This case highlights some of the important surgical considerations in the management of axillary NF.

### Axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients [^1171ggsm]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Axillary lymph node dissection — documentation requirements state that documentation prior to surgery should include an informed consent encompassing all treatment options and a full discussion of risks and benefits; the operative report should include appropriate patient identifiers, the name of the operation, the type of anesthesia, and a succinct description of the clinical setting, indication for surgery, and operative findings; the steps of the operative procedure should be described in detail, noting any complications and how they were managed; the presence of residual disease and the number/location/type of surgical drains should be noted; a copy of the operative report should go to all treating physicians and should be part of the permanent medical record; and a plan for follow-up, including discussion of pathology results, wound care, drain management, and arm exercises should be part of the overall survivorship program.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of the axilla [^115mNHuj]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

This publication reviews the current evidence supporting the imaging approach of the axilla in various scenarios with broad differential diagnosis ranging from inflammatory to malignant etiologies. Controversies on the management of axillary adenopathy results in disagreement on the appropriate axillary imaging tests. Ultrasound is often the appropriate initial imaging test in several clinical scenarios. Clinical information (such as age, physical examinations, risk factors) and concurrent complete breast evaluation with mammogram, tomosynthesis, or MRI impact the type of initial imaging test for the axilla. Several impactful clinical trials demonstrated that selected patient's population can received sentinel lymph node biopsy instead of axillary lymph node dissection with similar overall survival, and axillary lymph node dissection is a safe alternative as the nodal staging procedure for clinically node negative patients or even for some node positive patients with limited nodal tumor burden. This approach is not universally accepted, which adversely affect the type of imaging tests considered appropriate for axilla. This document is focused on the initial imaging of the axilla in various scenarios, with the understanding that concurrent or subsequent additional tests may also be performed for the breast. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Bilateral, tender axillary nodules [^117GB72o]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most likely diagnosis of the axillary nodules?
A. HS
B. Lymphadenopathy
C. Ectopic breast tissue (EBT)
D. EIC
E. Lipoma

Answer:
A. HS – Incorrect. HS may present with tender nodules in the axillae and inguinal region. HS typically has satellite lesions that are also inflamed and occasionally fluctuant, which our patient lacks. Other diagnoses should be considered if axillary nodules are resistant to appropriate medical management for HS.
B. Lymphadenopathy – Incorrect. Our patient lacks the signs or symptoms of an underlying infection or malignancy inducing bilaterally axillary lymphadenopathy. Infectious lymphadenopathy presents as a tender, soft, and mobile mass. Malignant lymphadenopathy presents as a nontender, hard, fixed mass. Furthermore, in our patient, a clinical breast examination did not reveal any abnormalities and an ultrasound of the breasts confirmed the absence of concerning lesions.
C. EBT – Correct. EBT may present with bilateral solitary, tender nodules that typically appear after puberty or first pregnancy. This may fluctuate in size throughout the menstrual cycle. EBT arises from a failure of regression of the breast tissue along the embryologic mammary ridge outside of the pectoral region.EBT is susceptible to the same physiologic and pathologic seen in normal breast tissue. Our patient's biopsy report read, "accessory breast tissue with apocrine metaplasia and columnar change". Notably, there has been one other case report of EBT being misdiagnosed as HS. In that case, the misdiagnosis was recognized during incision and drainage, where thin white fluid was noted rather than the purulent drainage expected with HS.
D. EIC – Incorrect. EICs are typically nontender, do not have tenderness associated with menses, and may have a dark-colored punctum at the apex. It would also be atypical for EICs to occur in bilateral axillae.
E. Lipoma – Incorrect. Lipomas present as slow-growing, round, and soft masses that are not tender. It would be atypical for lipomas to present in bilateral axillae.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^114uqS5P]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms (swelling (p < 0.001), heaviness (p = 0.001)) at 24 months were associated with larger increases (from 6 to 24 months) in the exact RAVI but not exact BIS values (Table S1).

Arm swelling category by 6 months predicted lymphoedema by 24 months (p < 0.001). Women who developed a RAVI of ≥ 5 to < 10% developed lymphoedema in 29% of cases, whereas a RAVI < 3% by 6 months had a 6% lymphoedema rate by 24 months (Table 3). BIS 5–10 increase by 6 months did not predict lymphoedema at 24 months (Table 3).

Table 3
Comparison of Multifrequency Bioimpedance (BIS) and RAVI values by 6 months against subsequent lymphoedema by 24 months.

NS non-significant.

a Non-significant: note RAVI changes predicted subsequent lymphoedema but BIS changes did not.

Sensitivity and specificity of BIS and RAVI were compared to the 221 patients with compression-sleeve application (clinical surrogate for lymphoedema) between 3 and 24 months. BIS identified high false positive numbers of patients with a 'lymphoedema' diagnosis whether the primary endpoint of RAVI > 10% or compression-sleeve application was used. Whilst the NPV for both BIS and RAVI > 10% were similar, the PPV was higher at all timepoints for RAVI > 10% because of the lower number of false positive results (between 6 and 24 months: (RAVI PPV 59%, 95% CI: 50–66% compared to BIS PPV 34%, 95% CI: 29–39%). Arm swelling was reported by 65.8% patients using the LBCQby 24 months (Fig. 1).

### Protocol to improve quality of life, functionality, and exercise capacity in patients with axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^114Pd4No]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, there are two general questions about the state of health and quality of life that score from 1 to 7, the highest value being the best state of health and quality of life. The vast majority of questions refer to the previous week.

Sample size: To determine the sample size for comparing two means, we aimed to detect a clinically meaningful difference in healing time for AWS, measured in days, between intervention and control group. Both current literature and expert input agreed that a difference of at least 15 days would be clinically relevant. Given that healing time is a quantitative outcome, we chose a comparison of means between the two groups as the basis for the sample size calculation.

For this study, we set a confidence level of 95% (α = 0.05) and a statistical power of 90% (β = 0.1) while accounting for an anticipated loss to follow-up of 20%. Based on a standard deviation of 14 days in healing time for standard treatments, we used the pwr package in R to calculate the necessary sample size. To detect a difference of 15 days or more between groups with the specified confidence and power, 18 subjects per group were required. Adjusting for the potential 20% follow-up loss, the total sample size needed was determined to be 46 participants.
Randomization allocation: Before commencing the study, Excel program "randomization" tool was used to provide an allocation sequence list for patients from 1 to 46. The position on the list would be assigned on arrival order. As patients arrived at the clinic for the first evaluation, they were informed about the study. If they agreed to participate, and after giving written consent, their physiotherapist would enroll the patient to either control or intervention group, according to the previously mentioned Excel list.
Masking: Blinding could not be performed due to the nature of the intervention because participants can clearly see whether they are being intervened at the health center by the specialist physiotherapist or not, as the control group patients solely perform the activities required by the specialist physiotherapist at home without in-person physiotherapy treatment. Physiotherapy studies often face challenges in masking both the intervention and the therapist.
Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics were computed as means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes, and medians with interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed data. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for categorical outcomes. Cohort homogeneity at baseline was assessed by comparing all measured outcomes between patient groups using nonparametric Wilcoxon tests. p -values were adjusted using the FDR method to control for type I error (Table 1).

### Lymph node imaging in patients with primary breast cancer: concurrent diagnostic tools [^113yKXYs]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Metastatic Spread and the Need for Axillary Treatment

Metastasis is a challenging clinical problem, considered the leading cause of death in breast cancer. Lymph nodes are the first regional site of metastasis and nodal disease is critical for staging and prognosis and for predicting increased mortality in many cancer types including the breast. Once a migratory cell has detached from the tumor, it may intravasate into blood vessels or lymphatics. Either route of dissemination can lead to venous circulation, as lymphatics drain into blood, most commonly through the left lymphatic duct (thoracic duct) or the right lymphatic duct, and then subsequently into the subclavian veins 16. However, although the potential of one detached cell to metastasize is limitless, only very few metastases eventually develop. Tumor cells forming metastases either have the autonomous characteristics while still in the primary tumor to metastasize or will acquire the needed changes induced by the environmental conditions. The potential to metastasize is not solely dependent on tumor cell traits but also modulated by the host cells, in particular platelets and bone marrow–derived cells. Tumors almost invariably invade lymph nodes in sequence, starting with the nearest (sentinel or draining) node, followed by increasingly distal ones 5.

### Review of axillary web syndrome: what the radiologist should know [^114eUZ1i]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Axillary web syndrome is common after axillary surgery, frequently affecting breast cancer patients. In this condition, patients develop one or more linear bands of firm tissue, also known as "cords", in the axilla and arm, associated with pain and limited range of motion of the shoulder and arm. Radiologists may encounter this syndrome in patients referred for axillary or upper extremity ultrasound, and should be aware of the physical examination and ultrasound findings for accurate diagnosis. However, there are currently limited articles about this syndrome published in radiology journals, suggesting that radiologists may be unaware of this entity. In this work, axillary web syndrome will be discussed, including background knowledge, incidence, clinical presentation, possible etiology, and ultrasound appearance.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^1166KQ6K]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Knowledge of the normal axillary anatomy aids in determining the underlying aetiology of an axillary mass. The differential diagnosis of an axillary mass is broad, including skin lesions, infections, haematoma, lymphadenopathy (hyperplastic, inflammatory, neoplastic or metastatic), accessory breast tissue, fibroadenoma, fibrocystic change, post-operative fluid collections, primary breast cancer and intramuscular neoplasms. For most cases, imaging evaluation entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound. If intervention is warranted, FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and for guiding the management of an axillary mass.

### Physiotherapy protocol to reduce the evolution time of axillary web syndrome in women post-breast cancer surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^112m41DH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with more than 2 million new cases in 2020.

Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) was described as a visible and palpable network of cords in the skin of the axillary cavity, tensed by shoulder abduction following surgery for breast cancer, significantly, limiting the function of the ipsilateral upper limb (UL) and causing pain. It is also known as "cording", "axillary string", "vascular string", "lymphatic cord", "fibrous banding", or "Mondor's disease".

The frequency of AWS is highly variable. Yeung's systematic review reports ranges from 0.6% to 85.4% after surgical intervention for breast cancer. AWS is an early complication of axillary surgery for breast cancer, which is more common than infection, seroma, or lymphedema.

AWS causes pain, reduces shoulder mobility and functionality, and involves a decrease in quality of life. These may affect radiotherapy treatment, leading to delays or even loss of treatment. If sustained over time, it can lead to shoulder rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, and myofascial pain syndrome.

Axillary cords are always present in the axilla and may extend down into the medial ipsilateral arm. These cords frequently extend across the antecubital fossa and into the forearm. They occasionally may extend to the radial aspect of the wrist and into the base of the thumb.

AWS usually appears between weeks 8–12 after surgery. It usually resolves by itself within 3–4 months after surgery, but there is evidence of multiple cases persisting up to 24 months. There are also cases of late recurrence after disappearance.

### Management of the axilla in early-stage breast cancer: Ontario health (cancer care Ontario) and ASCO guideline [^112M1h6u]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO/Ontario Health axillary management guideline — scope and evidence basis provides recommendations on "the best strategies for the management and on the best timing and treatment (surgical and radiotherapeutic) of the axilla" in early-stage breast cancer, developed by a Working Group and Expert Panel via a systematic review. The guideline "endorsed two recommendations of the ASCO 2017 guideline for the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy" and expands to radiotherapy interventions, timing of staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and mapping modalities; its evidentiary base included "seven high-quality systematic reviews, 54 unique studies, and 65 corollary trials". Recommendations are issued across objectives including which patients require axillary staging, whether further axillary treatment is indicated for women without NAC who are "sentinel lymph node–negative at diagnosis", which axillary strategy applies when such women are "pathologically sentinel lymph node–positive at diagnosis (after a clinically node-negative presentation)", what axillary treatment and timing are indicated when NAC is used, and the best methods "for identifying sentinel nodes".

### Esterified estrogens, methyltestosterone (Esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone full strength) [^1129oQ2u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Androgens

Endogenous androgens are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as beard, pubic, chest and axillary hair, laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature, and fat distribution. Drugs in this class also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein. Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietic stimulating factor.

Androgen Pharmacokinetics

Testosterone given orally is metabolized by the gut and 44 percent is cleared by the liver in the first pass. Oral doses as high as 400 mg per day are needed to achieve clinically effective blood levels for full replacement therapy. The synthetic androgens (methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone) are less extensively metabolized by the liver and have longer half-lives. They are more suitable than testosterone for oral administration.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^111fMExD]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Screening can be used with the aim of detecting subclinical lymphoedema to allow early intervention to try to reduce the risk of clinical lymphoedema developing. In addition, screening can be used with the aim of detecting early clinical lymphoedema so that early intervention can be introduced to reduce the risks of progression of the swelling and of the development of the main complication of cellulitis. Anecdotal clinical experience internationally confirms that intervention with compression garments in early lymphoedema reduces the risk of the development of more severe swelling. However, as stated above, evidence that early intervention in subclinical lymphoedema reduces the risk of developing lymphoedema is lacking.

Increasingly cancer patients are encouraged to improve their survivorship by self-management. Our approach was to combine factors to produce a novel scoring index to allow identification of patients at risk of the condition who may benefit from lymphoedema surveillance. Early arm swelling after surgery (RAVI at 1 month or indeed at 6 months) was a good predictor of subsequent lymphoedema and the scores were weighted for each factor according to the risk of subsequent lymphoedema. This index, if validated, would allow clinicians to give extra attention to support at risk patients following the post-operative visit.

One of the challenges with this approach is that even in the low risk group, there is an 11% chance of developing lymphoedema by 36 months and, therefore, the risk cannot be ignored altogether. A possible solution is that patients in the low risk group can be informed of signs and symptoms of lymphoedema, given written advice, taught simple lymphatic massage, encouraged to be vigilant about self-screening using symptoms or signs and to self-refer to a lymphoedema clinic if they develop any new symptoms.

Alternatively, if resources permit, continued surveillance of this group could take place. However, patients may find continued attendance at the lymphoedema clinic at 3 or 6 monthly intervals, anxiety provoking. In our study many failed to attend beyond 2 years, as they were attending a separate annual cancer clinic.

Lymphedema and treatment toxicities — breast cancer–related lymphedema is an unpredictable occurrence that can happen years after axillary surgery and is associated with risk of infection, restricted mobility, significant financial toxicity, and decreased QoL and psychosocial well-being. Breast RT is related to acute and late toxicities including RT dermatitis, fatigue, cardiotoxicity, and lymphedema. In the SOUND and INSEMA trials, patients in the SLNB group, compared to the no axillary surgery group, showed significantly and clinically relevant breast and arm symptoms including pain, arm swelling, and impaired mobility and disability.

Post-operative surveillance is also advocated to detect early clinical lymphoedema so that early intervention to reduce the risk of progression and complications such as cellulitis can be carried out. To facilitate this a standardised objective method of diagnosing early lymphoedema is required.

In this prospective multicentre study, we sought to (1) compare five methods for diagnosis of lymphoedema, (2) identify which patients were at risk of developing lymphoedema, (3) develop a criterion score to identify patients who would benefit from compression sleeve application and (4) determine the relationship between lymphoedema diagnosis and quality-of-life.

Quality-of-life

The minimum clinically important difference in Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is 5 points. Patients with lymphoedema at 6 (12, 18 and 24) months had lower FACT-B, TOI and ARM subscale scores (RAVI ≥ 10%: p = 0.027, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively, Tables S1a, b and S2). At all timepoints, a higher percentage of patients reporting swelling or heaviness symptoms was found for those with lymphoedema (p < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis showed lymphoedema (by 12 months) p = 0.002, high BMI p < 0.001, and current smoking p = 0.036 all independently reduced TOI by 5 points (Table S2).

After compression-sleeve application (between 3 and 24 months), patient quality-of-life scores increased (Fig. S1b) (p < 0.001 for TOI, p = 0.001 for Total FACT-B, and ARM subscales Tables S3 and S4). The Estimated Marginal Mean (EMM) for TOI at baseline was 66.7 (95% CI: 64.7–68.6), 62.7 (95% CI: 60.6–64.7) before sleeve application and 66.8 (95% CI: 64.3–69.3) at 36 months. Quality-of-life following sleeve application increased for patients with a RAVI > 5% (N = 116), TOI increased from 62.4 (95% CI: 59.6–65.1) to 68.0 (95% CI: 65.2–70.7), whereas for those patients with RAVI < 5% (N = 86) TOI remained the same 65.3 (95% CI: 61.7–68.6) and 66.8 (95% CI: 63.1–70.1) Interaction: p = 0.022: Table S2).

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^1145cSvF]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Perometry is a standardised infrared optoelectronic technology used to detect and quantify limb volume changes. – In early stages of lymphoedema development, the swelling is believed to be due mainly to extracellular fluid accumulation (often considered 'subclinical'). Multi-frequency bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a non-invasive technique to measure extracellular fluid, which involves passing an extremely small alternating electric current through the body and measuring the impedance (or resistance) to the flow of this current. – BIS compares quantitatively the amount of extracellular fluid in the 'at risk' limb (i.e. operated side) with the un-operated side. A three-standard deviation (sd) increase in BIS is the criterion to diagnose lymphoedema (-Dex > 10. Impedimed) although a 2sd deviation (-Dex > 7.5) is also used.

A small study suggested BIS detects lymphoedema development up to 10 months before arm volume changes with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100%, but subsequent studies have found limited correlation with lymphoedema development after surgery.BIS is used in American centres for early detection of lymphoedema after surgery to inform treatment in women after axillary surgery.

Conventional advice is arm swelling at 3 months post-surgery does not portend chronic swelling and is treated conservatively. Arm measurements are not routine practice in Europe prior to ANC, but prospective studies have demonstrated that RAVI of ≥ 5% identifies increased risk of subsequent lymphoedema and is a suitable threshold for considering early intervention.

Several American guidelines (National Lymphoedema Network Guidelines) recommend screening for lymphoedema. However, the evidence base for diagnosis (and screening) is limited. –, An observational study of 43 women developing RAVI > 3% after surgery, and prescribed graduated compression sleeves for a duration of 4.4 weeks, observed arm volume reductions of 4.1% using the sleeve. This reduction was maintained over an average follow-up period of 4.8 months after discontinuing the intervention. Despite limited follow-up and intervention periods, this small study has been cited to argue for pre-operative baseline measurements and led internationally to lymphoedema guidelines recommending early intervention in subclinical lymphoedema with compression garments to prevent the subsequent development of clinical lymphoedema. The optimal threshold and diagnostic tool, for intervention to prevent progression to lymphoedema however remains unclear.

Axillary reverse mapping — Where expertise is available and resources allow, axillary reverse mapping is an option for patients indicated for axillary lymph node dissection to reduce risks of chronic breast cancer related lymphedema, but axillary reverse mapping should not be offered in patients at high risk of axillary recurrence (e.g., multiple positive lymph nodes, T4 primary).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^115qgNr4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Paget disease of the breast — axillary lymph node (ALN) staging is tailored to disease context. ALN staging is not necessary when breast-conserving therapy is used to treat Paget disease with underlying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) without evidence of invasive cancer following clinical examination, imaging evaluation, and full-thickness skin biopsy of the involved NAC. In the presence of an underlying invasive breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS), axillary surgery should be performed according to the Considerations for Surgical Axillary Staging outlined in the NCCN Guidelines algorithm. In cases treated by total mastectomy, axillary staging is recommended for patients with invasive disease and should also be considered for patients with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive disease, because the final pathology may reveal an invasive cancer in the mastectomy specimen and the mastectomy precludes subsequent sentinel node biopsy. Two retrospective studies have provided evidence for a high degree of accuracy in the identification of the sentinel node(s) in patients with Paget disease.

### Subjective nasal fullness and objective congestion [^114KyRYa]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

How well do subjective descriptions of the sensation of nasal closure or absence of nasal patency agree with objective measures of nasal geometry and airflow? Problems with this concept begin with terminology. "Congestion" has been applied to both the subjective and objective measures. Therefore, the term "fullness" will be used to describe perceptions of nasal mucosal heaviness or blockage that subjects with allergic rhinitis articulate. "Congestion" will refer to the objective measures used to assess patency. Sensations attributed to the nasal mucosa are highly integrated interpretations summed from multiple subsets of nociceptive and other neurons. Activation of sensor systems is required to depolarize afferent neurons. These sensors and other receptor proteins can be modulated by inflammation as part of the neural plasticity that leads to increased sensitivity to nasal stimuli. This plasticity and hyperalgesia may extend from the afferent neuron to spinal cord dorsal horn synapses, and regulatory and analytical regions of the brainstem and cerebrum. Although glandular hypersecretion can deliver obstructing material into the nasal cavities, the dilation of deep venous sinusoids is the strongest factor regulating nasal airspace volumes. There is a long history of attempts to correlate subjective sensations to objective measurements such as airflow resistance (rhinomanometry), nasal wall geometry (acoustic rhinometry), and peak nasal inspiratory flow. The medical evidence supporting each method has been analyzed on the basis of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. These results provide a starting point for linking the outcomes of pathophysiological processes with a patient's psychometrically calibrated sensation of airflow.

Our analysis for locally advanced, operable breast cancer during 2010–2021 showed decreasing incidence of N2–3 breast cancer for all tumor types. An increase in T3–4N0–1M0 was observed for HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors, which may partially be explained by modest increases in N0–1M0(Any T) cancers in this subtype. Incidence of T3–4N0–1M0 disease was stable or decreasing for other receptor-based breast cancer subtypes over our study period. These locally advanced, operable disease presentations, particularly HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, continue to be observed with high frequency in the clinic. Our analysis also showed that ILC was more common in the high anatomic disease burden groups than all diagnoses combined, not only in HR-positive/HER2-negative cancers but across all breast cancer subtypes. Collectively, these data provide contemporary information on occurrence of locally advanced, operable breast cancer.

Our finding of a temporal decrease in disease presentations with high nodal burden may be reflective of the surgical trials challenging the benefit of full axillary nodal dissection. In 2011, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial and subsequently the After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery? (AMAROS) trial in 2014 reported no benefit to axillary lymph node dissection in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes at surgery who were clinically node negative at presentation. More recently, the Sentinel Node Negative Breast Cancer with Macrometastasis (SENOMAC) trial, which addressed some limitations from the aforementioned trials (including early closure, large non-inferiority margin, uncertain nodal irradiation volumes, and low event rates), showed similar findings. Additionally, recent large cohort studies have observed decreasing rates of axillary lymph node dissection. Practice changes related to these findings bring about a new clinical question: What is the optimal medical management of patients without full axillary staging information? Additionally, based on our findings a sizeable population appears to still undergo complete axillary lymph node evaluation, perhaps including those with T3–4 tumors or those with clinically apparent axillary lymph nodes at presentation who were generally not included in the aforementioned trials.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy in axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WpyZS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise and stretching are the most effective therapies within the field of physiotherapy for the rehabilitation of axillary web syndrome. They restore ROM faster, reduce pain, improve quality of life, and reduce disabilities. Manual therapy, scar massage, and myofascial release could help improve outcomes but with worse results.

There is a clear need for further rigorous research in this field. Well-designed, randomized studies with larger sample sizes are needed to provide more conclusive data to inform best practice for the management of axillary web syndrome in rehabilitation treatments.

### Axillary osmidrosis: past, present, and future [^1179Tpac]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Axillary osmidrosis is characterized by offensive odor resulting from bacterial decomposition of apocrine secretions in the axillae, and individuals with axillary osmidrosis suffer detrimental effects to their psychosocial functioning. We searched the literature in January 2019 for all English-language publications discussing axillary osmidrosis to identify previous reports, present trends, and emerging treatments. Studies were listed chronologically by the country of the first author's institution. Publications were also classified regarding the study type (literature review), pathophysiology, and treatments. We identified 133 publications on axillary osmidrosis, and of these, 120 were from East-Asian countries. Before 1990, there were only 9 publications, but after 2000, publications increased in number. One hundred of 133 reports discussed treatment, namely, 39 reports on suction curettage, 28 reports on open surgery, and 8 reports on subdermal laser. Other studies focused on the pathophysiology of axillary osmidrosis. This literature review revealed unique trends in the identified studies. Because control of axillary odor is a universal subject, the etiology and pathophysiology of axillary osmidrosis have been studied throughout the world and are clearly described. However, almost all studies of surgical treatments have been performed in East-Asian countries. After the year 2000, various surgical and nonsurgical treatments, namely, laser therapy and suction curettage, have been attempted. Emerging treatments for axillary osmidrosis include ethanol injections, microwave therapy, and microneedle radiofrequency technologies; however, further studies of these treatments are needed.

### Axillary web syndrome assessment using a self-assessment questionnaire: a prospective cohort study [^112XcbDC]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical procedure for breast cancer is not without its side effects and one such side effect is axillary web syndrome (AWS), characterized by palpable fibrotic-like cords in the operated arm. As physical evaluation is the only gold standard method used, our study aims to assess the incidence and early detection of AWS with a self-assessment questionnaire.

Methods

From July 2013 to July 2014, 370 breast cancer patients were enrolled. AWS incidence was 51.1%, with 94.1% onset in the first 4 weeks after surgery; 43.5% of the patients did not recover in the first 8 weeks. Univariate analysis showed that BMI (P < 0.001), age (P < 0.001), educational level (P = 0.01), and exercise frequency in the eighth week of follow-up (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the AWS detection, and multivariate analyses confirmed that younger patients (age < 50) have significantly higher AWS detection (OR = 2.38 (95%CI 1.53, 3.71) and that BMI is associated with AWS, with normal weight patients (BMI ≤ 25) having a significantly greater AWS detection with an odds ratio of 2.11 (95%CI 1.33, 3.36).

Conclusion

Our findings indicated that the incidence of AWS is high in breast cancer patients, particularly in the first month after surgery. Not all patients achieved recovery during our 8 week follow-up, suggesting that evaluation and treatment should be longer. Double AWS detection was found for patients who were younger (age < 50) and with normal weight.

### Bilateral, tender axillary nodules [^113uqacQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 36-year-old woman presented with bilateral, nondraining, solitary axillary nodules that were initially noticed after her first pregnancy (Fig 1). She reported the nodules to be tender, nonfluctuant, and without drainage. In addition to the axillary nodules, she had multiple draining lesions and sinus tracts in her right groin. She was initially treated for presumed hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with 2 months of oral doxycycline, topical clindamycin, and 10% benzoyl peroxide wash and reported mild improvement of the groin lesions but denied improvement of the axillary lesions. Despite the escalation of appropriate medical management for HS with topical 5% dapsone and trials of spironolactone and adalimumab, she reported continued tenderness of the axillary nodules, most prominently around her menses. She ultimately underwent surgical excision of the groin lesions, which were proven to be HS histopathologically, and punch biopsy of one of the axillary nodules to establish the diagnosis.

Question 1: What was seen on pathology of the axillary nodules?
A. Follicular occlusion and rupture of pilosebaceous unit with acute inflammatory response
B. Proliferation of mature adipocytes
C. Keratin debris lined with stratified squamous epithelium
D. Terminal ductal lobular units
E. Dense connective tissue containing well-developed follicles and plasma cells within medullary cords

Answer:
A. Follicular occlusion and rupture of pilosebaceous unit with acute inflammatory response – Incorrect. This would be the histopathologic finding for HS.
B. Proliferation of mature adipocytes – Incorrect. This would be the histopathologic finding for a lipoma.
C. Keratin debris lined with stratified squamous epithelium – Incorrect. This would be the histopathologic finding for an epidermal inclusion cyst (EIC).
D. Terminal ductal lobular units – Correct. This is the histopathologic finding for the correct diagnosis (Fig 2).
E. Dense connective tissue containing well-developed follicles and plasma cells within medullary cords – Incorrect. This would be the pathology finding for a normal lymph node.

The differential diagnosis for a solitary axillary mass is extensive. Based on the initial history and physical examination of the patient presented in this case report, the diagnosis of suppurative hidradenitis was incorrectly reached. This subjected her to a surgical procedure that was not indicated for the actual diagnosis of ectopic axillary breast tissue. This article reviews the workup for a solitary axillary mass and discusses multiple aspects of ectopic breast tissue.

### Axillary node interventions in breast cancer: a systematic review [^1172ZrL5]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Recent data from clinical trials have challenged traditional thinking about axillary surgery in patients with breast cancer.

Objectives

To summarize evidence regarding the role of axillary interventions (surgical and nonsurgical) in breast cancer treatment and to review the association of these axillary interventions with recurrence of axillary node metastases, mortality, and morbidity outcomes in patients with breast cancer.

Evidence Review

Ovid MEDLINE (1946-July 2013), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005-July 2013), Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (1994-July 2013), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1989-July 2013) were searched for publications on axillary interventions in breast cancer. Clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses with at least 2-year follow-up were included. A total of 1070 publications were reviewed, 17 of which met final inclusion criteria.

Findings

Partial mastectomy followed by whole breast radiation is breast-conserving therapy. For women with no suspicious, palpable axillary nodes who undergo breast-conserving therapy, there is little evidence of benefit from surgical complete axillary node dissection compared with sentinel node biopsy alone. Complete axillary node dissection in patients with no palpable lymph nodes, compared with sentinel node biopsy, provides no survival benefit and is associated with a 1% to 3% reduction in recurrence of axillary lymph node metastases, but is associated with a 14% risk of lymphedema. Surgical axillary staging via sentinel node biopsy in patients with benign axillary nodes on radiological and clinical examination helps to inform decisions regarding adjuvant systemic and radiation therapy. Patients and physicians should tailor axillary lymph node interventions to maximize regional disease control and minimize morbidity. Complete axillary lymph node dissection is indicated in patients who present with palpable or needle biopsy-proven axillary metastases, patients with positive sentinel nodes undergoing mastectomy (who do not, as a standard, receive adjuvant radiation), patients with more than 3 positive sentinel nodes undergoing breast-conserving therapy, and patients not meeting eligibility criteria for recent trials establishing the safety of sentinel node biopsy alone in patients with breast cancer and metastases in their sentinel nodes.

Conclusion and Relevance

Available evidence suggests that axillary node dissection is associated with more harm than benefit in women undergoing breast-conserving therapy who do not have palpable, suspicious lymph nodes, who have tumors 3.0 cm or smaller, and who have 3 or fewer positive nodes on sentinel node biopsy.

### Esterified estrogens, methyltestosterone (Esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone full strength) [^112WHPuc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Estrogens

Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. They promote growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, and enlargement of the breasts. Indirectly, they contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal growth spurt and its termination, growth of axillary and pubic hair, and pigmentation of the nipples and genitals. Decline of estrogenic activity at the end of the menstrual cycle can bring on menstruation, although the cessation of progesterone secretion is the most important factor in the mature ovulatory cycle. However, in the preovulatory or nonovulatory cycle, estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset of menstruation. Estrogens also affect the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The pharmacologic effects of esterified estrogens are similar to those of endogenous estrogens. They are soluble in water and are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

In responsive tissues (female genital organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) estrogens enter the cell and are transported into the nucleus. As a result of estrogen action, specific RNA and protein synthesis occurs.

Estrogen Pharmacokinetics

Metabolism and inactivation occur primarily in the liver. Some estrogens are excreted into the bile; however they are reabsorbed from the intestine and returned to the liver through the portal venous system. Water soluble esterified estrogens are strongly acidic and are ionized in body fluids, which favor excretion through the kidneys since tubular reabsorption is minimal.

### Axillary management: how much is too much? [^111dH7BQ]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in U.S. women affecting 1 in 8 women and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death. In 2022, 287,850 invasive cancers and 51,400 non-invasive (in situ) cancers were diagnosed, including 2710 cases in men. Breast cancer survival is high with five-year survival around 90%. However, five-year survival remains lower for African American women (78%) compared to White counterparts (92%). Despite the disparities in outcomes, all groups are experiencing improvement in breast cancer survival due to advancements in management across the modalities of surgery, radiation, and medical therapies. As a result, the impact of axillary management on breast cancer survival has been evaluated.

### Is there a need for axillary dissection in breast cancer? [^117583if]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

The involvement of axillary nodes remains a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer. However, management has changed from complete surgical staging to sentinel lymph node biopsies. Although little controversy exists regarding patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsies, some remains regarding what to do with patients with small volume of axillary disease. This article focuses on the examination of recent evidence in management of the axilla. It focuses on both the prognostic and therapeutic information gleaned from isolated tumor cells and micrometastatic disease and on the use of completion axillary lymph node dissections or axillary radiation in preventing regional recurrence.

### Axillary management: how much is too much? [^1153gMUz]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

To review the current management of the axilla in breast cancer.

Recent Findings

Axillary dissection is no longer indicated in patients with clinically node-negative axilla with 1–2 positive sentinel lymph nodes following upfront surgery or in patients with clinically node-negative axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Summary

Breast cancer has evolved away from routine axillary clearance to the less invasive sentinel lymph node biopsy to now complete omission of axillary sampling in select patients. We will review the most salient evidence that has shaped these practice changes over the last three decades. Current practice controversies are especially relevant for elderly populations and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Ongoing clinical trials will provide data to further guide breast cancer surgical management.

### Protocol to improve quality of life, functionality, and exercise capacity in patients with axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^112C6xoF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To improve functionality, quality of life, and exercise capacity in women who have undergone breast cancer surgery and suffer AWS.

Hypothese

With the application of this physiotherapy treatment, functionality, quality of life, and exercise capacity are sought to be improved significantly in patients suffering from AWS in comparison to current strategies.

### Physiotherapy protocol to reduce the evolution time of axillary web syndrome in women post-breast cancer surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^112JJ5RD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations:

Our study registered good adherence to the scheduled activity in each group with almost no loss of recruited patients in either group. The physiotherapist ensured correct adherence to the exercises.
Considering the good results in the intervention group in all outcomes from the first follow-up on day 30 after the first examination, this physiotherapy technique could become an effective and quick treatment for AWS.
Our study was single center, so its external validity may be questioned. It would be highly advisable to perform this study as multi center to be able to reach a wider spectrum of target population.
Blinding of the intervention could not be carried out due to the nature of the intervention. Physiotherapy studies often face this challenge as it is difficult for the patient to be unaware of the group they belong to.

*Future Directions

Ideally, future studies should include imaging tests, such as Indocyanine Green Lymphography or Lymphoscintigraphic imaging, to better understand the process of making AWS disappear. Few studies use imaging techniques that visualize AWS, and out of the few that do, they seem to describe that the cord disappears and new recanalizations and collateralizations appear.

### Axillary web syndrome with vascular thrombosis and arterial intimal hyperplasia [^111pmbxC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Axillary web syndrome (AWS) is characterized by firm, linear, subcutaneous bands in the axilla extending to the arm or hand. The bands are accompanied by pain and a limited range of joint motion due to tension. AWS mostly affects patients with breast cancer who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy. Although generally considered to be of lymphatic origin, the exact pathogenesis of AWS remains unclear. Here we report a case of AWS following an axillary lymph node biopsy in a patient with mycosis fungoides, in which histologic examination revealed vascular thrombosis and arterial stenosis with intimal hyperplasia.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^116VAxPf]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging of the axilla typically occurs when patients present with axillary symptoms or newly diagnosed breast cancer. An awareness of the axillary anatomy is essential in order to generate an accurate differential diagnosis and guide patient management. The purpose of this article is to review the indications for axillary imaging, discuss the logistics of the scanning technique and percutaneous interventions, and present the imaging findings and management of a variety of breast diseases involving the axilla. Teaching points
- Knowledge of normal axillary anatomy aids in determining the aetiology of an axillary mass.
- The differential diagnosis of an axillary mass is broad and can be subdivided by the location of the lesion.
- Imaging evaluation of the axilla usually entails diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound.
- FNA or core needle biopsies are safe and accurate methods for diagnosis and guiding management.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^114Ggb4e]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The Perometer is the most objective tool to measure arm swelling. Treatment decisions to apply compression sleeves based on subjective information (patient reported arm symptoms) have led to lymphoedema staging classifications describing a prodromal or latent phase of lymphoedema characterised by arm heaviness or swelling. This study suggests that application of a compression sleeve based upon clinical symptoms of swelling and/or heaviness alone in the absence of a measurable change in RAVI is likely to lead to misdiagnosis and overtreatment. In the absence of a RAVI > 5%, quality-of-life was not improved by sleeve application.

Screening for 'subclinical' lymphoedema to enable intervention to reduce the risk of developing clinical lymphoedema is recommended internationally, despite the weak evidence base. For 'subclinical' lymphoedema, prescribing of 'prophylactic' compression-sleeves has occurred internationally without any randomised evidence of efficacy. Nearly 16% of our women who had treatment compression-sleeves (20–25 mmHg) applied progressed to moderate lymphoedema despite claims that intervention with compression sleeves prevented lymphoedema development. Other studies report 35% of lymphoedema patients progress after sleeve application. A randomised controlled trial of External Compression Sleeves (20–25 mmHg) Therapy + 'standard management' (written advice, arm elevation, exercises and massage) versus 'standard management' alone to prevent LE found no difference in LE rate between the interventions.

### Postmastectomy functional impairments [^115Z8mDp]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Although bilateral mastectomy is an effective treatment option, many patients encounter both short-term and long-term postmastectomy sequelae. These include various neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, and lymphovascular issues, each with distinct characteristics and implications for patient well-being. Neuromuscular issues involve the nerves and/or muscles in the affected area. Nerve damage during surgery or the removal of lymph nodes can result in symptoms such as pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. Common neuromuscular conditions include postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), which involves chronic pain persisting beyond the expected healing period, and phantom breast syndrome (PBS), which describes the perception of pain or sensations in the breast area following mastectomy. Musculoskeletal issues encompass the bones, joints, and surrounding connective tissue. These conditions can manifest in various ways, including myofascial pain syndrome, which involves the development of trigger points or muscle "knots" that cause both localized and referred pain. Additionally, adhesive capsulitis, widely recognized as frozen shoulder, is a well-documented condition that causes stiffness and restricted mobility in the shoulder joint. Lymphovascular impairments are associated with the lymphatic system and blood vessels. Lymphedema is a common consequence of lymph node removal during mastectomy and is characterized by swelling due to fluid buildup. Another common lymphovascular condition is axillary web syndrome (AWS), also known as cording, where visible or palpable fibrous cords develop in the axilla, causing pain and limited movement. Figure 1 provides an anatomical representation of functional impairments discussed in this review.

### Axillary swelling and a reduced general condition in a middle-aged man [^1138n77B]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

A 48-year-old man presented to his GP with an indolent swelling in his left axillary region. He also complained of a cough, a feeling of pressure in his chest, general poor health, and had increasingly suffered from night-time sweating and fever. Physical examination and an ultrasound revealed an enlarged lymph node of almost 4 cm in the left axillary region and several smaller lymph nodes of 1.5–2.0 cm in the left cervical region. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Investigations

Excisional biopsy, radiography, ultrasound, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, radionuclide imaging, echocardiography and lung function tests.

Diagnosis

Early-stage unfavorable (intermediate) lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Management

Chemotherapy (treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) and involved-field radiotherapy.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy in axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1127dxnY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the different physiotherapy treatments for the AWS and how effective they were. This review provides a compilation of current evidence regarding the physiotherapy treatments for de axillary web syndrome AWS. After performing the analysis of the articles selected, some considerations about the studies included in this paper need to be added.

Control and intervention groups in clinical trials should be homogeneous at the beginning of the intervention. As the sample sizes of the trials analyzed are small, randomness may not have performed its function, therefore not having similar groups at the beginning. Only few studies find that the control and intervention groups have similar BMI, age, types of breast and axillary surgery, or receive similar oncology and/or radiotherapy treatments.

In order to make a correct diagnosis and better understanding of the etiological mechanisms of AWS, more research is needed on clinical behavior, etiopathogenic mechanisms, evolution time, and possible recurrences. Understanding why and how it occurs from the histological point of view can facilitate devising new physiotherapy treatment strategies. For these reasons, studies where biopsies are made to analyze the AWS histologically should be carried out. Likewise, these studies should include a broader follow-up of the patients to observe beyond the initial 6 months from the AWS appearance and thus, have a broader perspective. Even in the event of AWS has disappearance, it would be interesting to check if the benefits obtained with the different physiotherapy treatments are maintained or if the problem became recurrent. Several authors mention the benefits of acting early in the immediate post-operative period and the importance of reducing initial acute pain to prevent long-term chronic pain.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1153E7dT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — axillary management for clinical T > 2 cm breast cancer presents an algorithm emphasizing staging and timing around sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). For clinically node-negative patients, the figure states "No axillary ultrasound for staging", and low-risk patients proceed to surgery with "Single tracer (radiocolloid) if primary surgery; if non identification or low volume center, use dual dye", while high-risk patients undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with "Axillary ultrasound pre-NAC for staging". The caption specifies, "Do not recommend SLNB before chemotherapy except in special circumstances after multidisciplinary discussion". For clinically node-positive disease "with lymph node biopsy to confirm diagnosis", options include NAC or a surgery pathway that features axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Postoperative radiation guidance shown includes "Standard RT (consider regional RT in select patients‡)" and, across node-positive scenarios (e.g., "If BCT, 1–2 nodes positive, and planning RT"; "If mastectomy, 1–2 nodes positive"; "If mastectomy or BCT, ≥ 3 nodes positive¶"), "Standard whole-breast or chest wall RT + RNI§". Notes in the figure add that "Full lymph node dissection may mitigate the need for RT in select patients" and that "Patients with three positive nodes were underrepresented in trials evaluating the omission of completion ALND".

### Management of the axilla in early-stage breast cancer: Ontario health (cancer care Ontario) and ASCO guideline [^1128DR9M]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Limitations and generalizability of evidence for early-stage breast cancer axillary management are noted as follows: "Among the limitations of this work is the total lack of evidence for male patients with early-stage breast cancer, which makes our recommendations generalizable only to female patients". Nonetheless, "we support the generalization of these guidelines to male patients with early-stage breast cancer". Additional limitations include "the lack of focus on new or emerging technologies for axillary staging, a body of evidence that is still partly immature with several studies still ongoing, and the almost complete lack of evidence on quality of life in all its dimensions (including patient-centered outcomes such as morbidity from interventions and lymphedema rates in patients treated by axillary radiation rather than ALND)".

### The lucerne toolbox 2 to optimise axillary management for early breast cancer: a multidisciplinary expert consensus [^1175tqmy]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Axillary staging after primary systemic treatment

Consensus was achieved (82.8%) that in the case of ≤ 2 suspicious nodes on ultrasound (including those with pathologic confirmation of nodal disease), axillary surgical staging can be one of a variety of procedures including a targeted approach (Table 2). The role of axillary ultrasound to determine radiologic complete response remains controversial: If SLNB alone is used the role of axillary ultrasound is important in order to maintain a low FNR, whereas in some of the targeted approaches (TAD) full radiological remission is much less important since the method has been shown to deliver low FNR even in patients without full remission. As fewer than one-third of the patients included in the trials evaluating targeted axillary procedures have been those with ≥ 4 suspicious nodes on initial imaging, the current recommendation for SLNB or targeted approaches includes only patients with ≤ 3 suspicious nodes on pre-treatment imaging.

Residual nodal disease seen on post-surgery imaging

Consensus was achieved (76.7%) that any suspicious node noted on radiation therapy planning CT should be biopsied prior to radiation, regardless of tumour response to PST or type of axillary surgery (i.e. including in the case of ypN0 and/or ALND). A majority agreed (72.4%) that if such a node is confirmed to be pathologically involved, the preferred approach is surgical excision prior to radiation therapy.

Consensus was achieved (93.1%) that if the initial axillary surgery was SLNB or a targeted approach, the preferred surgical approach is completion ALND prior to radiation. If re-operation is not feasible without exposing the patient to risk of excessive morbidity, consensus was achieved (80%) that a radiation boost to the involved node should be applied.

### Effectiveness of physical therapy in axillary web syndrome after breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nMHYZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The axillary web syndrome (AWS) is a surgical breast cancer sequel that limits the functionality of the patient and delays the protocol times of application of cancer treatments. This implies a long period of discomfort and limitations for the user.

Objective

To investigate the different physiotherapy treatments for the AWS and how effective they are.

Methods

A systematic review based on PRISMA protocol and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021281354) was conducted. The research was performed using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, and Web of Science databases during January 2022 and March 2022. All randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were included in this review.

Results

A total of 188 articles were identified, with 9 studies selected for the systematic review. These studies basically propose treatments based on exercises and stretching, manual therapy, and the combination of manual therapy and exercises.

Conclusions

Exercise and stretching are the most effective therapies within the field of physiotherapy for the rehabilitation of axillary web syndrome. They restore range of motion faster, reduce pain, improve quality of life, and reduce disabilities. Manual therapy, scar massage, and myofascial release could help improve outcomes but with worse results. The meta-analysis conclusion is that pain is the only outcome with a significant reduction after the application of physiotherapy treatments-0.82 [-1.67; 0.03]. This conclusion is drawn from the only three studies with small sample sizes.

### Abduction in internal rotation: a test for the diagnosis of axillary nerve palsy [^113vcSF5]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe and validate the use of a test of abduction in internal rotation for the assessment of axillary nerve injury.

Methods

A total of 14 male patients with a mean age of 29 years (SD ± 6 y), with axillary nerve lesions lasting an average of 6 months, participated. We measured their shoulder range of motion. In the upright position, with the trunk bending forward, we asked our patients to actively extend the shoulder (swallowtail test), and then we extended the shoulders and asked each patient to hold them in that position (deltoid extension lag test). For the abduction in internal rotation test, we asked patients to abduct the shoulder in internal rotation. If full abduction compared with the normal contralateral side was not possible, the examiner passively held the affected limb in maximal abduction and internal rotation. The patient was instructed to maintain the position when the examiner released the limb. In each test, any lag compared with the normal side accounted for deltoid palsy.

Results

All patients exhibited abduction beyond horizontal and full external rotation. The swallowtail test and the deltoid extension lag test identified the axillary nerve lesion in 10 of 14 patients. The abduction in internal rotation test recognized the axillary nerve injury in all 14. The average difference in the range of abduction in internal rotation between the normal and affected side was 37° (abduction lag).

Conclusions

Compensatory abduction in axillary nerve palsy has been attributed to the action of the supraspinatus, biceps, coracobrachialis, and pectoralis major. During abduction in internal rotation, compensatory abduction is impaired, clearly indicating deltoid muscle dysfunction.

### Rotator cuff tear following long-standing axillary neuropathy in a female motocross racer [^1176Fsct]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Learning points

A full-thickness rotator cuff tear in the setting of permanent axillary nerve deficit can still be treated surgically with an acceptable outcome.
Specialised exercises with the BOSU ball can help these patients achieve an acceptable result.
A permanent axillary nerve deficit does not preclude participation in motocross racing.

### Increases in arm volume predict lymphoedema and quality of life deficits after axillary surgery: a prospective cohort study [^117RgDHm]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Increasing cancer survival will increase patients at risk of the consequences of their treatments. USA National Lymphoedema Network Guidelinesrecommend lymphoedema screening for all patients after axillary surgery or radiotherapy, which is frequently done using BIS alone. In this lymphoedema screening study, arm volume measurements more reliably diagnosed and predicted risk of lymphoedema, than BIS. The large cohort allowed accurate assessment of the diagnostic health technology involved but limits the strength inferring any causality about effects seen. Similar factors (RAVI > 5%, BMI > 30, and number of involved nodes) predicted development of lymphoedema, and its progression despite compression-sleeve therapy.

Screening for 'subclinical' lymphoedema is only appropriate if objective measures (RAVI > 5%) are used to allow early intervention with compression-sleeves and if this intervention reduces the risk of developing clinical lymphoedema.

The lack of standardised diagnostic criteria for lymphoedema make estimation of the true incidence of lymphoedema difficult.– Baseline measurements comparing both arms of individual women found 8.3% of patients exhibited marked arm volume (> 200 ml) differences regardless of BMI, supporting the need for pre-surgery baseline measurements.

Up to 25% of patients reported symptoms of swelling and/or heavinessin their ipsilateral limb before surgery. RAVI (not BIS) changes were associated with increased symptom reporting. Rigorous pre-operative baseline and subsequent measurements are required to determine the significance of any arm volume changes. Relative arm volume change is the optimal method for early diagnosis of lymphoedema.

DiSipio reviewed 30 prospective studies and estimated by 2 years around 21.4% patients developed lymphoedema after ANC.

### Some cases of severe post-mastectomy pain syndrome may be caused by an axillary haematoma [^116at46N]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is experienced by 20–65% of patients who undergo breast surgery for cancer. The etiology of this chronic neuropathic pain syndrome is unclear and most likely multi-factorial. Symptoms may be mild, not requiring treatment, or severe, considerably restricting quality of life. The effectiveness of available pharmacological and pain management therapies is unknown. Certainly, some women remain under-treated with poor pain control. We report three women undergoing wide local excision for cancer of the breast and block dissection of axillary lymph nodes who subsequently developed severe PMPS. In these cases the symptoms were completely relieved by the aspiration or formal drainage of an encapsulated haematoma in the axilla. The removal of a minimal amount of blood brought instant improvement suggesting that pressure within the haematoma could be an etiological factor. An axillary haematoma, which may not be clinically obvious, should be considered as a possible cause of PMPS.

### Testosterone (Axiron) [^1155ESJc]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Medication Guide.

Patients should be informed of the following information:

17.1 Use in Men with Known or Suspected Prostate or Breast Cancer

Men with known or suspected prostate or breast cancer should not use AXIRON. [See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precaution (5.1)].

17.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone and Steps to Prevent Secondary Exposure

Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women have been reported with topical testosterone products applied to the abdomen, shoulders or upper arms, including cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children, with signs and symptoms including enlargement of the penis or clitoris, premature development of pubic hair, increased erections, aggressive behavior and advanced bone age. Inappropriate changes in genital size or premature development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in hair distribution, increase in acne, or other signs of testosterone effects in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to AXIRON also should be brought to the attention of a physician. AXIRON should be promptly discontinued at least until the cause of virilization is identified.

Strict adherence to the following precautions is advised in order to minimize the potential for secondary exposure to testosterone from AXIRON treated skin:

AXIRON should only be applied to the axilla, not to any other part of the body.
Children and women should avoid contact with the unwashed skin of the axilla or unclothed application sites of men where AXIRON has been applied.
Patients should wash their hands immediately with soap and water after application of AXIRON.
Patients should cover the axilla application site(s) with clothing (e.g., a shirt) after waiting 3 minutes for the solution to dry.
Prior to any situation in which direct skin-to-skin contact of the axilla is anticipated, patients should wash the axilla to which AXIRON has been applied thoroughly with soap and water to remove any testosterone residue.
In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which AXIRON has been applied comes in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible.

### A review of options for localization of axillary lymph nodes in the treatment of invasive breast cancer [^115Aapri]. Academic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Invasive breast cancer is a common disease, and the most common initial site of metastatic disease are the axillary lymph nodes. As the standard of care shifts towards less invasive surgery in the axilla for patients with invasive breast cancer, techniques have been developed for axillary node localization that allow targeted dissection of specific lymph nodes without requiring full axillary lymph node dissection. Many of these techniques have been adapted from technologies developed for localization of lesions within the breast and include marker clip placement with intraoperative ultrasound, carbon-suspension liquids, localization wires, radioactive seeds, magnetic seeds, radar reflectors, and radiofrequency identification devices. The purpose of this article is to summarize these methods and describe benefits and drawbacks of each method for performing localization of lymph nodes in the axilla.

### Axillary web syndrome: current understanding and new directions for treatment [^111kcGvW]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Axillary web syndrome (AWS) is a poorly understood but common cause of significant morbidity after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. It is characterized by painful scar tissue formation and contracture extending from the axilla down the medial arm which limits shoulder and arm mobility. We sought to gain a better understanding of its pathophysiology and available treatments. Additionally, we present our preliminary experience with 2 novel treatment methods: (1) percutaneous needle cord disruption with fat grafting, (2) Xiaflex injection to the cording.

Methods

In order to gain better understanding of current treatment modalities, we performed a literature search to identify articles that described axillary cording after axillary dissection exclusively for breast cancer. We performed operative percutaneous cord disruption and immediate autologous fat grafting in 18 patients. Xiaflex injection was performed in one patient. Details from the 2 new treatment modalities are described.

Results

Described treatments in the literature include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, moist heat, and 1 case of Ascueven Forte. Typically, symptoms lasted from 1 week to 2 years, and most cases resolved by 3 months postoperatively with return to preoperative functionality. We found our 2 new treatment modalities markedly improved arm and shoulder range of motion, overall daily functioning, and pain. Aesthetic outcomes were also improved with softening of the cords.

Conclusions

Axillary web syndrome remains an incompletely understood postoperative phenomenon, which warrants further research. Those patients who develop severe cording often do not respond to traditional therapy and may require more aggressive treatment. Our 2 novel techniques provide alternative options for treating this condition.

### Progressive fat necrosis after breast augmentation with autologous lipotransfer: a cause of long-lasting high fever and axillary lymph node enlargement [^112Ko4Rg]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Breast augmentation with autologous fat transfer has been widely practiced. However, this procedure is not exempt from complications even after technique refinement. This article aims to describe a case of long-lasting high fever, axillary node enlargement, and upper extremity dysfunction caused by liponecrosis after breast fat injection. Radiological and histological examination confirmed liponecrosis in bilateral breasts. Aspiration, drainage, and irrigation were performed along with empirical antibiotic treatment. The patient has made a full recovery from the operation. Liponecrosis, one of the complications after autologous fat grafting to the breast, may present widely different symptoms and signs. Even experienced surgeons should not underestimate it and caution should be used to maintain safety during and after the procedure.

### Clinical epidemiology and management of hidradenitis suppurativa [^111kgBX7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Obstetrician–gynecologists (ob-gyns) often serve as the primary medical contact for female patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. The first North American clinical management guidelines from the U.S. and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations (NAHS guidelines hereafter) have been recently published, which creates an opportunity to summarize these guidelines and other recent related literature for ob-gyns.

Morbidity and mortality in hidradenitis suppurativa cannot be overstated: pain and malodorous drainage torment patients, and the condition is independently associated with increased mortality after adjusting for other comorbidities. Early intervention requires establishing the diagnosis soon after initial symptoms, but evidence suggests that current efforts are insufficient. The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis is 10 years, with 65% of patients having six or more physician visits before diagnosis. This delay, coupled with multiple misdiagnoses, fragmented care, and inappropriate treatments contributes to disease progression and morbidity. Acute lesions are painful inflammatory nodules (solid, raised, round-oval lesions without puncta associated with redness and tenderness) and abscesses (fluctuant, exquisitely tender lesions that can drain purulent fluid), typically in axillary, inframammary, and inguinal areas (Fig. 1). More than half of patients experience disease flares at least weekly. Over time, hypertrophic scars or tunneling sinus tracts may develop that drain purulent, malodorous fluid and limit range of motion. Almost 15% report disease-related disability. Approximately 5% of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa report that ob-gyns were the physicians who correctly diagnosed their disease, positioning ob-gyns to help shorten diagnostic delay.

### Long-term morbidity of sentinel node biopsy versus complete axillary dissection for unilateral breast cancer [^114tR88c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative changes after axillary lymph node surgery may significantly alter breast cancer survivors' (BCS) quality of life. Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has less immediate morbidity than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), its long-term impact on shoulder abduction, arm swelling, and neurosensory changes has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare long-term morbidity after SLNB or ALND and breast-conservation surgery.

Methods

Female BCS who remained free of disease at least 3 years after ALND or SLNB for Stage I-III unilateral breast cancer completed a symptom questionnaire and a brief neurosensory physical examination of the upper arm and axilla (range of motion, arm circumference, and sensation to light touch with cotton and needle).

Results

The mean age of the 187 participating BCS was 62 years. At a mean follow-up of 6.6 years after ALND and 4.9 years after SLNB, most BCS had full abduction; only 10 cases (8 ALND, 2 SLNB) had a ≥ 2 cm proximal and/or distal circumference difference on the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral side. ALND was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of subjective arm numbness (P < .001), chest or axillary numbness (P < .001), arm or hand swelling (P < .001), and objective neurosensory changes in the posterior axilla, medial and distal upper arm (P < .001). Operative procedure was the only significant predictor of neurosensory changes (P < .001).

Conclusion

SLNB is associated with significantly less subjective and objective long-term morbidity than ALND.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidance for the prevention of breast cancer-related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL): international Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^113c4Ssf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Table 1 — evidence base for prevention of breast cancer–related arm lymphoedema (BCRAL) — summarizes key findings informing the consensus. A systematic review (SR) identified 14 risk factors from 84 cohort studies involving 85,538 patients. Another SR of 21 studies found that prospective surveillance with early management reduced chronic BCRAL versus usual care. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 307 high‑risk patients showed prophylactic compression sleeves reduced post‑operative arm swelling in the first year without impacting quality of life. An RCT with 4806 patients found axillary radiation non inferior to axillary lymph node dissection for 10‑year axillary recurrence in cT1–2 disease, with significantly lower BCRAL in the radiation arm. An SR of 5 studies (251 patients) reported immediate lymphatic reconstruction reduced BCRAL from 30.5% to 6.6% at a median follow‑up of 22.6 months. A pooled analysis of 5 RCTs (1696 patients) showed axillary reverse mapping reduced BCRAL incidence from 18.8% to 4.8% without increasing axillary recurrence at a median follow‑up of 37 months.

### A practical approach to imaging the axilla [^115QP4b8]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Scanning technique, logistics and image-guided interventions

The standard imaging evaluation of a palpable axillary lump for females over the age of 30 years in most of the USA typically includes a mammogram with a "skin marker" overlying the palpable finding followed by a focussed ultrasound of the area of concern. This may vary in different countries and typically in the UK, for example, mammographic evaluation begins at age 40 years. In younger patients, imaging begins with ultrasound. For patients with a focal lump, scanning is typically targeted over the area of concern; however, if there is a suspicious finding, it is important to cover the entire axillary region to evaluate for any associated findings. When the study is being performed in a female newly diagnosed with breast cancer, imaging should be performed broadly to include the entire extent of the axillary contents. Examination of level I lymph nodes necessitates visualising the axillary vessels as well as scanning the entire fatty contents from the margin of the pectoralis muscles anteromedially to the latissimus dorsi and teres major margin posterolaterally. The lateral thoracic and thoracodorsal arteries and smaller branches will be seen variably along each margin, respectively. Although node groups typically follow these vessels, lymph nodes are frequently found in isolation within the axillary fat. It is also very important to scan inferiorly, down through the axillary tail, because abnormal nodes are frequently found in this location as well. Levels II and III are not routinely scanned, although large level II nodes can sometimes be seen.

Question 3: What is the appropriate treatment for this patient?
A. Observation
B. Oral minocycline and topical 5% dapsone
C. Infectious disease workup
D. Lymph node biopsy and histological analysis
E. Surgical excision

Answer:
A. Observation – Incorrect. As her lesions were symptomatic, surgical excision is the best definitive management for this patient's EBT. Smaller and asymptomatic EBT can be managed more conservatively.
B. Oral minocycline and topical 5% dapsone – Incorrect. Oral minocycline and topical 5% dapsone would be appropriate medical management options for HS. Our patient's axillary nodules persisted despite a 3-month trial of oral doxycycline and topical 5% dapsone and eventual progression to spironolactone and adalimumab.
C. Infectious disease workup – Incorrect. Our patient is not displaying signs or symptoms concerning for a systemic infection. This patient's bilateral axillary nodules are due to EBT, rather than lymphadenopathy.
D. Lymph node biopsy and histological analysis – Incorrect. Our patient does not have any features concerning underlying malignancy. Lymph node biopsy is not indicated in the management of EBT.
E. Surgical excision – Correct. For both symptomatic relief and to eliminate malignant potential, management of EBT includes surgical excision. Our patient was symptomatic and received definitive treatment with surgical excision. To date, she has recovered well and is pleased with her outcome.

### A 53-year-old woman with axillary lymphadenopathy [^114tCb5q]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 53-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presented with abnormal axillary lymph nodes detected on surveillance imaging. Using history, physical examination, and diagnostic workup, an illness script for her presentation emerges. A differential diagnosis is developed and refined until a final diagnosis is confirmed.

### Axillary lymphadenopathy in the COVID-19 era: what the radiologist needs to know [^115XQ6jT]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Axillary lymphadenopathy caused by the high immunogenicity of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines presents radiologists with new diagnostic dilemmas in differentiating vaccine-related benign reactive lymphadenopathy from that due to malignant causes. Understanding axillary anatomy and lymphatic drainage is key to radiologic evaluation of the axilla. US plays a critical role in evaluation and classification of axillary lymph nodes on the basis of their cortical and hilar morphology, which allows prediction of metastatic disease. Guidelines for evaluation and management of axillary lymphadenopathy continue to evolve as radiologists gain more experience with axillary lymphadenopathy related to COVID-19 vaccines. General guidelines recommend documenting vaccination dates and laterality and administering all vaccine doses contralateral to the site of primary malignancy whenever applicable. Guidelines also recommend against postponing imaging for urgent clinical indications or for treatment planning in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Although conservative management approaches to axillary lymphadenopathy initially recommended universal short-interval imaging follow-up, updates to those approaches as well as risk-stratified approaches recommend interpreting lymphadenopathy in the context of both vaccination timing and the patient's overall risk of metastatic disease. Patients with active breast cancer in the pretreatment or peritreatment phase should be evaluated with standard imaging protocols regardless of vaccination status. Tissue sampling and multidisciplinary discussion remain useful in management of complex cases, including increasing lymphadenopathy at follow-up imaging, MRI evaluation of extent of disease, response to neoadjuvant treatment, and potentially confounding cases. An invited commentary by Weinstein is available online. © RSNA, 2022.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111iZtpX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — management of the axilla in patients with "clinical T1–2 cm breast cancer" — emphasizes that "Multidisciplinary discussion of adjuvant therapy options should occur prior to surgery when omitting sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)". Decision making "should be made on a case-by-case basis, and include a patient-centered approach", and "Full lymph node dissection may mitigate the need for RNI in select patients". The caption highlights that "Patients with three positive nodes were underrepresented in trials evaluating the omission of completion ALND", and that "There are no clinical trial data comparing SLNB/targeted axillary dissection (localized removal of clipped biopsy-proven positive node) to complete axillary lymph node dissection at this time, and either may be options for patients", with abbreviations defined as "ALND, axillary lymph node dissection", "RNI, regional nodal irradiation", and "SLNB, sentinel lymph node biopsy".
