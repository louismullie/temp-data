## Question

What would cause a primary metabolic alkalosis in critical illness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what would cause a primary metabolic alkalosis in critical illness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining primary metabolic alkalosis and confirming the diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the generation and maintenance phases. Next, I will categorize the etiologies relevant to critical illness, including chloride-responsive, chloride-resistant, and iatrogenic causes. After that, I should review special critical care contexts that amplify risk. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic approach and highlight the most common culprits in the ICU, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: primary metabolic alkalosis is a rise in serum bicarbonate with arterial pH above 7.44, accompanied by a compensatory increase in PaCO2 from alveolar hypoventilation, and the expected respiratory compensation is roughly a 0.5–0.7 mmHg rise in PaCO2 for each 1 mEq/L increase in bicarbonate, which helps distinguish simple from mixed disorders [^77be3de5] [^81b4c8bb].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Metabolic alkalosis has two phases: generation, where acid is lost or base is gained, and maintenance, where the kidney fails to excrete excess bicarbonate due to volume contraction, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, aldosterone excess, or reduced GFR; critically ill patients often have multiple maintenance factors simultaneously, which sustains the alkalosis even after the generator is removed [^53929fc4] [^77be3de5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies without categorizing them. In critical illness, the most relevant buckets are chloride-responsive alkaloses driven by volume depletion and chloride loss, chloride-resistant alkaloses driven by mineralocorticoid excess or genetic tubular disorders, and iatrogenic alkaloses from alkali administration or CRRT; I should confirm that these categories map to the ICU data showing diuretics, gastric losses, and exogenous alkali as frequent drivers [^77be3de5] [^71a001f7] [^06b316b4].

> Let me consider chloride-responsive causes first, since they dominate in the ICU. Loop and thiazide diuretics cause natriuresis with chloride loss, volume contraction, RAAS activation, and kaliuresis, all of which sustain alkalosis; nasogastric suctioning or vomiting causes loss of gastric HCl with parallel chloride and hydrogen losses, again triggering volume contraction and secondary hyperaldosteronism; post-hypercapnic alkalosis can emerge after correction of chronic CO2 retention as the kidney has adapted to retain bicarbonate, and this can delay ventilator weaning; finally, chloride-responsive alkalosis is also common in cystic fibrosis due to renal chloride wasting and pendrin dysregulation, which I should keep in mind in the right phenotype [^736a33f6] [^2f04b3e2] [^8b39a269] [^8cb734a9].

> Wait, let me verify the chloride-resistant category in critical illness. Primary aldosteronism and Cushing's syndrome can present with hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis; in the ICU, secondary hyperaldosteronism from heart failure, liver disease, or renal artery stenosis is more common and can sustain alkalosis even when volume status is not frankly contracted; refeeding syndrome can also generate alkalosis via intracellular potassium shifts and insulin effects, so I should check for recent nutrition changes [^77be3de5] [^132844ed] [^09609ec1].

> I should double-check iatrogenic contributors because they are preventable. Exogenous bicarbonate or citrate, often given for acidosis or regional anticoagulation, can overshoot and cause alkalosis; sodium lactate infusions can be metabolized to bicarbonate and raise pH; CRRT with bicarbonate-based fluids can induce alkalemia if not carefully titrated; and acetazolamide, while used to treat alkalosis, can paradoxically worsen potassium losses and must be used judiciously, especially in renal impairment [^73ddded9] [^74f310c5] [^bddac986] [^15fff011].

> Next, I should review special critical care contexts that amplify risk. Mechanical ventilation with permissive strategies can unmask or worsen metabolic alkalosis by allowing compensatory hypoventilation; hypernatremia from hypertonic fluids or diabetes insipidus can increase the strong ion difference and raise pH; and hypoalbuminemia, common in critical illness, can artifactually elevate measured bicarbonate and mask concurrent acidosis, so I need to interpret the acid-base picture in light of albumin-corrected metrics [^8b39a269] [^31221505] [^89e316f2].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach so I don't miss mixed disorders. I should confirm the primary process with pH, PaCO2, and bicarbonate, then assess compensation; next, I should measure urine chloride to distinguish chloride-responsive from chloride-resistant etiologies, review medication and feeding history for alkali sources, and check electrolytes, creatinine, and albumin; in complex cases, the Stewart approach can reveal hidden mixed disturbances, but I should confirm that it adds actionable information before relying on it [^62f5f180] [^77be3de5] [^9ecbd1d4].

> But wait, what if the alkalosis is severe and the patient is failing to wean from the ventilator? I should confirm that correcting the underlying driver — stopping diuretics, replacing volume and potassium, removing alkali sources, or treating mineralocorticoid excess — is the cornerstone; in select cases, acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate and facilitate weaning, though evidence for hard outcomes is limited and adverse effects can occur, so I need to weigh risks and monitor closely [^77be3de5] [^c0522ab7] [^40a07b4e].

> In summary, I need to ensure I'm prioritizing the most common causes in critical illness: diuretic-induced alkalosis from loop or thiazides, gastric losses from NG suction or vomiting, post-hypercapnic alkalosis in COPD, and iatrogenic alkali loading; less common but important are mineralocorticoid excess states and genetic tubular disorders, and I should always consider mixed acid-base disturbances that can obscure the primary process [^71a001f7] [^77be3de5] [^06b316b4].

Primary metabolic alkalosis in critical illness is most often due to **gastric acid loss** (vomiting, nasogastric suction) [^2f04b3e2] or **diuretic-induced renal losses** (loop/thiazides) [^736a33f6], with **hypokalemia and hypochloremia** sustaining the disorder [^132844ed]. Other causes include exogenous alkali (bicarbonate, citrate, lactate) [^73ddded9], mineralocorticoid excess [^132844ed], and post-hypercapnic alkalosis [^8b39a269]. Critical illness amplifies these mechanisms via volume depletion, RAAS activation [^eb6c3383], and impaired renal bicarbonate excretion [^53929fc4], and severe alkalosis (pH ≥ 7.55) is linked to increased mortality [^77be3de5] [^378146c0].

---

## Pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis

Metabolic alkalosis arises from **two phases**: generation and maintenance [^53929fc4]. Generation occurs from acid loss or bicarbonate gain, while maintenance results from impaired renal bicarbonate excretion due to volume depletion, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, or mineralocorticoid excess [^77be3de5].

## Common causes of primary metabolic alkalosis in critical illness

| **Category** | **Specific causes** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal acid loss | - Vomiting <br/> - Nasogastric suction | Loss of HCl and volume depletion activate RAAS, increasing HCO3− reabsorption [^2f04b3e2] |
| Renal acid loss | - Loop diuretics <br/> - Thiazide diuretics | - Salt and chloride loss <br/> - Volume depletion <br/> - RAAS activation <br/> - Hypokalemia <br/> - Increased HCO3− reabsorption [^736a33f6] |
| Exogenous alkali administration | - Sodium bicarbonate <br/> - Citrate (transfusions, CRRT) <br/> - Lactate (Ringer's) | Increased HCO3− load with impaired renal excretion [^73ddded9] [^bddac986] |
| Mineralocorticoid excess | - Primary aldosteronism <br/> - Cushing's syndrome <br/> - Exogenous steroids | Increased ENaC-driven Na+ reabsorption with K+ and H+ secretion, raising HCO3− [^132844ed] [^9e6d4969] |
| Post-hypercapnic alkalosis | - Chronic CO2 retention with rapid correction | Renal HCO3− retention persists after CO2 correction [^8b39a269] |

## Factors unique to critical illness that exacerbate metabolic alkalosis

Critical illness amplifies alkalosis through **volume depletion** from diuretics, vomiting, or third spacing, which activates the RAAS and increases HCO3− reabsorption [^eb6c3383]. Hypokalemia is common and sustains alkalosis by stimulating H+ secretion and HCO3− reabsorption [^45c1c69d]. Impaired renal function reduces HCO3− excretion, and mechanical ventilation can cause compensatory hypoventilation, raising PaCO2 and further increasing HCO3− reabsorption [^9e6d4969].

---

## Clinical consequences of metabolic alkalosis in critical illness

Metabolic alkalosis has **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Respiratory depression**: Compensatory hypoventilation can worsen ventilator dependence [^8b39a269].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and ionized hypocalcemia are common [^notfound].

- **Neurological effects**: Confusion, seizures, and coma can occur in severe cases [^1f455e1a].

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Arrhythmias and reduced myocardial contractility are risks, especially with digitalis use [^3516ea8a].

- **Increased mortality**: Severe alkalosis (pH ≥ 7.55) is associated with higher mortality [^77be3de5] [^378146c0].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Confirm metabolic alkalosis**: pH > 7.44 with elevated HCO3− and compensatory PaCO2 rise [^1f455e1a].

- **Measure urine chloride**: < 20 mmol/L suggests chloride-responsive; > 20 mmol/L suggests chloride-resistant [^1f455e1a].

- **Assess volume status and electrolytes**: Evaluate for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and mineralocorticoid excess [^1f455e1a].

- **Review medications and interventions**: Identify diuretics, alkali sources, and ventilator settings [^1f455e1a].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **correcting the underlying cause** and reversing maintenance factors:

- **Chloride-responsive alkalosis**: Volume repletion with NaCl and potassium repletion [^21ce3b0c].

- **Chloride-resistant alkalosis**: Treat mineralocorticoid excess (e.g. spironolactone, surgery) and correct hypokalemia [^302d97d0].

- **Exogenous alkali**: Stop bicarbonate/citrate/lactate sources [^9e6d4969].

- **Acetazolamide**: Consider for refractory cases, especially with respiratory failure [^c0522ab7].

- **HCl infusion**: Rarely used for severe, refractory alkalosis [^64d18be5].

---

Primary metabolic alkalosis in critical illness most often results from **gastric acid loss**, **diuretics**, or **exogenous alkali**, with **hypokalemia and hypochloremia** sustaining it. Critical illness amplifies these mechanisms, and severe alkalosis is associated with increased mortality; therefore, **prompt identification and correction** are essential.

### Evaluation and treatment of respiratory alkalosis [^1a966816]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is the most frequent acid-base disturbance encountered in clinical practice. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, for whom the degree of hypocapnia directly correlates with adverse outcomes. Although this acid-base disturbance often is considered benign, evidence suggests that the alkalemia of primary hypocapnia can cause clinically significant decreases in tissue oxygen delivery. Mild respiratory alkalosis often serves as a marker of an underlying disease and may not require therapeutic intervention. In contrast, severe respiratory alkalosis should be approached with a sense of urgency and be aggressively corrected.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^62f5f180]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^77be3de5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a widespread acid-base disturbance, especially in hospitalized patients. It is characterized by the primary elevation of serum bicarbonate and arterial pH, along with a compensatory increase in P 2 consequent to adaptive hypoventilation. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis involves either a loss of fixed acid or a net accumulation of bicarbonate within the extracellular fluid. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or the kidney, whereas the sources of excess alkali may be via oral or parenteral alkali intake. Severe metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients — arterial blood pH of 7.55 or higher — is associated with significantly increased mortality rate. The kidney is equipped with sophisticated mechanisms to avert the generation or the persistence (maintenance) of metabolic alkalosis by enhancing bicarbonate excretion. These mechanisms include increased filtration as well as decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bicarbonate by specialized transporters in specific nephron segments. Factors that interfere with these mechanisms will impair the ability of the kidney to eliminate excess bicarbonate, therefore promoting the generation or impairing the correction of metabolic alkalosis. These factors include volume contraction, low glomerular filtration rate, potassium deficiency, hypochloremia, aldosterone excess, and elevated arterial carbon dioxide. Major clinical states are associated with metabolic alkalosis, including vomiting, aldosterone or cortisol excess, licorice ingestion, chloruretic diuretics, excess calcium alkali ingestion, and genetic diseases such as Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, and cystic fibrosis. In this installment in the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis; appraise the precipitating events; and discuss clinical presentations, diagnoses, and treatments of metabolic alkalosis.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^6137ee28]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several reports highlighted that the presence of metabolic alkalosis is associated with longer ICU stays and increased mortality in patients with various diseases. In our cohort, metabolic alkalosis at admission was a strong indicator of higher mortality, worse GOS, and a lower likelihood of returning to baseline even after correction for potential confounders.

Our findings were further validated using the Stewart approach, which, despite being more complex and less user-friendly for clinical practice, offers a more detailed and precise assessment of acid–base disorders, particularly in critical care settings. According to the Stewart method, predominant metabolic alkalosis was associated with all primary outcomes in univariate analysis and remained significantly linked to a reduced likelihood of good functional outcomes after binomial regression.

Metabolic alkalosis may directly contribute to poor outcomes or be an indicator of other adverse factors. Some studies suggest that metabolic alkalosis directly impacts outcomes by reducing respiratory input, inhibiting hemoglobin dissociation and causing electrolytes imbalance. We analyzed the number of patients with metabolic alkalosis according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach who normalized their pH levels within the subsequent 24 h: of 17 patients with available data, the normalization of pH had no clear impact on prognosis, but the extremely small sample size warrants caution in interpretation.

While alkalosis may contribute directly (e.g. through respiratory depression), other factors likely play a significant role in reducing the likelihood of good outcome for alkalosis patients in our cohort. We found a significant correlation between metabolic alkalosis, hypoalbuminemia, and lower serum potassium. The association between alkalosis and hypoalbuminemia is well established, as well as the bidirectional relationship among metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia.

Hypoalbuminemia is a well-known predictor of poor outcomes across various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sepsis, and it might be considered as a reliable biomarker of overall patient's resources to survive SE. Similarly, low serum potassium has been associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, including an increased risk of respiratory insufficiency, with a reduced capacity to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Discussion

Our study reveals that approximately 50% of SE patients present with an acid–base disorder within the first 24 h of SE according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch approach.

About 35% of patients experienced respiratory and/or metabolic acidosis, likely directly related to respiratory disfunction and/or lactate production. The antiepileptic effect of acidosis is well established: neuronal excitability and seizure activity are strongly suppressed by a decrease in brain and blood pH, with some anticonvulsants, such as acetazolamide, acting reducing extracellular brain pH. However, the prognostic role of acidosis in critically ill patients remains debated. Some studies associate acidosis to higher mortality, while others find no relationship with outcome, or even a correlation to better prognosis. In our study, we did not find a clear association between acidosis and outcomes, but a larger sample size may be needed to detect small differences.

In the first 24 h of SE, 15% of patients showed alkalosis, split evenly between metabolic and respiratory causes. The pathogenesis of alkalosis in SE is less clear, and likely influenced by the overall pathophysiological context. Alkalosis, especially metabolic alkalosis, has been recognized as a common acid–base disturbance in critically ill patients, increasing with invasive therapies like mechanical ventilation, gastric aspiration, and intravenous infusions. In our cohort, we assessed pH only in the very first stage of SE and only a small percentage of patients experienced alkalosis, with no relationship to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive therapies, suggesting their non-primary role in this context.

An increase in pH is associated with the generation of spontaneous interictal spikes in animal models, potentially contributing to the interictal–ictal transition. In this context, hyperventilation-induced alkalosis has long been used to induce seizure activity/electroencephalogram abnormalities as an activation test.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^b77c6e32]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

An association between alkalosis and mild hyperlactatemia has been described before in numerous case reports of extreme alkalosis, of both respiratory and metabolic origin. Bersin et al. introduced the concept of "primary lactic alkalosis" in a study describing a small case series along with an experimental demonstration of the pH-induced hyperlactatemia in a swine model of metabolic alkalosis. Several mechanisms are proposed to explain its pathophysiology: First, alkalosis stimulates glycolysis by increasing the activity of phosphofructokinase, which is sensitive to both pH itself and to alkalosis-induced sympathetic hyperactivation; second, alkalosis-induced left shift in the hemoglobin dissociation curve decreases oxygen tissue extraction, which may explain the decrease in oxygen consumption observed in the seminal study by Bersin. During exercise in man, experimental studies observed the same positive correlation between pH and lactate output, which was interpreted as a protective mechanism to regulate cellular acid production and protect muscle pH. In a cohort of patients with psychogenic respiratory alkalosis, hyperlactatemia was present in 30% of patients and was mainly correlated to pH and PaCo 2 without any relation to adverse events, suggesting that "lactic alkalosis" does not carry the same prognostic value as lactic acidosis. In a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients, alkalosis was not associated with increased mortality but was significantly associated with prolonged ICU stay, although lactate was not available, preventing the exploration of its prognosis value in this particular context.

Overall, very little is known about lactic alkalosis in intensive care, and our findings encourage us to explore further the relationship between alkalosis, lactate and outcome in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, it could be useful for the clinician to know that mild, isolated hyperlactatemia in a patient with alkalosis should be interpreted with caution and is not necessarily a "red flag" that should lead to inappropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Approach to metabolic alkalosis [^bfc7c3fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a common disorder, accounting for half of all acid-base disturbances in hospitalized patients. It is the result of an increase in bicarbonate production, a decrease in bicarbonate excretion, or a loss of hydrogen ions. Most causes of metabolic alkalosis can be divided into 4 categories: chloride depletion alkalosis, mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndromes, and excess alkali administration. Treatment is usually supportive and based on cause of the alkalosis.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^40a07b4e]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present systematic review demonstrates that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are associated with favorable blood gas parameters in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, but did not provide conclusive results for clinically important outcomes. Future well-designed and large randomized trials should investigate the effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors on these outcomes, particularly mortality, duration of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^71a001f7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Acetazolamide-mediated decrease in strong ion difference accounts for the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^2738b1aa]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	The Stewart approach offers an advanced understanding of acid–base physiology that is central to the practice of critical care medicine.

- 	Although the Stewart approach has proved to be valuable in critically ill acidotic patients, no reports exist in which the approach is used in ICU patients with metabolic alkalosis.

- 	In ICU patients with metabolic alkalosis, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide corrects pH by decreasing the SID, with no effect on the other independent determinants of pH.

- 	The decrease in serum SID is completely explained by an increase in plasma chloride, caused by an increase in the urinary excretion of sodium without chloride.

- 	The Stewart approach explains that acetazolamide-induced loss of bicarbonate is not the cause of the decrease in serum pH, but only facilitates the renal reabsorption of chloride while sodium can still be excreted.

Methods

The detailed methods are included in Additional file 1.

Eligibility criteria

RCTs were included if they recruited patients with respiratory failure and concurrent metabolic alkalosis (as defined by the individual trial), including patients on MV or NIPPV. In addition, the trial should have compared CAI to either placebo or usual care. All co-interventions should have been similar for the two comparison groups.

The primary outcomes of interest were duration of hospital stay, duration of MV or NIPPV, mortality, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the blood gases parameters PaCO 2, PO 2, HCO 3, and PH.

Search strategy

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to August 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Figures 1 to 4 in Additional file 2 detail the electronic search strategy. There were no language or date restrictions. We also screened the reference lists of included trials and identified related systematic reviews. The search strategy did not include attempts at collecting unpublished data.

Selection process

Teams of two review authors (BYT and CN, and HSI and MOO) screened independently and in duplicate the abstract and title of every record captured by the searches. We retrieved the full texts for all citations judged as potentially eligible by at least one reviewer.

The teams of two reviewers then assessed the full texts for eligibility using a standardized screening form.

A PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) flow-chart was used to summarize the results of the selection process (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
PRISMA study flowchart

Data extraction

We extracted information about the study design, the clinical characteristics of the trial (population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes), funding, and conflicts of interest of the authors.

Assessment of risk of bias

Risk of bias was assessed using The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. The following criteria were used: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants, providers, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts (performance bias and detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other biases (including early stopping for benefit).

Risk of bias criteria was judged as 'low risk', 'high risk' or 'unclear risk' as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^378146c0]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a heterogeneous neurological emergency with significant variability in prognosis, influenced by underlying disease and pathophysiological context. Acid–base disturbances are common in critically ill patients, yet their distribution and impact in SE patients remain poorly understood.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study including non-hypoxic SE patients with available blood gas analysis within the first 24 h of SE, treated at the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland between 2015 and 2023. Acid–base disturbances were classified using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, with prevalent metabolic alkalosis confirmed through the Stewart approach. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and return to premorbid neurologic function.

Findings

Among 540 SE patients, 365 were included. Half of patients exhibited acid–base disturbances within the initial 24 h of SE, with metabolic and respiratory acidosis being the most prevalent, though not prognostically significant. After correction for possible confounders, metabolic alkalosis (6%) was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (P = 0.011; OR = 4.87, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), worse GOS (P = 0.012; OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), and reduced likelihood of returning to premorbid function (P = 0.017; OR = 3.30, CI95% = 1.24–8.80). Following the Stewart approach, 9% of patients had predominant metabolic alkalosis, associated with worse GOS (P = 0.005; OR:3.37, 95%CI = 1.45–7.82), and reduced chance of returning to baseline (P = 0.012; OR = 3.29, CI95% = 1.30–8.32). Metabolic alkalosis was related to hypoalbuminemia and lower serum potassium.

Conclusion

Metabolic alkalosis strongly predicts mortality and adverse functional outcome in SE patients. Prospective studies should assess whether early detection and correction of metabolic alkalosis and related electrolyte imbalances can improve SE prognosis.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^9d682b93]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

The kidney is poised to defend against development of metabolic alkalosis through non-adaptive mechanisms in the proximal nephron and adaptive processes in the distal nephron. Despite a prodigious capacity to excrete base, metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in hospitalized patients. Development of this disorder requires pathophysiologic changes leading to generation of new HCO3- combined with an augmentation in the capacity of the kidney to reclaim filtered HCO3-. The initial approach to these patients is careful assessment of effective arterial blood volume focusing on the physical examination and urine electrolytes. Identifying the mechanisms by which the kidney's ability to correct alkalosis are perturbed provides an understanding of the clinical approach to differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment. While metabolic alkalosis is frequently not dangerous, in certain settings, metabolic alkalosis may contribute to mortality and should be aggressively managed.

### Increased serum bicarbonate in critically ill patients: a retrospective analysis [^06b316b4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although metabolic alkalosis is a common occurrence, no study has evaluated its prevalence, associated factors or outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective study from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. From 23,529 adult patient records, 18,982 patients met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Serum bicarbonate levels demonstrated a U-shaped association with mortality with knots at 25 and 30 mEq/l. Of the total included patients, 5,565 (29.3%) had at least one serum bicarbonate level measurement > 30 mEq/l. The majority were exposed to multiple factors that are classically associated with metabolic alkalosis (mainly diuretic use, hypernatremia, hypokalemia and high gastric output). Patients with increased serum bicarbonate exhibited increased ICU LOS, more days on mechanical ventilation and higher hospital mortality. After multivariate adjustment, each 5-mEq/l increment in the serum bicarbonate level above 30 mEq/l was associated with an odds ratio of 1.21 for hospital mortality. The association between increased serum bicarbonate levels and mortality occurs independently of its possible etiologies.

Conclusion

An increased serum bicarbonate level is common in critically ill patients; this can be attributed to multiple factors in the majority of cases, and its presence and duration negatively influence patient outcomes.

Although the results of the pooled analysis concerning mortality and duration of hospital stay are not conclusive, they suggest a possible decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation in the CAI group compared with placebo. This clinically important outcome should be confirmed in future larger randomized clinical trials.

### Changes of serum chloride and metabolic acid-base state in critical illness [^1f6fed8d]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Alterations of electrolytes and albumin cause metabolic acid-base disorders. It is unclear, however, to what degree these plasma components affect the overall metabolic acid-base state in the course of critical illness. We performed serial analyses of the metabolic acid-base state in 30 critically ill patients over the course of 1 week. We applied a physical-chemical acid-base model and used a linear regression model to determine the influence of sodium, chloride, unmeasured anions and albumin on the net metabolic acid-base state. Progressive hypochloraemia was identified as the main cause of developing metabolic alkalosis. Changes in serum chloride and unmeasured anions were responsible for changes of 41% and 22% in the metabolic acid-base state, respectively. Sodium and albumin played a minor role. In conclusion, chloride is the major determinant of metabolic acid-base state in critical illness.

### Acetazolamide-mediated decrease in strong ion difference accounts for the correction of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^4a6b48e5]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic alkalosis is a common acid–base disturbance in the intensive care unit (ICU) that is associated with increased ICU mortality and morbidity, with adverse effects on cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic function. Additionally, such patients are characterized by compensatory alveolar hypoventilation, which can result in delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Options for treatment aimed at correcting metabolic alkalosis are fluid and potassium replacement, and administration of ammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, or acetazolamide. These therapeutic interventions potentially increase minute ventilation, allowing patients to be weaned more rapidly.

An advanced understanding of acid–base physiology is central to the practice of critical care medicine. Although it is not difficult to quantify the degree of metabolic alkalosis, it is more challenging to identify the cause of a metabolic alkalosis and determine the actions that must be taken to correct it. The method of quantifying and qualifying an acid–base disturbance, as described by Stewart, relies on the accepted physicochemical principles of conservation of mass and electroneutrality. According to Stewart, three variables independently determine the serum hydrogen concentration. These variables are the partial carbon dioxide tension (PCO 2), the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (primarily serum proteins and phosphate), and the strong ion difference (SID). The Stewart approach, in contrast to other approaches, allows us to quantify an acid–base derangement as well as determine its cause.

### Respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis: core curriculum 2023 [^dff34e29]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The respiratory system plays an integral part in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Normal ventilation participates in the maintenance of an open buffer system, allowing for excretion of CO 2 produced from the interaction of nonvolatile acids and bicarbonate. Quantitatively of much greater importance is the excretion of CO 2 derived from volatile acids produced from the complete oxidation of fat and carbohydrate. A primary increase in CO 2 tension of body fluids is the cause of respiratory acidosis and develops most commonly from one or more of the following: (1) disorders affecting gas exchange across the pulmonary capillary, (2) disorders of the chest wall and the respiratory muscles, and/or (3) inhibition of the medullary respiratory center. Respiratory alkalosis or primary hypocapnia is most commonly caused by disorders that increase alveolar ventilation and is defined by an arterial partial pressure of CO 2 < 35 mm Hg with subsequent alkalization of body fluids. Both disorders can lead to life-threatening complications, making it of paramount importance for the clinician to have a thorough understanding of the cause and treatment of these acid-base disturbances.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^5247c30a]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a heterogeneous neurological emergency with significant variability in prognosis, influenced by underlying disease and pathophysiological context. Acid-base disturbances are common in critically ill patients, yet their distribution and impact in SE patients remain poorly understood.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study including non-hypoxic SE patients with available blood gas analysis within the first 24 h of SE, treated at the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland between 2015 and 2023. Acid-base disturbances were classified using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, with prevalent metabolic alkalosis confirmed through the Stewart approach. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at discharge, and return to premorbid neurologic function.

Findings

Among 540 SE patients, 365 were included. Half of patients exhibited acid-base disturbances within the initial 24 h of SE, with metabolic and respiratory acidosis being the most prevalent, though not prognostically significant. After correction for possible confounders, metabolic alkalosis (6%) was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (P = 0.011; OR = 4.87, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), worse GOS (P = 0.012; OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.29–7.84), and reduced likelihood of returning to premorbid function (P = 0.017; OR = 3.30, CI95% = 1.24–8.80). Following the Stewart approach, 9% of patients had predominant metabolic alkalosis, associated with worse GOS (P = 0.005; OR:3.37, 95%CI = 1.45–7.82), and reduced chance of returning to baseline (P = 0.012; OR = 3.29, CI95% = 1.30–8.32). Metabolic alkalosis was related to hypoalbuminemia and lower serum potassium.

Conclusion

Metabolic alkalosis strongly predicts mortality and adverse functional outcome in SE patients. Prospective studies should assess whether early detection and correction of metabolic alkalosis and related electrolyte imbalances can improve SE prognosis.

### Severe multifactorial metabolic alkalosis in the emergency department: a case report [^9a8eda0b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is an uncommon clinical entity resulting from a wide variety of underlying etiologies including gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and metabolic causes. It is a typically clinically silent condition; however, severe cases can be life-threatening, mandating both a systematic investigative approach and an early aggressive management strategy.

Case Report

We present a case of a 58-year-old man with severe, multifactorial metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.72, HCO 3–42 mmol/L, pCO 2 31 mm Hg) resulting from refractory vomiting, severe hypokalemia (2.0 mmol/L), and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 20 g/L). WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe metabolic alkalosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential underlying causes in these cases, as well as how to delineate between chloride- and non-chloride-depleted states, which dictates initial treatment. We provide a pragmatic summary of the evaluation, pertinent investigations, and early management of these cases.

### Rising serum sodium levels are associated with a concurrent development of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^31221505]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Changes in electrolyte homeostasis are important causes of acid-base disorders. While the effects of chloride are well studied, only little is known of the potential contributions of sodium to metabolic acid-base state. Thus, we investigated the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired hypernatremia on acid-base state.

Methods

We included critically ill patients who developed hypernatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration exceeding 149 mmol/L, after ICU admission in this retrospective study. Data on electrolyte and acid-base state in all included patients were gathered in order to analyze the effects of hypernatremia on metabolic acid-base state by use of the physical-chemical approach.

Results

A total of 51 patients were included in the study. The time of rising serum sodium and hypernatremia was accompanied by metabolic alkalosis. A transient increase in total base excess (standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L) paralleled by a transient increase in the base excess due to sodium (base excess sodium from 0.7 to 4.1 mmol/L) could be observed. The other determinants of metabolic acid-base state remained stable. The increase in base excess was accompanied by a slight increase in overall pH (from 7.392 to 7.429, standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Hypernatremia is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis and an increase in pH. Given the high prevalence of hypernatremia, especially in critically ill patients, hypernatremic alkalosis should be part of the differential diagnosis of metabolic acid-base disorders.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^8484d497]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary pathophysiologic event characterized by the gain of bicarbonate or the loss of nonvolatile acid from extracellular fluid. The kidney preserves normal acid-base balance by two mechanisms: bicarbonate reclamation, mainly in the proximal tubule, and bicarbonate generation, predominantly in the distal nephron. Bicarbonate reclamation is mediated mainly by a Na(+)-H(+) antiporter and to a smaller extent by the H(+)-ATPase (adenosine triphosphate-ase). The principal factors affecting HCO3(-) reabsorption include effective arterial blood volume, glomerular filtration rate, chloride, and potassium. Bicarbonate regeneration is primarily affected by distal Na(+) delivery and reabsorption, aldosterone, arterial pH, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To generate metabolic alkalosis, either a gain of base or a loss of acid must occur. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or via the kidney. Excess base may be gained by oral or parenteral HCO3(-) administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate administration. Factors that help maintain metabolic alkalosis include decreased glomerular filtration rate, volume contraction, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and aldosterone excess. Clinical states associated with metabolic alkalosis are vomiting, mineralocorticoid excess, the adrenogenital syndrome, licorice ingestion, diuretic administration, and Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. The effects of metabolic alkalosis on the body are variable and include effects on the central nervous system, myocardium, skeletal muscle, and liver. Treatment of this disorder is simple, once the pathophysiology of the cause is delineated. Therapy consists of reversing the contributory factors that are promoting the alkalosis and, in severe cases, administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acid infusion, and low bicarbonate dialysis.

### Supporting hemodynamics: what should we target? What treatments should we use? [^ff11aa37]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

When all of the compensatory mechanisms are overcome, the hemodynamic failure is overt and its marker is the appearance of metabolic acidosis associated with increased plasma lactate concentration. We believe that the best approach to understand the relationship between metabolic acidosis and lactate in tissue hypoxia has been provided by Hochachka and Mommsen, who elegantly showed how lactate production and ATP hydrolysis are coupled and must be considered together. Here it is enough to say that the appearance of acidosis indicates the energy failure of a group of cells that, in the absence of correction, may result in cellular death after a few hours.

Figure 3 reports the impressive relationship between metabolic acidosis and mortality in a general population of critically ill patients. In contrast, elevated metabolic alkalosis, usually caused by diuretic therapy, is not associated with increased mortality. Beyond pH, several approaches have been proposed to assess the hemodynamic failure, such as base excess, lactate, decreased strong ion difference (SID), increased anion gap, increased venous to arterial difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) and its ratio to the arterial-venous oxygen content. All these variables, however, are just different facets of the same reality; that is, the perturbation of the acid-base equilibrium due to nonvolatile acid load, originating from suffering cells (lactate) or dead cells (intracellular strong acid content is higher than plasma content). In mammalians, when metabolic acidosis starts due to the hemodynamic failure, the time for correction is limited before irreversible mitochondrial damages and cell death occurs.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a brief pathophysiologic review [^9d2e6a86]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a very commonly encountered acid-base disorder that may be generated by a variety of exogenous and/or endogenous, pathophysiologic mechanisms. Multiple mechanisms are also responsible for the persistence, or maintenance, of metabolic alkalosis. Understanding these generation and maintenance mechanisms helps direct appropriate intervention and correction of this disorder. The framework utilized in this review is based on the ECF volume-centered approach popularized by Donald Seldin and Floyd Rector in the 1970s. Although many subsequent scientific discoveries have advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis, that framework continues to be a valuable and relatively straightforward diagnostic and therapeutic model.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^50205de5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c0522ab7]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic alkalosis is common in patients with respiratory failure and may delay weaning in mechanically ventilated patients. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors block renal bicarbonate reabsorption, and thus reverse metabolic alkalosis. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the benefits and harms of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis.

Methods

We searched the following electronic sources from inception to August 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. Randomized clinical trials were included if they assessed at least one of the following outcomes: mortality, duration of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, adverse events, and blood gas parameters. Teams of two review authors worked in an independent and duplicate manner to select eligible trials, extract data, and assess risk of bias of the included trials. We used meta-analysis to synthesize statistical data and then assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology.

Results

Six eligible studies were identified with a total of 564 participants. The synthesized data did not exclude a reduction or an increase in mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.56) or in duration of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) 0.42 days, 95% CI -4.82 to 5.66) with the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy resulted in a decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation of 27 h (95% CI -50 to -4). Also, it resulted in an increase in PaO 2 (MD 11.37 mmHg, 95% CI 4.18 to 18.56) and a decrease in PaCO 2 (MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -9.66, -0.3), serum bicarbonate (MD -5.03 meq/L, 95% CI -6.52 to -3.54), and pH (MD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01). There was an increased risk of adverse events in the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor group (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.99). Certainty of evidence was judged to be low for most outcomes.

Conclusion

In patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy may have favorable effects on blood gas parameters. In mechanically ventilated patients, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation. A major limitation of this finding was that only two trials assessed this clinically important outcome.

### Lactic alkalosis in intensive care: a red flag? [^42260a19]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

Alkalosis is the most common acid–base disturbance that develops in critically ill patients. Indeed, the study by Mæhle et al. based on more than 100,000 samples showed that the median base excess (BE) increases steadily during the stay of critically ill patients, due to multiple factors such as diuretics and hypoprotidemia. Despite these findings, alkalosis is still relatively neglected in the field of intensive care research. As an illustrative example, a PubMed search performed on 04/10/2023 showed 10 time less results for [alkalosis AND intensive care] as compared with [acidosis AND intensive care]. In our intensive care unit (ICU), we regularly observe patients with both alkalosis and mild hyperlactatemia, without any obvious cause for hyperlactatemia. We therefore requested through electronic health record (IntelliSpace Critical Care and Anesthesia, Philips ®) all arterial blood gases associated with lactate measurement performed in ourICU (Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon), between the January 1, 2014, and the October 31, 2022. The analysis was performed with the appropriate regulatory agreement (CNIL N°2,228,340). After restricting our analysis to pH values of 7.45 or higher, 57,393 samples were identified with the following distribution: 46% (26,578) with pH within 7.45–7.47, 39% (22,223) within 7.48–7.51, 11% (6,023) within 7.52–7.54, 1,718 (3%) within 7.55–7.57, 1% (579) within 7.58–7.60, and less than 1% (272) over 7.6. The median associated lactate measurement was 1.4 IQR [1.0–1.9] mmol/l. After categorizing the pH values along pre-defined cut points, we observed that lactate measurement increased along with pH values (Fig. 1, panel A). Using linear regression, we showed that the ascension of 1 / 10 of pH was associated with an increase of 0.33 mmol/l of lactate measurement (p < 0.001). The 90th percentile of lactate measurement in the different categories of pH was constantly increasing (as illustrated in Fig. 1 by a red dot) at 2.4 mmol/l, 2.5 mmol/l, 2.7 mmol/l, 2.9 mmol/l, 3.3 mmol/l, and 3.5 mmol/l. Additionally, we used BE to separate metabolic alkalosis (pH > 7.45 and BE > 3 mmol/L, N = 29,486 (51%)) from respiratory and mixed alkalosis (pH > 7.45 and BE ≤ 3 mmol/l, N = 29,907 (49%)). The same association between serum lactate and pH was present in both categories (Fig. 1, panel B).

Results

Patients

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1, and baseline acid–base and electrolyte data are presented in Table 2. Of the patients studied, 87% were mechanically ventilated (all in an assisted mode of ventilation in which spontaneous breathing activity was fully possible). Although 47% of the patients were treated with diuretics, none exhibited clinical symptoms of hypovolaemia. Furthermore, low urinary chloride excretion (< 20 mmol/l), which is indicative of hypovolaemia in patients who do not use diuretics, was present in only one patient. Intravenous and enteral intake of sodium chloride, as well as ventilator settings and diuretic dose, were not changed during the study period.

### Respiratory alkalosis [^b0ff4e73]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is an extremely common and complicated problem affecting virtually every organ system in the body. This article reviews the various facets of this interesting problem. Respiratory alkalosis produces multiple metabolic abnormalities, from changes in potassium, phosphate, and calcium, to the development of a mild lactic acidosis. Renal handling of the above ions is also affected. The etiologies may be related to pulmonary or extrapulmonary disorders. Hyperventilation syndrome is a common etiology of respiratory alkalosis in the emergency department setting and is a diagnosis by exclusion. There are many cardiac effects of respiratory alkalosis, such as tachycardia, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and ischemic and nonischemic chest pain. In the lungs, vasodilation occurs, and in the gastrointestinal system there are changes in perfusion, motility, and electrolyte handling. Therapeutically, respiratory alkalosis is used for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. Correction of a respiratory alkalosis is best performed by correcting the underlying etiology.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^8b39a269]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood Pco2 owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated Hco3- levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

### Hypocapnic but not metabolic alkalosis impairs alveolar fluid reabsorption [^447f6ab3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances, such as metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, are relatively common in critically ill patients. We examined the effects of alkalosis (hypocapnic or metabolic alkalosis) on alveolar fluid reabsorption in the isolated and continuously perfused rat lung model. We found that alveolar fluid reabsorption after 1 hour was impaired by low levels of CO2 partial pressure (PCO2; 10 and 20 mm Hg) independent of pH levels (7.7 or 7.4). In addition, PCO2 higher than 30 mm Hg or metabolic alkalosis did not have an effect on this process. The hypocapnia-mediated decrease of alveolar fluid reabsorption was associated with decreased Na, K-ATPase activity and protein abundance at the basolateral membranes of distal airspaces. The effect of low PCO2 on alveolar fluid reabsorption was reversible because clearance normalized after correcting the PCO2 back to normal levels. These data suggest that hypocapnic but not metabolic alkalosis impairs alveolar fluid reabsorption. Conceivably, correction of hypocapnic alkalosis in critically ill patients may contribute to the normalization of lung ability to clear edema.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^e3fb5b89]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The UOG, in contrast to the urine anion gap, is not invalidated by increased excretion of unmeasured anions and therefore is the preferred measure to further analyze the causes for hyperchloremic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Type 1 (distal) RTA is based on defective distal tubular H+ secretion and is characterized by inadequately high urinary pH (> 5.3) during hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In type II (proximal) RTA the underlying cause is a defect in proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption. This results in urinary bicarbonate loss also resulting in inappropriately high urine pH during hyperchloremic acidosis. However, in established type II RTA, after severe bicarbonate depletion has occurred, minimum urinary pH is usually below pH 5.3. Type IV RTA is based on mineralocorticoid deficiency or inadequate renal response to mineralocorticoids. It is characterized by low urinary pH and - contrary to RTA types I/II - hyperkalemia.

The prevalence of RTA and underlying metabolic changes has been studied in patients after kidney transplantation and in osteoporotic patients. However, studies in critically ill patients are lacking.

Based on the physical-chemical approach, more than one metabolic acid-base disorder at the same time was found to be common in critical illness. Thus, 'metabolic acidosis' and 'metabolic alkalosis' may be present in the same patient at the same time, potentially leading to normal pH values. The terms 'acidosis' and 'alkalosis' are defined as separate effects that decrease or increase arterial pH, respectively, whereas 'acidemia' and 'alkalemia' are defined as net arterial pH < 7.35 or > 7.45, respectively.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients and to analyze the underlying acid-base state using a physical-chemical approach according to Gilfix et al.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^09609ec1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some important causes of metabolic alkalosis with variable volume status include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, refeeding syndrome, alkali loading in individuals with reduced GFR, and nonreabsorbable anions such as penicillin and carbenicillin.

Patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism require measurements of renin and aldosterone at baseline and, if necessary, following the saline suppression test. The diagnosis of Bartter, Gitelman, cystic fibrosis, and Pendred syndromes necessitates genetic testing. Diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β- or 17α-hydroxylase deficiency requires specific tests measuring the blood concentration of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, renin, and aldosterone, as well as cortisol and its 17-hydroxylated precursors.

Returning to case 2, thiazide overuse can produce hypercalcemia due to increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but will also cause other electrolyte disturbances such as profound hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are not observed in this patient. Further, the magnitude of hypercalcemia by thiazides is not expected to exceed levels above 14 mg/dL. Thus, option (a) is not the correct answer to Question 3.

Because the patient's PTH level is borderline low, primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia is unlikely. Further, a majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism develop nongap metabolic acidosis due to the direct inhibitory effects of PTH on proximal tubule function, hence option (b) is not correct. In hypercalcemia caused by granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D levels are significantly increased, which is not the case in this patient; thus, option (c) is not correct. Because the PTH-related peptide levels are undetectable, option (e) is incorrect.

The patient's findings of hypercalcemia (PTH-independent), metabolic alkalosis, and decreased kidney function are most likely caused by calcium alkali (milk alkali) syndrome. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of calcium along with an absorbable alkali. The disease was initially described in patients treated for peptic ulcer disease who used milk and sodium bicarbonate for symptomatic relief, but the current dominant etiology is associated with the use of over-the-counter calcium-containing medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or heartburn. Because of the change in the causative agents over the years, several scholars have suggested changing the name to calcium-alkali syndrome to accurately reflect the current pathogenesis of this disorder. Thus, the correct answer to Question 3 is (d).

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

The impact of metabolic alkalosis on the body is diverse and includes effects on the central nervous system (ranging from confusion to coma), peripheral nervous system (neuropathic symptoms such as tingling and numbness), myocardium (arrythmia), and skeletal muscle (weakness and twitching), among others. Some of these signs and symptoms could be due to severe electrolyte derangements either consequent to transcellular shifts (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) or secondary to altering the ratio of free to bound ions (calcium). Metabolic alkalosis is divided into 2 major categories based on whether ECF volume status is contracted or expanded (Box 1). Diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis is established by elevation in blood pH above 7.44 in the setting of high serum HCO 3 − concentration. Arterial blood gas (ABG), or a VBG at a minimum, is required if the diagnosis is in doubt (Fig 6).

A comprehensive patient history can uncover potential causes of metabolic alkalosis such as vomiting or excessive intake of diuretics, laxatives, exogenous HCO 3 −, or licorice. The history can also provide clues toward the presence of diseases such as primary aldosteronism, cystic fibrosis, or possible alkalosis-provoking medications (penicillin, carbenicillins, etc). Physical examination can help in establishing ECF volume contraction. A basic chemistry profile for Na +, K +, Cl −, Mg2 +, SUN, and Scr assists in evaluating kidney function and may provide clues toward the causes of alkalosis.

Based on the systemic blood pressure and urine electrolytes, patients with metabolic alkalosis are divided into chloride-sensitive (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) and chloride-resistant (urine Cl − > 20 mmol/L) groups (Fig 6).

### Sodium lactate for fluid resuscitation: the preferred solution for the coming decades? [^74f310c5]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In a recent issue of Critical Care, 0.5 M sodium lactate infusion for 24 hours was reported to increase cardiac output in patients with acute heart failure. This effect was associated with a concomitant metabolic alkalosis and a negative water balance. Growing data strongly support the role of lactate as a preferential oxidizable substrate to supply energy metabolism leading to improved organ function (heart and brain especially) in ischemic conditions. Due to its sodium/chloride imbalance, this solution prevents hyperchloremic acidosis and limits fluid overload despite the obligatory high sodium load. Sodium lactate solution therefore shows many advantages and appears a very promising means for resuscitation of critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to establish the most appropriate dose and indications for sodium lactate infusion in order to prevent the occurrence of severe hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis.

### Hydrochloric acid infusion for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis in surgical intensive care unit patients [^64d18be5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Older reports of use of hydrochloric acid (HCl) infusions for treatment of metabolic alkalosis document variable dosing strategies and risk.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize use of HCl infusions in surgical intensive care unit patients for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

Methods

This retrospective review included patients who received a HCl infusion for > 8 hours. The primary end point was to evaluate the utility of common acid-base equations for predicting HCl dose requirements. Secondary end points evaluated adverse effects, efficacy, duration of therapy, and total HCl dose needed to correct metabolic alkalosis. Data on demographics, potential causes of metabolic alkalosis, fluid volume, and duration of diuretics as well as laboratory data were collected.

Results

A total of 30 patients were included, and the average HCl infusion rate was 10.5 ± 3.7 mEq/h for an average of 29 ± 14.6 hours. Metabolic alkalosis was primarily diuretic-induced (n = 26). Efficacy was characterized by reduction in the median total serum CO 2 from 34 to 27 mM/L (P < 0.001). The change in chloride ion deficit and change in apparent strong ion difference (SIDa) were not correlated with total HCl administered. There were no documented serious adverse effects related to HCl infusions.

Conclusion

HCl was effective for treating metabolic alkalosis, and no serious adverse events were seen. In this clinical setting, the baseline chloride ion deficit and SIDa were not useful for prediction of total HCl dose requirement, and serial monitoring of response is recommended.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^573f5591]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we should be cautiously enthusiastic. Modifying pH by removing chloride and manipulating the strong ion difference will not treat the underlying cause of the acid–base disorder any more than lowering P 2 or administering sodium bicarbonate does, unless of course the primary derangement is hyperchloremia, elevated P 2, or hyponatremia. Although acidosis with hyperchloremia is quite common in critical illness, preventing hyperchloremia by using the physicochemical approach to guide the choice and composition of fluids is perhaps a simpler and wiser alternative. Furthermore, hyperventilation, sodium bicarbonate administration, and chloride electrodialysis do not directly treat elevated lactate levels, the most common cause of acidosis in critical illness. However, Zanella and colleagues make no such claims. They simply use the physicochemical approach to elegantly show that increasing the strong ion difference restores pH to normal levels. It's conceivable that the same result could be more easily obtained by conventional dialysis, where the dialysate solutions are engineered to target a given strong ion difference. Either way, the manipulation of strong ion difference to achieve specific therapeutic effects is slowly gaining traction, and similar approaches have recently been shown to enhance respiratory support. Whatever the future holds for these therapies, it behooves us to start teaching the physicochemical approach to our medical students and junior colleagues sooner rather than later.

Herein we present a case of severe alkalaemia (pH 7.81) due to suspected acute-on-chronic respiratory alkalosis in a patient with chronic anxiety and metabolic alkalosis secondary to emesis. The patient was managed in the intensive care unit with significant improvement and discharged in stable condition. The case report emphasises considering a broad differential of aetiologies that can cause acid-base status derangements and identifying the appropriate therapeutic approach.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^89e316f2]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Different to previous studies in which hypoalbuminemia was the confounding factor in the interpretation of acid–base data, the alkalinizing factor in the present study was hypochloremia. Albuminemia and the [A tot -] value were lower in patients with low [BE] – which might be due to the presence of shock, a condition that increases extravascular albumin losses. McAuliffe and colleagues described 'primary hypoproteinemic alkalosis' in hypoalbuminemic ICU patients with positive [BE] and elevated [HCO 3 -] levels. Nevertheless, the actual role of hypoalbuminemia to produce metabolic alkalosis has been recently challenged. We previously could only detect one patient fulfilling the criteria of primary hypoproteinemic alkalosis among 700 hypoalbuminemic patients. Wilkes showed that the loss of weak acid secondary to hypoproteinemia is compensated by a renal-mediated increase in [Cl -], so the [SID] decreases without changes in pH.

The presence of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis in patients with normal [BE] can be related to the high number of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, hypochloremia is the consequence of an appropriate kidney response to chronic respiratory acidosis. Despite the prior administration of diuretics being similar both groups, in some patients the diuretics might have contributed to the development of hypochloremia.

Although most of the patients in the normal [BE] group had absolute hypochloremia and most of the patients in the low [BE] group had normal [Cl -] levels, a mechanism other than hypochloremic alkalosis might have contributed to the differences in [Cl -] between both groups. Since shock was more frequently present in patients with low [BE], these patients received more aggressive fluid resuscitation before ICU admission. Consequently, a subtle component of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis might be present in this group.

### Sodium bicarbonate administration for metabolic acidosis in the intensive care unit: a target trial emulation [^351a47b2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is commonly encountered in intensive care units (ICUs) and associated with high mortality rates. Detrimental effects of acidosis include impaired myocardial contractility, arrhythmias, systemic vasoplegia, pulmonary vasoconstriction, impaired response to catecholamines, and reduced immune function. While management should focus on addressing the underlying cause, correcting acid–base status may attenuate the negative effects of acidemia and allow time for other treatments to take effect.

Sodium bicarbonate is frequently used to treat metabolic acidosis in ICU, though the practice varies widely between different countries and individual facilities. Despite a logical rationale for its use, two small trials did not demonstrate that it directly improved hemodynamic parameters. Bicarbonate administration is associated with potential harms, including rebound alkalosis, hypocalcaemia, hypokalemia, hypotension, and thrombophlebitis. Concerns have also been raised about worsening intracellular acidosis due to increased CO 2, which readily diffuses across cell membranes.

BICAR-ICU was an open-label randomized-controlled trial (RCT) of bicarbonate administration in 389 patients with pH < 7.2. It showed non-significant results overall for a composite of mortality and organ dysfunction, but reduced mortality in the subgroup with acute kidney injury (AKI). Observational studies report conflicting results, varying from potentially dramatic benefits to no significant difference in outcome or even possible harm. The use of observational data is particularly challenging, as bicarbonate is often preferentially administered to the most unwell patients. Robust analysis requires careful attention to potential biases as well as adjustment for confounding.

The conduct of future RCTs can be optimized by clarifying the anticipated treatment effect using well-conducted analyses of high-volume observational data. The aim of this project was to use a large, multi-center ICU dataset to perform a target trial emulation evaluating the effect of bicarbonate administration on mortality. Our hypothesis was that bicarbonate administration, compared to no bicarbonate, would reduce ICU mortality in patients with metabolic acidosis.

### Metabolic alkalosis… [^3516ea8a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC ALKALOSIS, a primary increase in the alkali content of the blood, is commonly seen in hospital practice. Increase in blood pH reduces ionized calcium concentration and can lead to tetany. The irritability of the CNS increases and convulsive tendencies are aggravated. Respiration can be depressed. Electrocardiographic changes resemble those of hypokalemia. Especially in patients receiving digitalis, or when there already exists serious systemic disease, alkalosis may be a potentially serious hazard.

1. DEFINITION OF METABOLIC ALKALOSIS As the Pco2 of blood rises above the normal value of 40 mm Hg, blood pH falls. Progressive reduction of Pco2, below normal, leads to elevated blood pH. The actual confidence band relating pH to Pco2 of arterial blood has been experimentally determined. 2 Metabolic alkalosis is defined by a blood pH above that predicted for the prevailing Pco2, for only removal of excessive.

### Acetazolamide: a second wind for a respiratory stimulant in the intensive care unit? [^f1cfac59]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are affected by episodes of respiratory exacerbations, some of which can be severe and may necessitate respiratory support. Prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality rates. Persistent failure to discontinue invasive mechanical ventilation is a major issue in patients with COPD. Pure or mixed metabolic alkalosis is a common finding in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with a worse outcome. In patients with COPD, the condition is called post-hypercapnic alkalosis and is a complication of mechanical ventilation. Reversal of metabolic alkalosis may facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation of patients with COPD. Acetazolamide, a non-specific carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is one of the drugs employed in the ICU to reverse metabolic alkalosis. The drug is relatively safe, undesirable effects being rare. The compartmentalization of the different isoforms of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme may, in part, explain the lack of evidence of the efficacy of acetazolamide as a respiratory stimulant. Recent findings suggest that the usually employed doses of acetazolamide in the ICU may be insufficient to significantly improve respiratory parameters in mechanically ventilated patients with COPD. Randomized controlled trials using adequate doses of acetazolamide are required to address this issue.

### Acetazolamide in critically ill neonates and children with metabolic alkalosis [^90e33ea5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acetazolamide is an option for hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, but there are limited reports in children.

Objective

To describe the acetazolamide regimen and outcomes in critically ill children with metabolic alkalosis.

Methods

This was a descriptive, retrospective study of patients < 18 years of age who received ≥ 3 doses of acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis (ie, pH > 7.45 and bicarbonate [HCO3] > 26 mEq/L). Patients receiving other treatments for metabolic alkalosis within 24 hours of acetazolamide were excluded. The primary objective was to identify the mean dose and duration of acetazolamide. Secondary objectives were to determine the number of patients with treatment success (ie, serum HCO3 22–26 mEq/L) and occurrence of adverse events.

Results

Thirty-four patients were included for analysis, the median age was 0.25 years (range = 0.05–12 years). The acetazolamide regimen included a mean dose of 4.98 ± 1.14 mg/kg for a mean number of 6.1 ± 5.3 (range = 3–24) doses. The majority (70.6%) received acetazolamide every 8 hours. Treatment success was achieved in 10 (29.4%) patients. Statistically significant differences were noted between the pre-acetazolamide and post-acetazolamide pH and HCO3, 7.51 ± 0.05 versus 7.37 ± 0.05 (P < .001) and 39.4 ± 6.1 mEq/L versus 31.4 ± 7.5 mEq/L (P < .001), respectively.

Conclusions

This is the first study to evaluate acetazolamide dosing for metabolic alkalosis in children with and without cardiac disease. Acetazolamide treatment resulted in improved HCO3, but the majority of patients did not achieve our definition of treatment success. Future studies should elucidate the optimal acetazolamide regimen.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^32549c77]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

Chloride-Resistant Alkalosis

The treatment of metabolic alkalosis with volume expansion (urine Cl − > 20 mmol/L and elevated blood pressure) is mainly directed at modification of the primary cause when associated with high mineralocorticoid states, and the correction of hypokalemia. Removing the source of mineralocorticoid excess, as in adrenal or pituitary tumors, is the cornerstone of this therapy. In other cases, such as in primary hyperaldosteronism, treatment could be pursued via direct hormone blockade with the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone) or via amiloride, an ENaC blocker. The effect of this blockade will enhance NaCl excretion and K + retention, thereby improving the patient's alkalosis and hypertension.

It is critical to identify and remove exogenous factors that could potentially contribute to mineralocorticoid stimulation (ie, licorice, carbenoxolone). Almost all cases of Cl − -resistant alkalosis are associated with hypokalemia; therefore, the correction of K + deficiency is essential to diminish the severity of metabolic alkalosis. The judicious use of oral or intravenous K + supplementation is advised, depending on the severity of the hypokalemia. Restriction of Na + and the addition of K + in the diet could help in improving the alkalosis. NCC will become active during hypokalemia, thus enhancing the salt absorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and worsening the hypertension. Correction of hypokalemia will restore NCC activity toward normal, and could potentially mitigate the severity of hypertension in individuals with Cl − -resistant metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia.

### The expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism: implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment [^41bfa5a3]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is characterized by aldosterone secretion that is independent of renin and angiotensin II and sodium status. The deleterious effects of primary aldosteronism are mediated by excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor that results in the well-known consequences of volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but it also increases the risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as death. For decades, the approaches to defining, diagnosing, and treating primary aldosteronism have been relatively constant and generally focused on detecting and treating the more severe presentations of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is much greater than previously recognized, and that milder and nonclassical forms of renin-independent aldosterone secretion that impart heightened cardiovascular risk may be common. Public health efforts to prevent aldosterone-mediated end-organ disease will require improved capabilities to diagnose all forms of primary aldosteronism while optimizing the treatment approaches such that the excess risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease is adequately mitigated. In this review, we present a physiologic approach to considering the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of primary aldosteronism. We review evidence suggesting that primary aldosteronism manifests across a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to overt, that correlates with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we review emerging evidence from genetic studies that begin to provide a theoretical explanation for the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism and a link to its phenotypic severity spectrum and prevalence. Finally, we review human studies that provide insights into the optimal approach toward the treatment of primary aldosteronism.

Pathogenesis of Metabolic Alkalosis

Case 1:

A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental state after being found unresponsive at home by his neighbors. Little is known about his medical history except for a few medications found in his home, including over-the-counter antacids and ibuprofen. His neighbors indicated the patient had a history of heavy smoking and noticed some weight loss over the last 6 months. On arrival, his blood pressure was 95/57 mm Hg, pulse rate was 96 beats/min, and he was afebrile. The oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92%. Basic chemistry laboratory testing showed Na +, 142 mEq/L; K +, 2.9 mEq/L; Cl −, 90 mEq/L; HCO 3 −, 45 mEq/L; total calcium, 9.1 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen (SUN), 38 mg/dL; and serum creatinine (Scr), 1.7 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH, 7.48; Pa 2, 52 mm Hg; and PaO 2, 70 mm Hg. The nephrology service was consulted for the workup and management of the acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities.

Question 1:
The differential diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia in this patient should include (select the best answer):

Excessive use of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide
Ectopic corticotropin production due to possible lung malignancy
Intake of HCO 3 − -containing antacid for heartburn in the setting of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Gastric outlet obstruction with vomiting

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

Box 1 displays the major causes of metabolic alkalosis, which are divided into 2 distinct categories based on intravascular volume status. The following sections will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis in gastric acid loss and diuretic overuse as the 2 prototypes of GI and kidney acid loss with volume depletion. We will then discuss the role of mineralocorticoid excess in the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in both volume-depleted and volume-expanded states.

### Round table discussion: ACIDOSIS AND ALKALOSIS… [^90d5b0e4]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Acidosis and alkalosis are terms used to describe opposite types of disturbance of acid-base balance of the body fluids. From the chemical point of view acidosis may be defined as the condition in the blood characterized by a reduction of the BHCO. 3/HHCO 3 ratio, and alkalosis as an increase. When BHCO 3 is primarily affected, the disturbance is referred to as metabolic in origin; when HHCO 3 concentration is the first to be altered, the resulting change is considered to be of respiratory origin. Primary changes of either BHCO 3 or HHCO 3 usually stimulate compensatory changes in the other which tend to restore the original normal ratio. When compensation for acidosis is incomplete, an increased H + ion concentration of the blood results, and such a change is referred to as acidemia. The opposite condition is called alkalemia.

From the clinical point of view a much broader concept of acidosis and alkalosis exists and includes in addition all related changes in metabolism which may give rise to definite symptoms and signs of illness. Such metabolic changes may be either primary or secondary, and, as either, may be very important in determining prognosis as to life or death. The most important signs and symptoms of acidosis are: hyperpnea, which is considered not primary, stupor, dehydration, ketosis and strongly acid urine. Any or all may be absent. The most important signs and symptoms of alkalosis are: depressed respiration, considered compensatory, or hyperventilation, considered primary, tetany, and forceful vomiting, thought to be the result of pyloric or high intestinal obstruction, and strongly alkaline urine. For absolute diagnosis of acidosis or alkalosis two of the three variables, BHCO 3, HHCO 3 and pH have to be determined.

Since pH and BHCO 3 usually move in the same direction, it has been widespread clinical practice to determine only BHCO 3 by determining serum CO 2 content by the Van Slyke manometric method. In this connection it should be remembered that when so determined about 20/21 of the CO 2 comes from BHCO 3, the remainder coming from HHCO 3 In the past it was customary not to separate BHCO 3 and HHCO 3, but to record them together as the total CO 2 content.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^81b4c8bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^31593131]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective, multiple-center study was conducted during a thirteen-month period in five ICUs. In accordance with French law, informed consent was not mandatory, given that this observational study did not modify diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. This study was approved by the Montpellier University Hospital Institutional Review Board and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology recommendations for reporting observational studies.

Definitions

"Severe acidemia" was defined as a pH below 7.20. Respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis and other mixed disorders were categorized using the classical method (namely, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation) with base excess and corrected anion gap (AG) (corrected AG = (measured AG + (40 g/dl - (albuminemia ÷ 10 g/dl))).

Therefore, we defined the following specific acidemia as follows. (1) "Severe metabolic acidemia" comprised pH less than 7.20, bicarbonatemia less than 22 mmol/L, base excess less than or equal to 5 mmol/L and expected partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) = bicarbonatemia × 1.5 + 8 ± 2 mmHg. (2) "Severe respiratory acidemia" was defined as pH less than 7.20, PaCO 2 greater than 45 mmHg and expected bicarbonatemia = (PaCO 2–40) ÷ 10 + 24). (3) "Severe mixed acidemia" was the classification for secondary response to the primary process outside the expected range.

Patients

All consecutive patients who experienced severe acidemia within the first 24 hours of their ICU admission were screened, and those who presented with either single metabolic acidemia or mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia were included. Patients admitted for diabetic ketoacidosis were excluded from the outcome analysis, as their mortality risk in the ICU is very low and may not represent the risk level among the whole population. Furthermore, because one of the aims of the present study was to describe the use of sodium bicarbonate to treat severe acidemia, patients admitted with a single severe respiratory acidemia were not analyzed in detail, because they were considered not to be candidates for that treatment. No guidelines, advice or documentation were given to the intensivists regarding acidemia, treatment or routine daily care.

### Bench-to-bedside review: treating acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit – the role of renal replacement therapy [^bddac986]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in critically ill patients. Metabolic acid-base disorders are particularly common in patients who require acute renal replacement therapy. In these patients, metabolic acidosis is common and multifactorial in origin. Analysis of acid-base status using the Stewart-Figge methodology shows that these patients have greater acidemia despite the presence of hypoalbuminemic alkalosis. This acidemia is mostly secondary to hyperphosphatemia, hyperlactatemia, and the accumulation of unmeasured anions. Once continuous hemofiltration is started, profound changes in acid-base status are rapidly achieved. They result in the progressive resolution of acidemia and acidosis, with a lowering of concentrations of phosphate and unmeasured anions. However, if lactate-based dialysate or replacement fluid are used, then in some patients hyperlactatemia results, which decreases the strong ion difference and induces an iatrogenic metabolic acidosis. Such hyperlactatemic acidosis is particularly marked in lactate-intolerant patients (shock with lactic acidosis and/or liver disease) and is particularly strong if high-volume hemofiltration is performed with the associated high lactate load, which overcomes the patient's metabolic capacity for lactate. In such patients, bicarbonate dialysis seems desirable. In all patients, once hemofiltration is established, it becomes the dominant force in controlling metabolic acid-base status and, in stable patients, it typically results in a degree of metabolic alkalosis. The nature and extent of these acid-base changes is governed by the intensity of plasma water exchange/dialysis and by the 'buffer' content of the replacement fluid/dialysate, with different effects depending on whether lactate, acetate, citrate, or bicarbonate is used. These effects can be achieved in any patient irrespective of whether they have acute renal failure, because of the overwhelming effect of plasma water exchange on nonvolatile acid balance. Critical care physicians must understand the nature, origin, and magnitude of alterations in acid-base status seen with acute renal failure and during continuous hemofiltration if they wish to provide their patients with safe and effective care.

### Pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis: a new classification based on the centrality of stimulated collecting duct ion transport [^87d62f08]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a unique acid-base disorder because it can be induced and sustained by functional alterations in renal ion transport. This review summarizes more than 50 years of research into the pathophysiologic processes causing this disorder. The evidence reviewed supports the hypothesis that virtually all forms of metabolic alkalosis are sustained by enhanced collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion, induced by stimulation of sodium uptake through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Enhanced collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion in metabolic alkalosis occurs most commonly secondary to changes in ion transport earlier along the nephron, but also can occur as the result of primary stimulation of ENaC. In both these settings, potassium secretion is stimulated, and abnormal potassium losses cause depletion of body potassium stores. Potassium depletion has a key role in sustaining metabolic alkalosis by stimulating renal hydrogen ion secretion, enhancing renal ammonium production and excretion, and downregulating sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle and early distal tubule. A new classification of the causes of metabolic alkalosis is proposed based on these pathophysiologic events rather than response to treatment.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^92987594]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective multicentre observational study, during the postoperative period, the presence of metabolic acidosis demonstrated an inverse relationship with survival in high-risk surgical patients, particularly in cases where metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. When examining patients with metabolic acidosis and concurrent mixed disorders, the application of the Delta-AG/delta-Bic calculation revealed distinct outcomes. Specifically, patients experiencing metabolic acidosis without accompanying mixed disorders displayed high risk to ICU mortality and an increased occurrence of postoperative complications, as opposed to those presenting with a combination of hyperchloremia or alkalosis.

Our findings are consistent with those observed in our prior study and other investigations conducted on high-risk surgical and critically ill patients. Over half of the patients experienced postoperative acidosis, with the most prevalent type being MA characterized by an elevated anion gap. Metabolic acidosis has been identified as a contributing risk factor for unfavourable outcomes in major surgical procedures, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract, which was the predominant occurrence of metabolic acidosis in our analysis. The presence of high AG, in our study, most discriminates the correlation with survival of patients. In our study, the elevated anion gap emerges as the primary discriminator in relation to patient survival. It is noteworthy that specific factors associated with gastrointestinal tract surgeries, including the administration of substantial volumes of saline solution, accumulation of lactate, and depletion of bicarbonate through surgical drainage, are likely contributors to the heightened occurrence of metabolic acidosis observed within this distinct patient subgroup.

Mineralocorticoid Excess and Metabolic Alkalosis

Almost all cases of metabolic alkalosis present with an excess of mineralocorticoids. Most represent RAS stimulation consequent to decreased intravascular volume, which encompasses conditions with either true vascular volume deficit (ie, vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or overuse of diuretics) or decreased effective vascular volume (ie, congestive heart failure). The other major category of metabolic alkalosis with increased mineralocorticoids encompasses patients with normal or expanded vascular volume such as in primary aldosteronism. The role of mineralocorticoid excess in the generation and or the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in volume-depleted or volume-expanded states will be discussed in the following sections.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Depleted States

The maintenance phase of metabolic alkalosis in disease states associated with ECF volume contraction refers to a period after the generation phase where the initiating factors responsible for increased arterial pH and HCO 3 − concentration (vomiting or diuretic overuse) may have abated but the metabolic alkalosis persists. Factors that impair the elimination of excess serum HCO 3 − will prevent the correction of metabolic alkalosis. The most important among these factors are decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) consequent to volume contraction, hypochloremia, K + deficiency, and steroid (aldosterone) excess. The role of these factors in the maintenance of gastric alkalosis and diuretic-induced alkalosis will be discussed in the following sections.

Decreased Kidney Perfusion

Both vomiting (or nasogastric suctioning) and chloruretic diuretic overuse are associated with ECF volume contraction consequent to the loss of Cl − -rich fluid in the stomach or kidney tubules, respectively, resulting in decreased kidney perfusion and GFR. The reduction in GFR reduces the amount of filtered HCO 3 −, preventing effective removal of excess HCO 3 − from the blood compartment.

Hypochloremia

Almost all patients with metabolic alkalosis and vascular volume depletion display both hypochloremia and kidney hypoperfusion (low GFR). Low serum Cl − directly results from the loss of Cl − into the lumen of the stomach and kidney tubules. This interferes with renal HCO 3 − excretion via several mechanisms, one of which is the impairment of HCO 3 − secretion in B-intercalated cells via pendrin (Fig 5A), which is inactivated both due to the low luminal Cl − concentration and the transcriptional downregulation consequent to K + depletion (Fig 5B).

The compensatory alveolar hypoventilation in metabolic alkalosis leads to hypercapnia (elevated arterial carbon dioxide; Pa 2), which blunts the rise in arterial pH due to elevated HCO 3 − concentration. Although hypercapnia occurs gradually as a respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis, it enhances the HCO 3 − reabsorptive capacity of the kidney tubules and thus prevents HCO 3 − excretion. Hypercapnia together with vascular volume depletion, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and mineralocorticoid excess contribute to the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Expanded States

In conditions associated with the primary increase in circulating mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids, the vascular volume is increased due to augmented salt absorption in the collecting duct (Fig 4B). The initiation of metabolic alkalosis in the aforementioned states is gradual and is primarily due to enhanced H + excretion in A-intercalated cells. This process is driven by increased luminal negative electrogenicity consequent to aldosterone-dependent Na + absorption via the apical sodium channel, ENaC (Fig 4B). A similar driving force enhances K + secretion into the lumen of the collecting duct, creating a state of K + wasting. The aldosterone-induced hypokalemia plays a critical role in the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis by increasing acid secretion and HCO 3 − absorption in several nephron segments as discussed previously (Fig 2B). Diseases such as primary aldosteronism and Cushing syndrome present with this abnormality, as does excess licorice ingestion. In conditions associated with primary stimulation of the RAAS (renal artery stenosis, renin-producing tumors, etc), increased angiotensin II levels intensify net acid excretion in the distal nephron, hence contributing to the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis.

Recovery Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis

The recovery phase occurs when the existing deficits (volume, Cl −, or K +) are corrected, and the continued losses (via kidney or GI tract) are halted. Agents that are responsible for the loss of acid (ie, loop diuretics, licorice, etc) or gain of alkali (oral bicarbonate or citrate) need to be discontinued.

Acetazolamide could increase the renal excretion of HCO 3 −, potentially correcting her alkalosis, but will not help to correct this patient's hypercalcemia and volume depletion. Further, the beneficial effect of acetazolamide in enhancing HCO 3 − excretion is partly blunted in patients with ECF volume contraction. Finally, the use of acetazolamide is relatively contraindicated in kidney failure and should be used with extreme caution to avoid acetazolamide neurotoxicity consequent to impaired renal excretion. Thus, option (b) is not correct.

Aggressive volume expansion not only enhances calcium excretion but also increases HCO 3 − wastage. The improvement in the severity of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of hypercalcemia has significant therapeutic ramifications on both the salt wasting (from the thick limb), as well as the calcium excretion. The increase in extracellular pH due to metabolic alkalosis independently activates basolateral CaSR in the thick ascending limb of Henle and apical/basolateral CaSR in the distal convoluted tubule. Together, these processes initiate a self-perpetuating cycle by inhibiting salt absorption in the thick ascending limb and activating calcium absorption (via calcium transporter 2 [TRPV5]) in the distal convoluted tubules. For this reason, patients with hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis tend to recover relatively fast when this vicious circle is interrupted by the administration of high volumes of isotonic solutions. Aggressive volume expansion is the most important initial therapeutic maneuver in hypercalcemia and metabolic alkalosis, making (c) the best answer to Question 4. Reports of aggressive volume expansion in conjunction with loop diuretics for the treatment of hypercalcemia with volume contraction have been published.

Even though bisphosphonates and occasionally calcitonin are considered first-line treatment in hypercalcemia, correction of volume depletion should be the first choice in the setting of hypercalcemia, volume depletion, and metabolic alkalosis, which is why options (d) and (e) are not correct.

The patient was started on a normal saline infusion at 200 mL/h and her calcium level and mental status improved 24 hours after admission.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (BICAR-ICU): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial [^0958b73f]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial, as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods

We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. We included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia (pH ≤ 7·20, PaCO 2 ≤ 45 mm Hg, and sodium bicarbonate concentration ≤ 20 mmol/L) and with a total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 or more or an arterial lactate concentration of 2 mmol/L or more. We randomly assigned patients (1:1), by stratified randomisation with minimisation via a restricted web platform, to receive either no sodium bicarbonate (control group) or 4·2% of intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (bicarbonate group) to maintain the arterial pH above 7·30. Our protocol recommended that the volume of each infusion should be within the range of 125–250 mL in 30 min, with a maximum of 1000 mL within 24 h after inclusion. Randomisation criteria were stratified among three prespecified strata: age, sepsis status, and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) score. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause by day 28 and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. All analyses were done on data from the intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who underwent randomisation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02476253.

Findings

Between May 5, 2015, and May 7, 2017, we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population (194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 (71%) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 (66%) of 195 in the bicarbonate group (absolute difference estimate -5·5%, 95% CI -15·2 to 4·2; p = 0·24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant (46% [95% CI 40–54] vs 55% [49–63]; p = 0·09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3, the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant (37% [95% CI 28–48] vs 54% [45–65]; p = 0·0283). Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatraemia, and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group, with no life-threatening complications reported.

Interpretation

In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia, sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However, sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^601e5fd2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The major renal response to metabolic acidosis is increased NH4 + excretion. Therefore, a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function (glomerular filtration rate > 25 ml/min) represents an inadequate renal response and is characteristic for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

Subtypes of RTA were determined as follows:

RTA type I (distal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH ≥ 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + secretion in the distal tubule.

RTA type II (proximal): hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and low/normal plasma potassium (< 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced HCO 3− reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

RTA type IV: hyperchloremic acidosis with a minimum urine pH < 5.3 and high plasma potassium (≥ 5.5 mmol/L), based on reduced H + and K + excretion in the distal tubule.

Transient RTA was defined as RTA on a single study day, while persistent RTA was defined as RTA on two or more days.

Objectives

The primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of RTA in critically ill patients during the first week after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, defined as hyperchloremic acidosis (BE Chloride) ≤ −5 mmol/L), a UOG of less than 150 mosmol/kg, and a preserved renal function. Secondary outcome measures were to evaluate the risk factors for RTA.

### Acetazolamide therapy for metabolic alkalosis in critically ill pediatric patients [^23c3e416]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite a paucity of supporting literature, acetazolamide is commonly used in critically ill children with metabolic alkalosis (elevated plasma bicarbonate [pHco-3] and pH). The objective of this study was to assess the change in 18 hours after initiation of acetazolamide therapy.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

PICU of an urban, tertiary-care children's hospital.

Patients

Mechanically ventilated children (≤ 17 yr) with metabolic alkalosis (pHco-3 ≥ 35 mmol/L).

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 153 consecutively screened patients, 61 patients (29 female patients) were enrolled: 18 cardiac patients (after congenital heart disease repair) and 43 noncardiac patients. The cardiac patients were younger than the noncardiac patients (median [interquartile range] age, 0.6 mo [0.3–2.5 mo] vs 7.4 mo [2.8–39.9 mo]; p < 0.00001) and had higher preacetazolamide baseline diuretic scores and urine output. The pHco-3 levels 18 hours after initiation of acetazolamide were reduced in the cohort as a whole (40.2 ± 4.8 to 36.2 ± 5.6 mmol/L; p < 0.001) and in the noncardiac patients, but they were unchanged in the cardiac patients. The PCO2 remained unchanged after acetazolamide in both subgroups. Because young age and presence of cardiac disease were potential confounders, the 20 noncardiac patients who are 6 months old or younger were compared with the cardiac subgroup and demonstrated reduced pHco-3 after acetazolamide and lower preacetazolamide baseline diuretic score and urine output.

Conclusion

Acetazolamide reduces pHco-3 concentration in critically ill, mechanically ventilated children overall, but it did not do so in cardiac patients in our cohort, even in comparison with noncardiac patients of a similar age. These findings do not support the current use of acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis in critically ill children with congenital heart disease. Further study is required to determine why these cardiac patients respond differently to acetazolamide than noncardiac patients and whether this response impacts important clinical outcomes, for example, weaning mechanical ventilation.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^ae4067e2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 4:
The most critical step contributing to this patient's metabolic alkalosis and kidney failure is:

Decreased kidney perfusion due to vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles
Activation of the RAAS
Downregulation of the water channel aquaporin (AQP2) in the collecting duct
Inhibition of NKCC2 due to calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation in the loop of Henle

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

The patient in case 2 presented with metabolic alkalosis, kidney failure, and profound hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause vasoconstriction of the afferent renal arterioles, which decreases GFR. The vasoconstriction could contribute to a decline in kidney function but does not play any significant role in salt wasting or metabolic alkalosis, making option (a) implausible.

The ECF volume contraction due to salt wasting activates the RAS, which stimulates H + secretion in the collecting duct in an attempt to blunt the Na + loss. This enhances HCO 3 − absorption and may increase arterial HCO 3 − concentration and pH. However, RAS activation per se does not lead to salt wasting and kidney failure, making option (b) incorrect.

Inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone-dependent apical water channel (AQP2) activity in hypercalcemia causes the inability to concentrate urine (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), which may increase fluid loss. However, the increase in water diuresis per se should not cause metabolic alkalosis or kidney failure, so option (c) is not correct.

Studies on the impact of hypercalcemia on kidney physiology show the activation of the CaSR in the thick ascending limb, which inhibits NKCC2 and as a consequence produces salt wasting and volume contraction (Fig 7). For individuals consuming large amounts of calcium and alkali mixtures (calcium carbonate, etc), the generation of hypercalcemia and its attendant salt wasting and volume contraction (Fig 7) will precipitate kidney failure and exacerbate the magnitude of metabolic alkalosis due to the impaired excretion of consumed bicarbonate, making (d) the best answer for Question 4. In addition, the presence of volume contraction activates the RAS, which could exacerbate the magnitude of metabolic alkalosis (Fig 4).

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^669f4de6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

### Alkali therapy for respiratory acidosis: a medical controversy [^6a0ad1d4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Alkali therapy for certain organic acidoses remains a topic of ongoing controversy, but little attention has been given to a related medical controversy, namely the prescription of alkali for respiratory acidosis. We first describe the determinants of carbon dioxide retention in the 2 types of respiratory failure; hypercapnic respiratory failure and hypoxemic respiratory failure with coexisting hypercapnia. We then highlight the deleterious consequences of severe acidemia for several organ systems, particularly the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. We argue that alkali therapy is not indicated for respiratory acidosis as a simple acid-base disturbance. Notwithstanding, we recommend prescription of alkali for severe acidemia caused by mixed acidosis (ie, combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis) or permissive hypercapnia. We examine the utility of alkali therapy in various clinical scenarios incorporating respiratory acidosis. We conclude that controlled studies will be required to test the impact of alkali therapy on clinical outcomes of these clinical settings. Such studies should also examine the optimal mode of administering alkali (amount, rate, and tonicity) and the blood pH to be targeted. The development of new buffers should be explored, especially systems that do not generate carbon dioxide or even consume it.

### The early phase of critical illness is a progressive acidic state due to unmeasured anions [^9ecbd1d4]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Stewart's and Fencl's methods have recently been proposed to interpret acid-base disorders where traditional theory has proven inadequate. Our objectives were to evaluate: (1) the occurrence of acid-base disturbances in critically ill patients and their trend over the first 3 intensive care unit days, (2) whether Stewart's theory offers advantages over the traditional theory in the diagnosis of acid-base metabolic disturbances and (3) whether variables derived from Stewart's and Fencl's methods offer advantages over the traditional method to predict patient mortality.

Methods

A prospective cohort study in a general intensive care unit. Blood samples were analysed for arterial blood gases, electrolytes and proteins. PaCO2, pH, bicarbonate, base excess, standard base-excess, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium and lactate were measured. Anion gap, Stewart's and Fencl's variables were calculated.

Results

When using Stewart's method, metabolic acidosis and metabolic alkalosis were found in 92.9% and 93.4% of samples, respectively. Corresponding figures obtained with the traditional method were 15% and 18.7%. In 245 (64.5%) samples, Stewart's method revealed that metabolic acidosis and alkalosis were simultaneously present, whereas the traditional method revealed a normal acid-base status. Strong ion gap increased significantly over the first 3 intensive care unit days. Strong ion gap and lactate were independent predictors of 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Metabolic acidosis by unmeasured anions is a clinically relevant phenomenon, which is correlated with mortality. Progressive metabolic acidosis may be ongoing in the early phase of critical illness despite the absence of acidaemia.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^82bc1ed7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Acidemia" can be defined as the accumulation of protons in the plasma which results in a lower blood pH if secondary responses are overwhelmed. In critically ill patients, acidosis is often the result of a combination of single disorders occurring simultaneously that are commonly known collectively as "mixed acid-base disorders".

Although "severe acidemia" is not a universally accepted term, it usually indicates that plasma pH is lower than 7.20. Severe acidemia can be critical, especially when an extremely low pH develops quickly. Clinical manifestations of severe acidemia include cerebral edema, seizures, diaphragm dysfunction, decreased myocardial contractility, pulmonary vasoconstriction and systemic vasodilatation. Acidemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and previous studies have described the incidence and mechanisms of acidosis occurring in the ICU. Surprisingly, however, these studies failed to focus specifically on severe acidemia. Furthermore, despite the fact that severe acidemia reflects a serious underlying disease that should be treated as soon as possible, the treatment of acidemia by itself with the administration of intravenous buffers remains controversial. Indeed, notwithstanding experts' opinions arguing against treatment with intravenous buffers except in dedicated situations (for example, massive digestive fluid loss during diarrhea or tubular acidosis), 86% of polled US nephrologists indicated that they would prescribe buffers to treat lactic acidosis in patients with a targeted pH above 7.20. Moreover, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests not treating lactic acidosis when the plasma pH level is above 7.15, but does not give any recommendations for cases where the plasma pH level is below this threshold. To date there have been only two small, prospective, randomized crossover studies assessing the impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment for lactic acidosis on hemodynamic, acid-base and electrolyte changes. Both studies included 24 patients and could not address any difference in terms of morbidity and mortality with regard to whether the patients had first been treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Therefore, we had two aims in our study. First, we sought to describe the incidence of severely metabolic or mixed acidemia patients admitted to the ICU. Second, we wanted to describe the outcomes of patients who had been treated at the onset of acidemia (within the first 24 hours of ICU admission) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate compared with those who had not. We hypothesized that severe acidosis within the 24 first hours after ICU admission is an infrequent phenomenon but that its correction rather than its initial severity is associated with prognosis.

### Alkalemia during continuous renal replacement therapy and mortality in critically ill patients [^fe811aeb]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Acid-base disorders are common in critically ill patients. Once continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is initiated, it becomes a major determinant of acid-base status. We hypothesized that therapy-induced alkalemia and alkalosis is associated with increased mortality.

Patients

The CCF-ARF Registry (1995–01) was used to identify 405 patients supported with bicarbonate based continuous hemodialysis. Proportion of days with an elevated pH to the number of days with normal pH was used to assess the association of alkalemia and the number of days with alkalemia, and mortality. Multivariable analyses were used to adjust for days with acidosis, and other relevant covariates.

Main Results

Serum bicarbonate and pH levels plateau after 48 hrs of CRRT. Study subjects had on average 1.5 ± 2.9 days where pH was greater than 7.45, and .4 days where serum bicarbonate level was greater than 28 mmol/L, during a median of 9 days of CRRT. Daily dialysis dose was inversely associated with the number of days with a low serum bicarbonate level, but was not associated with increased frequency of an elevated pH or serum bicarbonate level. Increasing proportion of days with elevated pH or serum bicarbonate was not associated with increased mortality in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Alkalemia and alkalosis occur frequently during CRRT, but they are not associated with increased mortality. Persistent acidosis and acidemia while on CRRT was a strong predictor of poor outcome.

### Disorders of sodium [^5561e26a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important history items to ascertain is if the patient has symptoms and how long this imbalance has taken to develop. Treatment rapidity depends on severity of symptoms with the most rapid treatment occurring in only the severely symptomatic. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion in order to prevent these devastating consequences.

Potassium Deficiency (or Hypokalemia)

Hypokalemia exerts multiple effects on kidney tubules with a net effect of maintaining the alkalosis, both in gastric or diuretic-induced alkalosis in volume depleted states, as well as in volume expanded states.

Hypokalemia, as well as metabolic acidosis, is a potent stimulator of ammoniagenesis by increasing glutamine uptake and enhancing the expression of ammoniagenic enzymes in the proximal tubule, ultimately resulting in the generation and addition of new HCO 3 − to the blood (Fig 2B). This added HCO 3 − may be maladaptive because it can either contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis (primary aldosteronism) or impede the correction of alkalosis in volume-depleted states with secondary hyperaldosteronism (vomiting or loop diuretic-induced alkalosis).

Hypokalemia stimulates HCO 3 − reabsorption by activating apical NHE3 and basolateral NBCe1 in the proximal tubule, enhancing H + -ATPase and AE1 activities in A-intercalated cells, and inducing the expression and activity of the nongastric H + /K + -ATPase in the collecting duct (Fig 2B). Furthermore, hypokalemia downregulates the expression of the HCO 3 − -secreting transporter pendrin in B-intercalated cells (Fig 2B). Collectively, these effects blunt the elimination of excess HCO 3 − in volume-depleted states (vomiting, overuse of loop diuretics, etc) or contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in volume-expanded states (primary aldosteronism).

In brief, hypokalemia is a critical contributor to the worsening of metabolic alkalosis, specifically in volume-depleted states, by (1) enhancing ammoniagenesis in proximal tubule cells, leading to new HCO 3 − generation; (2) increasing proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered HCO 3 −; (3) increasing HCO 3 − generation and absorption in the collecting duct A-intercalated cells; and (4) decreasing HCO 3 − secretion in the collecting duct B-intercalated cells.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^53b4dd1d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In our present study focused on severe metabolic and mixed acidemia, we report that, as opposed to the pH value upon ICU admission, the rapidity of pH recovery was associated with mortality (Table 3). Whether metabolic acidemia is an etiologic contributor to organ dysfunction or just a marker of illness has been debated. Recent findings demonstrate that severe metabolic acidemia is at least a contributory factor to organ dysfunction, favoring cardiac output decrease, arterial dilatation with hypotension, arrhythmia, altered oxygen delivery, respiratory muscle workload increase in spontaneously breathing patients, decreased ATP production and impairment of the immune response. Acidemia correction using the administration of a base, primarily in the form of sodium bicarbonate, has naturally become the mainstay of therapy, but its use continues to generate intense debate. In our study, we included patients with severe academia, and the prescription of sodium bicarbonate was heterogeneous between the participating ICUs and independent of the mechanism of academia, as shown by chloremia and corrected anion gap values upon ICU admission (Table 1). Lower PaCO 2, bicarbonatemia and base excess were associated with sodium bicarbonate prescription. Interestingly, our results are similar to those of a recent North American survey which reported that over 60% of intensivists and 80% of nephrologists would consider the use of buffer therapy for the treatment of lactic acidosis. To our knowledge, that survey and our present study are the only investigations that describe the pattern of sodium bicarbonate prescription for severe acidemia in critically ill patients.

When prescribing sodium bicarbonate in the critically ill, the potential side effects of severe acidemia must be balanced with complications related to sodium bicarbonate itself. Indeed, sodium bicarbonate may also be associated with complications such as a transient drop in blood pressure and cardiac output and a decrease in ionized calcium, thus sensitizing the heart to abnormal electrical activity and subsequent arrhythmia. Moreover, "paradoxical" intracellular acidosis may occur because generated CO 2 freely diffuses across the cell membrane. In addition, bicarbonate administration can be responsible for hypernatremia, volume overload, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. In the present study, administration of sodium bicarbonate within the first 24 hours of acidemia was not associated with outcome (Tables 2 and 3).

In 2011, there is no human study that has reported any beneficial or detrimental effects of sodium bicarbonate administration when treating patients with severe mixed or metabolic acidemia. Therefore, attention should be first directed toward correcting the underlying basis for the acidemia.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^6b86aa78]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia defined by a plasma pH level lower than 7.20 within the first 24 hours of ICU admission was observed in 6% of critically ill patients. Second, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia was associated with an ICU mortality rate of 57%. Third, as opposed to pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction was associated with mortality. Fourth, sodium bicarbonate prescription within the first 24 hours of acidemia was heterogeneous, depending on the participating ICU, and was not associated with the patient's prognosis.

Several limitations of this study must be identified. First, we defined and classified severe acidemia on the basis of a pH value below 7.20, bicarbonate and base excess, and instead used the physiochemical classification developed by Stewart. We chose this strategy because of its widespread use and because it was the easiest way to screen patients. Moreover, our study could not demonstrate that acidemia per se rather than the underlying disease was the main independent predictive factor in patient outcome. Indeed, our study was an observational, multiple-center study which included all consecutive, heterogeneous patients according to their acid-base status and was not designed to specifically address the impact of sodium bicarbonate on outcome or to address the reasons for sodium bicarbonate prescription. We also could not assess whether very early sodium bicarbonate administration (within the first six hours of acidemia), a different load of buffer (high vs low dose) or administration modalities (slow vs rapid infusion and/or concentrated vs diluted bicarbonate) had any different effects on outcome. However, the present cohort may be used as a tool with which to design a future interventional, randomized study to examine the effects of buffers in severely acidotic critically ill patients.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^25500bca]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study reports for the first time that severe metabolic or mixed acidemia, defined by plasma pH lower than 7.20, occurs within the first 24 hours in the ICU in 6% of critically ill patients. In our study, severe acidemia was associated with a high mortality rate, and, rather than the initial pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction appeared to be a determinant of outcome. Sodium bicarbonate therapy administration was very heterogeneous between participating ICUs. Further studies are necessary to better assess the role of buffers in this subgroup of critically ill patients.

### Sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis with moderate or severe acute kidney injury in ICU (BICARICU-2) [^0aaf509b]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Acute acidemia is frequently observed during critical illness, its reported incidence varying from 14%to 42%. Persistent acidemia has been associated with poor prognosis, with a mortality rate as high as 57% when the pH stays below 7⋅20 more than 24h. Along with case-specific treatment, improvement of tissue perfusion and supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation and renal-replacement therapy are the cornerstones of severe metabolic acidemia management in critically ill patients. The mainstay of AKI management is to identify and correct causative factors while providing supportive care and treating acute complications. Clinical manifestations include encephalopathy and pericardial effusion. Other potentially dangerous complications include metabolic abnormalities of hyperkalaemia and acidosis, and fluid overload. Despite correcting causative and providing supportive care AKI-associated mortality remains high.

Investigators conducted a prospective multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether bicarbonate infusion would improve outcome in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidemia. Specifically, investigators hypothesized that, compared with no bicarbonate, early bicarbonate infusion would result in an improvement in the primary outcome.

In the a-priori defined clinical stratum of patients with moderate to severe acute kidney injury, sodium bicarbonate infusion was associated with an improvement in the primary outcome and a reduced rate of mortality from enrolment to day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group: 63% vs 46%; p = 0⋅0283. Originality and innovative aspects of the study This will be the first randomised clinical trial investigating whether sodium bicarbonate infusion is associated with day 90 mortality in critically ill patients with both severe acidemia and moderate to severe AKI. If sodium bicarbonate, a medication worldwide available for almost no additional cost is associated with a better outcome, it would change the way of treating these patients around the globe.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^53929fc4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A gain of base or a loss of acid from extracellular fluid is fundamental to the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or by the kidney. Excess base may accumulate from oral or parenteral bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate supplementation. The loss of acid from the GI tract or the kidney is directly coupled to the generation of intracellular HCO 3 −, which is then transported to the blood, thus increasing the blood HCO 3 − concentration and pH.

The kidney is well equipped to eliminate excess HCO 3 − in order to maintain systemic acid-base status within a narrow physiological range. Any increase in blood HCO 3 − concentration (generation phase) will elicit a series of adaptive mechanisms that enhance HCO 3 − excretion by the kidney. Thus, significant metabolic alkalosis will not persist so long as the kidney's ability to enhance HCO 3 − excretion remains intact irrespective of the source of new HCO 3 −.

The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis encompasses 2 distinct phases, generation and maintenance, first conceptualized by Seldin in 1972 although there may be some overlap in certain disease states. The generation phase is defined as the period that is manifested by the initial loss of H + (acid) and chloride (Cl −) either through the GI tract (eg, via vomiting) or via the kidney (eg, from chloruretic diuretics). The maintenance phase refers to the period when the active loss of acid has subsided or is subsiding (ie, the vomiting or diuretic usage has stopped), but metabolic alkalosis persists due to impairment of kidney HCO 3 − excretion. The correction (recovery) phase follows the maintenance phase and is achieved when the existing volume and electrolyte deficits (hypokalemia and hypochloremia) are corrected and the inciting event (GI or kidney acid loss) is treated. This installment of the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology will try to incorporate the knowledge gained on this topic over the last 6 decades into a comprehensive description of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms facilitating the generation, maintenance, or recovery from metabolic alkalosis, a detailed understanding of pathways and molecules regulating acid secretion and HCO 3 − reabsorption in kidney tubules is essential. This issue will be discussed in the following section.

Gastric Alkalosis

Vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction or nasogastric tube suctioning can lead to metabolic alkalosis consequent to the loss of gastric acid and fluid through the acid-producing activity of the parietal cell. Parietal cells secrete H + along with Cl − into the gastric lumen to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) needed for digestion as shown in Figure 3. The generation of intracellular H + in parietal cells is coupled to the production of HCO 3 − facilitated by the CAII activity. The H + is extruded into the gastric lumen via the gastric H + /K + -ATPase, whereas the HCO 3 − ion is transported to the blood predominantly via the basolateral Cl − /HCO 3 − anion exchange protein 2 (AE2), "generating" base excess that is referred to as "alkaline tide". The secretion of H + into the gastric lumen and transport of HCO 3 − to the blood is the initial step in both the physiologic digestion process and gastric fluid loss due to vomiting. The initial increase in serum HCO 3 − concentration will be short-lived as long so the individual remains euvolemic, normochloremic, and normokalemic. However, significant gastric fluid loss (as in nasogastric suctioning or severe vomiting) will result in extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction and hypochloremia due to the direct loss of HCl from the gastric lumen. In addition, the resulting volume depletion will activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thus generating hypokalemia consequent to enhanced renal K + wasting. Together these factors are critical to the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis especially after the cause of the gastric fluid loss has ceased.

Diuretic-Induced Metabolic Alkalosis

Inhibitors of Cl − absorption in both the kidney's thick ascending limb and the distal convoluted tubule can generate metabolic alkalosis subsequent to the loss of salt (NaCl) and fluid. Thiazides (inhibitors of the Na + /Cl − cotransporter [NCC]) produce a mild metabolic alkalosis. By contrast, loop diuretics (furosemide and its analogs) can produce severe metabolic alkalosis consequent to the inhibition of NKCC2. The generation of metabolic alkalosis with loop diuretics is due to the combination of several sequential steps. It starts primarily with salt wasting, resulting in volume depletion and activation of the renin-aldosterone system (RAS). Next, the salt wasting increases the delivery of Na + (and Cl −) to the more distal segments, such as the connecting tubule and collecting duct, where Na + will be absorbed via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in exchange for K + (predominantly via the renal outer medullary K + channel [ROMK]) and H + secretion (via H + -ATPase and in part H + /K + -ATPase) (Fig 4A). These processes are significantly amplified in the presence of aldosterone (Fig 4B), which also has a direct effect on H + secretion in the medullary collecting duct.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (such as acetazolamide) are used as diuretics in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, they are also used for the treatment of various disorders including certain types of seizures, glaucoma, mountain sickness, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They cause HCO 3 − wasting by inhibiting HCO 3 − absorption in the proximal tubule and the collecting duct, resulting in nongap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis. In addition, they also cause K + wasting, which leads to hypokalemia. The patient in case 1 has metabolic alkalosis and not acidosis, so for Question 1, option (a) is not correct. Glucocorticoids at high concentrations, like those in ectopic corticotropin production, can bind and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor in principal cells, leading to the stimulation of salt absorption via ENaC and generation of hypertension. The absorption of Na + will increase K + and H + secretion into the urine, promoting hypokalemia and enhanced HCO 3 − absorption. The presence of hypertension is detected in the majority of patients with ectopic corticotropin secretion. The patient in case 1 presents with low blood pressure and tachycardia suggestive of intravascular volume depletion, so option (b) is not correct.

Aldosterone Excess

Volume depletion stimulates the RAAS, which mitigates sodium loss by increasing Na + absorption in exchange for K + and H + secretion. Increased H + secretion into the collecting duct lumen leads to enhanced HCO 3 − absorption through A-intercalated cells and contributes to metabolic alkalosis (Fig 4B). The stimulation of K + secretion into the collecting duct in exchange for Na + absorption via ENaC leads to K + depletion, which impairs the correction of alkalosis by several mechanisms (see the following section). Angiotensin II has a direct effect on H + secretion in the proximal and distal nephron segments, contributing to enhanced absorption of HCO 3 − and the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in volume-depleted states.

Could I just ask you to talk a little about primary aldosteronism and its prevalence?

The classic view, dating back 50 years to the seminal work of Jerome Conn at that time, at the University of Michigan, is that primary aldosteronism was manifested by hypertension. This new entity called primary aldosteronism (later named Conn's syndrome), was caused by an adrenal tumor secreting excessive amounts of the adrenal hormone aldosterone, As originally defined, primary aldosteronism was associated with hypokalaemia, present in approximately 40% of patients, and usually there was a lack of oedema in this setting. The reason for that was the mechanism of aldosterone escape, which I will return to later, leading to an increase in natriuresis and diuresis. And, finally, it was believed that the excess of aldosterone resulted in metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, and mild hypernatraemia. Again, if we were sitting in an office with our patient in 1990, the tell-tale signs we would look for would be hypokalaemia and substantial hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. And we were also taught that primary aldosteronism is a rare and categorical disease.

Recently, there has been a huge paradigm shift, and our current understanding of primary aldosteronism has been completely revised. This was best summarised in a landmark publication by a group of major investigators in the field published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2020. Brown et al. showed that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is high and, importantly for all of us in clinical medicine, remains largely unrecognised. Furthermore, that severe hypertension and hypokalaemia are not prerequisites for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; rather, it can frequently be detected not only in normokalaemic hypertensive patients, but, indeed, across a very wide spectrum of blood pressure alterations.

Essentially, these observations have served to radically redefine primary aldosteronism. From a disease that, historically, was identified as a rare, infrequent cause of hypertension to what we now know it as today: a common syndrome that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The potassium ion is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes, including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle and the maintenance of normal renal function.

The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day.

Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by a concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.

If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency (e.g., patients require long-term diuretic therapy), supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium salts may be able to restore normal potassium levels.

In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis), potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate or potassium gluconate.

### Approach to the patient with hypertension, unexplained hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [^cc3f93a2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We present a patient with hypertension and hypokalemia secondary to an aldosterone-producing adenoma that was renin responsive (APARR). We discussed the sequential approach to the diagnosis of the different subtypes of primary aldosteronism and confirmed the presence of an APARR. The most common cause of primary aldosteronism is an aldosteronoma; functionally, these adenomas respond poorly to angiotensin II but show a brisk response to adrenocorticotropin hormone. They have a pattern of aldosterone level that declines in parallel with cortisol levels. Our patient had an APARR, with an increase of aldosterone in the upright posture. The unusual physiologic response, incidence, and clinical characteristics of APARR are reviewed.

### Population pharmacodynamic model of bicarbonate response to acetazolamide in mechanically ventilated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [^d10b09ed]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acetazolamide is commonly given to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with metabolic alkalosis. Little is known of the pharmacodynamics of acetazolamide in the critically ill. We undertook the pharmacodynamic modeling of bicarbonate response to acetazolamide in COPD patients under mechanical ventilation.

Methods

This observational, retrospective study included 68 invasively ventilated COPD patients who received one or multiple doses of 250 or 500 mg of acetazolamide during the weaning period. Among the 68 investigated patients, 207 time-serum bicarbonate observations were available for analysis. Population pharmacodynamics was modeled using a nonlinear mixedeffect model. The main covariates of interest were baseline demographic data, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) at ICU admission, cause of respiratory failure, co-prescription of drugs interfering with the acid-base equilibrium, and serum concentrations of protein, creatinin, potassium and chloride. The effect of acetazolamide on serum bicarbonate levels at different doses and in different clinical conditions was subsequently simulated in silico.

Results

The main covariates interacting with acetazolamide pharmacodynamics were SAPS II at ICU admission (P = 0.01), serum chloride (P < 0.001) and concomitant administration of corticosteroids (P = 0.02). Co-administration of furosemide significantly decreased bicarbonate elimination. Acetazolamide induced a decrease in serum bicarbonate with a dose-response relationship. The amount of acetazolamide inducing 50% of the putative maximum effect was 117 ± 21 mg. According to our model, an acetazolamide dosage > 500 mg twice daily is required to reduce serum bicarbonate concentrations > 5 mmol/L in the presence of high serum chloride levels or coadministration of systemic corticosteroids or furosemide.

Conclusions

This study identified several covariates that influenced acetazolamide pharmacodynamics and could allow a better individualization of acetazolamide dosing when treating COPD patients with metabolic alkalosis.

Bicarbonate Absorption, Secretion, and Generation in the Kidney: A Coordinated Interaction

Acid Secretion and Bicarbonate Reabsorption (Reclamation) by the Proximal Tubule

Approximately 85% to 90% of filtered HCO 3 − is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, with the remaining being absorbed by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting ducts. Reabsorption of HCO 3 − in the proximal tubule is mediated via H + secretion into the lumen principally through Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3) and the H + -transporting adenosine triphosphatase (H + -ATPase). Secreted H + reacts with luminal HCO 3 − and rapidly dissociates to carbon dioxide (CO 2) and H 2 O, catalyzed by the luminal membrane carbonic anhydrase (CAIV). The CO 2 enters proximal tubule cells where it is converted to HCO 3 − by cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CAII) before transportation to the blood via the basolateral Na + /HCO 3 − cotransporter (NBCe1). Figure 1 includes a depiction of the role of apical NHE3 and H + -ATPase, basolateral NBCe1, and CAIV and CAII in H + secretion and HCO 3 − reabsorption in the kidney proximal tubule.

The patient in case 3 exhibits signs of volume depletion, along with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. In addition, she displays inability to conserve chloride. Common causes of volume contraction with metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia include vomiting, excessive use of loop or thiazide diuretics, or an inordinate consumption of laxatives. It can also be caused by genetic disorders such as congenital chloride-losing diarrhea, Gitelman syndrome, or Bartter syndrome. This patient does not fit into any of these categories. Loss of electrolytes in sweat, specifically in hot weather, can lead to significant volume depletion and RAAS activation, leading to hypokalemia and alkalosis. The urine chloride in nonrenal causes of volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis should be very low. However, the urine chloride in this patient is elevated, meaning option (a) is not correct for Question 6.

Salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte-containing solutions should not lead to volume depletion and metabolic alkalosis, so option (b) is not correct. This patient's history did not support the presence of respiratory acidosis before or on admission, and she was not treated for it before the admission to the hospital, ruling out option (c).

Recent studies have identified kidney-specific mechanisms that contribute to the generation of metabolic alkalosis in the setting of volume contraction. These reports demonstrated that pendrin, which is critical to Cl − absorption (and HCO 3 − secretion) by B-intercalated cells in volume-depleted states, is profoundly downregulated in cystic fibrosis. a Pendrin downregulation impairs the ability of the kidney collecting duct to absorb salt and enhance HCO 3 − secretion (Fig 1). This further exacerbates the magnitude of volume contraction and metabolic alkalosis due to renal Cl − loss and impaired HCO 3 − secretion into the collecting duct, respectively. The loss of Cl − in the urine consequent to the inactivation of pendrin in the setting of volume depletion mimics a pseudo-Bartter picture, which has been described in cystic fibrosis patients, thus option (d) is the best answer to Question 6. The patient was admitted for the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction, and received 6 liters of saline along with 120 mEq of KCl over 48 hours. She was discharged with a serum HCO 3 − of 27 and K + of 3.8 mEq/L, and a venous blood gas of 7.41.

Case 3:

A 28-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis has been followed up in the adult outpatient clinic for the past 12 years. Last year she was admitted to the hospital with severe weakness and lethargy after an episode of upset stomach associated with nausea and loss of appetite. There was no vomiting or diarrhea. Her vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure of 90/55 mm Hg and pulse rate of 90 beats/min. Blood chemical analysis showed Na +, 134 mEq/L; K +, 2.4 mEq/L; HCO 3 −, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 88 mEq/L; SUN, 38 mg/dL; and Scr, 1.4 mg/dL. She is not on any diuretics. VBG indicated a pH of 7.48 and P 2 of 48 mm Hg. Urine electrolyte profile showed Na +, 35 mEq/L; Cl −, 30 mEq/L; and K +, 28 mEq/L.

Question 6:
The generation of metabolic alkalosis, volume depletion, and renal Cl − loss in this patient could be best explained by:

Severe volume depletion due to the excessive loss of Na + and Cl − in sweat
Kidney salt wasting due to excessive consumption of electrolyte replacement solutions
Posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis after the treatment for respiratory acidosis
The inability to conserve Cl − in the kidney during volume depletion

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

Chloride-Responsive Alkalosis

The treatment of metabolic alkalosis with volume contraction (urine Cl − < 20 mmol/L) targets the factors that maintain the alkalotic state: decreased GFR due to volume depletion, Cl − deficiency, and hypokalemia. Administration of Cl − -based intravenous fluids expands intravascular volume, restores GFR, and disrupts the avid reabsorption of Na +, K +, HCO 3 −, Cl −, and water, as well as facilitating HCO 3 − excretion. Rising urinary Cl − indicates adequate volume expansion. Repletion of K + to address hypokalemia decreases ammoniagenesis and the generation of new HCO 3 − as well as reducing the absorption of HCO 3 −. Restoring K + reestablishes pendrin expression and activity, thereby enhancing the secretion of HCO 3 −. Altogether, this treatment with Cl − -based intravenous fluid and K + repletion corrects multiple pathogenic factors that maintain volume-depleted metabolic alkalosis.

This review assesses the physiological significance of hyperchloraemic acidosis and of acidosis in general. It aims to differentiate the effects of the causes of acidosis from the physiological consequences of acidosis.

Ingestion of absorbable antacids such as those containing HCO 3 − or CO 3 2− (carbonate) in the setting of diminished kidney function can lead to the generation of metabolic alkalosis due to impaired kidney excretion of HCO 3 −. Absorbable HCO 3 − -containing medications, such as sodium bicarbonate, are usually used as a treatment to correct metabolic acidosis in CKD patients. The presence of significant hypokalemia and hypotension makes option (c) implausible for Question 1.

Many of the diseases that present with metabolic alkalosis are accompanied with K + depletion. Vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction can lead to metabolic alkalosis due to large gastric fluid losses via parietal cells as discussed under the gastric alkalosis section (Fig 3). Excessive loss of gastric fluid causes hypochloremia and ECF volume contraction, activates the RAS, and leads to hypokalemia due to renal K + wasting. The net effect of these factors is a significant elevation of serum HCO 3 − and arterial pH along with hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Vital signs (low blood pressure and tachycardia due to vascular volume depletion) and laboratory results (hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis) in case 1 fit this category of gastric loss-induced metabolic acidosis; thus, the best answer to Question 1 is (d).

Question 2:
Match each diagnosis with the correct clinical and laboratory presentation:

The overuse of loop diuretics is associated with volume contraction, which is consistent with a blood pressure of 95/57 mm Hg and with increased urine electrolytes. Ectopic corticotropin production presents with hypertension (blood pressure of 160/100 mm Hg) and increased urine electrolytes. Gastric outlet obstruction with vomiting presents with volume contraction (blood pressure of 95/57 mm Hg) and low urine Na + and Cl − excretion. Thus, the correct pairs are (a) and (2); (b) and (1); and (c) and (3).
