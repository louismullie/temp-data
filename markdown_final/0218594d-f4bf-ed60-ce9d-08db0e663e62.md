## Question

A 32-year-old woman is referred to hepatology after an incidental finding of a 4 cm liver lesion on abdominal ultrasound performed for non-specific abdominal discomfort. She has no history of liver disease, and her liver function tests are normal. She has been taking combined oral contraceptives for 8 years. The radiologist notes that the lesion is suspicious for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), but cannot exclude hepatocellular adenoma. The patient is asymptomatic and is concerned about the need for further testing, stopping her oral contraceptives, and whether she will need surgery or ongoing follow-up.

Based on current ACG guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? Justify your answer with reference to imaging, medication management, and follow-up.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 32-year-old woman with an incidental 4 cm liver lesion that is suspicious for focal nodular hyperplasia but cannot exclude hepatocellular adenoma, including what imaging to order, whether to stop oral contraceptives, and what follow-up is needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key diagnostic dilemma between FNH and HCA and why ultrasound is insufficient. Then, I should verify the best first-line advanced imaging modality and why. Next, I will consider medication management contingent on the diagnosis, especially the differing guidance for FNH versus HCA. After that, I need to outline follow-up strategies based on the confirmed diagnosis. Finally, I will address when biopsy or surgical referral becomes appropriate and summarize a practical, guideline-concordant plan with contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why ultrasound is not enough. Ultrasound can detect a lesion but cannot reliably distinguish FNH from HCA, and misclassification leads to divergent management paths, so the next step must be advanced contrast-enhanced imaging to characterize the lesion and subtype if HCA is present, which is explicitly recommended by ACG for incidentally discovered solid hepatic masses in patients without known liver disease [^111fc4w9] [^116XN6Uw].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal first-line advanced imaging. MRI with hepatobiliary-phase contrast has the highest diagnostic performance for FNH versus HCA, with over 90% accuracy and near-100% specificity for FNH on hepatobiliary phase, and it is the preferred modality to distinguish FNH from HCA in this scenario. If MRI is contraindicated, multiphasic CT is an acceptable alternative, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be adjunctive, particularly for smaller lesions, though MRI remains first choice here for a 4 cm lesion [^117GxEgh] [^115KiUPY] [^116wrzpC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping oral contraceptives yet. I need to ensure the diagnosis is established before changing hormones because management hinges on whether this is FNH or HCA. ACG advises not to routinely discontinue OCPs for FNH, whereas for HCA, discontinuation of exogenous hormones is recommended due to associations with growth and complications, so I should confirm the diagnosis first and then tailor counseling accordingly [^112fEn9k] [^111HKJ1L] [^114BJsBF] [^112EdmE3].

> Next, I should review follow-up once the diagnosis is made. If MRI confirms FNH, no further follow-up is required because FNH is benign, lacks malignant potential, and even growth does not mandate intervention. If MRI confirms HCA, surveillance depends on size: for lesions less than 5 cm, contrast-enhanced imaging every 6 months for 2 years then annually is suggested, with risk factor modification including stopping OCPs and weight loss if applicable. For lesions 5 cm or larger, observation for 6–12 months with risk modification is reasonable, but if there is no regression to less than 5 cm, resection is generally recommended due to higher risks of hemorrhage and malignant transformation [^115KiUPY] [^111y4xQ4] [^114fuuwF] [^114cTdZv] [^114BJsBF].

> I should double-check when biopsy or surgical referral is indicated. Biopsy is not routine for FNH when imaging is diagnostic, but it becomes appropriate if imaging cannot confidently distinguish FNH from HCA or if there are atypical or evolving features concerning for malignancy. Similarly, surgical consultation is indicated for HCA that is 5 cm or larger, growing, symptomatic, or has imaging features suspicious for β-catenin activation or malignant transformation, whereas resection is not indicated for confirmed FNH even with growth [^116XN6Uw] [^111s7XFL] [^113mFVZy] [^115PvrkG].

> Let me synthesize the most appropriate next step. The most appropriate next step is to obtain multiphase contrast-enhanced MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast to definitively distinguish FNH from HCA and to subtype if HCA is present, while continuing current OCPs until the diagnosis is established. After MRI, management will branch: if FNH is confirmed, no further follow-up is needed and OCPs can be continued with shared decision-making. If HCA is confirmed, stop OCPs, address metabolic risk factors, and initiate size-based surveillance or consider resection if 5 cm or larger or if high-risk features are present [^117GxEgh] [^112fEn9k] [^111y4xQ4] [^114BJsBF].

---

The next step is to **obtain a multiphase MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast** [^112fEn9k] to distinguish FNH from HCA, as this is the most accurate noninvasive test and will guide management [^117GxEgh]. If MRI is contraindicated, use multiphase CT or contrast-enhanced ultrasound [^116wrzpC] [^1134NSwt]. Do not stop oral contraceptives now, as FNH is not hormonally driven and stopping OCPs is not routinely recommended for FNH [^112fEn9k] [^111HKJ1L]; if HCA is diagnosed, then discontinue OCPs and consider risk modification [^114BJsBF] [^112EdmE3]. Surgery is not indicated unless the diagnosis remains uncertain after imaging or if HCA is ≥ 5 cm or shows atypical features [^111s7XFL] [^114cTdZv].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast**: This is the preferred modality to distinguish FNH from HCA, with > 90% accuracy and near-100% specificity for FNH on hepatobiliary phase imaging [^117GxEgh] [^112fEn9k].

- **Alternative imaging**: If MRI is contraindicated, multiphase CT or contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are acceptable alternatives, though MRI is superior for characterization [^116wrzpC] [^1134NSwt].

- **Biopsy**: Not routinely indicated; reserve for cases where imaging cannot confidently differentiate FNH from HCA or when imaging features are atypical or concerning for malignancy [^116XN6Uw] [^117GxEgh].

---

## Management of FNH

- **Observation**: FNH is benign, has no malignant potential, and rarely causes symptoms; no treatment or routine follow-up is required once confidently diagnosed [^115KiUPY] [^112RDdt6].

- **Oral contraceptives**: Do not routinely discontinue OCPs in FNH, as there is no evidence that OCPs promote growth or complications in FNH [^112fEn9k] [^111HKJ1L] [^115bYjQS].

- **Growth**: Even if FNH grows, resection is not indicated unless symptoms are severe and refractory, and patients should be counseled that symptoms may not improve after surgery [^115KiUPY] [^115PvrkG].

---

## Management of HCA

- **Risk modification**: Discontinue OCPs and address metabolic risk factors (e.g. weight loss) to reduce growth and complications [^114BJsBF] [^112EdmE3] [^112Fq2wU].

- **Surveillance**: For lesions < 5 cm, monitor with contrast-enhanced imaging every 6 months for 2 years, then annually if stable [^111y4xQ4] [^114fuuwF].

- **Surgery**: Consider resection for lesions ≥ 5 cm, those that grow, or those with atypical features suggesting higher risk of hemorrhage or malignant transformation [^111s7XFL] [^114cTdZv].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Obtain multiphase MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast to distinguish FNH from HCA [^112fEn9k] [^117GxEgh] |
| 2 | If MRI is contraindicated, use multiphase CT or CEUS [^116wrzpC] [^1134NSwt] |
| 3 | Do not discontinue OCPs unless HCA is diagnosed [^112fEn9k] [^111HKJ1L] |
| 4 | If FNH is confirmed, no further follow-up or treatment is needed [^115KiUPY] [^112RDdt6] |
| 5 | If HCA is diagnosed, discontinue OCPs, modify risk factors, and surveil or resect based on size and features [^114BJsBF] [^111y4xQ4] [^111s7XFL] |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **obtain a multiphase MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast** to differentiate FNH from HCA, as this will determine whether to stop OCPs and whether surgery is needed. If FNH is confirmed, no further action is required; if HCA is confirmed, stop OCPs and manage based on size and risk features [^112fEn9k] [^111y4xQ4].

Incidentally discovered solid hepatic mass — When a solid hepatic mass is incidentally discovered in a patient with no known risk factors, appropriate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) should be the first step in management and is often a sufficient test for diagnosis and subtyping of hepatic adenomas. Biopsy should be performed when a hepatic adenoma has an uncharacteristic appearance on imaging or change in imaging features that are concerning for malignant transformation.

### Laparoscopic liver surgery: shifting the management of liver tumors [^114TZQLT]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic liver surgery has evolved rapidly over the past 5 years in a select number of centers. The growing experience with these procedures has resulted in a shift in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to common liver tumors. The fact that resection of benign and malignant hepatic masses can now be accomplished laparoscopically with relatively low morbidity has influenced the decision-making process for physicians involved in the diagnosis and management of these lesions. For example, should a gastroenterologist or hepatologist seeing a 32-year-old woman with an asymptomatic 4 cm hepatic lesion that is radiologically indeterminate for adenoma or focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH): (1) continue to observe with annual computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) scans, (2) subject the patient to a liver biopsy, or (3) refer for laparoscopic resection? For a solitary malignant liver tumor in the left lateral segment, should laparoscopic resection be considered the new standard of care, assuming the surgeon can perform the operation safely? We present current data and representative case studies on the use of laparoscopic liver resection at 2 major medical centers in the United States. We propose that surgical engagement defined by the managing physician's decision to proceed with a surgical intervention is increasingly affected by the availability of, and experience with, laparoscopic liver resection.

Key points

Guidelines on benign liver tumours are necessary to prevent clinical practice variation and suboptimal treatment
Three guidelines on benign liver tumours provided several differences in recommendations regarding hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic haemangioma
Indications for biopsy in hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic haemangioma differed
Life style advices on contraceptive pills and follow-up in focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma varied
Some guidelines did not provide specific recommendations for treatment of hepatocellular adenoma in men and differed in recommendations on subtype identification on MRI
Recognising differences can assist in harmonisation of practice standards, identify unmet needs in research, and may ultimately contribute to improved global patient care

### Growth of focal nodular hyperplasia is not a reason for surgical intervention, but patients should be referred to a tertiary referral centre [^111mMkBF]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Differences in management between FNH and hepatocellular adenomas demand an accurate differentiation. Resection is indicated for hepatocellular adenoma if the tumour exceeds a diameter of 5 cm 6 months after the use of Oral Contraceptive is stopped, because of the risk of bleeding. In contrast, for FNH, no strict indications for resection are defined. As liver resections may have a peri-operative complication rate up to 20–25%, a diagnostic liver resection is not advisable. In the case of FNH, the liver resections are generally performed in young, healthy women. As our study showed no complications of the conservative approach, we advise to avoid resection as described in the EASL clinical practice guideline, even if the lesion is growing.

FNH is often an incidental finding discovered by various imaging techniques. In our cohort, we found that 26.5% of the patients were asymptomatic, while most studies have shown a large percentage of asymptomatic patients ranging from 65 to 90%. One possible explanation could be that the Erasmus Medical Hospital is a tertiary referral centre, and more patients with symptoms are referred. We assume that most of the symptoms are not caused by the presence of FNH and that FNH indeed could be asymptomatic. If treated, patients need to be comprehensively informed and it should be stressed that it may not be guaranteed that the abdominal pain will resolve.

The biggest limitation of our retrospective study is the design that is inherent to bias. In addition, it may be questioned whether the sample size of the growing FNH group is large enough to justify the conclusion; however, with 19 patients, we are the first to describe such a series of growing FNH and others may be challenged by this report to add new data.

In conclusion, our series confirm that FNH is not a static lesion and that growth may occur rather frequently. It must be noted that patients with a growing FNH do not report more pain or discomfort compared to the patients with non-growing FNH. Moreover, growth in itself should not have any implications on clinical management. In case of doubt, MRI with liver-specific contrast agents in combination with CEUS provides the highest diagnostic accuracy. As these imaging techniques are not available in every hospital, patients could be referred to a centre specialized in focal liver lesions. Growth is not an indication for liver biopsy, and biopsy should only be considered when the two imaging modalities do not provide the same diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1114mUwy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) — scope and terminology emphasize that FLLs have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental lesions, and that gastroenterologists and hepatologists often manage lesion types including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis, and this American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs. FLLs are solid or cystic lesions identified as an abnormality in the liver, and for this update the term "lesion" will be used instead of "mass".

Diagnostic Factors Lesions smaller than 1 cm that are detected during screening in patients at high risk of HCC do not require further diagnostic evaluation. Most of these lesions will be cirrhotic lesions rather than HCC. Close follow-up at 3-month intervals is a common surveillance strategy, using the same technique that first documented the presence of the lesions. For patients with liver lesions larger than 1 cm who are at risk of HCC, a diagnosis can be considered. The tests required to diagnose HCC may include imaging, biopsy, or both. Diagnostic imaging In patients with cirrhosis, liver disease, or other risk factors for HCC, and with lesions greater than 1 cm, triple-phase, contrast-enhanced studies can be used to diagnose HCC. A triple-phase CT or MRI assesses the entire liver in distinct phases of perfusion.

Following the controlled administration of intravenous contrast media, the arterial and venous phases of perfusion are imaged. During the arterial phase of the study, HCC enhances more intensely than the surrounding liver because the arterial blood in the liver is diluted by venous blood that does not contain contrast, whereas the HCC contains only arterial blood. In the venous phase, the HCC enhances less than the surrounding liver, because the arterial blood flowing through the lesion no longer contains contrast; however, the portal blood in the liver now contains contrast. However, if a first imaging modality, such as a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, is not conclusive, sequential imaging with a different modality can improve sensitivity for HCC detection without a decrease in specificity.

If, despite the use of two imaging modalities, a lesion larger than 1 cm remains uncharacterized in a patient at high risk of HCC, a liver biopsy can be considered. Liver biopsy A liver biopsy may be performed when a diagnosis of HCC is not established by a dynamic imaging modality for liver lesions 1 cm or larger in high-risk patients. Alpha-fetoprotein levels AFP is insufficiently sensitive or specific for use as a diagnostic assay. AFP can be elevated in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and in some cases in which there are metastases from colon cancer. Finding a mass in the liver of a patient with an elevated AFP does not automatically indicate HCC. However, if the AFP level is high, it can be used to monitor for recurrence. Prognosis The natural course of early tumors is poorly understood because most HCC patients receive treatment.

However, older reports have described 3-year survival rates of 13% to 21% in patients who do not receive any specific treatment. At present, only 10% to 23% of patients with HCC may be surgical candidates for curative-intent treatment. The survival rate of untreated patients in 25 randomized clinical trials ranged from 10% to 72% at 1 year and 8% to 50% at 2 years. Unlike most patients with solid tumors, the prognosis of patients with HCC is affected by the tumor stage at presentation and by the underlying liver function. The following prognostic factors guide the selection of treatment:

### Liver (hepatocellular) cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116zMXva]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Harms Based on fair evidence, screening would result in rare but serious side effects associated with needle aspiration cytology such as needle-track seeding, particularly of lesions more than 2 cm in diameter, and hemorrhage, bile peritonitis, and pneumothorax. Transjugular liver biopsy is rarely associated with major complications such as perforation of the hepatic capsule or cholangitis. Chronic hepatitis B and C are recognized as the major factors worldwide increasing the risk of hepatocellular cancer, with risk being greater in the presence of coinfection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. The incidence of HCC in individuals with chronic hepatitis is as high as 0. 46% per year. In the United States, chronic hepatitis B and C account for about 30% to 40% of HCC. Chronic hepatitis G infection is not associated with HCC in either hepatitis B surface antigen–positive carriers or noncarriers.

Cirrhosis is also a risk factor for HCC, irrespective of the etiology of the cirrhosis. The annual risk of developing HCC among individuals with cirrhosis is between 1% and 6%. Other risk factors include alcoholic cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, alpha-l-antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage disease. porphyria cutanea tarda, tyrosinemia, and Wilson disease, but rarely biliary cirrhosis. A retrospective case-control study found that features suggestive of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, were more frequently observed in patients with HCC associated with cryptogenic cirrhosis than in those with HCC of viral or alcohol etiology. Aflatoxins, which are mycotoxins formed by certain. Evidence of Benefit Rationale for Screening The rationale for screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is based on the concept that populations at high risk for HCC, such as those with cirrhosis, can be identified.

However, 20% to 50% of patients presenting with HCC have previously undiagnosed cirrhosis. These patients would not be recruited into a surveillance program if the presence of cirrhosis is used to define a target population. The modalities potentially available for screening include serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonography. Abnormal screening results may lead to liver biopsy for diagnosis. Complications of liver biopsy are reported in 0. 06% to
0. 32% of patients, and typically occur within the first few hours after the biopsy. A prospective, 16-year, population-based, observational study of screening for HCC included 1, 487 Alaska Native individuals chronically infected with HBV. The study compared survival among screen-detected patients with HCC with a historical comparison group of clinically diagnosed patients with HCC. The screening program's target was AFP determination every 6 months. A case-control study conducted within the U. S.

Veterans Affairs health care system assessed whether screening with AFP and/or ultrasound reduced HCC mortality. The cases were 238 patients with cirrhosis who died of HCC from 2013 to 2015 and who had been in VA care with a diagnosis of cirrhosis for 4 years or more before the diagnosis of HCC. The controls, who did not die of HCC and had also been in VA care for 4 years or more, were matched for date of. entry and for age, sex, race, model for end-stage liver disease score, and etiology of cirrhosis. The study examiners, blinded to outcome status, used chart extraction to assess exposure to ultrasound and AFP screening. The reason for testing was assessed, also blinded to outcome. The study found no difference between cases and controls regarding the proportion of patients who underwent screening ultrasound, AFP screening, or both.

Focal liver lesions (FLL) have been a common reason for consultation faced by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. The increasing and widespread use of imaging studies has led to an increase in detection of incidental FLL. It is important to consider not only malignant liver lesions, but also benign solid and cystic liver lesions such as hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, and hepatic cysts, in the differential diagnosis. In this ACG practice guideline, the authors provide an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of FLL.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental liver lesions. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists often see these patients in consultation and make recommendations for management of multiple types of liver lesions, including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of FLLs, and healthcare providers must be familiar with the diagnosis and management of FLLs.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^115KiUPY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) — Diagnosis and management — Advanced imaging techniques (e.g., contrast-enhanced multiphase MRI with hepatobiliary-specific contrast) can accurately diagnose focal nodular hyperplasia in most cases, and biopsy is not routinely needed. In a patient with a focal nodular hyperplasia confirmed on imaging, no further follow-up is required. If the diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia is confirmed, then even in the case of growth, resection is not required; if resection is being considered because of symptoms, then patients must be counseled that their symptoms may not improve after surgery as FNH rarely causes symptoms. If focal nodular hyperplasia lesions are symptomatic and surgery is not an option because of comorbidities or anatomic considerations, then transarterial embolization with or without bleomycin may be considered to decrease size. Men with focal nodular hyperplasia do not need to have any different evaluation, monitoring, or treatment compared with women.

Introduction

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign liver tumour with an incidence in the general population of 0.6–3%. FNH is especially common in young women, with a male/female ratio of 1:12. So far, no explanation has been found for the gender bias; female hormones or the use of oral contraceptives do not seem to play a role in prevalence.

An FNH lesion consists of benign hepatocytes surrounding a central fibrous scar with a prominent dystrophic artery. The underlying mechanism of FNH formation is thought to be due to a vascular malformation and injury. Patients do not have an underlying liver disease and are mostly asymptomatic.

With the current availability of highly sensitive imaging techniques, FNH is diagnosed more often as an incidental lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with liver-specific contrast agents has a very high specificity of almost 100% in larger lesions (> 3 cm) but is less accurate with a sensitivity of 70–80% to diagnose smaller lesions where the central scar may be missing. In these cases, the combination of MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides the highest diagnostic accuracy.

This year, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) issued the first clinical practice guideline for benign liver tumours in which they state that treatment of FNH is not recommended because of the benign character of FNH, the low incidence of intralesional bleeding and the absence of malignant transformation. In case of doubt about the diagnosis FNH, a biopsy may be considered. The guideline describes treatment is only pursued in exceptional cases such as expanding FNH.

It has been documented that FNH lesions may show a slow and incidental increase in size during follow-up. However, change in size may cause doubt about the diagnosis and the benign character of the liver lesion. Growth of FNH has been suggested to be an indication for resection, although evidence for this approach is weak. The aim of this study was to evaluate how often a FNH grows and what are the implications for management and compare the characteristics of those with and without growing FNH.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^112EY5RL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver masses in pregnancy — Asymptomatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia do not need management or surveillance during pregnancy (strong recommendation, very low level evidence). Hepatic adenomas should be monitored with ultrasound during pregnancy for growth, and patients with large adenomas (> 5 cm) should be referred for resection before pregnancy (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Spontaneous rupture of hemangiomas is exceedingly rare, even with large lesions, and routine symptomatic follow-up and standard vaginal delivery is safe. Focal nodular hyperplasia is found in 3% of the population with multiple case series in pregnant women reporting routine pregnancies with good clinical outcomes. If a hepatic adenoma is larger than 5 cm or rapid growth is noted, surgical or radiological intervention should be recommended before pregnancy.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)

FNH is defined as a nodule composed of benign-appearing hepatocytes occurring in a liver that is otherwise histologically normal or nearly normal. It is the second most common benign liver tumour after haemangioma with a prevalence of 0.9% and commonly occurs in young females (male:female ratio = 1:8). The majority of FNHs are solitary (80%), smaller than 5 cm in diameter and occur near the surface of the liver. In contrast to monoclonal HCAs, which frequently bleed, FNHs are polyclonal tumour-like lesions and do not undergo haemorrhage or malignant transformation. Although an association with oral contraceptive use has been speculated, owing to the increased prevalence of these tumours in young women, studies have shown that FNH is not hormonally dependent. Association with vascular diseases such as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber disease) and congenital absence of the portal vein can be seen.

FNH is often an incidental finding at imaging. Distinction between FNH and other hypervascular liver lesions such as HCA, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hypervascular metastases is critical as the management differs considerably. FNH is asymptomatic in most patients, and in such cases no treatment is necessary. One third of patients may present with abdominal pain or a palpable mass. Typically, FNH follows a benign natural course and remains stable or may even decrease in size at follow-up examination.

### Case-orientated approach to the management of hepatocellular adenoma [^116bJVyk]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of suspected hepatocellular adenoma (HA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of HA at a time when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are highly sensitive methods for diagnosing HA.

Methods

Between January 2000 and January 2005, data from 48 consecutive women with HA (median age 36 years) were prospectively collected. The protocol for diagnostic work-up consisted of multiphasic MRI or CT. Management was observation if the tumour was smaller than 5 cm and surgical intervention if it was 5 cm or larger.

Results

The median follow-up was 24 (range 3–73) months. Sixteen (33 per cent) patients had invasive procedures because of tumour size 5 cm or larger, malignant characteristics or haemorrhage. The remaining 32 patients (67 per cent) were observed; haemorrhage and malignant degeneration did not occur and none of the lesions showed enlargement after withdrawal of oral contraceptives. Multiple HAs were found in 32 (67 per cent) patients; liver steatosis was significantly more common in these patients than in those with a solitary lesion (59 versus 19 per cent; P = 0.008).

Conclusion

Observation of adenomas smaller than 5 cm is justified because of improved radiological reliability. Resection should be reserved for patients with malignant tumour characteristics or with single lesions 5 cm or larger.

### Hepatic adenomas: imaging and pathologic findings [^117U6Ast]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular adenoma is a rare benign lesion that is most often seen in young women with a history of oral contraceptive use. It is typically solitary, although multiple lesions have been reported, particularly in patients with glycogen storage disease and liver adenomatosis. Because of the risk of hemorrhage and malignant transformation, hepatocellular adenomas must be identified and treated promptly. At pathologic analysis, hepatocellular adenoma is usually a well-circumscribed, nonlobulated lesion, and at gross examination, resected adenomas frequently demonstrate areas of hemorrhage and infarction. Most adenomas are not specifically diagnosed at ultrasonography (US) and are usually further evaluated with computed tomography (CT) or other imaging modalities. Color Doppler US may help differentiate hepatocellular adenoma from focal nodular hyperplasia. Multiphasic helical CT allows more accurate detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions. Hepatocellular adenomas are typically bright on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and predominantly hyperintense relative to liver on T2-weighted images. The prognosis of hepatic adenoma is not well established. Criteria that guide treatment include the number and size of the lesions, the presence of symptoms, and the surgical risk incurred by the patient. Understanding the imaging appearance of hepatocellular adenoma can help avoid misdiagnosis and facilitate prompt, effective treatment.

### Management of incidental liver lesions on CT: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^114YMWFD]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Committee on Incidental Findings presents recommendations for managing liver lesions that are incidentally detected on CT. These recommendations represent an update from the liver component of the ACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver. The Liver Subcommittee-which included five abdominal radiologists, one hepatologist, and one hepatobiliary surgeon-developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize liver lesions on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an assessment of benignity or a specific follow-up recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. The goal is to improve the quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected liver lesions.

### Spectrum of liver lesions hyperintense on hepatobiliary phase: an approach by clinical setting [^114Q6ufE]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-cirrhotic patients

An incidental liver observation detected at imaging in an asymptomatic patient without underlying disease is benign in 96% of the cases. Among these observations, those that may show iso- or hyperintensity in the HBP are mainly focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), areas of fat sparing in steatotic liver, and, seldom, hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs). The likelihood of these observations depends on the patient's on age, gender and risk factors such as oral contraceptives, steroids, history of glycogenosis. Cholangiocarcinoma and metastases may show some central enhancement in the HBP phase that is, however, typically lower in comparison with the background parenchyma.

Focal nodular hyperplasia

FNH is the second most common benign liver tumor with a prevalence of 0.03–0.9% in the general adult population, with a peak incidence among women between 30 and 40 years old. FNH is defined as a nodule composed of benign-appearing hepatocytes occurring in a liver that is otherwise histologically normal or nearly normal. Although FNH may increase in size in 3–15% of cases, these lesions do not evolve to malignancy and their management is conservative.

FNHs show iso- or hyperintensity in the HBP relatively to liver parenchyma in the vast majority (97%) of cases (Fig. 2), and this is attributed to OATP1B3 expression equal or higher than that of the background liver or to an increase in well-differentiated bile ducts in these lesions compared to the surrounding parenchyma.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Hepatocellular adenoma — natural history, diagnosis, and complications note that HCAs represent a benign proliferation of mature hepatocytes and the presence of multifocal (> 10) nodules has been defined as adenomatosis. The initial diagnosis is often made incidentally during abdominal imaging, although patients can present with abdominal pain, and currently there is no formal recommendation for HCA screening with metabolic risk factors or duration of OCP exposure. Most hepatic adenomas are benign and asymptomatic; however, they are associated with a risk of hemorrhage (up to 15%) and/or malignant transformation (up to 5%).

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^113nGAgL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Key concept — hepatic adenomas (HCAs) are generally benign but can be associated with hemorrhage and malignant transformation, and complications are more typical in tumors larger than a threshold: HCAs "are generally benign but can be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage and/or malignant transformation", and "adenomas that are associated with these complications are > 5 cm in size, although complications can arise in smaller lesions". Because of this benign nature, "treatment is often unnecessary", and "stabilization or regression of HCA lesions has been noted with elimination of hormonal stimuli and can be seen with aggressive management of metabolic risk factors".

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^1149coRm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Hepatic adenoma — Risk factors and diagnostic imaging — The use of anabolic steroids in men, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, glycogen storage disease, and possibly exogeneous hormonal therapy in men, women, and transgender individuals are risk factors for development of hepatic adenomas. Hepatic adenomas are generally benign but can be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage and/or malignant transformation. When a solid hepatic mass is incidentally discovered in a patient with no known risk factors, appropriate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) should be the first step in management and is often a sufficient test for diagnosis and subtyping of hepatic adenomas. Biopsy should be performed when a hepatic adenoma has an uncharacteristic appearance on imaging or change in imaging features that are concerning for malignant transformation. MRI features are beneficial for subtyping inflammatory-type adenomas and HNF-1α mutated adenomas, but are not specific for subtyping β-catenin mutated, sonic hedgehog, and unclassified adenomas. Risk factors for development of inflammatory HCAs include obesity and/or metabolic syndrome risk factors, heavy alcohol consumption, and/or glycogen storage disease. Hepatic adenomatosis is a variant of HCA characterized by 10 or more hepatic adenomas.

Focal nodular hyperplasia

Guidelines differed slightly in their formulation of recommendations for FNH (table 3). The ACG guideline recommended using MRI or CT for diagnostic confirmation, without specifying the modality or MR contrast agents. SBH and EASL guidelines concluded CE-MRI superiority for both FNH identification and FNH-HCA differentiation. The EASL guideline recommended biopsy for suspected FNH ≥ 3 cm if diagnosis is doubtful after CE-MRI or if uncertain in < 3 cm tumours after CEUS. The ACG guideline recommended biopsy if FNH cannot be distinguished from HCA, without discussing the role of MRI and CEUS. The SBH did not discuss the role of biopsy in FNH.

Table 3
Comparison of guideline recommendations on focal nodular hyperplasia

Results regarding the use of CEUS (combined with MRI) for focal liver tumours were published prior to ACG and SBH guideline publication. Additional findings on CEUS use in FNH smaller than 3 cm, though, were published after July 2013.

The SBH guideline had no advices regarding CP use and concluded FNH's association with Oestrogens remains controversial. The SBH recommended follow-up every 6 months to 2 years, depending on tumour characteristics. The ACG recommended follow-up during 2–3 years in women when CP are continued. The EASL guideline did not recommend any follow-up unless concurring underlying vascular liver disease is present.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^117SdkfE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Objective

Benign liver tumours (BLT) are increasingly diagnosed as incidentalomas. Clinical implications and management vary across and within the different types of BLT. High-quality clinical practice guidelines are needed, because of the many nuances in tumour types, diagnostic modalities, and conservative and invasive management strategies. Yet, available observational evidence is subject to interpretation which may lead to practice variation. Therefore, we aimed to systematically search for available clinical practice guidelines on BLT, to critically appraise them, and to compare management recommendations.

Design

A scoping review was performed within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science. All BLT guidelines published in peer-reviewed, and English language journals were eligible for inclusion. Clinical practice guidelines on BLT were analysed, compared, and critically appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) checklist regarding hepatic haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations (PRISMA) for scoping reviews were adhered to.

Results

The literature search yielded unique 367 papers, 348 were excluded after screening of title/abstract, and 16 after full-text screening. Three guidelines were included: the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG; 2014), Brazilian Society of Hepatology (SBH; 2015), and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL; 2016). There was no uniformity in the assessment methods for grading and gravity of recommendations between guidelines. Among observed differences were: (1) indications for biopsy in all three tumours; (2) advices on contraceptive pills and follow-up in FNH and HCA; (3) use of an individualised approach to HCA; (4) absence of recommendations for treatment of HCA in men; and (5) approaches to HCA subtype identification on magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusion

Recognising differences in recommendations can assist in harmonisation of practice standards and identify unmet needs in research. This may ultimately contribute to improved global patient care.

### Pregnancy and liver adenoma management: PALM-study [^111AKNzg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is rare benign tumor of the liver that occurs particularly in women during their reproductive years. The incidence is not exactly known. Studies performed years ago show an estimate incidence of 1–1.3 per 1,000,000 in women who have never used oral contraceptives (OC), compared to 30–40 per 1,000,000 in long-term users. The association of HCA with the use of OC was first described in 1973. In subsequent years many authors have supported the hypothesis of an association between OC and HCA. The mechanism by which estrogen or other steroids contributes to the development of HCA is still not understood and studies are rare. Symptomatic patients with HCA present with right upper quadrant abdominal pain or discomfort secondary to bleeding within the HCA, elevated liver enzymes and symptoms of life treating hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity. However, most patients with HCA are asymptomatic and present as an incidental finding during ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen for unrelated reasons or are noted during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Despite its benign nature, the diagnosis of HCA has a great impact of the lives of these, mostly, young women because HCA can be complicated by hormone induces growth and rupture. Besides that malignant transformation of HCA into hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported with an overall frequency of 4.2%.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111s7XFL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic adenoma — key concepts: Women with hepatic adenomas ≥ 5 cm should modify risk factors, undergo observation for 6–12 months, and undergo resection if the lesion does not regress to < 5 cm. Men with hepatic adenomas should consider surgical resection regardless of lesion size because of elevated risk of malignant transformation. Hepatic adenomas should be monitored regularly during pregnancy and should be treated if there is growth to > 6.5 cm or with high-risk features for hemorrhagic rupture. Hepatic adenomas of any size that have imaging features concerning for malignant transformation should be treated as an HCC, with consideration to surgical resection, locoregional therapies, and/or liver transplantation. Hepatic adenomatosis is a variant of HCA characterized by 10 or more hepatic adenomas, more commonly associated with background steatosis or glycogen storage disease. Consideration for liver transplantation should be given to patients who meet the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policy for transplantation, especially those with glycogen storage disease, unresectable β-catenin positive adenoma, or unresectable with complications of hemorrhage or malignant transformation of hepatic adenomas.

### Hormonal contraceptive use among women with liver tumors: a systematic review [^115bYjQS]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The review was conducted to evaluate from the literature the safety of hormonal methods of contraception in women with liver tumors, specifically in benign and malignant disease.

Study Design

We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases to find all articles published from database inception through July 2008 that were relevant to hormonal contraception use and liver tumors.

Results

Of 148 articles, three publications of two studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review; both investigated the use of hormonal contraception in women with the benign liver tumor focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). In one small, retrospective case series, use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) over a 4-year average follow-up was not associated with a change in either the number or size of hepatic lesions. In another case series, use of either COCs or progestogen-only contraceptives (POCs) after FNH diagnosis had no influence on disease progression or resolution.

Conclusions

The studies identified examined oral contraceptive use among women with FNH. We did not identify any studies of hormonal contraceptive use among women with hepatocellular adenoma or with malignant liver tumors. Limited, poor-quality evidence suggests that for women with FNH, use of low-dose COCs or POCs does not appear to influence either liver lesion resolution or progression.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® liver lesion-initial characterization [^1127eNkH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Incidental liver masses are commonly identified on imaging performed for other indications. Since the prevalence of benign focal liver lesions in adults is high, even in patients with primary malignancy, accurate characterization of incidentally detected lesions is of paramount clinical importance. This document reviews utilization of various imaging modalities for characterization of incidentally detected liver lesions, discussed in the context of several clinical scenarios. For each clinical scenario, a summary of current evidence supporting the use of a given diagnostic modality is reported. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Coincidental liver diseases

Acute hepatitis

AH should be considered in the presence of sudden jaundice and acute liver injury or failure in pregnancy. Although viral hepatitis (virus A to E) is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy worldwide, hepatotoxicity due to drug reactions, herbal or dietary supplements should be ruled out. In India, the hepatitis E virus is a common cause of AH in pregnancy with a 25% mortality rate, while acetaminophen overdose is responsible for 30% of the cases of ALF in pregnancy in the USA.

Autoimmune hepatitis may also be seen in pregnancy, requiring rapid diagnosis and therapy. Imaging can help in the diagnosis of AH with a combination of hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall thickening, and periportal edema. AHSV should be suspected in the presence of multiple small (< 1 cm) nodular lesions, between 1 and 3 mm, that are hypoechoic on US, hypo-attenuating on CT, and represent necrotic foci.

Incidental focal liver lesions

Like in the general population, an incidental liver lesion without no underlying liver disease is benign in 96% of the cases. If the pre-test probability and unenhanced imaging support a benign diagnosis, further characterization with contrast administration should be performed after childbirth (Fig. 10). However, CEUS is safe for single lesions during pregnancy.

The authors report a case of a 21-year-old woman taking oral contraceptives for severe dysmenorrhea who presented with a hepatic mass and worsening right upper quadrant pain. The oral contraceptives could not be discontinued because of her pelvic symptoms, necessitating treatment of the liver lesion for symptomatic relief. Computed tomography and percutaneous biopsy demonstrated the mass to be focal nodular hyperplasia.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^117GxEgh]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) — diagnostic imaging performance and selection: An MRI with a hepatobiliary contrast agent can correctly classify FNH from adenoma with an accuracy of over 90%, and MRI has a specificity of almost 100%; if MRI is contraindicated, multiphase CT can be performed, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be used with increased diagnostic accuracy in lesions measuring < 3 cm. On hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging at 20 minutes, diagnosis can be made with nearly 100% confidence, and only 2% of FNH are hypointense; however, 11% of inflammatory and 59% of β-catenin mutated adenomas can show HBP hyperintense signal, so atypical dynamic imaging with HBP hyperintensity should be closely followed. If diagnosis cannot be made by imaging, a biopsy may be considered after multidisciplinary tumor board discussion, but interpretation can be difficult with some series reporting diagnosis as low as 58%.

### Laparoscopic staged adjustable gastric banding and liver resection in morbidly obese patient [^117UzBgK]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 34-year old morbidly obese female, with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and birth control pill therapy, who underwent laparoscopic gastric banding. On laparoscopic exploration, a 4-cm liver neoplasm that was missed by preoperative ultrasound was incidentally found. The intraoperative biopsy was suggestive for a benign lesion of hepatocellular origin but could not make the differential diagnosis between focal nodular hyperplasia and adenoma. The neoplasm had atypical features on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and was suggestive of liver adenoma. Six months after laparoscopic gastric banding, the patient presented with a weight loss of 24 kg and consented to liver resection. A laparoscopic resection of liver segment 3 was performed. Atypical liver neoplasms are subject to potential degeneration, rupture, and bleeding; therefore, they should be treated surgically to allow final diagnosis and potential cure of the disease. In this case, a staged approach was effective in obtaining substantial weight loss and a lesser degree of liver steatosis to enable the performance of a laparoscopic liver resection.

### Growth of focal nodular hyperplasia is not a reason for surgical intervention, but patients should be referred to a tertiary referral centre [^1141SWPW]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

When a liver lesion diagnosed as focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) increases in size, it may cause doubt about the initial diagnosis. In many cases, additional investigations will follow to exclude hepatocellular adenoma or malignancy. This retrospective cohort study addresses the implications of growth of FNH for clinical management.

Methods

We included patients diagnosed with FNH based on ≥ 2 imaging modalities between 2002 and 2015. Characteristics of patients with growing FNH with sequential imaging in a 6-month interval were compared to non-growing FNH.

Results

Growth was reported in 19/162 (12%) patients, ranging from 21 to 200%. Resection was performed in 4/19 growing FNHs; histological examination confirmed FNH in all patients. In all 15 conservatively treated patients, additional imaging confirmed FNH diagnosis. No adverse outcomes were reported. No differences were found in characteristics and presentation of patients with growing or non-growing FNH.

Conclusion

This study confirms that FNH may grow significantly without causing symptoms. A significant increase in size should not have any implications on clinical management if confident diagnosis by imaging has been established by a tertiary benign liver multidisciplinary team. Liver biopsy is only indicated in case of doubt after state-of-the-art imaging. Resection is deemed unnecessary if the diagnosis is confirmed by multiple imaging modalities in a tertiary referral centre.

If lesions are "HCA reduced to < 5 cm", then continue "US monitoring each trimester and week 12 post-partum", with "No follow up during pregnancy required" for selected post-treatment states; additionally, "Pregnancy in women with HCAs less than 5 cm in diameter is not contraindicated" and "US monitoring of HCAs during each trimester of pregnancy and up to 3 months postpartum is reasonable". For multiple adenomas, "surveillance of < 5 cm is advised during pregnancy even if a dominant lesion ≥ 5 cm is treated", and "Reproductive-aged women with HCAs should be counseled about the possibility of adenoma growth and rupture in pregnancy".

### Tissue sublimation follow transarterial embolization of a follicular nodular hyperplasia of the liver-report of a case [^113Vd39H]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Follicular nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign lesion of the liver that is often incidentally discovered during abdominal imaging. FNH has no malignant potential and is most commonly seen in female patients of reproductive age, a fact that has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Although FNH is mostly clinically inapparent, rapid growth might lead to symptoms, especially upper abdominal pain. Patients with rapid progressing FNH therefore are usually candidates for surgical referral. Resection of the lesion is indicated to release symptoms and to exclude the presence of hepatic adenoma, a precancerous lesion with morphologic similarities to FNH.

Besides surgical resection, less invasive interventional techniques have been used to manage liver tumors. A major advantage of less invasive techniques is the low risk of complication in comparison to the risk of complication following surgical resection. Transarterial embolization (TAE) represents a standard interventional technique for the management of hepatic lesions. Hepatic tissue sublimation (change of physical state from solid to gas) has so far not been reported as a sequela of TAE. This to the best of our knowledge is the first report of tissue sublimation following TAE.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign liver lesion thought to be a non-specific response to locally increased blood flow. Although the diagnosis of FNH and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) has made great progress over the last few years using modern imaging techniques, there are still in daily practice some difficulties concerning some atypical nodules. Here, the authors report the case of a 47-year-old woman with a single liver lesion thought to be, by imaging, an inflammatory HCA with major sinusoidal congestion. This nodule was revealed to be, at the microscopical level and after specific immunostaining and molecular analysis, an FNH with sinusoidal dilatation (so-called telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia).

Liver cancer and liver dysfunction — For individuals with a history of primary hepatocellular carcinoma with normal liver function, we recommend clinicians provide access to all available contraceptive methods utilizing a person-centered approach (GRADE 1C), whereas for individuals with severely altered liver function, we recommend nonhormonal and progestin-only contraceptives as first-line contraceptive methods, given the increased risk of thrombosis in this population (GRADE 1A). The 2024 CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) category for combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use for individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma is an unacceptable risk (category 4), and individuals with liver dysfunction related to primary or metastatic malignancy have an elevated thrombosis risk, and therefore estrogen-containing contraceptives are not recommended; the 2024 CDC MEC also categorizes hepatocellular adenoma as an unacceptable risk (category 4) for CHC use because oral contraceptive use is associated with the development and growth of hepatocellular adenoma.

As for daily practice, we recommend biopsy only in very selected cases where HCA cannot be differentiated from FNH with any imaging modality. The clinical repercussion of a wrong diagnosis of either HCA or FNH can have a large influence on a patient's future in terms of treatment and prognosis. When there are signs of malignancy patients should preferentially be forwarded to an experienced referral center for further evaluation. One should be aware that in some cases MRI or biopsy will be unable to differentiate between HCA and well-differentiated HCA.

Complications

The two major complications of HCAs are (a) intratumoral bleeding with or without associated rupture and haemoperitoneum and (b) malignant transformation to HCC. Different subtypes of HCA show variable complication rates.

Haemorrhage can occur in 15–20% of HCAs. Bleeding can be intratumoral, intrahepatic or extrahepatic (Fig. 12). Risk factors for bleeding of HCA include a diameter of 35 mm or more, visualisation of central and peripheral intralesional arteries, location in the left lateral liver and exophytic growth. Although peliosis is much more common in the inflammatory subtype compared to the HNF 1-alpha subtypes (52% vs. 4%), there is no notable difference in the risk of clinically manifest bleeding between these two subtypes (16% vs. 9%). Bleeding is very rare in the β-catenin subtype although the exact incidence is unknown.

### Tissue sublimation follow transarterial embolization of a follicular nodular hyperplasia of the liver-report of a case [^116PFPP8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Follicular nodular hyperplasia is estimated to constitute close to 8% of all primary hepatic masses and is the second most common benign liver neoplasm after hemangioma. FNH occurs in both sexes and at all ages with a female predominance. Its prevalence has been shown to be high in females on oral contraceptive. FNH in male patients is usually singular, smaller and atypical compared to findings in female patients.

In most cases, FNH is clinical silent and is usually diagnosed incidentally during routine abdominal ultrasound. However, clinical symptoms, mostly mild pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen as well as a palpable abdominal mass might be present. The diagnosis is usually suspected following abdominal imaging via US, CT or MRI. FNH might be difficult to differentiate from other hepatic lesions based on imaging alone. Lesions like hepatic adenoma and telangiectasia represent the most common differential diagnoses. Such entities, especially hepatic adenoma, a precancerous liver tumor must be differentiated from the benign FNH. This is achieved via histopathology following ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy.

Considering the benign natural history of FNH with rare acute complications and lack of malignant potential, asymptomatic cases should be conservatively managed. Surgical resection or interventional management should therefore be reserved for cases with doubtful histology or persistent symptomatic.

Transarterial embolization is a well-established procedure in the management of hepatic lesions. TAE was initially used by Doyon and colleagues to manage hepatocellular carcinoma in 1974. Nowadays, TAE is frequently used for the management of unresectable hepatic tumors. Post-interventional complications especially hepatic failure, intraperitoneal rupture and profuse hemorrhage have been reported in association with TAE. Tissue sublimation however, has so far not been reported as a possible complication of TAE. Herein we report the first case of hepatic tissue sublimation following TAE for a large FNH of the right liver lobe.
