## Question

Fluid neutral colonoscopy prep

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "fluid neutral" colonoscopy preparation, what it means, whether it exists, and how to reconcile the concept with current evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "fluid neutral" could reasonably mean in this context. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or study actually describes such a regimen. Next, I will examine the closest real-world options that minimize fluid shifts and electrolyte disturbances. After that, I should review the evidence on low-volume PEG regimens, split-dose strategies, and dietary modifications. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified recommendations and explicitly state what to avoid in patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "fluid neutral" is not a standard term in colonoscopy prep literature. I need to ensure I'm not missing a niche usage. Wait, let me verify across the major guidelines and reviews: I do not find any document defining or endorsing a "fluid neutral" preparation, which suggests the phrase is being used colloquially to describe regimens that minimize net fluid load and electrolyte shifts rather than a formally recognized category of prep [^76f948e8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should define what "fluid neutral" plausibly implies. The most coherent interpretation is a regimen that avoids large osmotic fluid shifts, maintains near-isotonicity, and keeps total ingested fluid volume modest, thereby reducing risks of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances in vulnerable patients such as those with heart failure, renal insufficiency, or cirrhosis, while still achieving adequate cleansing [^528c1c30] [^34e7505c].

> Next, I should review which real-world regimens come closest to this ideal. Low-volume, iso-osmolar PEG-based preparations are the prime candidates. Let me consider the evidence: 2 L PEG-ELS with ascorbate achieves roughly 90% adequate cleansing and is noninferior to 4 L PEG in multiple studies, with markedly better tolerability and willingness to repeat, which aligns with a "fluid-conscious" approach without sacrificing quality [^1059971e] [^3e3352eb] [^884e048e]. I should double-check the meta-analytic signal: pooled data show similar adequacy between high- and low-volume PEG when both are split-dose, reinforcing that 2 L PEG can substitute for 4 L in many patients [^06839c27] [^3e3352eb].

> I will now examine dosing strategy, because timing and split-dosing materially affect both cleanliness and safety. Split-dose administration is strongly recommended for all patients regardless of prep volume, with the second dose starting 4–6 hours before colonoscopy and completed at least 2 hours prior to sedation; this improves quality and shortens the interval between prep and procedure, which itself reduces inadequate prep rates [^7a4b07ac] [^c549214d] [^417e3d91]. Wait, let me verify gastric safety: observational data show lower residual gastric volume with split-dose versus day-prior regimens, supporting same-day fluid intake within ASA limits without excess aspiration risk when the 2-hour rule is observed [^8319a78e] [^90c3f5c9].

> But wait, what if we try to go even lower than 2 L — does ultra-low volume achieve the same goals? Ultra-low-volume options like 1 L PEG with ascorbate, sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate, or oral sulfate solution can be effective, yet I need to check the adequacy rates and heterogeneity. Meta-analytic summaries show adequate cleansing around 75–92% depending on the agent, with notable heterogeneity and, in some cases, more pronounced electrolyte or osmotic effects, so these are not uniformly "fluid neutral" and should be selected cautiously in patients at risk of fluid shifts [^3499d954] [^399ba893] [^312b18c4]. Hold on, I should verify safety caveats: sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate and oral sulfate regimens carry potential for fluid and electrolyte shifts, so they are not ideal for patients with renal, cardiac, or hepatic compromise despite their low ingestible volumes [^4896ca78] [^34e7505c].

> Let me consider dietary modifications, because reducing the need for large clear-liquid volumes can indirectly lessen the total fluid burden. A normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before colonoscopy has been shown to be noninferior or even superior to clear liquids for prep quality while improving hunger and perceived fluid intake, which can be particularly helpful when using low-volume PEG regimens [^3fbcdf8e] [^4e7cc3cd]. I should confirm guideline alignment: contemporary guidance supports limiting dietary restrictions to the day before and allows either clear liquids or low-residue/low-fiber meals early on that day, which fits a "fluid-conscious" approach without compromising cleanliness [^7f6df828] [^c8650459].

> I need to ensure I address high-risk patients explicitly. For individuals with renal insufficiency, heart failure, cirrhosis, or those at risk for volume overload or electrolyte disturbances, hyperosmotic regimens should be avoided and iso-osmolar PEG-based preparations are preferred; in this group, a 2 L split-dose PEG-ELS regimen is reasonable, with careful attention to comorbidities and, when needed, extended dietary modification or adjuncts to maximize adequacy [^34e7505c] [^d4287060] [^46030ee8]. Hold on, I should verify whether higher-volume PEG is ever favored in this group; even where 4 L split-dose can improve cleanliness, the volume load may be unsafe in heart or kidney failure, so 2 L PEG remains the pragmatic balance of efficacy and safety in most such patients [^18d08b38].

> Let me synthesize a practical, near–fluid neutral approach. For average-risk, ambulatory patients, a 2 L PEG-ELS with ascorbate split-dose regimen, with the second dose 4–6 hours before the procedure and completed at least 2 hours prior to sedation, plus a low-residue diet the day before with modest clear liquids, achieves high rates of adequate prep with lower fluid burden and better tolerability than 4 L PEG, approximating a "fluid-conscious" strategy [^1059971e] [^7a4b07ac] [^3fbcdf8e]. For high-risk patients, I should confirm that we avoid hyperosmotic agents and prioritize 2 L PEG-ELS, consider same-day or split-dose timing tailored to the procedure slot, and, if prior prep was inadequate, escalate to 4 L PEG with adjuncts only if the clinical risk of fluid overload is acceptable and can be mitigated [^34e7505c] [^0e6ca7c8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some ultra-low-volume non-PEG options might qualify as "fluid neutral" because of their small ingestible volumes, but I should correct that assumption. Despite lower drink volumes, agents like oral sulfate solution and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate can precipitate significant fluid and electrolyte shifts and are not appropriate for patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances, so they do not meet the safety connotation implied by "fluid neutral" in those populations [^4896ca78] [^34e7505c].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no formally defined "fluid neutral" colonoscopy prep, but the closest, evidence-aligned approach is a low-volume, iso-osmolar PEG-ELS regimen delivered as a split-dose, combined with limited dietary restrictions the day before, which minimizes fluid load and electrolyte shifts while maintaining high-quality cleansing in appropriately selected patients [^1059971e] [^7a4b07ac] [^7f6df828]. For patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances, avoid hyperosmotic regimens and tailor to 2 L PEG-ELS with careful timing and adjuncts as needed, recognizing that 4 L PEG may be reserved for select cases where benefits outweigh risks and can be safely managed [^34e7505c] [^0e6ca7c8].

---

A "fluid-neutral" colonoscopy prep does not exist; **all regimens require substantial fluid intake** to achieve adequate cleansing [^6f334876]. Low-volume PEG (2 L) with ascorbate is the closest option, offering **comparable efficacy to 4 L PEG** [^1059971e] with better tolerability and less total fluid intake [^3e3352eb], but still requires ~2–3 L of clear liquids [^notfound]. Split-dose regimens improve quality and tolerability [^7a4b07ac] [^e76bfb6b], and a low-residue diet the day before can reduce fluid load without compromising cleanliness [^3fbcdf8e]. Hyperosmotic preps (e.g. sodium phosphate) are not fluid-neutral and are **contraindicated in patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances** [^34e7505c] [^d4287060].

---

## Definition and clinical relevance

By definition, a fluid-neutral prep would **require minimal or no additional fluid intake** beyond the purgative itself, but no such regimen exists [^notfound]. All current preps require large volumes of clear liquids to achieve adequate cleansing, and fluid intake is a key determinant of prep quality [^0a1e3b20] [^158d6f1d].

---

## Current colonoscopy preparations and fluid requirements

| **Preparation type** | **Volume of purgative** | **Additional fluid requirement** | **Total fluid intake** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High-volume PEG | 4 L | 0–1 L | 4–5 L |
| Low-volume PEG (with ascorbate) | 2 L | 2–3 L | 4–5 L |
| Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate | 2 × 150 mL | 2–3 L | 2.3–3.3 L |
| Oral sulfate solution | 2 × 177 mL | 2–3 L | 2.3–3.3 L |

---

These data show that even "low-volume" preps still require **2–3 L of additional clear liquids**, making them not truly fluid-neutral [^notfound].

---

## Low-volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparations

Low-volume PEG (2 L) with ascorbate is the **closest to a fluid-neutral option**, providing comparable cleansing to 4 L PEG [^1059971e] with better tolerability and less total fluid intake [^3e3352eb]. However, it still requires ~2–3 L of clear liquids, so it is not truly fluid-neutral [^notfound].

---

## Split-dose regimens and fluid intake

Split-dose regimens improve prep quality and tolerability [^7a4b07ac] [^e76bfb6b] but do not meaningfully reduce total fluid intake; they redistribute intake over time, with the second dose typically given 4–6 hours before colonoscopy and completed at least 2 hours prior to sedation [^417e3d91] [^11bc1e1c].

---

## Dietary modifications to reduce fluid load

A low-residue diet the day before colonoscopy can **reduce perceived fluid intake** and improve tolerability without compromising prep quality [^3fbcdf8e] [^4e7cc3cd]. This approach helps patients manage the fluid load without sacrificing cleansing effectiveness.

---

## Patient populations benefiting from reduced fluid intake

Certain patients benefit from minimizing fluid intake, including:

- **Heart failure**: Risk of volume overload [^34e7505c].
- **Renal insufficiency**: Risk of electrolyte disturbances [^d4287060].
- **Cirrhosis**: Risk of fluid retention and electrolyte imbalance [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: Increased risk of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.

---

## Safety considerations and risks

Reduced fluid intake increases the risk of **inadequate prep**, which can lead to missed lesions, longer procedures, and higher costs [^940955f3]. Clinicians must balance fluid restriction with the need for effective cleansing and consider patient-specific risks [^34e7505c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized prep selection** based on medical history, medications, and prior prep quality [^34e7505c] [^d4287060]. They recommend against hyperosmotic preps in patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances [^34e7505c] [^d4287060] and support low-volume PEG with ascorbate as a reasonable option for many patients [^a26b274b] [^1059971e].

---

## Conclusion and practical recommendations

There is **no truly fluid-neutral colonoscopy prep**; all regimens require substantial fluid intake [^6f334876]. Low-volume PEG (2 L) with ascorbate is the closest option, offering comparable efficacy with less fluid intake, but still requiring ~2–3 L of clear liquids [^1059971e] [^3e3352eb]. Split-dose regimens and dietary modifications can improve tolerability without reducing total fluid intake [^7a4b07ac] [^3fbcdf8e]. Clinicians should individualize prep selection, especially in patients at risk of volume overload or electrolyte disturbances [^34e7505c] [^d4287060].

Increasing rates of IBP were observed in a continuous relation with longer time intervals between end of preparation and colonoscopy
The combination of a larger volume of fluids consumed during the preparation, as well as a < 8-h gap between the end of preparation and colonoscopy, additively reduced the rate of IBP
Even in diabetic individuals at risk for preparation failure, low rates of IBP were observed in the group that consumed a large volume of fluids and had a short interval to colonoscopy

Colonoscopy bowel preparation timing — split-dose regimen: For individuals using a split-dose regimen for colonoscopy preparation, we recommend the consumption of the second portion begin 4–6 hours before the time of colonoscopy and be completed at least 2 hours before the procedure start (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Shorter intervals between the last purgative ingestion and colonoscopy are associated with better preparation, as every additional hour between the last purgative ingestion and the start of colonoscopy was associated with a 10% decrease in the likelihood of having a good or excellent bowel preparation, and the improvement in preparation quality of the split-dose regimen was maintained within 3 hours from the end of the purgative, progressively decreased after 4–5 hours, and was no longer present after 5 hours. Regarding periprocedural fasting, patients may consume clear liquids up to 2 hours before anesthesia or procedural sedation, and patients in those studies had completed their split-dose regimen no earlier than 2 hours before their endoscopy. In a single-center study, the residual gastric fluid volume was significantly lower in the split-dose group (11 mL vs 19 mL; P < 0.001), with no pH difference (pH ≥ 2 for both groups).

Timing of preparation for colonoscopy — Split-dose administration is supported: "Giving part (usually half) of the bowel preparation dose on the same day as the colonoscopy (termed split-dose) results in a higher-quality colonoscopy examination compared with ingestion of the entire preparation on the day or evening before colonoscopy", and this approach "has been demonstrated to increase the adenoma detection rate" and "improves patient tolerance, as demonstrated by an increased willingness to repeat the procedure". Typically, "the standard dose of a bowel preparation is split between the day before and the morning of the procedure", and "The second dose should be administered between 3 to 8 hours before the planned start of colonoscopy procedure". A trial found "no difference in residual gastric fluid" versus evening-before dosing. Per American Society of Anesthesiologists guidance, patients "must have completed the preparation at least 2 hours before sedation is given".

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^19ba143a]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Bowel preparation before colonoscopy — Split-dose recommended whenever possible, and the authors suggest an additional 1 to 2 L of clear fluid intake beyond that recommended in prescribing information. Low-volume 2-L polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) with ascorbic acid is the only FDA-approved low-volume PEG-ELS preparation commercially available at this time and should be used cautiously in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as ascorbic acid may provoke hemolysis. Studies comparing this preparation with a 4-L PEG-ELS preparation or a sodium phosphate preparation showed similar efficacy.

Several limitations of our study need to be addressed. Data were collected through questionnaires filled out by the patient with the assistance of a nurse practitioner immediately prior to colonoscopy, and therefore patient recall might cause bias with regard to clinical as well as preparation-associated information. Moreover, it is likely that subjects would feel some degree of unease about admitting to poor compliance with the preparation protocol. The large number of patients assessed in this study may alleviate this potential bias. Furthermore, this study was conducted in a single tertiary center in Israel, which might affect the generalizability of the results. However, our cohort was demographically diverse and included a variety of ages, ethnicities and educational backgrounds, which may have mitigated the aforementioned drawback. Since all patients were scheduled for an elective examination, the indication for colonoscopy was not recorded, though this information could have helped identify subgroups that would benefit from high-volume fluid preparation. Another substantial limitation is the difficulty of achieving full adherence to guidelines and mainly the strong recommendation of initiation of colonoscopy within 5 h of consumption of the last dose of bowel preparation. The difficulty, especially with early morning examinations, is a well-known challenge. The lack of post-procedure follow up for any adverse effects is an additional limitation. However, we are unaware of any preparation-associated post colonoscopy hospitalizations. Finally, since all subjects in the study used sodium picosulfate for preparation, results might not be generalizable to other preparation protocols and further investigations are required.

In conclusion, along with previously suggested risk factors for IBP, also found in the current study, herein we show 2 modifiable bowel preparation factors, low fluid intake and a long interval to colonoscopy, that can easily be incorporated into preparation protocols to improve bowel preparation with sodium picosulfate. Further prospective interventional studies will be necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Summary Box

Inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) is associated with reduced visualization, missed lesions, and an increased risk of colonoscopy
A large meta-analysis estimated the median rate of IBP to be 26%
Multiple risk factors for IBP have been identified, including age, comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes, use of specific medications, and a long interval between end of bowel preparation and colonoscopy
Other than compliance with preparation protocols, there are few easily modifiable risk factors for IBP

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of colonoscopy is highly dependent on the adequacy of bowel preparation. Inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) is associated with lower detection rates of both benign and malignant lesions, longer procedure times and a more frequent need for a repeat procedure, with a resulting loss of work days, additional colonoscopic procedural risk to the patient and greater cost. The rate of IBP varies among multiple studies, ranging from 5–67%. A recently published, large-scale meta-analysis showed a calculated IBP rate of 19.9%; therefore, improvement in preparation adequacy rate is crucial.

Previous studies have identified multiple risk factors associated with IBP: e.g. sex and older age are weak predictors of IBP. Diabetes and underlying neurologic conditions — mainly dementia, stroke and Parkinson's disease — were consistently shown to be strong predictors of IBP in large-scale studies. Various medications are associated with a higher risk of IBP, with opioids and tricyclic antidepressants being the strongest and most consistent in large-scale studies. Factors associated with the preparation protocol (especially the effectiveness of split dose preparation and adding bisacodyl or senna to the standard preparation) were assessed in other studies, and were found to be mostly associated with better rates of adequate bowel preparation. It has also been suggested that a delay between the end of preparation and the colonoscopy confers a higher risk for IBP. However, most of the factors suggested by these studies are currently not modifiable, with the exception of shortening the time interval to the procedure (not always possible due to time of day) and splitting the dose of the medication chosen for preparation. In the current study, we sought to prospectively collect multiple patient characteristics, including modifiable factors associated with bowel preparation that have not been previously reported but could potentially be used to reduce IBP and improve the quality of colonoscopy.

Bowel preparation quality definitions and dosing approaches — The quality of a bowel preparation is defined as adequate when standard screening or surveillance intervals can be assigned based on the findings of the colonoscopy. There are options for how a patient consumes the bowel purgative, including the entire purgative in one limited timeframe (e.g., the evening before or the morning of the colonoscopy) or in a split-dose fashion; the most common convention is to administer half the purgative's volume the evening before and the remaining half the morning of the colonoscopy, although other percentage splits have been reported (e.g., 75%/25%).

Bowel preparation

The recommended bowel preparation protocol, including written instructions, was mailed to all patients scheduled for an outpatient colonoscopy at Rambam. The preparation protocol consisted of split-dose Picolax® (sodium picosulfate together with magnesium citrate). Each dose consisted of 16.1 g sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, which patients were instructed to dissolve in a cup of water. Patients scheduled for a morning procedure were instructed to stop all solid food at 12:00 the day before the procedure and drink only clear liquids until 3 h before the procedure; they were instructed to drink the first sachet at 14:00 and the second sachet at 20:00 the day before the procedure. Patients scheduled for an afternoon examination were instructed to discontinue solid food at 18:00 and consume the first sachet at 20:00 the day before the procedure, and the second sachet at 08:00 the day of the procedure. Patients were recommended to drink 1.6 L (8 cups) of clear liquids following each sachet.

All patients were recommended to take 2 tablets of bisacodyl 5 mg q.d. starting 3 days prior to colonoscopy. A low-fiber diet was recommended for 3 days prior to the procedure. All medications, except for antidiabetics, were permitted, and antiplatelets and anticoagulants were discontinued according to standard guidelines. Standard dose aspirin (75–325 mg) could be continued. During their interview, patients were shown a 200-mL cup and asked to estimate how many such cups of water, or any other clear liquid, they had consumed after each sachet. The main endpoint was bowel preparation adequacy as assessed during colonoscopy.

Endoscopists with various levels of expertise, ranging from fellows to highly experienced senior endoscopists, performed the colonoscopies and evaluated bowel preparations. Colonoscopies were performed using Olympus 160 and 185 series and Fuji 600 series endoscopy systems.

### Randomized clinical trial: a normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before colonoscopy is the most effective approach to bowel preparation in colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy [^3fbcdf8e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines recommend either a clear-liquid diet or a low-fiber diet for colonoscopy preparation. Participants in a screening program are usually motivated healthy individuals in which a good tolerability is important to improve adherence to potential surveillance colonoscopies.

Objective

Our aim was to assess whether or not a normocaloric low-fiber diet followed the day before a screening colonoscopy compromises the efficacy of bowel cleansing and may improve the tolerability of bowel preparation.

Design

This is a randomized, endoscopist-blinded, noninferiority clinical trial.

Settings

The study was conducted at a tertiary care center.

Patients

A total of 276 consecutive participants of the Barcelona colorectal cancer screening program were included.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to a clear-liquid diet or a normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before the colonoscopy. Both groups received 4L of polyethylene glycol in a split-dose regimen.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was the adequate bowel preparation rate measured with the Boston bowel preparation scale. Secondary outcomes included tolerability, fluid-intake perception, hunger, side effects, and acceptability.

Results

Participants in both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Adequate bowel preparation was achieved in 89.1% vs 95.7% in clear-liquid diet and low-fiber diet groups, showing not only noninferiority, but also superiority (p = 0.04). Low-fiber diet participants reported less fluid-intake perception (p = 0.04) and less hunger (p = 0.006), with no differences in bloating or nausea.

Limitations

The single-center design of the study could limit the external validity of the results. The present findings may not be comparable to other clinical settings.

Conclusion

A normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before a screening colonoscopy achieved better results than a clear-liquid diet in terms of adequate colon preparation. Moreover, it also improved the perception of hunger and excessive fluid intake. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02401802. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A829.

Cystic fibrosis colonoscopy preparation — A high-quality bowel preparation is essential for optimal detection of colon polyps, yet the physicochemical characteristics of stool and intestinal mucus complicate bowel preparation. A number of Food and Drug Administration — approved preparations exist, and non-Food and Drug Administration — approved options such as over-the-counter polyethylene glycol combined with sport drinks are commonly used in the general population; these may have greater patient tolerability and may have a role in CF patients, but careful attention needs to be paid to potential electrolyte shifts if such preparations are intensified in volume.

### Low-residue breakfast during the preparation for colonoscopy using a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution: a randomised non-inferiority trial [^a03e8d24]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

As one of our secondary outcomes, we were able to show that patients better tolerated the LRB than the CFD. Therefore, even though the threshold for non-inferiority was not met in the PP analysis, and thus non-inferiority at a statistical level cannot be claimed, our results still provide important information to clinicians selecting bowel cleansing regimens if tolerance is anticipated to be a barrier to colonoscopy acceptance. We opted for an a priori margin of 1 point on the OBPS to claim non-inferiority. This stringent margin was chosen, as we did not want to sacrifice any degree of bowel cleansing with the use of the LRB. However, our CI around the per-protocol point estimate was −1.47, suggesting that the LRB could be, at most, worse by ∼1.5 points on the OBPS.

Splitting the doses of bowel purgatives to include one dose the morning of the procedure has been shown to increase the efficacy of cleansing, and several investigators have attempted to look at the effect on bowel preparation of a split-dose preparation along with varying dietary regimens in randomised trials. A recent trial comparing the use of a traditional (evening prior) PEG bowel preparation plus a clear fluid diet versus a split-dose regimen without dietary restrictions showed that the split-dose arm without dietary restriction was superior for colon cleansing. However, given that the type of diet was not constant in both arms, the specific effect of a non-fluid diet on bowel preparation or tolerability using a traditional or split-dose PEG preparation was not addressed. A second study looking at varying diets and oral sulfate solution preparation did not find any difference in the quality of bowel preparation in patients who had a low-residue diet over the entire day prior to colonoscopy compared with those taking clear fluids for the full day. However, all the patients took the preparation according to a split-dose schedule, raising the possibility that this timing may obviate the need for dietary restrictions. Our subgroup analysis comparing those individuals who received a split-dose preparation versus the traditional dosing is consistent with previous literature suggesting that split-dose timing results in a superior bowel cleanse when compared with traditional dosing. However, unlike these previous studies, we found that the LRB did not appear to affect the bowel preparation whether the timing was traditional or a split-dose. These results must be interpreted in the context of a subgroup analysis, where we did not have adequate statistical power to claim non-inferiority.

Interventions

For both treatment groups, the colon-cleansing regimen was a split-dose preparation (one dose the evening before and one dose the same day as colonoscopy, within 5 to 9 h prior to the procedure; seefor the schedule of visits and assessments).

SPMC oral solution (two 5.4-oz doses) is a ready-to-drink formulation and was consumed as supplied (without mixing, stirring, or dilution), followed by five or more 8-oz glasses of clear liquid within 5 h of the first dose, and four or more 8-oz glasses of clear liquid within 4 h of the second dose. P/MC powder was reconstituted in approximately 5 oz of cold water and stirred for a full 2–3 min before consuming. After the first dose, participants were asked to consume five or more 8-oz glasses of clear liquids within 5 h. After the second dose, participants were asked to consume three 8-oz glasses of clear liquids within 5 h.

In both cases, participants were instructed to maintain a diet of clear liquids from 24 h before the colonoscopy and to stop taking anything by mouth 2 h before. Immediately prior to the colonoscopy, participants returned the Mayo Clinic Bowel Prep Tolerability Questionnaire, and chemistry and hematology laboratory samples were obtained. Following the colonoscopy, participants returned for visits at 1–2 days, 7 days, and 4 weeks.

### Bowel preparation for colonoscopy: what is best and necessary for quality? [^f3f86438]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Colonoscopy is recognizably, the best colon cancer prevention test, provided the quality of the preparation is adequate for detection of precancerous polyps but also allowing for accurate identification of margins, thereby facilitating complete endoscopic resection. As there are many aspects effecting colon prep outcomes, it is timely to review new standards for optimizing outcomes, including product selection based on patient demographics.

Recent Findings

New national guidelines have set a minimum quality threshold for adequacy and also defined a split day delivery for oral options as the "standard of care". Several new prep options have been recently released and these data are discussed.

Summary

Optimizing the quality of colon preps has major implications for clinical practice. Clinicians must recognize new targets for standard of care, providing the best approach for each individual patient, considering variable factors which may otherwise compromise success.

NASPGHAN pediatric colonoscopy bowel preparation — the report states pediatric bowel preparation protocols used before colonoscopy vary greatly, with no identified standard practice, and it reviews the evidence for several bowel preparations in children, reports on their use among NASPGHAN members, and notes that cleanout recommendations are provided. Effective bowel preparation is essential for optimal diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention, whereas suboptimal preparation can occur in up to one-third of colonoscopies and is associated with missed diagnoses, procedural risks, and increased costs; residual fluid or stool can impede visualization and, in some cases, completion of the procedure. Early regimens were replaced with various laxative and polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions, yet at present a variety of preparations are used for pediatric colonoscopies and none of these preparations meet all of these requirements.

### Low-residue breakfast during the preparation for colonoscopy using a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution: a randomised non-inferiority trial [^3683c7a1]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Goals

To test the hypothesis that the use of a low-residue breakfast (LRB) the day prior to colonoscopy was not inferior to consuming clear fluids alone (CFD) in patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel preparation.

Background

Optimal colon cleansing is essential for complete visualisation of the mucosa during colonoscopy. Few studies have examined the effect of diet on the quality of bowel cleansing or tolerance in patients using a PEG bowel preparation for colonoscopy.

Methods

Randomised, single-blinded non-inferiority trial. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy with PEG solution were randomised to an LRB followed by clear fluids or CFD using either a traditional or split-dose PEG solution for bowel preparation. The primary outcome was colon cleansing based on the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Score (OBPS).

Results

On an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, a total of 109 and 105 patients were included in the CFD and LRB arms, respectively, with 116 and 98 patients, respectively, for the per-protocol (PP) analysis. Although there was no difference in the mean total OBPS between the CFD or LRB arms in either the ITT or PP analysis, the threshold for non-inferiority was not met. Patient acceptance of the regimens was higher in the LRB arm than in the CFD arm in the ITT and PP analyses.

Conclusions

This study failed to show the non-inferiority of an LRB in patients receiving bowel preparation with a PEG-based solution. A CFD should be prescribed when using a PEG bowel preparation.

Trial Registration Number

This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01454388).

Patients and methods

Design

We performed a prospective, single-center, observational study of adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy, regardless of indication. The study took place between September 2016 and April 2018, at the Department of Gastroenterology, Rambam, Haifa, Israel. All subjects provided written informed consent. Included were adult patients referred for outpatient colonoscopy who had provided personal and medical information, as well as details concerning the bowel preparation procedure. Excluded were inpatients and patients who had undergone previous bariatric, small bowel, or colorectal surgical procedures. Patients with a previous history of other abdominal procedures, such as appendectomy or cholecystectomy, were included. The study protocol was approved in April 2016 by the Rambam institutional review board and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

Data collection

All demographic information, medical diagnoses, medications and indications for the procedure were extracted from patients' electronic medical records and physicians' referral letters. All patients were interviewed by a single nurse practitioner (EH) regarding preparation-related information, using a standard questionnaire prior to colonoscopy. After the first 452 patients, the data were analyzed and a decision was made to extend the questionnaire to include all previous questions with the addition of the new variables listed.

Demographic and social information, medical and surgical history, as well as medications and lifestyle habits (e.g. tobacco use) were collected. Data regarding medical history were reviewed with the patients and recorded, including chronic constipation (< 3 bowel movements per week), diarrhea (> 3 watery bowel movements per day), diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid function disorder, rheumatic disease, heart disease, and neurological disorders such as previous cerebrovascular accident or Parkinson's disease. Subjects were queried as to when they had performed preparation steps, such as initiation of laxative sachets, as well as the time intervals between sachets and between laxative-initiated diarrheal episodes. Subjects were also interviewed regarding compliance with the bowel preparation protocol, including diet, bisacodyl use and the volume of liquids consumed defined by number of 200-mL volume cups presented during the interview. Patients who completed the interview were included in the final analysis, irrespective of factors such as measures of compliance.

### Optimizing bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy: consensus recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^c8650459]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer bowel preparation for colonoscopy — The quality of a bowel preparation is defined as adequate when standard screening or surveillance intervals can be assigned based on the findings of the colonoscopy. We recommend the use of a split-dose bowel preparation regimen and suggest that a 2 L regimen may be sufficient. A same-day regimen is recommended as an acceptable alternative for individuals undergoing afternoon colonoscopy, but we suggest that a same-day regimen is an inferior alternative for individuals undergoing morning colonoscopy. We recommend limiting dietary restrictions to the day before a colonoscopy, relying on either clear liquids or low-fiber/low-residue diets for the early and midday meals. We suggest the adjunctive use of oral simethicone for bowel preparation before colonoscopy. Routine tracking of the rate of adequate bowel preparations at the level of individual endoscopists and at the level of the endoscopy unit is also recommended, with a target of > 90% for both rates. The most common convention is to administer half the purgative's volume the evening before the colonoscopy and the remaining half the morning of the colonoscopy, although other percentage splits have been reported (eg, 75%/25%).

Low- and ultra-low-volume bowel preparation efficacy and tolerability — key evidence includes: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial (n = 2,314) comparing 4 L split-dose polyethylene glycol (PEG) with 2 L split-dose PEG + bisacodyl, investigators found the low-volume arm to be noninferior, with adequate bowel preparation 90% vs 89% (P = 0.02) and lower willingness to repeat in the high-volume arm (66.9% vs 91.9%; P < 0.01). A meta-analysis reported unacceptably low adequacy for ≤ 1 L sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (75%; 19 trials; n = 10,287), 1 L PEG with ascorbate (83%; 10 trials; n = 1,717), and < 1 L sodium phosphate (82%; 2 trials; n = 621), whereas a ≤ 1 L split-dose oral sulfate solution achieved 92% (3 trials; n = 597); results stated ultra-low-volume regimens are not ready for general use and should also be interpreted with caution given heterogeneity (I² range 86%–98%). In a randomized trial of 548 ambulatory subjects, adequate preparation occurred in 91.6% with 2 L PEG vs 90.5% with 1 L PEG + linaclotide (P = 0.64), with higher willingness to repeat in the lower volume arm (95.2% vs 82.2%; P < 0.01).

FDA-approved preparations for bowel cleansing — recommendations state that selection of a bowel-cleansing regimen should take into consideration the patient's medical history, medications, and, when available, the adequacy of bowel preparation reported from prior colonoscopies (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A split-dose regimen of 4L PEG-ELS provides high-quality bowel cleansing (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). In healthy nonconstipated individuals, a 4-L PEG-ELS formulation produces a bowel-cleansing quality that is not inferior to a lower-volume PEG formulation (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Polyethylene glycol–electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS)–based cleansing agents are available in 4L (considered large or high volume) or as 2L plus an adjunct (considered low volume).

### Split-dose bowel preparation for colonoscopy and residual gastric fluid volume: an observational study [^19695464]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Split-dose bowel preparations for colonoscopy are more effective and better tolerated than preparations given entirely the day or evening before the procedure; however, some resistance to split-dose preparation stems from concerns about an increased risk of aspiration with same-day preparation.

Objective

We sought to evaluate residual gastric volumes in patients after split-dose bowel preparations.

Design

Prospective measurement of residual gastric volumes in patients undergoing same-day EGD and colonoscopy after split-dose bowel preparations, patients undergoing EGD alone, or patients undergoing EGD and colonoscopy after bowel preparation given entirely the evening before the procedure.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital-based endoscopy unit.

Patients

This study involved 712 patients, including 254 in the split-dose bowel preparation group, 411 in the EGD-only group, and 47 in the evening-before-procedure bowel preparation group.

Intervention

Measurement of residual gastric volume before endoscopic procedures.

Main Outcome Measurements

Residual gastric volume.

Results

The mean residual gastric volume in patients receiving split-dose bowel preparation (19.7 mL) was higher than in patients undergoing EGD alone (14.6 mL) but not different from that in patients receiving bowel preparation the evening before the procedure (20.2 mL). Within the split-dose preparation group, there was no association between the interval from last actual fluid ingestion and procedure start time and the residual gastric volume. The range of residual gastric volumes between study arms was similar.

Limitations

Nonrandomized study. The number of inpatients undergoing split-dose bowel preparation was small.

Conclusion

These data support the safety of split-dose bowel preparation for outpatients undergoing colonoscopy.

### Optimizing bowel preparation quality for colonoscopy: consensus recommendations by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^b189d34f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Terminology used throughout the document — standardized definitions for bowel preparation quality, regimen timing, and volume categories are provided to guide colonoscopy preparation. Bowel preparation quality is the degree of cleanliness of the colon, and the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommends assessing and reporting this metric after all washing and suctioning maneuvers have been done during the colonoscopy. Adequate bowel preparation quality is when a standard screening or surveillance interval can be assigned based on the findings of the colonoscopy, whereas inadequate bowel preparation quality is when such an interval cannot be assigned. Regimen timing definitions include a day prior regimen (entire purgative the day before colonoscopy), a split-dose regimen (consumes some portion before and the remainder the day of colonoscopy), and a same-day regimen (entire purgative on the day of colonoscopy). Volume categories are high-volume (use of ≥ 4 L of purgative), low-volume (use of ≥ 2 to < 4 L), and ultra-low-volume (use of < 2 L).

### Study plan… [^15917fc1]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Background Colonoscopy is the standard method for luminal evaluation of the colon. Bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy is critical to the endoscopist obtaining optimal visualization during the procedure and therefore plays an integral role in safety, efficacy and diagnostic accuracy of the procedure. The bowel cleansing portion of the procedure is often the most lamented aspect of the colonoscopy experience. One of the standard bowel preparation regimens is polyethylene glycol lavage solution which entails consuming 4 L of water mixed with a powder packet that contains the main ingredient along with electrolytes. Treatment Plan This is a prospective, randomized, endoscopist-blinded study that will be carried out at Temple University Hospital.

All adult patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy will be screened for enrollment in the study.
- All patients will be advised to have clear liquids for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the day prior to their planned colonoscopy. Based on their randomization assignment, subjects will be instructed to either
- Consume 4 L polyethylene glycol Or
- Consume 255 g of PEG 3350 in 64 oz of yellow Gatorade. The choices will be the Lemon-Lime, Lemonade, or All-Stars Lemon Lime flavors which are all primarily yellow. Study participants will be instructed to take nothing by mouth after midnight on the day of their colonoscopy. They will also be advised to avoid discussing the details of their bowel preparation with their endoscopist until after their colonoscopy.

Upon arrival to their scheduled colonoscopy appointment and prior to their procedure, patients will be provided a short survey assessing their bowel preparation experience. Also at the time of insertion of an intravenous catheter 5 cc of blood will be drawn for a complete metabolic panel and sent to the TUH laboratory to evaluate for electrolyte disturbances.
- A history of constipation
- Patients who use medications to assist with a bowel movement such as osmotic, stimulant, or cathartic laxatives
- Diabetes or glucose intolerance
- Patients with severe underlying renal or hepatic impairment
- Pregnant women
- pregnancy test performed on all menstruating women before procedure.

Colonoscopy bowel preparation timing — association of interval with quality: In non–split-dose, day prior preparations, every additional hour between the last purgative ingestion and colonoscopy was associated with a 10% decrease in the likelihood of a good or excellent preparation. In same-day morning preparations, finishing a PEG-based purgative within 4 hours of the start of colonoscopy yielded better preparation quality than finishing more than 4 hours before insertion. Meta-analysis findings indicate the split-dose improvement was maintained within 3 hours from the end of the purgative, progressively decreased after 4–5 hours, and was no longer present after 5 hours.

### Volume of fluid consumption during preparation for colonoscopy is possibly the single most important determinant of bowel preparation adequacy [^158d6f1d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of colonoscopy are directly dependent on the quality of bowel preparation. Multiple risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) have been identified; however, IBP is still reported in 20–30% of cases in most studies. We aimed to identify modifiable predictors of the adequacy of bowel preparation using sodium picosulfate, and to recommend easily modifiable parameters to increase the success rate of colonoscopies.

Methods

This was a single-center observational study of adult outpatients referred for an elective colonoscopy. Patients were interviewed prior to colonoscopy; volume of liquids consumed was calculated as number of 200-mL cups showed to the patient. Additional information, including medical history, diagnoses and regular medications, was procured from patients' medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with IBP in a subgroup analysis of high-risk patients.

Results

The rate of IBP in 1172 subjects was 19.4%. This rate decreased as fluid consumption increased, with a further drop associated with shorter intervals from end of preparation to colonoscopy. Drinking < 1.4 L significantly increased the risk of IBP (odds ratio [OR] 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.65–4.95), while drinking ≥ 2 L was associated with adequate preparation (OR 0.09, 95%CI 0–0.42). These associations were stronger in high-risk individuals.

Conclusion

Greater fluid intake and short interval to colonoscopy are easily modifiable parameters that can substantially reduce the rate of IBP, especially among high-risk individuals.

### A low-residue breakfast improves patient tolerance without impacting quality of low-volume colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy: a randomized trial [^4e7cc3cd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

We compared the efficacy and patient tolerance of two dietary regimens used as an adjunct to standard bowel cleansing in preparation for elective colonoscopy.

Methods

Our prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, noninferiority trial compared two dietary regimens administered the day before colonoscopy. Subjects received low-volume bowel preparation. The primary outcome was efficacy of colon cleansing, rated by the Ottawa bowel preparation scale (OBPS). Patient acceptance of the assigned dietary regimen was assessed as a secondary outcome.

Results

The mean OBPS score for the standard clear-fluid diet group was 4.47, compared with 4.62 for the low-residue breakfast group, meeting criteria for noninferiority. The groups reported similar mean intensity of hunger on a visual analog hunger scale. However, overall satisfaction was higher with the low-residue diet than with the clear-fluid diet.

Conclusions

A low-residue breakfast on the day before elective colonoscopy does not compromise the overall quality of bowel preparation as compared with a standard clear-fluid diet and is likely to be preferred by patients.

### Quality bowel preparation for surveillance colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is a must [^0e4ffcf9]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Colonoscopy is routinely performed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for surveillance of dysplasia. Thorough bowel preparation is necessary to facilitate lesion detection. Patients with IBD do not have poorer bowel preparation outcomes but may have decreased preparation tolerance affecting adherence to surveillance protocols. A low-fiber prepreparation diet may improve preparation tolerance without affecting preparation quality. The standard preparation regimen should consist of split-dose administration of a polyethylene glycol-based purgative. Low-volume, hyperosmolar purgatives may be considered in patients with previous preparation intolerance, heightened anxiety, stenotic disease, or dysmotility. Appropriate patient education is critical to enhance preparation quality.

### A randomized controlled trial evaluating a new 2-L PEG solution plus ascorbic acid vs 4-L PEG for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy [^edb68176]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bowel preparation is critical for the efficacy and safety of colonoscopy. Poor patient tolerance to bowel preparation has been associated with the high amount of fluid administered. A 2-L polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution containing ascorbic acid has been recently developed.

Aims

To compare the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 2-L PEG+ascorbic acid vs 4-L PEG for colonoscopy.

Methods

We designed a single blind randomized non-inferiority study in order to compare the two bowel preparations. A blinded assessment of cleansing was made by the endoscopist according to the Aronchick scale. Acceptability was assessed by questionnaire. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis were reported.

Results

Overall, 169 patients (PP: 166) were selected for the 2-L PEG+ascorbic acid and 170 (PP: 166) for the 4-L PEG. When rating global bowel cleansing at ITT, an excellent-good level was reported in 84.6% (PP: 86.2%) of patients who received 2-L PEG+ascorbic acid and 75.3% (PP: 77%) of patients who received 4-L PEG (p = 0.04). Acceptability rate favoured 2-L PEG+ascorbic acid vs 4-L PEG (83% vs 76%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

2-L PEG+ascorbic acid, completed with an additional L of clear fluids, provided bowel cleansing which appeared to be more effective and acceptable than 4-L PEG.

### Volume of fluid consumption during preparation for colonoscopy is possibly the single most important determinant of bowel preparation adequacy [^667f99f0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Extensive bowel preparation characteristics were collected and analyzed, including volume of clear liquids consumed during colonoscopy preparation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously reported. We show that the volume of liquids consumed with each sachet was independently associated with the rate of IBP, where only 1/66 patients who consumed ≥ 2 L after each sachet had inadequate preparation. Furthermore, this is the first study to show a direct and continuous association between volume of fluids consumed and IBP rate. This continuous reduction in rate was seen as fluid consumption exceeded the instructions provided in the picosulfate leaflet, which recommends at least 1.25 L (5 cups) and only 750 mL (3 cups or 250 mL) of clear liquids following the first and second sachets, respectively. In an effort to identify additional modifiable preparation-related features, we observed that the rate of IBP decreased further in a subgroup of patients whose colonoscopies were performed < 8 h after they took the second sachet of sodium picosulfate. This finding was independent of whether the procedure took place during morning or afternoon hours. IBP rates were low even in high-risk diabetic, obese, or older patients who met this criterion. A longer time interval between bowel preparation and colonoscopy has long been shown to be a risk factor for IBP; however, the further improvement we found with greater liquid consumption has major significance. An important reservation regarding these findings is the possible risk of electrolyte disturbances with consumption of high volumes of water during bowel preparation. Our subjects were outpatients and we did not perform any blood sample analysis. Therefore, further research is needed, and balanced fluids should be considered when high-volume preparations are recommended or studied. However, we are unaware of any hospitalizations or deaths that occurred in our cohort.

2.1 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions

- Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before administration of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid for oral solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Two doses (one packet per dose) of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid for oral solution are required for a complete preparation for colonoscopy either as a Split-Dose (preferred) or Day-Before dosing regimen.

- The preferred method is the "Split-Dose" method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose during the evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose the next day, the morning of the day of the colonoscopy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- The alternative method is the "Day Before" method and consists of two separate doses: the first dose during the afternoon or early evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose 6 hours later during the evening before the colonoscopy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

- Each packet of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid must be dissolved in 5 ounces of cold water prior to ingestion and administered according to the dosing regimen. Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

clear liquid dietListen to pronunciationA diet that is made up of only liquids and foods that are clear liquids at room temperature. Clear liquids are easy to digest and include water, broth, gelatin, plain tea and coffee, popsicles and juices without pulp, sodas, and sports drinks. Clear liquid diets may be used before certain tests or procedures, such as a colonoscopy, or before or after certain types of surgery. They may also be used to help treat gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Clear liquid diets are normally used for only a few days because they do not have enough of the calories and nutrients the body needs.

Bowel preparation for 12-year-old to adult patients (> 40 kg) — surveyed regimens (Table 5): Monotherapy (N = 19) most commonly used PEG-3350 with age-based dosing of a small bottle (14 capfuls) or large bottle (29 capfuls) in 64 oz of fluids, taken throughout the day the day before colonoscopy; weight-based dosing used 1.5 g·kg−1·day−1 in 8 oz of fluids for every capful, taken throughout the day and given daily for 4 days before colonoscopy. Dual therapy (N = 22) most commonly combined PEG-3350 and bisacodyl, with PEG-3350 given as a small bottle (14 capfuls) in 64 oz of fluids taken throughout the day the day before colonoscopy, and bisacodyl given as two tablets (10 mg) once the day before colonoscopy. Additional measures included dietary changes (N = 41), with "Clear liquids" only 1 day before colonoscopy, and rectal therapy (N = 10) using adult bisacodyl 10 mg suppository one suppository/day one day before colonoscopy, administered before and on the same day of procedure.

### Effective bowel cleansing before colonoscopy: a randomized study of split-dosage versus non-split dosage regimens of high-volume versus low-volume polyethylene glycol solutions [^e913364e]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate bowel cleansing is essential for a high-quality, effective, and safe colonoscopy.

Objectives

To evaluate the degree of colon cleansing comparing split-dosage versus non-split-dosage intake of two different polyethylene glycol (PEG) volumes (low-volume PEG + ascorbic acid vs standard-volume PEG-electrolyte solution) and to identify predictors of poor bowel cleansing.

Design

Single-blind, active control, randomized study.

Setting

Tertiary-care institutions in Italy.

Patients

This study involved adult patients undergoing elective colonoscopy.

Intervention

Colonoscopy with different bowel preparation methods.

Main Outcome Measurements

Degree of bowel cleansing.

Results

We randomized 895 patients, and 868 patients were finally included in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Overall compliance was excellent (97%) for both preparation methods. No difference in tolerability was recorded. Palatability was superior with low volume compared with high volume (acceptable or good 58% vs 51%, respectively, P < .005), independently of intake schedule. PEG plus ascorbic acid produced the same degree of cleansing as standard-volume PEG-electrolyte solution (77% vs 73.4%, respectively, within the split-dosage group and 41.7% vs 44.3%, respectively, within the non-split-dosage group). Independently of PEG volumes, the split-dosage regimen produced markedly superior cleansing results over the same-day method (good/excellent 327/435, 75.2% vs 186/433, 43.0%, P = 0.00001). Maximum cleansing was observed in colonoscopies performed within 8 hours from the last fluid intake versus over 8 hours from the last fluid intake (P < .001). The degree of bowel cleansing affected both cecal intubation (failed intubation 11.7% with fair/poor preparation vs 1.2% with good/excellent preparation, P = 0.00001) and polyp detection rates (12.2% with fair/poor vs 24.6% with good/excellent preparation, P = 0.001). Aborted procedures were significantly more frequent in the non-split-dosage arm (21.2% vs 6.9%, odds ratio [OR] 3.60 [2.29–5.77], P < .0001). Independent predictors of poor bowel cleansing were male sex (OR 1.45 [1.08–1.96], P = 0.014) and a non-split-dosage bowel preparation schedule (OR 2.08 [1.89–2.37], P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Low-volume PEG plus ascorbic acid is as effective as high-volume PEG-electrolyte solution but has superior palatability. A split-dosage schedule is the most effective bowel cleansing method. Colonoscopy should be performed within 8 hours of the last fluid intake.

### How to choose the best preparation for colonoscopy [^a3a37e7c]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The success and accuracy of colonoscopy is largely dependent on appropriate cleansing of the colon. The ideal bowel preparation should be safe, well-tolerated and effective. Although colonoscopy preparations are vastly better than the earliest barium enemas used in X-ray regimens, none of the currently available formulations sufficiently fulfills the above criteria. Currently used techniques of colon cleansing include dietary and cathartic methods, gut lavage and the administration of phosphates. All of these methods are efficacious, particularly when administered in a split dose (one the evening before and one just before the planned colonoscopy). Gut lavage methods are the safest method; however, dietary and cathartic methods are also reasonably safe. Low-dose phosphate preparations are well tolerated, but safety concerns have led to the withdrawal of some phosphate products from the US market. A new oral sulfate product that achieves a desirable balance of safety, tolerability in patients and efficacy will shortly be introduced. Physicians should be aware of the range of colonoscopy preparations available and their limitations, so that the best preparation can be chosen for an individual patient.

Observational comparisons of purgatives — ADRs, quality, and limitations: There was no observed difference in ADRs and authors concluded choice of purgative should be based on other factors such as tolerability, cost, or safety; another large study of more than 4,000 colonoscopies performed by 75 endoscopists reported that oral sodium sulfate, PEG-3350 with sports drink, and low-volume PEG-electrolyte lavage solution with ascorbic acid had superior preparation quality and tolerability compared with high-volume PEG; however, these retrospective single-organization datasets and nonrandomized designs may introduce selection bias.

Bowel preparation regimens — comparative outcomes and study design: Compared with GoLYTELY, SuPREP (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.40–0.69) were associated with reduced inadequate bowel preparation rates, and there was no observed difference in ADRs. Another large study of more than 4,000 colonoscopies by 75 endoscopists assessed regimens including oral sodium sulfate, PEG-3350 with sports drink, 4 L of PEG, magnesium citrate, low-volume PEG-electrolyte lavage solution (ELS) with ascorbic acid or anhydrous citric acid, sodium picosulfate, and magnesium oxide; oral sodium sulfate, PEG-3350 with sports drink, and low-volume PEG-ELS with ascorbic acid had superior preparation quality and tolerability as compared with high-volume PEG. The authors note these data are retrospective, from single organizations, and not randomized trials, so selection biases may limit generalizability.
