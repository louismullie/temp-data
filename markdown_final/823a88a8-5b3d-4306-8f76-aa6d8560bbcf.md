## Question

For a 12-year-old male with acne currently using tretinoin 0.05%, what is the next step in therapy if this regimen is inadequate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next step in therapy should be for a 12-year-old boy with acne who has had an inadequate response to topical tretinoin 0.05% monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about where he fits in guideline-based severity pathways and what "inadequate response" implies. Then, I should verify age-appropriate options and regulatory considerations. Next, I will review evidence-based escalation from topical monotherapy to combination therapy versus indications to move directly to oral isotretinoin. Finally, I need to ensure monitoring, safety, and adherence strategies are explicitly addressed and supported by current guidelines and labeling [^115sg9Qn] [^116kmqyB] [^11121thf].

> Let me first confirm the clinical category: a preadolescent/adolescent male on a topical retinoid with insufficient control typically falls under "inadequate response to topical retinoid monotherapy", so the decision branch depends on current severity, scarring risk, and psychosocial impact; I should double-check that current guidelines recommend stepping up to combination topical therapy for persistent mild-to-moderate papulopustular disease, while reserving systemic isotretinoin for severe nodular disease, refractory cases, or those with scarring/major psychosocial burden [^115sg9Qn] [^116kmqyB].

> I will now examine the evidence for escalation in moderate but refractory disease: guidelines support adding benzoyl peroxide to a topical retinoid or using a fixed-dose retinoid/antimicrobial combination, which improves efficacy versus monotherapy by targeting multiple pathogenic pathways; in fact, clindamycin 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% gel has shown superiority to either component alone, though I should ensure antibiotic stewardship and typically pair any antibiotic with benzoyl peroxide to mitigate resistance, and S3 favors adapalene over tretinoin for tolerability if a retinoid switch is needed [^112SjbvY] [^114txgPM] [^116kmqyB].

> Wait, let me verify age-appropriateness of the current and proposed topical options; Altreno (tretinoin 0.05% lotion) is FDA-approved down to age 9, and pediatric studies demonstrate efficacy and tolerability of tretinoin lotion in preadolescents, so continuing or optimizing a retinoid-based regimen in a 12-year-old is on-label and supported, while adding benzoyl peroxide to the morning routine with retinoid at night is a common, evidence-consistent approach [^116hc7nz] [^113JTxfd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting an oral antibiotic next; my initial instinct was to consider a short course of oral antibiotics for inflammatory disease, but I should confirm that guidelines emphasize combination topical therapy first for moderate, non-nodular acne and caution against antibiotic monotherapy; if antibiotics are used, they should be limited in duration and combined with benzoyl peroxide to curb resistance, yet given this patient's inadequate response to retinoid alone, the cleaner next step is adding benzoyl peroxide or prescribing a fixed-dose combination rather than immediately escalating to oral antibiotics unless severity truly warrants it [^115sg9Qn] [^116kmqyB].

> Next, I should review when to proceed directly to oral isotretinoin: in severe nodular acne, refractory disease after appropriate topical or oral therapy, or when scarring or significant psychosocial burden is present, AAD 2024 recommends isotretinoin as indicated; dosing is typically 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with food to optimize bioavailability per FDA labeling, with baseline and periodic LFTs and fasting lipids, pregnancy prevention counseling for those who can become pregnant, and prudent monitoring of mood and other adverse effects; this path avoids prolonging ineffective therapy and helps prevent irreversible scarring [^115sg9Qn] [^11773Egv] [^115yBDuH] [^115grjt9] [^114DRZBk] [^116Rv2Pt].

> I should confirm age considerations for isotretinoin and ensure I'm not overstepping: while FDA labels focus on severe recalcitrant nodular acne without a strict lower age in labeling language, clinical use in adolescents is established, and primary care guidance also supports isotretinoin in adolescents with severe nodular or refractory acne; in this 12-year-old, candidacy hinges on current severity and scarring/psychosocial impact rather than age alone [^11121thf] [^115sg9Qn].

> Let me think about practical optimization if we remain in the moderate but refractory lane: add benzoyl peroxide 2.5–5% in the morning and continue the retinoid at night to reduce potential retinoid degradation by benzoyl peroxide when layered together, or select a fixed-dose combination where applicable; mitigate irritancy with gentle cleanser, moisturizers, and a brief retinoid "ramp up" if needed, as these strategies improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy; reassess in 8–12 weeks to determine need for further escalation [^113aEbSD] [^113xQbyd] [^116kmqyB].

> But wait, what if tolerability is limiting adherence rather than true resistance? I should double-check whether switching from tretinoin to adapalene (often better tolerated) or to a lotion formulation of tretinoin improves adherence and outcomes before declaring failure; S3 favors adapalene over tretinoin for tolerability, and pediatric data support the lotion vehicle's cutaneous tolerability profile, which can be clinically meaningful in sustaining use [^114txgPM] [^113JTxfd].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the decision algorithm is explicit: if disease is still moderate papulopustular without scarring, the next appropriate step is combination topical therapy (add benzoyl peroxide to existing tretinoin or use a fixed-dose retinoid/antimicrobial combination, with stewardship safeguards), reassessing after 8–12 weeks; if disease is severe/nodular, scarring, or conferring major psychosocial burden now or after an adequate trial of combination therapy, initiate oral isotretinoin with guideline-concordant monitoring and counseling to prevent progression and scarring [^115sg9Qn] [^116kmqyB] [^11773Egv].

If acne remains active on tretinoin 0.05%, the next step is to **add benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5–5%** [^116kmqyB] to reduce inflammatory lesions and prevent antibiotic resistance. If inflammation persists, **add a topical antibiotic** (clindamycin 1% or erythromycin 2%) with BPO [^116kmqyB] to limit resistance. For moderate-to-severe or refractory acne, escalate to **oral antibiotics** (doxycycline or minocycline) for 3–4 months with continued topical therapy. Reserve isotretinoin for severe nodular [^11121thf] or recalcitrant acne after other therapies fail [^115sg9Qn]. Consider hormonal therapy in females with signs of androgen excess or menstrual irregularities.

---

## Stepwise escalation of acne therapy

### Step 1: optimize topical therapy

- **Benzoyl peroxide (BPO)**: Add BPO 2.5–5% gel or wash [^116kmqyB] to tretinoin to reduce inflammatory lesions and prevent antibiotic resistance.

- **Topical antibiotics**: If inflammation persists, add clindamycin 1% or erythromycin 2% [^116kmqyB] with BPO to limit resistance.

- **Alternative topical retinoids**: Consider adapalene 0.1–0.3% [^114txgPM] or tazarotene 0.05–0.1% [^113NDMcv] if tretinoin is poorly tolerated or ineffective.

---

### Step 2: systemic therapy for moderate-to-severe or refractory acne

Oral antibiotics (doxycycline 50–100 mg BID or minocycline 50–100 mg BID) are used for 3–4 months with continued topical therapy for **moderate-to-severe or refractory acne**. In females with androgen excess or menstrual irregularities, consider **hormonal therapy** (combined oral contraceptives or spironolactone 50–100 mg/day).

---

### Step 3: isotretinoin for severe or recalcitrant acne

- **Indications**: Severe nodular acne [^11121thf], recalcitrant acne, or significant psychosocial burden after failure of other therapies [^115sg9Qn] [^1176kFJD].

- **Dosage**: 0.5–1 mg/kg/day [^114DRZBk] for 16–20 weeks [^111rx41h], targeting a cumulative dose of 120–150 mg/kg.

- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic LFTs, lipids [^11773Egv], and pregnancy tests (for females of childbearing potential).

---

## Summary table: escalation of acne therapy

| **Step** | **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | BPO 2.5–5% | Mild-to-moderate acne | Add to tretinoin [^116kmqyB] |
| 1 | Topical antibiotics | Inflammatory acne | Combine with BPO |
| 1 | Alternative retinoids | Poor tolerance to tretinoin | Adapalene or tazarotene [^114txgPM] [^113NDMcv] |
| 2 | Oral antibiotics | Moderate-to-severe acne | Doxycycline or minocycline |
| 2 | Hormonal therapy | Females with androgen excess | COCPs or spironolactone |
| 3 | Isotretinoin | Severe or recalcitrant acne | Requires monitoring [^11773Egv] |

---

## Conclusion

If tretinoin 0.05% is inadequate, **add BPO** [^116kmqyB] and consider **topical antibiotics** [^1173LYWx]. Escalate to **oral antibiotics** for moderate-to-severe or refractory acne, and reserve **isotretinoin** for severe or recalcitrant cases [^11121thf].

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^113JTxfd]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

This was a post hoc analysis of two identical multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, vehicle‐controlled, parallel group clinical studies in pediatric subjects with moderate‐to‐severe acne. Protocols received approval before patient enrollment from the appropriate institutional review board (IRB) and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. All subjects were informed of the study details and provided written consent.

Eligible subjects included male and female patients of any race and ethnicity aged 9‐13 years who presented with 20‐40 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 20‐100 noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), and two nodules or less. A washout period of 2‐4 weeks was required for subjects who used previous prescription and over-the-counter acne treatments.

Subjects were enrolled with an Evaluator Global Severity Score (EGSS) of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) and randomized (1:1) to tretinoin 0.05% lotion or matched vehicle lotion, applied once daily for 12 weeks. They were instructed to gently wash their faces with the approved cleanser and warm water, rinsing thoroughly and gently patting their face dry. During the study, each subject was permitted to use only approved nonmedicated cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens. Lists of approved cleanser and moisturizers were provided. Subjects applied a pea‐sized amount of the study drug, dotted on six facial areas, and gently rubbed it into the skin.

### Safety and efficacy of micronized tretinoin gel (0.05%) in treating adolescent acne [^113aEbSD]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Tretinoin is widely used in the treatment of acne. Despite significant advances in formulation development, irritation and dryness can be particularly bothersome, especially during the first 3–4 weeks, impacting adherence. Dose titration and adjunct use of moisturizers have been commonly employed. Co-prescribing with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or a BPO/antibiotic combination is also common practice. The tretinoin molecule is unstable and can be degraded by BPO, further complicating treatment regimens.

Lately, formulation technology has focused on providing more efficient penetration of the tretinoin into the skin layers so that lower concentrations of tretinoin might afford better tolerability but maintain good efficacy. This is achieved by incorporating moisturizing excipients to minimize irritation and providing greater stability to the tretinoin molecule. This approach is particularly relevant in a pediatric acne population where the efficacy/tolerability balance is important, and treatment regimens must take into account lifestyles, but little data exist on the use of tretinoin in this patient population. A micronized formulation of tretinoin (0.05%) gel has been developed that provides a more efficient delivery of tretinoin, because of its optimal particle size, no degradation by BPO and better cutaneous tolerability than tretinoin microsphere (0.1%) gel without compromising efficacy in a pediatric population.

### Renova [^114c1NHR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Tretinoin is an endogenous retinoid metabolite of Vitamin A that binds to intracellular receptors in the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ), which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms such as irritation, or both.

The effect of tretinoin on skin with chronic photodamage has not been evaluated in animal studies. When hairless albino mice were treated topically with tretinoin shortly following a period of UVB irradiation, new collagen formation was demonstrated only in photodamaged skin. However, in human skin treated topically, adequate data have not been provided to demonstrate any increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA. Application of 0.1% tretinoin cream to photodamaged human forearm skin was associated with an increase in antibody staining for procollagen I propeptide. No correlation was made between procollagen I propeptide staining with collagen I levels or with observed clinical effects. Thus, the relationships between the increased collagen in rodents, increased procollagen I propeptide in humans, and the clinical effects of tretinoin have not yet been clearly defined.

### Use of topical tretinoin and the development of noncutaneous adverse events: Evidence from a systematic review of the literature [^114cCnHD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids have been in clinical use for the treatment of chronic skin conditions, including acne, photodamage, and psoriasis, for 30 years. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the incidence of noncutaneous adverse events (AE) among patients treated with topical retinoids, focusing on topical tretinoin studies reported before the Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention trial.

- **Methods**: Electronic literature searches were conducted in Embase and MEDLINE for literature reporting development of nonteratogenic, noncutaneous AE among patients treated with topical retinoids, published through September 2008.

- **Results**: The search yielded 2778 citations, of which 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Tretinoin was used in 14 of the studies. Other retinoids assessed included isotretinoin, adapalene, alitretinoin, and tazarotene. Within patients receiving topical tretinoin, 27.9% reported the occurrence of at least one noncutaneous AE. The majority of noncutaneous AE were transient and judged not to be related to tretinoin treatment.

- **Limitations**: The conclusions of this study apply largely to tretinoin compared with other topical retinoids. Many of the included trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical treatment, and reporting of safety events concentrated on the incidence of localized AE, rather than systemic or noncutaneous events.

In conclusion, no clear evidence was found of a relationship between the use of topical tretinoin and the development of noncutaneous AE before a recent report of excess mortality.

### Tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris: Impact of gender and race on efficacy and safety [^113ny4Kp]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

There has been an increasing interest in gender and racial differences in the pathogenesis and treatment of acne vulgaris (acne). Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a major concern in patients of color. Female acne patients report more anxiety and depression, with acne improvement positively influencing quality of life (QoL) more than in their male counterparts. Differences in acne presentation are also noted. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymeric emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients, especially those who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations.

- **Objective**: To determine the impact of gender and race on the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate or severe acne.

- **Methods**: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate-to-severe acne. Subjects (aged 9 to 58 years, N = 1640) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] to clear/almost clear). Quality of life was assessed using the validated Acne QoL scale. Safety, adverse events (AEs), cutaneous tolerability, and hypo-/hyper-pigmentation (using a 4-point scale where 0 = none and 3 = severe) were evaluated at each study visit.

Results for efficacy and tolerability were observed through the mean percentage reduction by week 12.

### Oral isotretinoin for acne [^1132E26A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit associated with socialization and mental health problems, may affect more than 80% of teenagers. Isotretinoin is the only drug that targets all primary causal factors of acne; however, it may cause adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral isotretinoin for acne vulgaris.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to July 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and LILACS. We updated this search in March 2018, but these results have not yet been incorporated into the review. We also searched five trial registries, checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant trials, and hand-searched dermatology conference proceedings. A separate search for adverse effects of oral isotretinoin was undertaken in MEDLINE and Embase up to September 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of oral isotretinoin in participants with clinically diagnosed acne were compared against placebo, any other systemic or topical active therapy, and isotretinoin itself in different formulations, doses, regimens, or course durations.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 31 RCTs involving 3836 participants (aged 12 to 55 years) with mild to severe acne. There were twice as many male participants as females. Most studies were undertaken in Asia, Europe, and North America. Outcomes were generally measured between eight to 32 weeks.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^115Yk7GL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Safety**: A similar number of subjects in each treatment group (22 with tretinoin 0.05% lotion and 18 with vehicle) reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All TEAEs experienced in the tretinoin 0.05% lotion group were mild or moderate. Treatment-related adverse events reported by ≥ 1% of subjects treated with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were application site pain (5.6%), dryness (2.8%), and irritation, exfoliation, or pruritus (each 1.4%).

- **Cutaneous safety and tolerability**: Erythema and scaling were recorded by the investigator. Overall, mild-to-moderate erythema was noted in 43% of subjects at baseline, with 12% reporting mild-to-moderate scaling. Mean scores for both erythema and scaling increased at Week 4 (to 0.6 and 0.5, respectively, where 0 = mild) following treatment with tretinoin 0.05% lotion, returning to baseline levels by the end of the study. Levels of itching, burning, and stinging were obtained from the subjects. Overall, 19% of subjects reported mild-to-moderate itching at baseline. Only four subjects (6%) reported any itching by Week 12. Reports of burning (7 subjects, 5%) and stinging (6 subjects, 4%) were infrequent and mild at baseline. Mean scores increased very slightly at Week 4 (to 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, where 0 = mild) with tretinoin 0.05% lotion, again returning to baseline levels by the end of the study.

### Amnesteem [^115yBDuH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology

Isotretinoin is a retinoid which, when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown.

- **Nodular acne**: Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Amnesteem. It reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation.

- **Absorption**: Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Amnesteem under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with Amnesteem given under fasted conditions (see Table 2). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged. This lack of change in half-life suggests that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Amnesteem capsules should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^113xQbyd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When prescribing topical retinoids, it is prudent to commence with a low concentration and select a tolerable formulation. Beginning therapy with alternate-day dosing for the first two weeks can also help reduce the risk of irritation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Notably, it has been shown that a slower initiation of therapy by starting with a small area of application or application every other day is associated with the same excellent level of efficacy as daily application with adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% (A‐BPO). Data from clinical studies show that most adverse effects, including retinoid irritation, occur during the early phase of treatment. Thus, strategies to minimize irritation — such as application every other day and/or use of a moisturizer prior to therapy — should be employed at the initiation of treatment. In our experience, the use of moisturizers can markedly improve the cutaneous tolerability of topical retinoids; we recommend applying the moisturizer either 10 minutes prior to retinoid therapy or mixing the retinoid and moisturizer together for application.

- **Figure 1**: Retinoid-associated skin tolerability problems are most frequently observed in the first few weeks of therapy and subside with continued use. (Reproduced with permission.)

Kwon et al. hypothesized that adherence to treatment could be improved by providing a dermatological tutorial instructing patients on application techniques, such as using a limited amount of product and applying moisturizer 10 minutes before acne therapy.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^112ctH2N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy**: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion resulted in statistically significant reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts compared to the vehicle from Week 8 through Week 12. Notably, there was no additional improvement seen with the vehicle beyond the reduction in non-inflammatory lesion counts reported at Week 8. The mean percentage change (LS mean) from baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts was 49.5% and 44.0%, compared with 31.4% and 18.8% with the vehicle (both P = 0.001).

- **Treatment success**: By Week 12, 23.7% of subjects were treatment successes (at least a 2‐grade improvement in global severity by EGSS and "clear" or "almost clear") following treatment with tretinoin 0.05% lotion compared to only 7.2% on the vehicle (P = 0.009).

- **Patient satisfaction and quality of life**: Subject satisfaction with treatment was significantly greater with tretinoin 0.05% lotion than with the vehicle by Week 12 (P = 0.008). Although there were no statistically significant differences in improvement between treatment groups based on the mean Acne-QoL assessments in each of the four evaluated domains, the increases in…

### Tretinoin [^116e91JN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The recommended dose is 45 mg/m²/day, administered as two evenly divided doses, until complete remission is documented. Therapy should be discontinued 30 days after the achievement of complete remission or after 90 days of treatment, whichever occurs first.

If, after the initiation of treatment with tretinoin capsules, the presence of the t(15;17) translocation is not confirmed by cytogenetics and/or polymerase chain reaction studies, and the patient has not responded to tretinoin capsules, alternative therapy appropriate for acute myelogenous leukemia should be considered.

Tretinoin capsules are for the induction of remission only. Optimal consolidation or maintenance regimens have not been determined. All patients should, therefore, receive a standard consolidation and/or maintenance chemotherapy regimen for APL after induction therapy with tretinoin capsules, unless otherwise contraindicated.

### Acne and craniofacial defects [^1173XPSS]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the best treatment for acne in a patient with this condition?

	- A. Topical retinoid
	- B. Oral antibiotic
	- C. Isotretinoin
	- D. Topical antibiotic
	- E. Benzoyl peroxide

- **Answers**:

	- A. Topical retinoid – Incorrect. Oral isotretinoin, not topical, is found to be most effective at resolving acneiform lesions associated with Apert syndrome.

	- B. Oral antibiotic – Incorrect. Although tetracyclines inhibit the FGFR2b downstream expression and activity of metalloproteinases, this inhibition has not been sufficient in treating this gain-of-function FGF2 mutation.

	- C. Isotretinoin – Correct. The onset of acne in Apert syndrome, and often oily skin, occurs in early puberty. When androgen levels increase, they promote FGF synthesis, activate the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation, and cause the severe acneiform lesions in these patients. FGF2b signaling is known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne. Although most drugs target single regions of the FGF2b signaling cascade, oral retinoids disrupt multiple regulatory steps and signals in the FGFR2 pathway and therefore provide the most effective treatment for patients with the gain-of-function FGF2 mutation. However, depending on the acne severity, isotretinoin may not be required in all patients. A risk-benefit assessment should be made on an individual case basis because of the numerous known potential side effects of isotretinoin. Of concern, the disruption of FGFR2 signaling during embryonic development yields a teratogenicity risk in postpubertal females.

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: A clinical review and implications for practice [^114yDHp5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Studies of combination therapies include a vehicle-controlled study of clindamycin 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% for acne and hyperpigmentation (N = 33) and two open-label studies of hydroquinone 4%/retinol 0.15% for hyperpigmentation/melasma (N = 21 and N = 28). These studies showed improvements in overall hyperpigmentation severity, color/intensity of hyperpigmented lesions, lesion counts, lesion size, lesion area, colorimetric measurements, and patient-reported global severity.

- **Retinoid effects on acne and hyperpigmentation**: Although retinoids offer benefits in terms of effective acne treatment and favorable hyperpigmentation outcomes, they can be irritating, which in itself can contribute to unwanted pigmentary changes. To address issues of irritation and tolerability, novel lotion formulations were developed for tretinoin and tazarotene. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was developed using a polymeric emulsion technology resulting in a honeycomb matrix that provides uniform distribution of the active ingredient (which was micronized for more homogeneous dispersion and to promote diffusion into skin follicular openings), along with a homogeneous dispersion of the moisturizing/hydrating ingredients. While similar to the tretinoin 0.05% lotion, tazarotene 0.045% lotion was developed using parent emulsion technology in which the active and moisturizing/hydrating ingredients are encapsulated in oil droplets and uniformly suspended within a three-dimensional mesh matrix, which instantly breaks apart upon contact with the skin.

### A randomized, double-blind, split-face study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of three retinol-based products vs. three tretinoin-based products in subjects with moderate to severe facial photodamage [^11477BzN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). High credibility.

Retinol has been shown to improve the appearance of photodamaged skin when applied topically and is generally considered to be approximately ten times less potent than tretinoin. To assess this theory, three cosmetic formulations containing 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% retinol were developed to correspond to the three commonly prescribed concentrations of tretinoin (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%).

A randomized, double-blind, split-face comparison study was conducted to compare the three concentrations of retinol (Ret) including 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, against the respective three strengths of tretinoin (Tret) 0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1% in subjects with moderate to severe facial photodamage. Subjects were randomized into three groups:

- **Group 1**: Ret 0.25% vs. Tret 0.025%
- **Group 2**: Ret 0.5% vs. Tret 0.05%
- **Group 3**: Ret 1.0% vs. Tret 0.1%

Within each group, subjects were randomized to apply Ret on one half of the face (left or right) and Tret on the other facial side, for a duration of twelve weeks. Clinical evaluations for efficacy and tolerability, as well as standardized digital photographs, were conducted at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Sixty-five subjects completed the twelve-week study (Group 1: n = 24, Group 2: n = 20, and Group 3: n = 21).

At week 12, in all treatment groups, both Ret and Tret produced statistically significant improvements from baseline in all efficacy parameters, including overall photodamage, fine lines/wrinkles, coarse lines/wrinkles, skin tone brightness, mottled pigmentation, and tactile roughness (all P < 0.001).

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: A clinical review and implications for practice [^111ehDwy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

The lotion formulations of tazarotene and tretinoin have been approved for facial acne, with pooled post-hoc analyses from phase III trials showing statistically significant reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts relative to vehicle after 12 weeks of treatment in participants with moderate-to-severe acne. Although these retinoid lotions have not been specifically evaluated for hyperpigmentation, post-hoc analyses of safety results indicate improvements in hyperpigmentation among participants with skin of color.

In a post-hoc safety analysis of tretinoin 0.05% lotion that included 308 Black participants from the phase III studies, mean hyperpigmentation scores decreased from baseline to week 12 (from 0.8 to 0.6), as did the percentage of participants with moderate or severe hyperpigmentation (from 26.4% to 17.3%). In a subgroup analysis that included 69 Asian participants, hyperpigmentation was generally mild at baseline and remained mild throughout treatment (i.e. mean scores < 1 at all visits). Among 766 Hispanic participants, hyperpigmentation severity was progressively reduced with tretinoin 0.05% lotion. At baseline, 39% of participants had some degree of hyperpigmentation; at week 12, 73% of participants had no hyperpigmentation.

In a post-hoc analysis that included 262 Black and 352 Hispanic participants, treatment with tazarotene 0.045% lotion decreased the percentage with any hyperpigmentation (1 = mild to 3 = severe) from baseline to week 12 as follows: Black participants, from 40.5% to 31.3%; Hispanic participants, from 17.8% to 11.2%.

### Cumulative irritation potential of topical retinoid formulations [^114j8wKj]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Localized irritation can limit treatment success with topical retinoids such as tretinoin and adapalene. The factors that influence irritant reactions include individual skin sensitivity, the specific retinoid and concentration used, and the vehicle formulation.

- **Objective**: To compare the cutaneous tolerability of tretinoin 0.04% microsphere gel (TMG) with adapalene 0.3% gel and a standard tretinoin 0.025% cream.

- **Methods**: The results of two randomized, investigator-blinded studies, each lasting 2 to 3 weeks and utilizing a split-face method, were combined to compare cumulative irritation scores induced by topical retinoids in subjects with healthy skin. Study 1 compared TMG 0.04% with adapalene 0.3% gel over 2 weeks, while study 2 compared TMG 0.04% with tretinoin 0.025% cream over 3 weeks.

- **Results**: In study 1, TMG 0.04% was associated with significantly lower cumulative scores for erythema, dryness, and burning/stinging than adapalene 0.3% gel. However, in study 2, there were no significant differences in cumulative irritation scores between TMG 0.04% and tretinoin 0.025% cream. Measurements of erythema by a chromameter showed no significant differences between the test formulations in either study.

- **Conclusion**: Cutaneous tolerance of TMG 0.04% on the face was superior to that of adapalene 0.3% gel and similar to that of a standard tretinoin cream containing a lower concentration of the drug (0.025%).

### Altreno [^113QhdoW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Tretinoin is a metabolite of vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus. Tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation. It has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both.

Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin in acne treatment is unknown, evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells, causing extrusion of the comedones.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- The pharmacodynamics of Altreno in the treatment of acne vulgaris are unknown.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- Plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites (isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin) were evaluated in 20 subjects in an open-label, randomized, pharmacokinetic study. Subjects aged 10 years to less than 17 years old with acne vulgaris applied approximately 3.5 g of Altreno to the skin of the entire face (excluding eyes and lips), neck, upper chest, upper back, and shoulders once daily for 14 days. Single-dose pharmacokinetic characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Days 1 and 2 of dosing and steady-state concentrations were assessed.

### Tolerability of high-dose topical tretinoin: The Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial [^111atNNK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical tretinoin is a medication commonly used for acne with potential application in the long-term treatment of photodamaged skin. However, there are few published data regarding the tolerability of high-dose tretinoin with long-term use.

- **Objectives**: To assess the long-term tolerability of tretinoin 0.1% cream.

- **Methods**: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial for the chemoprevention of keratinocyte carcinomas (i.e. basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas) using topical tretinoin cream on the face and ears was conducted. All participants were veterans with a history of two or more keratinocyte carcinomas over the previous 5 years. Participants were examined by a study dermatologist and interviewed every 6 months for up to 5.5 years until May 2004. Treatment comprised tretinoin 0.1% cream or vehicle control cream once daily, then twice daily as tolerated. Participants were instructed to reduce application frequency to once daily or less if twice daily was not tolerated. The main outcome measures were reported side effects, frequency of cream application, and attendance at study visits. Appropriate data were available for four of the six clinical sites of this trial.

- **Results**: Data from 736 randomized participants (mean age 71 years; 97% men) from four clinical sites were analyzed. The tretinoin group more commonly reported one or more side effects at the 6-month follow-up than the control group (61% vs. 42%, P < 0.0001). Side effects decreased over time in both groups but to a greater extent in the tretinoin group.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris: Assessment of efficacy and safety in patients aged 9 years and older [^116G1XC3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Topical tretinoin has been extensively studied in clinical trials, and its essential role in the treatment of acne vulgaris (acne) is established through evidence-based guidelines.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion in moderate-to-severe acne in patients aged 9 years and older.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,640 patients, aged 9–58 years, were randomized to receive either tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle in two double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week, 2-arm, parallel-group studies evaluating safety and efficacy. These assessments included inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and acne severity using Evaluator Global Severity Scores (EGSS). In addition, patients completed a patient satisfaction survey, an acne-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire, and assessed their facial skin for improvements in shininess/oiliness. The data from these two independent studies were pooled and analyzed.

- **Results**: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority over the vehicle in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts (both P less than .001) at week 12 and in improving acne severity (P less than .001). At week 12, the mean percent change in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions was 52% and 46%, respectively. Treatment success, defined as a 2-grade improvement in EGSS and reporting as 'clear' or 'almost clear', was achieved in 18% of patients. Additionally, tretinoin 0.05% lotion showed significantly greater benefits relative to vehicle control in terms of patient satisfaction (P less than .001) and acne-specific QoL domains.

### Single-center, prospective, double-blind, evaluator-blind, non-randomized, vehicle-controlled trial with a 1927 nm non-ablative fractionated laser and topical 0.05% tretinoin lotion for facial dyspigmentation and photodamage [^113gPWFN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Dyspigmentation and photodamage are common concerns in patients seeking aesthetic consultation. Numerous treatment modalities have been utilized to address these issues. The 1927 nm thulium fiber laser is a fractionated non-ablative laser that has proven to be safe and effective for treating photoaging. Topical retinoids have been used for over two decades to promote epidermal hyperplasia, collagen synthesis, and decreased melanin production in photoaged skin. However, there is a lack of data supporting the combination of topical retinoids with laser treatments for managing facial dyspigmentation and photodamage.

- **Objective**: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits and subject satisfaction resulting from the use of a 1927 nm thulium fiber laser, with and without 0.05% tretinoin lotion, for facial dyspigmentation and photodamage.

- **Results**: Both groups showed a significant change in investigator-assessed overall hyperpigmentation and investigator-assessed overall photodamage over time (P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups at any point, as measured by investigator-reported and subject-reported efficacy scales. However, for the Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale and subject satisfaction at 30 days post-laser treatment, patients receiving 0.05% tretinoin lotion reported lower improvement levels (2.8 ± 0.86 in the treatment group vs. 2 ± 0.85 in the vehicle group, P = 0.009) and lower patient satisfaction compared to the vehicle group (2.87 ± 1.55 in the treatment group).

### Tretinoin [^112ZdCwy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tretinoin capsules have been investigated in 114 previously treated APL patients and in 67 previously untreated ("de novo") patients in one open-label, uncontrolled single investigator clinical study at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), and in two cohorts of compassionate cases treated by multiple investigators under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). All patients received 45 mg/m²/day as a divided oral dose for up to 90 days or 30 days beyond the day that complete remission (CR) was reached.

The median time to CR was between 40 and 50 days (range: 2 to 120 days). Most patients in these studies received cytotoxic chemotherapy during the remission phase. These results compare to the 30% to 50% CR rate and less than or equal to 6 months median survival reported for cytotoxic chemotherapy of APL in the treatment of relapse.

- **Pediatric cases**: Ten of 15 pediatric cases achieved CR (8 of 10 males and 2 of 5 females). There were insufficient patients of Black, Hispanic, or Asian derivation to estimate relative response rates in these groups, but responses were seen in each category.

- **Cytogenetic analysis**: Responses were seen in 3 of 4 patients for whom cytogenetic analysis failed to detect the t(15;17) translocation typically seen in APL. The t(15;17) translocation results in the PML/RARα gene, which appears necessary for this disease. Molecular genetic studies were not conducted in these cases, but it is likely they represent cases with a masked translocation giving rise to PML/RARα. Responses to tretinoin have not been observed in cases in which PML/RARα fusion has been.

### Claravis [^115grjt9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Isotretinoin is a retinoid which, when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown.

- **Nodular acne**: Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Claravis. It reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation.

- **Absorption**: Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Claravis under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with Claravis given under fasted conditions. The observed elimination half-life was unchanged, suggesting that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Claravis capsules should always be taken with food. Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in an Asian population [^1124evgH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Acne is a common problem among Asian adolescents and adults. Generally, Asian skin is more pigmented, with a higher risk of acne sequelae. Potential for skin irritation and dryness, as well as pigmentary changes, are key concerns that can significantly impact quality of life (QoL). The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymeric emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate-to-severe acne in an Asian population.

- **Methods**: This is a post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Asian subjects (aged 12 to 48 years, N = 69 with 61% female) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the validated Acne QoL scale. Safety, adverse events (AEs), cutaneous tolerability, and hyper- or hypo-pigmentation (using 4-point scales where 0 = none and 3 = severe) were evaluated.

- **Results**: At week 12, the mean percent reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts were 58.6% and 51.4% respectively compared with 41.5% and 23.9% with vehicle (P = 0.012 for non-inflammatory lesions).

### Low-dose isotretinoin in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^116uE8AX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The efficacy of isotretinoin at 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day in the treatment of acne is well established and considered safe, although it is sometimes not easily tolerated because of its cutaneous side effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of low-dose isotretinoin in the treatment of acne.

In this prospective, noncomparative, open-label study, 638 patients, both male and female, with moderate acne were enrolled and treated with isotretinoin at 20 mg/d (approximately 0.3–0.4 mg/kg per day) for 6 months. The patients were divided into two age groups: 12 to 20 and 21 to 35 years old. Patients were evaluated at 2-month intervals by means of clinical and laboratory examinations. A 4-year follow-up was also carried out.

At the end of the treatment phase, good results were observed in 94.8% of the patients aged 12 to 20 years, and in 92.6% of the patients aged 21 to 35 years. Failure of the treatment occurred in 5.2% and 7.4% of the two groups, respectively. Twenty-one patients dropped out of the study because of lack of compliance, and another patient discontinued participation because of a laboratory side effect. During the 4-year follow-up period, relapses of the acne occurred in 3.9% of the patients aged 12 to 20 years and in 5.9% of the patients aged 21 to 35 years. Elevated serum lipid levels (up to 20% higher than the upper limit of normal value) were found in 4.2% of the patients and abnormal (less than twice the upper limit of normal values) liver tests were observed in 4.8%.

### Tolerability comparison of adapalene gel, 0.3% versus tazarotene cream, 0.05% in subjects with healthy skin [^113jnT9U]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids, including adapalene and tazarotene, are a primary treatment choice for patients with acne. Adapalene is currently marketed in a 0.1% concentration in gel and cream formulations. A new gel containing a higher concentration (0.3%) of adapalene has been developed. In clinical studies, adapalene 0.1% concentration has proven to be better tolerated than other retinoids in skin treatment. However, the tolerability of adapalene gel 0.3% has yet to be compared to other topical retinoids.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this study was to compare the local cutaneous tolerability of adapalene gel 0.3% once daily versus tazarotene cream 0.05% once daily.

- **Methods**: Subjects reported to the investigative site each day, Monday through Friday, cleansed their face, and then applied adapalene 0.3% gel to one side of the face and tazarotene 0.05% cream to the other, in the presence of study personnel. For the weekends, subjects were instructed to apply the treatment at home according to the same procedure. Tolerability was assessed during each weekday visit. The study lasted for three weeks.

- **Results**: Tolerability results for adapalene 0.3% gel and tazarotene 0.05% cream were statistically similar throughout the study. Investigator-assessed overall tolerability favored adapalene at days 19 and 22 (P = .043). A cosmetic acceptability survey also showed results were better for adapalene 0.3% gel.

- **Conclusion**: Adapalene gel 0.3% is very well-tolerated with good cosmetic acceptability.

### Tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate and severe acne vulgaris in females: Effect of age on efficacy and tolerability [^112u2JKU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

While acne is generally considered a disease of adolescence, it affects an increasing number of adults, particularly women. Although there is data on the use of retinoids in adult females, there is no universal agreement on the age of onset for adult female acne or on age-dependent efficacy and tolerability data. A novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion formulation has shown effectiveness and has been well-tolerated in patients with moderate or severe acne.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in women with moderate or severe acne categorized into different age groups (13–19, 20–29, and 30+ years).

- **Methods**: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Women (aged 13–19 years, N = 357; 20–29 years, N = 352; 30+ years, N = 156) with moderate or severe acne were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/non-inflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] to 'clear'/'almost clear') and Quality of Life (QoL) using the validated Acne-QoL questionnaire. Safety and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout; cutaneous tolerability was assessed at each study visit using a 4-point scale (where 0 = none and 3 = severe).

- **Results**: At baseline, 91.9% (N = 794) of women in the post hoc analysis had moderate (EGSS = 3) and 8.1% (N = 70) severe (EGSS = 4) acne, with the highest proportion of women (11.1%, N = 39)…

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^116L9XZS]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Tretinoin 0.05% lotion is a novel topical treatment for moderate-to-severe acne leveraging polymerized emulsion technology. The development rationale was to provide a tretinoin formulation with improved efficacy and tolerability that could be especially suited to a preadolescent population. The polymerized emulsion provides a mesh (a polymeric network), which helps structure the emulsion, providing uniform distribution of active and hydrating ingredients at the surface of the skin, reducing the presence of concentrated drug in specific areas (hot spots). It also forms a barrier that helps keep the skin hydrated by reducing epidermal water loss and increasing skin water content.

Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was shown to provide significantly greater efficacy than the vehicle in two pivotal phase 3 studies. Data reported herein were consistent with these overall findings. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion offered significantly more efficacy than the vehicle in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion reduction and treatment success, with greater patient satisfaction and preference compared with previous acne therapy. Efficacy in comedonal acne (44% mean reduction) was similar to that reported previously with tretinoin microsphere 0.04% gel, although our analysis included preadolescent subjects with severe disease. To our knowledge, we are the first to report efficacy in inflammatory lesions (50% mean reduction). Results in this pediatric population were similar to those seen in the overall study populations. The only difference of note is that the vehicle tended to be less effective in this specific demographic.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a Hispanic population [^1175JqPh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common dermatologic disease seen in a racially, geographically, politically, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse Hispanic population. Despite their growing demographics in the US, there are few studies evaluating acne treatment in this population. Potential for skin irritation and dryness, as well as pigmentary changes, are key concerns. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymerized emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate-to-severe acne in a Hispanic population.

- **Methods**: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne. Hispanic subjects (aged 11 to 50 years, N = 766) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout using a 4-point scale where 0 = none and 3 = severe.

- **Results**: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were 60.1% and 53.0%, respectively, compared with 51.1% and 38.7% with vehicle (P ≤ 0.001) in the Hispanic population.

To indirectly capture the severity of acne symptoms, we defined three different patient populations as control cohorts for the isotretinoin treatment cohort:

- **Oral antibiotics cohort**: 44,748 patients were included in this cohort, having received prescriptions for erythromycins/macrolides or tetracyclines but not isotretinoin.
- **Topical anti-acne cohort**: 108,367 patients were included, having received topical anti-acne treatments but not isotretinoin or selected oral antibiotics such as erythromycins or tetracyclines.
- **Acne control cohort**: 78,666 patients were included without dispensed prescriptions for isotretinoin, any topical anti-acne agents, or the selected oral antibiotics.

For isotretinoin, oral antibiotics, and topical anti-acne agents, we used the first dispensed prescription in the data as the index prescription. For the third control cohort, we used the first healthcare visit due to acne as the index event.

### Zenatane [^116Rv2Pt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which, when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day, inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown.

- **Nodular acne**: Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary, related to the dose and duration of treatment with Zenatane, and reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation.

- **Absorption**: Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Zenatane under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with Zenatane given under fasted conditions. The observed elimination half-life was unchanged, suggesting that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Zenatane should always be taken with food.

Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne.

### The effects of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion on quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris [^112rycrZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

In two phase III clinical trials of patients with moderate-to-severe acne (NCT02932306, NCT02965456), tretinoin 0.05% lotion reduced inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions relative to vehicle lotion, with low potential for cutaneous irritation.

- **Objective**: Data from these studies were analyzed post hoc to investigate the effects of tretinoin 0.05% lotion on patient-reported quality of life, as assessed using the Acne-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne-QoL).

- **Methods**: Mean changes from baseline to week 12 in Acne-QoL scores were analyzed in the pooled intent-to-treat population and a subgroup with treatment success (≥ 2-grade improvement on the Evaluator's Global Severity Scale and rating of "clear" or "almost clear"). Pearson correlations were conducted in the pooled intent-to-treat population to assess the relationship between the Acne-QoL acne symptoms domain and each of the other three domains.

- **Results**: In the pooled intent-to-treat population (n = 1640), greater mean improvements were found with tretinoin 0.05% lotion vs. vehicle in all four domains: self-perception (mean change: 7.4 vs. 6.7); role-emotional (6.8 vs. 6.0); role-social (4.8 vs. 4.6); acne symptoms (6.5 vs. 5.6); all p < 0.05. Relative to the intent-to-treat population, participants who experienced treatment success with tretinoin 0.05% lotion had higher (better) mean Acne-QoL scores at week 12. Correlations between acne symptoms and the other three domains were found at baseline and week 12 (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Participants with moderate-to-severe acne reported better quality of life.

### Efficacy and safety of clindamycin-tretinoin gel versus clindamycin or tretinoin alone in acne vulgaris: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study [^112SjbvY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Topical combination therapy containing a retinoid and an antimicrobial is an effective treatment for acne vulgaris.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new topical formulation containing clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% solubilized in an aqueous-based gel (CT gel).

- **Methods**: 1,649 participants were randomized 2:2:2:1 to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with CT gel, clindamycin, tretinoin, or vehicle gel administered once daily.

- **Results**: Significantly more participants achieved a 2-grade or greater improvement on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment score with CT gel versus clindamycin, tretinoin, or vehicle gel. CT gel produced a significantly greater reduction in the absolute number of total lesions versus all other treatment groups, in total and noninflammatory lesions versus clindamycin, and in total and inflammatory lesions versus tretinoin. Local tolerability was similar to that of tretinoin alone; signs and symptoms of irritation were most notable at week 2. There were no more adverse events with CT gel than with tretinoin gel.

- **Conclusion**: CT gel is more effective than clindamycin or tretinoin monotherapy, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of tretinoin.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^113xxpWe]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all subjects randomized and provided with study drug and vehicle. The safety population included all randomized subjects who were presumed to have used the study medication or vehicle at least once and who provided at least one postbaseline evaluation. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data in the ITT analysis set was based on estimation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation methods. No imputations were made for missing safety data.

- **Treatment comparisons**: Treatment comparisons of percent reductions in lesion counts utilized a ranked analysis of covariance with a factor of treatment and the respective baseline lesion count as covariate. Significance of EGSS reductions was obtained from logistic regression (using Firth's Penalized Likelihood) with factors of the treatment group. There was no imputation of missing data for quality of life analyses. Mean Acne-QoL scores at Week 12 were compared using an analysis of covariance with factors of treatment and the respective baseline lesion count as covariate. Shininess/oiliness and PSS scores were compared between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS® version 9.3 or later. Statistical significance was based on 2-tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in P values of 0.05 or less.

- **Adverse events**: All adverse events (AEs) occurring during the studies were recorded and classified based on the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology for the safety population.

### Laboratory monitoring during isotretinoin therapy for acne: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pvwVX]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral isotretinoin has been associated with several adverse effects, but evidence-based estimates of laboratory changes during isotretinoin therapy in large patient samples are limited. The objective of this study was to develop estimates of the laboratory changes that occur during isotretinoin therapy for acne using extant data and meta-analytic methods.

A comprehensive search strategy using Ovid/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray literature was conducted from 1960 to August 1, 2013, to identify all relevant studies of isotretinoin use in acne vulgaris. Terms related to acne treatment, isotretinoin, and diagnostic procedures were searched with all available synonyms.

Inclusion criteria consisted of clinical trials using oral isotretinoin, doses of 40 mg/d or more, duration of at least 4 weeks, patients aged 9 to 35 years with acne vulgaris, and 10 or more participants. Studies from all countries published in any language were included. Exclusion criteria were the use of modified isotretinoin products, isotretinoin therapy for conditions other than acne vulgaris, and concomitant acne therapy. The initial search yielded 342 records; 116 of these were screened for full-text examination.

Two authors independently reviewed the publications to determine eligibility, and disagreements were resolved by a third author. Weighted means and 99% confidence intervals were calculated using the reported means (standard deviations or standard errors). A random effects model was created, and statistical heterogeneity was quantified. Data were analyzed from August 25, 2014, to December 4, 2014.

### High-dose isotretinoin treatment and the rate of retrial, relapse, and adverse effects in patients with acne vulgaris [^113EkMYU]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin is the most effective treatment for acne; however, the ideal dosing regimen remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the rates of relapse of acne vulgaris and retrial of isotretinoin after high cumulative-dose treatment, along with changes to the adverse effect profile.

A prospective, observational, intervention study was conducted from August 1, 2008, to August 31, 2010, at a single academic tertiary care center with multiple providers. A total of 180 patients with acne resistant to other treatments were enrolled, with 116 participating in the 12-month follow-up survey, resulting in a response rate of 64.4%.

Patients were treated with isotretinoin, with dosing determined by the providers' judgment. They were divided into two groups based on cumulative dosing: < 220 mg/kg and ≥ 220 mg/kg. The main outcomes measured were relapse — defined as the need for prescription topical or oral acne medication following a course of isotretinoin — or retrial, which refers to retreatment with isotretinoin, at the 12-month follow-up. Adverse effects experienced during and after the 12 months of treatment were also assessed.

The mean age of participants was 19.3 years, with 51.9% female and 74.1% white. At 12 months of follow-up, 97.4% reported an improvement in their acne. Acne relapsed in 32.7% of the patients, while 1.72% required a retrial. In the lower-dose treatment group (< 220 mg/kg), the relapse rate was 47.4% (95% CI, 32.3%-63.0%), compared to 26.9% (95% CI, 18.3%-37.8%) in the high-dose group (P = .03).

### Evaluation of the efficacy and relapse rates of treatment protocols for moderate acne using isotretinoin based on the global acne grading system: Randomized, controlled, comparative study [^112FQTti]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Protocols for treating acne with isotretinoin have varied widely because some factors associated with relapse and treatment duration have not yet been fully determined. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of conventional, low, and intermittent isotretinoin dosage protocols in the treatment of moderate acne and investigates the relationships between GAGS score, treatment duration, and relapse rate. The 107 patients with moderate acne were randomly divided into three groups who received isotretinoin for 24 weeks (Group A: 0.5–1 mg/kg/day; Group B: 0.25–0.4 mg/kg/day; Group C: 0.5–0.7 mg/kg/day for 1 week out of every 4 weeks).

The results show that both conventional and continuous low doses achieved full clinical effectiveness with minimum relapse rates. However, fewer side effects and better patient satisfaction were reported with the low dose. Significant differences in GAGS scores after 24 weeks were found between groups B and C (p = 0.037) and between groups A and C (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were found between groups A and B (p = 0.153). It was observed that the relapse rate increased with the initial GAGS score. The average relapse rate was 58.0% for those with initial GAGS scores of 25–30 compared with 5.5% for those with scores of 19–24. Among the patients who relapsed, the highest percentage (56.3%) were in the age group < 20 years. However, GAGS (β = 0.646, t = 8.323, p < 0.001) was found to be a better predictor of relapse than age (β = 0.083, t = 1.073, p = 0.286). These results suggest that the initial GAGS score is an important factor in determining relapse rates.

### Tretinoin microsphere gel pump 0.04% versus tazarotene cream 0.05% in the treatment of mild-to-moderate facial acne vulgaris [^116G37aa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

This 12-week, single-center, investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel-design study assessed the safety and efficacy of tretinoin microsphere gel 0.04% delivered by pump (TMG PUMP) compared to tazarotene cream 0.05% (TAZ) in the treatment of mild-to-moderate facial acne vulgaris. Efficacy measurements included investigator global assessment (IGA), lesion counts, and subject self-assessment of acne signs and symptoms. Efficacy was generally comparable between treatment groups, although TMG PUMP provided more rapid results in several parameters.

IGA showed a more rapid mean change from baseline at week 4 in the TMG PUMP group (-0.18) compared to -0.05 in the TAZ subjects. TMG PUMP yielded more rapid improvement in papules. At week 4, the mean percentage change from baseline in open comedones was statistically significant at -64% in the TMG PUMP group (P = 0.0039, within group) versus -19% in the TAZ group (not statistically significant within the group; P = 0.1875). Skin dryness, peeling, and pruritus were significantly less in the TMG PUMP group as early as week 4. Adverse events related to the study treatment were rare in both groups and all resolved upon discontinuation of study medication.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^114tufmC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Goh et al. evaluated the tolerability of adapalene gel 0.1% versus tretinoin gel 0.025% in four racial groups (Chinese, Asian Indian, Malay, and Caucasian) in a randomized split-face study. Subjects (n = 73) applied each agent on one half of the face and on one of two test areas on the forearms. Tolerability was assessed by a tolerability score, which was the sum of erythema, desquamation, and dryness scores, and TEWL. Adapalene was better tolerated than tretinoin in all racial groups, a difference apparent by study day 3 and sustained throughout the 21-day study period. There was a small but significant difference in tolerability associated with the various racial groups, with Chinese patients demonstrating more irritation than the other groups. However, this was much smaller than the difference between adapalene and tretinoin overall.

- **Tolerability analysis**: Local tolerability criteria are summarized in an area under the curve analysis of a total sum score of facial irritation, including erythema, desquamation, and dryness from baseline to last measurement. A higher value correlates with lower overall tolerability.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^117C7QpR]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy evaluation**: Efficacy evaluations comprised inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and an EGSS assessment at screening, baseline, and subsequent study visits (Weeks 4, 8, and 12). Efficacy endpoints included the mean percent change from baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and the proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline EGSS to "clear" or "almost clear" at that same visit.

	- Additional assessments included a patient satisfaction score (PSS) and a validated acne-specific quality of life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire. At baseline, subjects were asked to rate their satisfaction with prior acne therapy with a PSS of 1–10, where 10 was the most satisfied and a score of 5 or greater was considered as "satisfied". At Week 12, they were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with study treatment. Subjects assessed facial shine/oiliness at baseline and Week 12 using a 4-point scale, and those recording a score of 1–3 were asked to rate the degree of bothersomeness using a 5-point scale.

- **Safety evaluation**: Cutaneous safety (erythema and scaling) and tolerability (itching, burning, and stinging) were evaluated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout; severity and relationship with study medication were assessed.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^1114y8Sv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids are routinely used to treat acne; safety and efficacy are well documented in large pivotal trials. With limited FDA-approved treatment options for preadolescent acne, off-label prescribing is common. Monotherapy with adapalene gel, tretinoin gel, and tretinoin microsphere gel has been investigated in small open-label and blinded studies in children under 12 years of age. However, data in preadolescent acne are lacking.

In a 12-week open-label study of 40 children (8–12 years) with mild-to-moderate acne, tretinoin microsphere 0.04% gel produced a significant decrease in EGSS from baseline to Week 12 (from 2.6 to 2.1, P < 0.0001). Eight patients (22.2%) were "clear" or "almost clear". Skin irritation occurred in 35% of patients, being generally mild and transient.

In a subsequent double-blind study with tretinoin microsphere 0.04% gel in 110 children (9–11 years) with moderate acne, there was a significantly greater improvement in noninflammatory lesions (44.0% reduction) compared to vehicle (30.8%, P = 0.04) at Week 12.

In a post hoc analysis of two studies comparing tretinoin microsphere 0.1% gel and tretinoin 0.05% gel in young adolescents (10–14 years) with mild-to-moderate acne, comparable lesion reduction and treatment success were noted. Tretinoin 0.05% gel demonstrated better cutaneous tolerability. Fourteen percent of participants reported dry skin, 8% skin burning sensation, 5% erythema, and 5% dermatitis exfoliative compared with 32%, 11%, 23%, and 23%, respectively, with tretinoin gel microsphere 0.1% (all P < 0.001).

### New and emerging treatments in dermatology: Acne [^1138vkyX]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and topical and oral antibiotics remain the cornerstone of treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Oral isotretinoin is useful for the treatment of severe nodular acne, treatment-resistant acne, and acne with a risk of physical or psychological scarring. Hormonal treatment in female acne is useful in resistant or late-onset acne. With increasing concerns regarding the teratogenicity of isotretinoin and increasing antibiotic resistance, there is a clear need for therapeutic alternatives to these long-used treatments.

Research into the pathogenesis of acne has allowed for new therapies and future perspectives regarding acne to evolve. These include low-dose long-term isotretinoin regimens, insulin-sensitizing agents, 5alpha-reductase type 1 inhibitors, topical photodynamic therapy, new combination formulations, dietary interventions, and anti-inflammatory agents such as lipoxygenase inhibitors.

### A comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of retinoid-containing combination regimens for the treatment of acne vulgaris [^11589BCn]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Many physicians regularly prescribe combination therapy involving a retinoid for their acne patients. The most common retinoid-containing regimens include either oral antibiotics or topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotic products. A fair number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these combination therapies, but there is a lack of comparative studies examining different regimens head-to-head. Also, many of the noncomparative studies have very similar trial designs. A review of these studies was conducted in order to organize the available data side by side from the different regimens. Although not derived from comparative studies, this presentation of data is expected to provide dermatologists with valuable information from which they can easily make their own comparisons among similarly designed trials.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^115hMteu]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Preadolescent acne (≤ 13 years) is common and may be one of the first signs of pubertal maturation. The trend toward earlier onset of adrenarche and menarche mirrors the increasingly younger age of acne onset. Comedones tend to predominate, but inflammatory lesions can also be present. Preadolescent acne severity may also predict future disease severity, especially if left untreated until the patient is older. Treatment of preadolescent acne is therefore important not only to ameliorate the development of more severe acne but also to reduce physical and emotional impact and perhaps improve adherence in later life.

Data related to the treatment of preadolescent acne are limited, with most medications approved for age 12 and above; off-label prescribing is common. Topical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin, adapalene) have played an essential role in acne management because they inhibit the development of microcomedones and new acne papules. However, there is a common perception that they are primarily effective in comedonal acne, and their use is associated with significant cutaneous irritation.

A new lotion formulation of tretinoin 0.05% has recently been developed leveraging polymerized emulsion technology with the aim to improve both efficacy and tolerability. Here, a post hoc analysis of two large phase 3 clinical studies (N = 1640) evaluates its safety and efficacy in a preadolescent acne population with moderate-to-severe acne.

### Accutane [^114DRZBk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology

Isotretinoin is a retinoid that, when administered in pharmacologic dosages of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization. The exact mechanism of action of isotretinoin is unknown.

- **Nodular acne**: Clinical improvement in nodular acne patients occurs in association with a reduction in sebum secretion. The decrease in sebum secretion is temporary and is related to the dose and duration of treatment with Accutane. This reflects a reduction in sebaceous gland size and an inhibition of sebaceous gland differentiation.

- **Absorption**: Due to its high lipophilicity, oral absorption of isotretinoin is enhanced when given with a high-fat meal. In a crossover study, 74 healthy adult subjects received a single 80 mg oral dose (2 x 40 mg capsules) of Accutane under fasted and fed conditions. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the total exposure (AUC) of isotretinoin were more than doubled following a standardized high-fat meal when compared with Accutane given under fasted conditions (see Table 2). The observed elimination half-life was unchanged, suggesting that food increases the bioavailability of isotretinoin without altering its disposition. The time to peak concentration (Tmax) was also increased with food and may be related to a longer absorption phase. Therefore, Accutane should always be taken with food (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Clinical studies have shown that there is no difference in the pharmacokinetics of isotretinoin between patients with nodular acne.

- **Results**:

One hundred fifty-four subjects were included in the post hoc analysis. Of those, 139 (90.3%) completed the studies, including 64 preadolescent subjects (86.5%) on tretinoin 0.05% lotion and 75 (93.8%) on vehicle. The most common reasons for study discontinuation were "lost to follow-up" or "subject request".

- **Baseline characteristics**: Demographic data were similar across the treatment groups. The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 12.4 (0.94) years. Subjects were predominantly White (74.7%) and female (59.1%).

There were no noticeable differences between treatment groups with regard to lesion counts or EGSS. At baseline, the mean number (SD) of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions was 26.7 (6.04) and 50.3 (21.90), respectively. Additionally, 94.2% of subjects had moderate acne (EGSS = 3).

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^11773Egv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acne vulgaris, specifically with respect to systemic retinoids, the AAD 2024 guidelines recommend considering the monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and lipids in patients receiving isotretinoin. It is advised not to monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in healthy patients. Additionally, it is crucial to prevent pregnancy in patients of childbearing potential.
