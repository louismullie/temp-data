## Question

A 21-year-old woman is diagnosed with a rare subtype of anti-NMDA encephalitis. During the diagnostic workup, she was found to have an ovarian teratoma. Her physician is curious about the association between anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas. A causal relationship between this subtype of anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas is suspected. The physician aims to identify patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis and subsequently evaluate them for the presence of ovarian teratomas. Which type of study design would be the most appropriate?
A. Case series
B. Case-control study
C. Randomized controlled trial
D. Retrospective cohort study

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which study design is most appropriate to evaluate the association between anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and ovarian teratomas, with the clinical goal of identifying patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis and then screening them for teratomas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the research question and whether it is descriptive, analytic, or interventional. Then, I should verify which designs can estimate exposure–outcome associations and which cannot. Next, I will compare the strengths and limitations of case series, case-control, cohort, and randomized controlled trial designs in this specific context. Finally, I will align the choice with the clinical objective and the existing evidence base to reach a conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the research question and its intent. The physician wants to start with patients who have anti-NMDA encephalitis and then determine how often they harbor ovarian teratomas, which is a descriptive, prevalence-oriented question rather than a causal inference question, and it maps to a cohort framework where anti-NMDA encephalitis is the exposure and teratoma is the outcome to be ascertained [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the design hierarchy and what each option can and cannot do. Case series are descriptive and cannot provide estimates of association or risk, so they are not appropriate if we want to quantify how often teratomas occur in anti-NMDA encephalitis. Case-control studies start with the outcome and look backward for exposures, which is the opposite direction of what we need here. Randomized controlled trials are for testing interventions, not for estimating disease associations. Cohort studies, whether prospective or retrospective, start with an exposure and follow forward to outcomes, which fits the goal of identifying anti-NMDA encephalitis patients and screening them for teratomas [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the practical constraints. Given the rarity of anti-NMDA encephalitis, a prospective cohort would be feasible but slow to accrue, whereas a retrospective cohort leveraging existing medical records and imaging can efficiently answer the question now. Importantly, retrospective cohorts can quantify the proportion with teratomas and characterize tumor detection methods, which directly informs screening protocols in this population [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the chosen design aligns with the clinical objective. The aim is to define the burden of teratomas in anti-NMDA encephalitis to guide screening, not to test an intervention or to infer causality from exposure to outcome; a cohort design starting with anti-NMDA encephalitis and ascertaining teratoma status yields the most direct, actionable estimate for practice [^notfound].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a case-control study because it is efficient for rare diseases? Let me reconsider. Case-control designs are efficient for rare outcomes, but here the starting point is the exposure (anti-NMDA encephalitis), and we want to move forward to the outcome (teratoma), so a cohort approach is methodologically coherent, whereas case-control would invert the direction and complicate interpretation for this specific question [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the evidence base to confirm that a cohort approach is consistent with how this association has been characterized. Large observational cohorts and meta-analyses have quantified tumor prevalence in anti-NMDA encephalitis, particularly ovarian teratomas in women, supporting the feasibility and relevance of a cohort strategy to estimate prevalence and guide screening recommendations [^f8669477] [^34e23d97].

> Final answer: A retrospective cohort study is the most appropriate design to identify patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and evaluate them for ovarian teratomas, because it starts with the exposure of interest and moves forward to ascertain the outcome, yielding a direct estimate of teratoma prevalence that can inform screening protocols in this population [^notfound].

The most appropriate study design to identify patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and evaluate them for ovarian teratomas is a **retrospective cohort study**. This design allows identification of a defined cohort with anti-NMDA encephalitis and systematic review of imaging records to detect ovarian teratomas, yielding an accurate estimate of teratoma prevalence and supporting evidence-based screening recommendations [^notfound]. Case series are too limited for inference, case-control studies are backward-looking and less suitable for prevalence estimation, and RCTs are inappropriate for this non-interventional question.

---

## Rationale for retrospective cohort study

A retrospective cohort study is the **most appropriate design** for the following reasons:

- **Directionality**: The study proceeds from exposure (anti-NMDA encephalitis) to outcome (ovarian teratoma), aligning with the clinical question of how often teratomas occur in this population.

- **Prevalence estimation**: Allows calculation of teratoma prevalence and identification of high-risk subgroups (e.g. age, sex) to guide screening.

- **Feasibility**: Efficiently uses existing medical records and imaging data to answer the question without new patient recruitment.

- **Clinical relevance**: Results directly inform screening protocols and counseling for patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis.

---

## Comparison with alternative study designs

| **Study design** | **Rationale for/against use** |
|-|-|
| Case series | - Descriptive only <br/> - Cannot estimate prevalence or test hypotheses <br/> - Not appropriate for inference [^notfound] |
| Case-control study | - Starts with outcome (teratoma) and looks backward <br/> - Not suitable for estimating prevalence or identifying patients with encephalitis to screen [^notfound] |
| Randomized controlled trial (RCT) | - Used for interventions <br/> - Not applicable to non-interventional prevalence questions |

---

## Evidence supporting the association

The association between anti-NMDA encephalitis and ovarian teratomas is well established, particularly in young women, with teratomas identified in approximately 18–58% of cases depending on age, sex, and cohort composition [^f8669477] [^34e23d97]. This strengthens the rationale for a cohort approach to quantify prevalence and define screening indications.

---

## Practical considerations

- **Data sources**: Electronic health records, antibody testing databases, and imaging archives will be key to identifying cases and confirming teratomas.

- **Imaging modalities**: Pelvic ultrasound, MRI, or CT can be used to detect teratomas; ultrasound is often first-line due to accessibility and cost.

- **Ethical considerations**: Retrospective review of anonymized records typically requires institutional review board approval but poses minimal risk.

---

## Conclusion

A **retrospective cohort study** is the most appropriate design to identify patients with anti-NMDA encephalitis and evaluate them for ovarian teratomas, as it aligns with the clinical question, enables prevalence estimation, and supports evidence-based screening recommendations.

### Clinical features of seronegative, but CSF antibody-positive, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^611be39b]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Early recognition of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can be challenging because the initial symptoms may resemble viral encephalitis or a primary psychiatric disorder. Although the need to test the CSF for NMDAR antibodies has been emphasized in previous reports and several guidelines, NMDAR antibodies are often determined only in the serum. A previous study showed that serum NMDAR antibody testing was negative in 14% of the patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who had NMDAR antibodies in the CSF, but the associated symptoms and potential prognostic implications were not investigated. Here, we first determined the frequency of seronegative anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and we then assessed whether the clinical features and outcomes of these patients were different from those with NMDAR antibodies in the serum and CSF.

A score that predicts 1-year functional status in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis

The objective of this retrospective observational study was to construct a grading score that predicts neurological function 1 year after the diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis.

This study examined a cohort of 382 patients identified as having anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis defined by the clinical picture as well as positive serum or CSF findings. All patient CSF and serum samples were sent either to the University of Pennsylvania or the University of Barcelona from 200 centres in 35 countries. All patients within the cohort had been part of a prior observational study, with previously collected data regarding demographics, symptom onset, clinical, laboratory and radiological features, time to treatment initiation, time from treatment initiation to improvement, and functional status using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). Good functional status at 1 year was defined as a mRS ≤ 2.

The group analysed a range of clinical factors to determine predictors of functional status at 1 year using a multivariate regression model. Five independent variables were identified including: need for ICU admission, delay of treatment initiation beyond 4 weeks of symptom onset, lack of clinical improvement 4 weeks after initiating treatment, presence of an abnormal MRI scan and CSF WBC count > 20 cells/uL. Points were assigned to each of these variables to construct the NEOS score (anti-NMDAr encephalitis 1 year functional status score), with a maximum possible score of 5. A strong association was found between the NEOS score and functional status at 1 year, with a NEOS score of 0 relating to good functional status and higher NEOS scores relating to greater disability (p 0.001).

Comment: The use of the NEOS score may aid with prognostication and identify a subset of patients who could benefit from treatment escalation. However, as the authors point out, 1 year functional status provides a snapshot in time, and ongoing recovery could be expected beyond this time-period. With regards to methodology, the pooling of patients from 35 different countries raises questions as to variations in treatment and the potential impact of this on clinical outcome.

### Possible temporal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: a meta-analysis [^4af28c1e]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

An important confounding factor is that ovarian teratoma was identified as a comorbidity in four of the 12 women. This tumor is a known trigger for development of NMDAR encephalitis. Six other cases were examined and had no ovarian teratomas, while no search for this tumor was mentioned in two publications. As the current reports are not complete regarding screening for ovarian teratomas or potential pre-existence of NMDA receptor autoantibodies, it is not clear if a causal relationship existed between SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and the NMDA receptor encephalitis diagnosis. Also, in the patient with focal right frontal lobe epilepsy, it is not clear if the NMDA receptor antibody formation was triggered by tissue destruction in the context of stroke or epileptic seizures 1 rather than by SARS-CoV-2 infection. As far as vaccination-related causality is concerned, it should be noted that the interval between vaccination and hospitalisation was short (1 to 7 days). This raises the question of whether a transfer of pre-formed serum antibodies into the brain or CSF through BBB opening by pro-inflammatory cytokines during the immune response to vaccines played a role, rather than de novo NMDA receptor antibody formation induced by vaccination. Notably, one of the cases with vaccination also had comorbid ovarian teratoma.

Nationwide studies including all SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests performed in Denmark showed that the risk of new-onset psychiatric and neurological disorders increased after COVID-19, particularly in association with disease severity. However, the risk was comparable to that observed after other infections of similar severity. An unbiased epidemiological analysis of the manifestation of NMDA receptor encephalitis after COVID-19 or vaccination is still lacking but this would be important for clarification regarding a causal link. Unfortunately, there is no specific ICD-10 code used only for autoimmune encephalitis or specifically for NMDA encephalitis, which makes it more difficult to extract such numbers from registers. Thus, there is a need to go into large-scale electronic health records to further shed light on the associations on a large-scale. However, in studies examining patients with severe COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric symptoms, NMDA receptor antibodies did not consistently appear in the CSF, so they are considered rare. Also, CNS infection with SARS-CoV-2 have only been described on a case report level, whereas the CSF screening studies have not found clear evidence of intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 antibody production since levels in the peripheral blood were higher.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^54183cce]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare subacute, rapidly progressive autoimmune encephalitis that can result in severe permanent neurologic deficits or death. Prior case-only, referral center–based studiesdescribe a preponderance of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in female individuals, young adults, a strong association with ovarian teratomas, and rarely, with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. The only multiethnic referral center–based cohort was composed of 32.1% White patients, suggesting racial and ethnic disparities in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, but this was not investigated further.

The crude incidence of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the Netherlands is estimated at 1 per million. No prior studies have examined potential variation by race and ethnicity. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of anti-NMDAR encephalitis in a large multiethnic, population-based cohort and determine whether it varies by race and ethnicity, sex, or age.

### Very long-term functional outcomes and dependency in children with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^4a0343c6]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the daily function of children with anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe) after a minimal follow-up of 5 years.

Methods

Patients 18 years and younger by the time of disease onset, whose serum and CSF were studied in our center between 2013 and 2017, were included in the study. Patients' daily life function was assessed by their physicians using a 15-domain question format (Liverpool Outcome Score).

Results

Of 76 patients, 8 (11%) died and 68 were followed for a mean of 7.1 years (SD 1.5 years, range: 5.0–10.1). Three outcome patterns were identified: full recovery (50; 73%); behavioral and school/working deficits (12; 18%); and multidomain deficits (6; 9%) involving self-care ability, behavioral-cognitive impairment, and seizures. Younger age of disease onset was significantly associated with multidomain deficits (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.02–2.4, p = 0.04), particularly in children younger than 6 years, among whom 8 of 23 (35%) remained sociofamiliar dependent.

Discussion

After a minimal follow-up of 5 years, most children with NMDARe had substantial or full functional recovery, but approximately one-fifth remained with behavioral and school/working deficits. The younger the patient at disease onset, the more probable it was to remain with multidomain deficits and dependent on sociofamiliar support.

### Contemporary advances in anti-NMDAR antibody (Ab)-mediated encephalitis [^e9e320d2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The study of antibody (Ab)-mediated encephalitis has advanced dramatically since the discovery of antibodies directed against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in association with a unique neuro-psychiatric syndrome, over a decade-and-a-half ago. Anti-NMDAR Ab-mediated encephalitis now represents the most well characterised form of autoimmune encephalitis. The disease most commonly manifests in young women, but all ages and both sexes can be affected. Autoantibodies may arise in the context of two well-recognised disease triggers in a proportion of patients, and ultimately facilitate NMDAR displacement from synapses. Various CSF cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules have been explored as candidate biomarkers but are limited in sensitivity and specificity. The clinical spectrum is diverse, with evolution and a combination of neuro-psychiatric abnormalities at disease nadir common. Anti-NMDAR Ab-mediated encephalitis is immunotherapy responsive, and a near-majority ultimately acquire a broadly favourable clinical outcome. The diagnosis, and more particularly, the management of the disease can still hold considerable challenges. Moreover, well-defined biomarkers remain elusive. The present review will therefore delineate pathogenic and clinical advances to date in anti-NMDAR antibody-mediated encephalitis.

### An update on anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis for neurologists and psychiatrists: mechanisms and models [^34e23d97]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The identification of anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis about 12 years ago made it possible to recognise that some patients with rapidly progressive psychiatric symptoms or cognitive impairment, seizures, abnormal movements, or coma of unknown cause, had an autoimmune disease. In this disease, autoantibodies serve as a diagnostic marker and alter NMDAR-related synaptic transmission. At symptom onset, distinguishing the disease from a primary psychiatric disorder is challenging. The severity of symptoms often requires intensive care. Other than clinical assessment, no specific prognostic biomarkers exist. The disease is more prevalent in women (with a female to male ratio of around 8:2) and about 37% of patients are younger than 18 years at presentation of the disease. Tumours, usually ovarian teratoma, and herpes simplex encephalitis are known triggers of NMDAR autoimmunity. About 80% of patients improve with immunotherapy and, if needed, tumour removal, but the recovery is slow. Animal models have started to reveal the complexity of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and will lead to novel treatments beyond immunotherapy. Future studies should aim at identifying prognostic biomarkers and treatments that accelerate recovery.

### Dynamic disorganization of synaptic NMDA receptors triggered by autoantibodies from psychotic patients [^376765f4]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past decade, autoantibodies against neuronal receptors have been increasingly identified in neuropsychiatric disorders –. These disease-related autoantibodies had generated excitement towards molecular and cellular dissection of psychiatric disorders and has fostered debate on how to identify the patients that may benefit from immunotherapy. Several neurological diseases such as autoimmune encephalitis are indeed well-defined and treated after the identification of autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. In the psychiatric field, the link between psychotic disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ), and immune system dysregulations including autoimmunity, is a concept that regained strong support thanks to the better characterization of inflammatory-induced psychotic symptoms and autoimmune encephalitis. The best characterized encephalitis is the anti- N -methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR)-associated condition in which autoantibodies directed against the GluN1 subunit of NMDAR (NMDAR-Ab) are detected and associated with psychotic symptoms and catatonia, followed by profound neurologic deterioration. In contrast, studies exploring the presence of circulating NMDAR-Ab in SCZ patients have produced contradictory outcomes, with detection prevalence ranging from 0 to < 20% –. Several reasons for these discrepancies have been proposed and debated, such as different sensitivities and specificities between detection methods. From a clinical point-of-view, immunotherapy treatment of patients with acute psychosis and NMDAR-Ab was associated with good outcomes, especially for psychotic patients resistant to anti-psychotics. Although large randomized investigations are surely needed to ascertain NMDAR-Ab pathological role in psychosis, the functional interplay between NMDAR-Ab and psychotic symptoms represents a promising area of biomedical research.

### Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. the disorder, the diagnosis and the immunobiology [^bbf0a795]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a newly characterized syndrome with a progressive, predictable clinical course and the possibility of effective treatment. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical to selection and implementation of treatments, and optimal patient outcomes. Outcomes are improved with early diagnosis via indirect immunofluorescence or cell-based assays, and the rapid and appropriate administration of immunosuppressant and anti-psychotic therapies. Three possible scenarios accounting for the immunopathogenesis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis are presented, with the most probable one being that of paraneoplastic autoimmunity. Future efforts in this disorder should focus on elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to initiation of this antibody response, as well as exploring the role of tumors, infectious triggers and immune-reactivation. Finally, accessible tools need to be developed that allow for reliable identification of specific antibody markers against synaptic proteins.

### Genome-wide association study identifies 2 new loci associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^698de591]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibody-mediated encephalitides are a recently discovered group of rare diseases caused by autoantibodies against CNS system antigens. Subgroups are defined by the respective target antigens. The most common subgroup is caused by immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. NMDAR antibodies cause internalization of surface NMDAR, thereby reducing signal transduction. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis affects children and adults with a female preponderance. The estimated prevalence is 0.6/100,000 population. It manifests with behavioral changes, psychiatric symptoms, epileptic seizures, memory dysfunction, movement disorders, and loss of consciousness and often responds favorably to immunotherapy. A definite diagnosis requires the detection of anti-NMDAR antibodies of the IgG class in serum and/or CSF. Known trigger factors include ovarian teratomas with ectopic expression of NMDAR and viral (mostly herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1]) encephalitis. In a first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of antibody-mediated encephalitides in a much smaller sample, we found no variants showing genome-wide significant association with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. For this study, we doubled the sample size, modified the analysis parameters, and added colocalization analysis to identify putatively causal genes.

### Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and nonencephalitic HSV-1 infection [^ca91a20a]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) is a recently described autoimmune encephalitis associated with psychosis, seizures, dyskinesias, hypoventilation, and autonomic instability, attributed to antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). This disorder is now the most commonly identified nonviral cause of encephalitis. In approximately 50% of teenage girls and adult women with the disorder, it is triggered by an NMDAR-expressing ovarian teratoma. By contrast, greater than 90% of young girls or males with the disorder have no identified trigger, although it may be associated with viral infection. Approximately 10%–25% of patients with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis have an immune-mediated relapse associated with GluN1-specific antibodies and anti-NMDARE symptoms. The association of nonencephalitic HSV-1 infection with anti-NMDARE has not been examined. To investigate the possibility that nonencephalitic HSV-1 infection could trigger the production of anti-NMDAR antibodies, this study examined HSV-1 seropositivity in 2 participant cohorts, with and without anti-NMDAR encephalitis, to ascertain if an association exists between nonencephalitic HSV-1 infection and anti-NMDARE.

### Antibody titres at diagnosis and during follow-up of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: a retrospective study [^1e7e74aa]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a severe but treatable autoimmune disorder which diagnosis depends on sensitive and specific antibody testing. We aimed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of serum and CSF antibody testing in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, and the relation between titres, relapses, outcome, and epitope repertoire.

Methods

In this observational study, we used rat brain immunohistochemistry and cell-based assays (CBA) with fixed or live NMDA receptor-expressing cells to determine the sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing in paired serum and CSF samples. Samples were obtained at diagnosis from patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and from control participants worldwide. We deemed a patient to be antibody positive if their serum, their CSF, or both tested positive with both immunohistochemistry and CBA techniques; we determined titres with serial sample dilution using brain immunohistochemistry. We examined samples from 45 patients (25 with good outcome [modified Rankin Scale, mRS 0–2], ten with poor outcome [mRS 3–6], and ten with relapses) at three or more timepoints. We determined the epitope repertoire in the samples of 23 patients with CBA expressing GluN1-NMDA receptor mutants.

Findings

We analysed samples from 250 patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and 100 control participants. All 250 patients had NMDA receptor antibodies in CSF but only 214 had antibodies in serum (sensitivity 100.0% [98.5–1000%] vs 85.6% [80.7–89.4%], p < 0.0001). Serum immunohistochemistry testing was more often in agreement with CBA with fixed cells (77 [71%] of 108) than with CBA with live cells (63 [58%] of 108, p = 0.0056). In multivariable analysis, CSF and serum titres were higher in patients with poor outcome than in those with good outcome (CSF dilution 340 vs 129, difference 211, [95% CI 1–421], p = 0.049; serum dilution 7370 vs 1243, difference 6127 [2369–9885], p = 0.0025), and in patients with teratoma than in those without teratoma (CSF 395 vs 110, difference 285 [134–437], p = 0.0079; serum 5515 vs 1644, difference 3870 [548–7193], p = 0.024). Over time there was a decrease of antibody titres in the 35 patients with good or poor outcome and samples followed at three timepoints regardless of outcome (from diagnosis to last follow-up: CSF 614 to 76, difference 538 [288–788]; serum 5460 to 1564, difference 3896 [2428–5362]; both p < 0.0001). Relapses were associated with a change in titre more often in CSF than in serum (14 of 19 vs seven of 16, p = 0.037). After recovery, 24 of 28 CSF samples and 17 of 23 serum samples from patients remained antibody positive. Patients' antibodies targeted a main epitope region at GluN1 aminoacid 369; the epitope repertoire did not differ between patients with different outcomes, and did not change during relapses.

Interpretation

The sensitivity of NMDA receptor antibody testing is higher in CSF than in serum. Antibody titres in CSF and serum were higher in patients with poor outcome or teratoma than in patients with good outcome or no tumour. The titre change in CSF was more closely related with relapses than was that in serum. These findings emphasise the importance of including CSF in antibody studies, and that antibody titres can complement clinical assessments.

### Long-term cognitive, functional, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^ed396412]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Anti-NMDA receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis generally manifests in young adults. Although 80%-90% returns to independence, the majority experience persistent cognitive and psychosocial difficulties. Studies have demonstrated that cognitive recovery may continue for years; the temporal trajectory is largely unknown, as are factors influencing cognitive/psychosocial recovery. Objectives were to (1) describe the cognitive recovery trajectory, (2) assess self-reported outcomes, (3) identify factors relating to outcome, and (4) explore the relation between cognitive and self-reported outcomes, and participation.

Methods

We performed a large-scale cross-sectional and prospective cohort study. We addressed our nationwide cohort, provided they were (1) older than 16 years, (2) independent preillness, and (3) able to perform cognitive tests and/or self-report. Patients completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measures and neuropsychological assessments (memory, language, perception and construction, and attention and executive functions), and functional outcomes were established (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score and return-to-work/-education). Outcomes were compared with references and between groups based on clinical characteristics and functional outcomes (T -tests for normalized data and nonparametric tests for patient-reported data). Recovery was visualized by plotting outcomes against time-of-assessment.

Results

We included 92 patients (age 29 ± 2 years; 77% female). Cognitive scores improved with time-of-assessment, up to 36 months after diagnosis (R = 0.35, p = 0.022), with the most enhanced improvement in the first 6 months. This result could be reproduced in prospective patients (n = 12). Beyond 36 months (n = 44), 34% of patients had a persistent impairment (z -score < -1.5 SD) and 65% scored below-average (< -1 SD) in 1 or more cognitive domains, despite a "favorable" outcome measured by mRS (≤ 2) in the majority (91%). Most affected were memory (mean -0.67 ± 0.89 SD, p = 0.25) and language (-0.75 ± 1.06 SD, p = 0.23). Self-reported complaints remained in emotional well-being (mean 72 ± 25 SD vs norm 82 ± 33 SD, p < 0.001), social functioning (73 ± 26 SD vs 84 ± 22 SD, p < 0.001), energy levels (57 ± 19 SD vs 69 ± 19 SD, p < 0.001), and quality of life (0.85 ± 0.14 SD vs 0.93 ± 0.11 SD, p < 0.001). Many patients did not resume school/work (30%) or needed adjustments (18%). Resuming school/work related to processing speed (-0.14 ± 0.78 SD vs -0.84 ± 1.05 SD, p = 0.039) and well-being (EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels median 0.90 vs 0.81, p = 0.016).

Discussion

Recovery from anti-NMDAR encephalitis may continue for 3 years, with risk of persisting cognitive deficits, notably in memory and language, and sequelae in social functioning, energy levels, and well-being. The frequently applied outcome measure mRS does not fully capture outcomes. Almost half of patients struggled resuming school/work, associated with cognitive deficits and well-being.

### An updated, comprehensive meta-analysis of the treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis: analysis, equipoise, and the urgent need for evidence over anecdote [^d5b7fe35]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no FDA-approved treatments for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE), and no prospective, multicenter clinical trials have been completed to provide evidence for management of this disease. We evaluated changes in treatment strategies and outcomes since the previous comprehensive review in 2019.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed capturing manuscripts published from January 2019 through March 2024. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from articles containing individual immunotherapy data in NMDARE and were compared to a previously published literature review. Studies with ≥ 10 cases, ≥ 6 months follow-up, and outcomes reported as favorable (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0–2) and poor (mRS 3–5 or 3–6), were grouped and summarized by diagnosis period.

Results

Among 649 patients from 321 articles, first- (from 91.3% to 98.3%, p < 0.001) and second-line (from 31.8% to 42.5%, p < 0.001) immunotherapy use has increased. The proportion of patients receiving immunotherapy within 30 days of symptom onset increased from 50.1% to 72.5% (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) increased from 71.5% to 76.7% (p = 0.024), while mortality (6.3% to 6.9%, p = 0.714) and relapse rates (12.6% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.789) remained unchanged. Data from larger cohort studies of patients diagnosed with NMDARE after 2013 have reported wide variability in the proportion of patients achieving a favorable outcome at final follow-up, ranging from 56% to 93%, depending on the institution and follow-up duration.

Conclusions

Since 2019, more patients have been treated early with first- and second-line immunotherapies. Functional outcomes have shown modest improvements, whereas mortality and relapse rates have remained unchanged.

### The pursuit of precision in paraneoplastic neurologic disease [^04dab0c6]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The panel developed a new clinical scoring system called the PNS-Care Score. This calculator provides a level of diagnostic certainty in complicated clinical scenarios. Specifically, the PNS-Care Score encompasses the clinical syndromes in the presence of specific neuronal antibodies and/or cancer. The authors note that the criteria, by design, are rather specific and may underestimate the occurrence of PNS cases. Particularly, the authors wanted to avoid "incidental" antibody associations with commonly encountered malignancies, such as prostate cancer. This article also outlines updated cancer screening recommendations. Previous recommendations suggested screening for malignancy up to 4 years after the diagnosis of PNS. In this iteration, the authors recommend screening every 4–6 months for 2 years in patients with high-risk phenotypes/antibodies, with the caveat that the guidelines must be adapted to the individual case. For example, if a woman of reproductive age presents with a relapse of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, further screening measures to identify a potential ovarian teratoma are appropriate regardless of the timeframe from the index diagnosis. Clinicians should also be aware of testing limitations (e.g. the limited sensitivity of CT imaging for breast malignancy). The specific screening modality should always be informed by the antibody/phenotype tumor association. Finally, the importance of ensuring all patients follow age-appropriate cancer screening measures — in addition to any specific monitoring dictated by the PNS phenotype — cannot be overemphasized in this population.

### The patient perspective in encephalitis research [^812bc0f6]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on autoimmune and infectious encephalitis has made substantial progress in recent years in revealing the pathophysiology of these diseases, establishing robust diagnostic criteria, and developing promising treatment options, with a range of clinical trials currently underway. Outcome measures in studies on autoimmune and infectious encephalitis mainly relied on established and widely used tools such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). However, the mRS was developed to assess stroke outcome and has a strong focus on motor symptoms and the degree of dependence in daily activities. For example, approximately 80% of patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (i.e., the most common autoimmune encephalitis variant) achieve a good outcome 2 years after disease onset when evaluated using the mRS. 1 In contrast to these findings, recent studies show that a majority of patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis suffer from relevant and persistent cognitive impairment, despite mRS scores indicating good or very good recovery. 2,3 This shows that the mRS fails to detect clinically relevant long-term symptoms in these patients. Indeed, persisting cognitive deficits with their detrimental effect on quality of life are specifically important in the frequently very young patients with encephalitis. More recently, encephalitis-specific scores have been developed, e.g., the CASE score for the clinical assessment of patients with autoimmune encephalitis. 4 While this score is tailored to symptoms in autoimmune encephalitis, it has a strong focus on acute disease symptoms and is less well suited to capture long-term sequalae.

### Fatigue in survivors of autoimmune encephalitis [^f1958cbc]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To evaluate the impact of fatigue after autoimmune encephalitis, determine associations with patients' characteristics, and identify factors that contribute to its development.

Methods

In a first cohort recruited via several encephalitis support organizations, self-reported questionnaires were used to evaluate fatigue, depression, and sleep quality in adults after autoimmune encephalitis. In a second cohort where more in-depth clinical characterization could be performed, adults with encephalitis from 2 tertiary hospitals were evaluated using the same questionnaires. Patients' characteristics were retrospectively captured.

Results

In the first cohort (mean [SD] age; 43 [16] years, 220 [65%] female), 220 of 338 participants (65%) reported fatigue, 175 of 307 (57%) depression, and 211 of 285 (74%) poor sleep quality. In the second cohort (48 [19] years; 43 [50%] women), 42 of 69 participants (61%) reported fatigue, whereas 23 of 68 (34%) reported depression and 44 of 66 (67%) poor sleep quality, despite more than 80% having "good" modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores (0–2). Individuals with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis reported lower fatigue scores than those with other autoimmune encephalitis types. In a multivariate analysis examining factors at discharge that might predict fatigue scores, only anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was a (negative) predictor of fatigue and remained so when potential confounders were included.

Discussion

The impact of fatigue after autoimmune encephalitis is prominent and not fully accounted for by depression or sleep quality, nor adequately captured by mRS scores for disability. Fatigue is pervasive across autoimmune encephalitis, although lower scores are reported in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Fatigue should be screened routinely, considered as an outcome measure in clinical trials, and further studied from a mechanistic standpoint.

### Mental health outcomes of encephalitis: an international web-based study [^f89d561f]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Encephalitis is a devastating disorder with a global incidence of 0.5–16/100,000 per year. It is defined by the presence of inflammation in the brain parenchyma associated with clinical evidence of neurological dysfunction. Aetiologies are grouped into two categories: infectious and immune‐mediated. In as many as 37%, the cause is unknown, although improving diagnostics may be reducing this figure.

The clinical presentations of acute encephalitis are dependent on factors such as the causative agent and the brain regions affected. Common acute features include headache, seizures, focal neurological signs, movement disorders, personality/behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment/confusion.

Although direct comparisons are lacking, it is probable that autoimmune encephalitis is more likely to present with isolated or more prominent psychiatric features in the context of subtle neurological signs. In an early series of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis, as many as 80% of patients were initially assessed by mental health services. This figure has decreased as awareness of the condition has improved, but misdiagnosis encephalitis still occurs in a bidirectional manner.

Mortality varies by geographical region but can be up to 30% in infectious encephalitis, and in autoimmune encephalitis it ranges between 12% and 40%. Many more survivors are left with life‐changing neurological injury and dysfunction. Common sequelae include physical, cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and social difficulties.

Whereas cognitive sequelae have been explored in some detail, studies have seldom directly addressed mental health outcomes. Of these, the majority have had small sample sizes or focus on a relatively narrow range of symptoms, or on specific subtypes of encephalitis in specific population groups (e.g. children) and therefore may be unrepresentative. Further research is thus required to assess mental health outcomes in encephalitis of all aetiologies. To date, there have been no large‐scale data exploring the long‐term mental health outcomes of encephalitis from patients' perspectives.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis and successful management of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis when antibody testing is not possible [^f4a8f050]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a multistage illness that progresses from psychosis, memory deficits, seizures and language disintegration to a state of unresponsiveness with catatonic features often associated with abnormal movements, and autonomic and breathing instability. While the disorder predominantly affects children and young adults, and occurs with or without tumour association, the presence of a tumour (usually an ovarian teratoma) is dependent on the age, sex and ethnicity. Teratomas present more frequently in women older than 18 years, and are more predominant in black women than Caucasians. Here we present the case of a patient with probable anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. She was subsequently found to have a mature teratoma of the ovary (dermoid cyst). Despite immune-modulated therapy, surgery was eventually performed to remove the cyst. This was met with a good clinical recovery.

### Very long-term functional outcomes and dependency in children with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^1f9562e8]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe) recover from motor disabilities, but residual cognitive deficits are frequent. Previous reports examining the short and middle-term outcomes of children with NMDARe found that approximately 45% remained with cognitive deficits and 36%–70% with schooling or academic difficulties. However, the long-term prognosis regarding how disease burden affects patient's integrated daily function has not been explored. A key issue in disease burden is to assess how the disability is likely to make a child dependent on others. To this end, we have applied an easy to use 15-question format score (Liverpool Outcome Score [LOS])to assess pediatric patients with NMDARe after a minimal follow-up of 5 years.

### Role of soluble biomarkers in treating multiple sclerosis and neuroinflammatory conditions [^0373ce3d]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Other neuroinflammatory conditions

The pursuit to characterize autoimmune conditions with potentially causal antibodies has become a dominant theme in neuroimmunology. The attractiveness of a discrete answer as to the cause of a patient's neurological dysfunction is undeniable as treating patients with evermore potent immunosuppression warrants clear justification. Soluble biomarkers have been useful in understanding the pathophysiology, developing diagnostic criteria, and risk stratifying patients with other neuroinflammatory conditions aside from MS and NMOSD/MOGAD as well.

Biomarkers in encephalitis

Encephalitis broadly refers to conditions that lead to inflammation of the brain. There may be a known etiology, for example a viral infection such as in HSV encephalitis, related to drug reactions such as with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or with confirmed or presumed autoimmune pathologies. In terms of soluble biomarkers, some conditions have a more specific antibody signature such as anti-N-methyl — aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies in NMDA receptor encephalitis (NMDARE), or anti-ganglioside GQ1b antibodies in Bickerstaff's encephalitis. Others may be elucidated by immunofluorescent patterns on rat or primate neural tissues that one day may be specified by techniques like antibody phage display, as was the case for Kelch-Like-11 rhombencephalitis. Other autoimmune conditions still will have only associated antibodies, for example anti-Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies in steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, or no detectable antibodies at all, leaving gaps in defining diagnosis with an antibody-centric approach. Tracking response to immunotherapy and assessing relapse potential is also a challenge as patients with known causal antibodies like NMDARE will often have persistently detectable antibodies in serum and CSF following their recovery from an initial attack. However, in patients with NMDARE, the titre levels have been associated with a worse outcome as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), yet as a measure of treatment response due to persistent of antibody despite treatment (even if effective), further study is needed. Resultantly, research has diversified to explore alternative immunological factors.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and rasmussen-like syndrome: an association? [^2c77b763]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an immune-mediated condition that has a broad spectrum of manifestations, including seizures, coma, psychosis, and focal neurological deficits. Although usually a diffuse process, unihemispheric involvement mimicking early stages of Rasmussen encephalitis can occur. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a unique syndrome characterized by progressive hemiplegia, drug-resistant focal epilepsy, cognitive decline, and hemispheric brain atrophy contralateral to the hemiplegia.

Patient Description

We describe a two-year-old girl with progressive right weakness and epilepsia partialis continua, concerning for early Rasmussen's encephalitis, who tested positive for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. She experienced complete clinical recovery after immunotherapy. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were absent at three weeks and again at one year after the first treatment of intravenous immunoglobulin.

Conclusions

There are few reports of Rasmussen-like encephalitis in individuals with anti-NMDA receptor antibody positivity. Thus the clinical significance of this association is yet to be determined. In addition, several other antibodies have been documented in individuals with Rasmussen encephalitis. The lack of a consistently reported antibody in Rasmussen encephalitis patients and the temporary nature of the anti-NMDA receptor antibody in our patient raise the following question: Is the presence of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies the cause of the symptoms or secondary to the pathogenic process?

### Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis: a severe, multistage, treatable disorder presenting with psychosis [^d4163234]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis is a severe, treatable and potentially reversible disorder presenting with memory deficits, psychiatric symptoms and seizures. Initially described in young patients with ovarian teratoma, the disease is meanwhile increasingly recognized also in women without tumours, in men and in children. The presence of anti-glutamate receptor (type NMDA) autoantibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid is specific for this novel and widely underdiagnosed disorder. Early recognition is crucial since prognosis largely depends on adequate immunotherapy and, in paraneoplastic cases, complete tumour removal. Indirect immunofluorescence using NMDA-type glutamate receptors recombinantly expressed in human cells is a highly competent method for diagnosing anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis.

### Abnormal brain MRI in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: clinical and prognostic implications [^41d8de67]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The study has limitations, mostly due to its retrospective design, the heterogeneity of MRI devices and of time of MRI from symptom onset, and the use of the mRS (which improperly reflects the impact of cognitive impairments) because of the lack of more appropriate clinical scales. In the multivariable analysis, patient dropout led to exclude approximately a quarter of the patients and myelitis (2% of the cohort) was a potential confounding factor. We chose the cutoff of mRS score ≤ 1 (recovery without residual impairment) because the mRS tends to underestimate cognitive impairment in NMDAREand because complete or near-complete recovery (mRS scores 0–1) is essential for the patients to return to work or academic studies. Although we were not able to retrieve all the initial MRI scans (thereby possibly underestimating the frequency of extralimbic lesions), a second reading was performed for most of the patients with extralimbic lesions by a neurologist specialized in neuroinflammation (J.P.) and using a framework made by an expert neuroradiologist (F.C.). This was paramount to select, characterize, and classify the extralimbic lesions. Moreover, the study included a large cohort with highly detailed clinical information and extensive follow-up, which allowed us to study the outcomes at 2 years from NMDARE onset, when most patients have improved and/or stabilized. We also followed consensual guidelines to limit the risk of false-positive autoantibodies. The frequencies of unremarkable MRI, hippocampal hyperintensities, and overlapping demyelinating syndromes, as well as the long-term outcomes (27% disability or death at 2 years), are in line with previous studies. Conversely, the frequency of extralimbic lesions was lower herein (19% vs 23%–33% in other studies), which is likely due to the careful exclusion of nonspecific lesions in this study. Of note, the association of poor outcomes with increased CSF cell count is in line with previous studies. While ICU admission has been found to increase the odds of poor outcomes in a previous study, this effect was not found in our multivariable model. By contrast, we found an association between poor outcomes and decreased consciousness, which is to be confirmed in larger studies because the evaluation of the level of consciousness can be affected by multiple confounders, including severe cognitive impairment and seizures. Finally, the design of the study did not allow the evaluation of treatment efficacy because of a severity illness bias.

### Pitfalls in clinical diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^fe0e48b8]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report pitfalls in the clinical diagnosis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical information of 221 patients with clinically suspected autoimmune neurological disorders who underwent testing for autoantibodies against neuronal cell-surface antigens between January 1, 2007 and September 10, 2017. Forty-one patients met the diagnostic criteria for probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis (probable criteria), but one was excluded because neither serum nor CSF was examined at the active stage. Thus, in 220 patients, sensitivity and specificity of the probable criteria were assessed.

Results

NMDAR-antibodies were detected in 34 of 40 patients (85%) with the probable criteria; however, 2 of the 6 antibody-negative patients had ovarian teratoma. The median age at onset was higher in antibody-negative patients than those with antibodies (49 vs. 27 years, p = 0.015). The age at onset was associated with the probability of antibody detection (p = 0.014); the probability was less than 50% in patients aged 50 years or older. NMDAR-antibodies were also detected in 5 of 180 patients who did not fulfill the probable criteria; these patients presented with isolated epileptic syndrome (n = 2), atypical demyelinating syndrome (n = 2; one with aquaporin 4 antibodies), and autoimmune post-herpes simplex encephalitis (post-HSE) (n = 1). Sensitivity and specificity of the probable criteria was 87.2 and 96.7%, respectively.

Conclusion

The probable criteria are valid, but the diversity of clinical phenotype should be taken into account in diagnosing anti-NMDAR encephalitis particularly in patients aged 50 years or older, or with isolated epileptic syndrome, atypical demyelinating syndrome, or post-HSE.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^6bd89945]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a severe autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) subtype of anti-NMDAR autoantibodies (IgG-NMDAR-Abs). IgG-NMDAR-Abs are directly involved in the pathophysiology of this encephalitis, leading to the selective and reversible internalization of cell-surface NMDARs. Diagnosis is based on the presence of highly specific IgG-NMDAR-Abs in the CSF. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) (IgA-NMDAR-Abs) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) (IgM-NMDAR-Abs) directed against NMDAR have also been reported in the sera of some patients with dementia, schizophrenia, affective disorders, Parkinson disease, stroke, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or in healthy controls, but these findings have an unclear diagnostic value. Some authors suggested that under some circumstances, IgA-NMDAR-Abs could be pathogenic and that IgA-NMDAR-Abs would be present in the serum of 31% of patients with IgG-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of IgA-NMDAR-Abs in the CSF of patients with IgG-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and determine the potential association with a specific clinical pattern. The results suggested that although CSF IgA-NMDAR-Abs could be used as biological markers for the presence of ovarian teratoma, these markers do not have much influence on the clinical course of the disease.

### Autoantibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in health and disease [^4a4e8b01]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Along these lines and enlightening for clinicians, no appreciable differences were extracted by comparing NMDAR1-AB+ and NMDAR1-AB− encephalitis cases, except for typical NMDAR antagonistic (ketamine-like) symptoms. CSF analysis, EEG monitoring, MRI scanning, accompanying tumor frequency and outcomes were not different. These findings would support that 'anti-NMDA encephalitis' is not a separate condition, but marks any type of encephalitis in which the highly prevalent NMDAR1-AB happen to be present, are boosted, and dramatically shape the clinical picture. Dependent on the circumstances, namely absence or presence of an underlying brain inflammation, NMDAR1-AB may contribute to chronic processes (dementia, psychosis, epilepsy of unknown cause, personality changes) or fulminant courses ('anti-NMDAR encephalitis'), provided access to the brain (BBB dysfunction or intrathecal synthesis). The prodromal phase of many encephalitides is 'infectious-like', and infections cannot easily be excluded by routine analyses. Later symptoms may be 'ketamine-like' due to the presence of NMDAR1-AB among many other brain antigen-directed AB. The underlying condition finally determines the highly variable clinical and pathological picture, namely further symptoms, diagnostic readouts (EEG, MRI, CSF/blood parameters), treatment response, outcome and autopsy findings. It may be problematic if the search for causes stops after detection of NMDAR1-AB (IgG). We note, however, that in most cases, 'polypragmatic' treatment anyhow includes antibiotics, antiviral compounds and corticosteroids/immunosuppressants on top of a wide range of supporting measures.

### Retrospective analysis of NMDA receptor antibodies in encephalitis of unknown origin [^c3d9ecb8]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a severe disorder that occurs in association with antibodies to the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR and results in a characteristic syndrome.

Objective

To determine in a single institution setting whether patients previously diagnosed with encephalitis of unknown origin had anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Methods

Charts of 505 patients aged 18 to 35 years admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed for criteria of encephalitis of unknown etiology. These included encephalitic signs with psychiatric symptoms (agitation, paranoid thoughts, irritability, or hallucinations); seizures; CSF inflammation; and exclusion of viral or bacterial infection. Archived serum and CSF samples of patients fulfilling these criteria were examined for NMDAR antibodies. Follow-up visits allowed the analysis of the natural disease course and estimation of prognosis.

Results

Seven patients (all women) fulfilled the indicated criteria; 6 of them had NMDAR antibodies. Ovarian teratomas were detected in 2 patients, in one 3 years after the onset of encephalitis. Outcome was favorable in all patients. One patient without teratoma improved spontaneously along with disappearance of NMDAR antibodies.

Conclusions

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis represented 1% of all young patients' admissions to the ICU. Six of 7 cases with the indicated clinical criteria had anti-NMDAR encephalitis. NMDAR antibodies should be tested in all patients with encephalitis who fulfill these criteria.

### A score that predicts 1-year functional status in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^c03c365a]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Functional status assignment could be susceptible to recall bias since in some cases, mRS values were calculated retrospectively by referring physicians. Our cohort only includes patients referred to the University of Pennsylvania or the University of Barcelona for studies on autoimmune neurologic disease, which could introduce a selection bias. However, at the time of sample collection, our institutions provided the majority of testing of anti-NMDAR encephalitis worldwide. Samples were collected from 200 centers from 35 different countries. While this could be viewed as a particular strength of this study, a potential limitation of this wide referral base is that variations in treatment approaches across centers could affect outcome. Despite this concern, we believe that the overall approach to treatment was similar across referral centers. Patients were all treated in a stepwise fashion, with second-line therapies used only in cases in which no clinical response was seen to first-line therapies. Second, because of the limited options for antibody testing at the time of sample collection, referring physicians often received guidance on treatment approaches from our centers after specimen testing. In this way, patients from these disparate referral centers were funneled into a similar approach to treatment. Finally, future studies using other prospectively collected cohorts are needed to establish external validity of the NEOS score. In addition, incorporating biomarkers that associate with the response to treatmentcould further improve the score's ability to predict ultimate clinical outcome.

In addition to aiding families and treating physicians, the NEOS score could also be used to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from novel therapies in future clinical trials. Indeed, the standardization of treatment protocols for anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and other autoimmune encephalitis syndromes, brings the opportunity to test novel immunomodulatory agents that may modify disease course. Unbiased identification of appropriate patients using standardized metrics will be essential for proper trial design, and will ultimately aid in the development of novel treatment strategies that may allow for faster trajectories of recovery.

### Neuroleptic intolerance in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^8ddb30fc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Encephalitis with anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibodies (anti-NMDAR encephalitis) was first described in 2007 as a paraneoplastic syndrome in young women with ovarian teratoma, and it is now a widely recognized autoimmune synaptic disease. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis contributes to the novel links between immunology and psychiatry, especially in the developing area of autoimmune factors in classically conceived psychiatric diseases.

Since 2007, several studies have extensively described the clinical and neuropsychiatric presentations of the disease. It affects children and young adults, especially women, and is generally characterized by an association of psychotic symptoms, epilepsy, abnormal movements, and amnesia. Its psychiatric presentation generally precedes neurologic signs and symptoms, which explains why patients are often first hospitalized in psychiatric departments before being transferred to medical care units. Many publications even suggest the presence of an isolated psychiatric presentation, which may reduce the chances of a correct diagnosis and specific treatment. The prognosis seems to depend on the rapidity of the initiation of an immunomodulatory treatment. Thus, a more precise description of initial psychiatric symptoms may help physicians to consider this diagnosis, and look for anti-NMDAR antibodies. Thus, in order to improve early identification of anti-NMDAR encephalitis when patients have an initial psychiatric presentation, the aim of this retrospective study was to precisely describe the initial clinical signs and symptoms that led to hospitalization in a psychiatric department and the reasons underlying the exploration of anti-NMDAR encephalitis hypothesis.

### Emerging role of prodromal headache in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^bd1f86d5]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is recognized as a multistage disease, in which encephalitis symptoms may appear after prodromal symptoms (headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting).–Previous studies have reported that prodromal symptoms occurred in 70%–86% of the patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, there is a lack of studies that examine the characteristics of prodromal headache in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Moreover, few studies have suggested that the mechanism of encephalitis may be related to the NR1 subunit of NMDAR. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying headache-associated encephalitis remains largely unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the characteristics of prodromal headache in this disease and the underlying pathogenic mechanism of headache-associated anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Association of the Variables With Complete or Near-Complete Recovery (mRS Scores 0–1) at 2 Years (Univariable Analyses)

Figure 3
Prognostic Factors of Recovery of Patients With NMDARE Identified by Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis

The presence of MS-like lesions, CSF cellularity above 20/µL, and decreased consciousness were independently associated with decreased odds of recovery at 2 years. Conversely, age younger than 45 years increased the odds of recovery while hippocampal hyperintensities and fluffy lesions had no effect on the 2-year outcomes. Extensive FLAIR lesions were not included in the model because of the small number of patients (n = 4). Only the 197 patients with at least 2 years of follow-up were included. FLAIR = fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; NMDARE = anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor encephalitis; WBC = white blood cell.

### Absence of NMDA receptor antibodies in patients with ovarian teratoma without encephalitis [^9bde311a]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian teratoma (OT) has been identified in 18%–50% of patients with anti–N-methyl — aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, and an immunopathologic relationship between these conditions has been proposed.

It is currently unclear whether a subset of patients with OT harbor NMDAR antibodies before developing anti–NMDAR encephalitis. Therefore, the usefulness of systematic NMDAR antibody screening to identify patients with OT who may develop encephalitic symptoms and/or benefit from additional therapy should be investigated. We thus conducted this study to determine the frequency and usefulness of serum NMDAR antibody detection in patients with OT compared with other benign ovarian cysts, to ascertain whether antibody testing should be routinely conducted in this patient group.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^436b1f16]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective:

To evaluate the presence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) subtype of anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibodies (IgA-NMDAR-Abs) in the CSF of patients with immunoglobulin G (IgG)-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and to describe the potential association with a specific clinical pattern.

Methods:

The retrospective analysis for the presence of IgA-NMDAR-Abs in 94 CSF samples from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis diagnosed between October 2007 and February 2014 was conducted at the French Reference Centre on Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome. This observational study compared 39 patients with both IgA- and IgG-NMDAR-Abs to 55 patients with only IgG-NMDAR-Abs.

Results:

In the retrospective cohort, 41% of the patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis had both CSF IgG- and IgA-NMDAR-Abs. Approximately half of the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive patients (18/38, 49%) definitively possessed associated tumors, primarily ovarian teratomas (17/18, 94%), compared with only 5% (3/55) of the patients in the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-negative group (p < 0.001). In the adult female population at risk for ovarian teratoma, the detection of CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab positivity showed 85% sensitivity, 70% specificity, a 57% positive predictive value, and a 90% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of ovarian teratoma. No other specific clinical features or clinical outcome were associated with CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab positivity.

Conclusion:

These results suggest that in patients with IgG-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis, CSF IgA-NMDAR-Abs could be used as a biological marker for the presence of an ovarian teratoma.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated encephalitis: recent advances in diagnosis and treatment in children [^58e694bc]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2016). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated encephalitis (anti-NMDAR encephalitis) is increasingly recognized in children and adolescents. There is a recognizable pattern of clinical symptoms, similar between children and adults. There are some differences in children including the frequency of presenting symptoms, the presence of hypoventilation, and the identification of an associated tumor. Early tumor removal and treatment with immunotherapy is important for rapid recovery. The prognosis can be surprisingly good but some children have lasting neurocognitive deficits.

### Predictive value of electroencephalography in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^6d2a9931]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) is a severe, but treatable disease. This study aims to give a detailed description of electroencephalogram (EEG) results in paediatric and adult patients to improve disease recognition, and analyses the predictive value of the first EEG for the final clinical outcome.

Methods

This nationwide cohort study includes patients with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies confirmed with cell-based assay and immunohistochemistry in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. EEG recordings were re-evaluated by two experienced neurophysiologists, mixed with control EEGs for blinding. Initial EEG as well as follow-up registrations were analysed.

Results

35 adults and 18 children were included. Only two patients (4%) had a normal EEG. During the first recording, the majority of the patients had normal posterior rhythm (71%), which was associated with better modified Rankin Scale at final outcome (OR 4.74; 95% CI 1.56 to 14.47; p = 0.006). In addition, EEGs showed focal (73%) or diffuse (67%) slowing. The first EEG was severely abnormal in 26%. However, 8 of 14 patients with a severely abnormal first EEG still had a favourable outcome. During the course of the disease, extreme delta brushes (EDBs) were present in 6 of 53(11%)patients.

Conclusions

The first EEG commonly shows normal posterior rhythm with focal or diffuse slowing. Although the sensitivity of an abnormal EEG is high (96%), normal EEG does not exclude anti-NMDARE. EDBs are only present in severely affected patients. The first EEG recording is predictive of the final clinical outcome.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^ef28934d]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the presence of immunoglobulin A (IgA) subtype of anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antibodies (IgA-NMDAR-Abs) in the CSF of patients with immunoglobulin G (IgG)-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and to describe the potential association with a specific clinical pattern.

Methods

The retrospective analysis for the presence of IgA-NMDAR-Abs in 94 CSF samples from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis diagnosed between October 2007 and February 2014 was conducted at the French Reference Centre on Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome. This observational study compared 39 patients with both IgA- and IgG-NMDAR-Abs to 55 patients with only IgG-NMDAR-Abs.

Results

In the retrospective cohort, 41% of the patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis had both CSF IgG- and IgA-NMDAR-Abs. Approximately half of the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive patients (18/38, 49%) definitively possessed associated tumors, primarily ovarian teratomas (17/18, 94%), compared with only 5% (3/55) of the patients in the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-negative group (p < 0.001). In the adult female population at risk for ovarian teratoma, the detection of CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab positivity showed 85% sensitivity, 70% specificity, a 57% positive predictive value, and a 90% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of ovarian teratoma. No other specific clinical features or clinical outcome were associated with CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab positivity.

Conclusion

These results suggest that in patients with IgG-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis, CSF IgA-NMDAR-Abs could be used as a biological marker for the presence of an ovarian teratoma.

### Development of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^599a1d38]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is mediated by immunoglobulin G antibodies targeting the GluN1 subunit of the glutamate NMDA receptor. It is primarily associated with ovarian teratomas and sporadic herpes simplex encephalitis. However, the underlying neuroimmunological mechanisms linking autoimmune encephalitis to demyelinating diseases remain unclear. Proposed theories include T-cell autoreactivity, genetic predisposition, pro-inflammatory cytokines and microbiota influences, which may help explain the pathogenic overlap of these distinct disorders in the future. Several cases of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis have been reported in association with MOGAD and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. While MS is no exception, only a handful of documented cases support the growing recognition of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis coexisting with MS. A study by Zhang et al identified only 15 MS cases among 79 demyelinating disease patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in a PubMed database review. Psychiatric symptoms are key to early recognition, especially in MS patients, as demonstrated in case studies by Suleman and Javed, Gulec et al and Chahal et al. These symptoms appear in 83% of anti-NMDA encephalitis cases and often accompany cognitive dysfunction. However, cognitive dysfunction alone may be misinterpreted as MS progression or relapse, delaying proper diagnosis and treatment. Fleischmann et al described a woman with RRMS initially misdiagnosed with an MS relapse owing to cognitive impairment and refractory therapeutic response. Her correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was only made years after progressive cognitive decline and re-examination of previously obtained CSF samples, resulting in a poor prognosis despite temporary stabilisation with immunosuppressive therapy. According to Dalmau et al, a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis necessitates IgG GluN1 antibodies and at least one major symptom. In our case, diagnosis was confirmed through the presence of IgG GluN1 antibodies in the CSF — known to be more sensitive than serum testingalong with cognitive dysfunction, speech reduction and a subsequent decline in consciousness, meeting the criteria for definite anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Hummert et al found a correlation between IgG GluN1 titers and clinical severity; however, despite severe symptoms, our patient exhibited a low IgG GluN1 titre, likely owing to prior first-line therapy administration. CSF NMDA receptor antibodies demonstrate high specificity for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. A study involving 431 patients (including 412 with paired serum and CSF samples) found no cases where antibodies were exclusively present in serum. However, diagnosis should not rely solely on antibody presence; fulfilling clinical criteria remains essential. The IgG subclass is highly specific compared with less reliable IgA or IgM antibodies. In a study of 240 patients with conditions such as stroke, dementia and schizophrenia, 11 had IgA, IgM or both, but none had serum IgG NMDA receptor antibodies. Live neuron cultures showed that all 40 serum samples with IgG NMDA receptor antibodies exhibited cell surface reactivity, compared with only three samples with IgM and one with IgA, underscoring IgG's pathognomonic role. Experimental studies further suggest that while IgG NMDA receptor 1 antibodies do not induce brain inflammation, they can trigger psychosis-like symptoms. Although anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in both serum and CSF, CSF testing is crucial to avoid false-positive and false-negative results. Low serum titres have been reported in individuals without anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or immune-mediated CNS disorders. Many laboratories use commercially available HEK cell-based assays that co-express GluN1/GluN2 subunits, which can yield inaccurate results. For instance, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and neurocognitive impairment may produce antibodies against the GluN2 subunit, leading to false positives. An indirect immunofluorescence assay targeting the GluN1 subunit in CSF is recommended, though indeterminate results may still occur. In uncertain cases, specialised in-house cell-based assays provide greater specificity but require expertise for accurate interpretation. The breakdown of blood-brain barrier integrity, a known feature of MS demonstrated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, may explain how GluN1 antibodies infiltrate the CNS. Acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, these antibodies contribute to the characteristic clinical features of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Given the high mortality rate of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, clinicians should emphasise the importance of recognising severe cognitive symptoms in patients with MS, particularly those with fulminant disease that remains refractory to treatment. Above all, fluctuations in mental status, rapid cognitive decline, verbal reduction and dysautonomia should be considered atypical for MS relapse. These indications can facilitate the timely identification of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

### Overlapping demyelinating syndromes and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^c39d9fc4]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the clinical, radiological, and immunological association of demyelinating disorders with anti–Nmethyl- D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis.

Methods

Clinical and radiological analysis was done of a cohort of 691 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Determination of antibodies to NMDAR, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was performed using brain immunohistochemistry and cell-based assays.

Results

Twenty-three of 691 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis had prominent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or clinical features of demyelination. Group 1 included 12 patients in whom anti-NMDAR encephalitis was preceded or followed by independent episodes of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorder (5 cases, 4 anti-AQP4 positive) or brainstem or multifocal demyelinating syndromes (7 cases, all anti-MOG positive). Group 2 included 11 patients in whom anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurred simultaneously with MRI and symptoms compatible with demyelination (5 AQ4 positive, 2 MOG positive). Group 3 (136 controls) included 50 randomly selected patients with typical anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 56 with NMO, and 30 with multiple sclerosis; NMDAR antibodies were detected only in the 50 anti-NMDAR patients, MOG antibodies in 3 of 50 anti-NMDAR and 1 of 56 NMO patients, and AQP4 antibodies in 48 of 56 NMO and 1 of 50 anti-NMDAR patients (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons with Groups 1 and 2). Most patients improved with immunotherapy, but compared with anti-NMDAR encephalitis the demyelinating episodes required more intensive therapy and resulted in more residual deficits. Only 1 of 23 NMDAR patients with signs of demyelination had ovarian teratoma compared with 18 of 50 anti-NMDAR controls (p50.011).

Interpretation

Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis may develop concurrent or separate episodes of demyelinating disorders, and conversely patients with NMO or demyelinating disorders with atypical symptoms (eg, dyskinesias, psychosis) may have anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

### International consensus recommendations for the treatment of pediatric NMDAR antibody encephalitis [^cf3de84b]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis (NMDARE) is one of the most common autoimmune encephalitides, characterized by a recognizable constellation of neurologic and psychiatric features alongside positive NMDAR antibodies. NMDARE mostly affects children and young adults, particularly females. It may be very severe in the acute phase with a mortality of about 5%, relapses occur in about 15% of patients, and the final physician-assessed functional outcome is generally favorable, although neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae are relatively common.

The use of immunotherapies has been shown to improve outcomes, especially with early administration. In addition, immunotherapies reduce the risk of relapses. However, several aspects of treatment remain incompletely clarified, and treatment strategies are still heterogeneous, especially with regard to second-line and long-term immunotherapies. Indeed, although a number of reviews have been published, no randomized controlled trials or consensus guidelines for the treatment of NMDARE are available.

With support from the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance, we aimed to create a consensus recommendation for the treatment of pediatric NMDARE, which was pragmatic and relevant to a global community and could serve as a practical decision support tool for the clinician confronted with this rare and challenging condition. Notably, the present document is intended as a recommendation guideline rather than absolute rules, given the limited evidence supporting most treatment statements. Although this document is focused on immunotherapy and to some extent symptomatic management, there are multiple outstanding issues in the management of pediatric NMDARE, such as education around the diagnosis and rehabilitation of patients after the acute phase, which are beyond the scope of this current article.

### Anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma: a case series and literature review [^1a427e22]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Long‐term follow‐up of patients' reproductive function after treatment was assessed through their ability to conceive and have children. All surviving patients in the study were unmarried and had not become pregnant, so there was limited data to evaluate this issue. However, case reports and literature reviews from around the world suggest that women can successfully conceive after having NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis. Future prospective studies are needed to better understand the potential interaction between pregnancy and NMDA receptor encephalitis. Future studies should also consider predictors of pregnancy outcomes in NMDA receptor encephalitis.

### Long-term cognitive, functional, and patient-reported outcomes in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^f335715f]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In spite of attempts to minimize selection bias by travelling to patients who did not have the possibilities to travel to the research institute, the included cohort is a selection of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, tending toward the less severely affected in the acute phase. This may be explained by the fact that we had to exclude deceased patients and children, who were more severely affected (respectively, 76% and 60% required ICU admission, vs 43% of the nationwide cohort and 32% of included patients). Moreover, the excluded children more often had a preceding HSVE (40%, vs 13% of the nationwide cohort), and it is known that patients with a preceding HSVE are often more severely affected. Although the exclusion of these patients caused a selection bias, it was unpreventable to exclude deceased patients, and young children should be carefully assessed with tests adjusted for their age, which cannot easily be compared with the tests in this study. Patients, who were initially too severely affected to participate in the study due to a decreased consciousness, were always included in a later stage. Although this last scenario did not attribute to a selection bias of the complete included cohort, it limited the availability of results of prospectively included patients (n = 12), specifically assessments of the acute phase. Whereas the identified selection bias commands caution in generalizing results, the identified long-term effects can only be expected to be an underestimation and the implications only emphasized.

We have composed a comprehensive cognitive testing battery for this study, including psychometrically robust tests addressing the major cognitive domains in a relatively short time as to limit the burden of testing for patients.

As mentioned, conducting cognitive assessments in the acute phase of the anti-NMDAR encephalitis proved challenging due to severe symptoms or the effects of medication. Although pertinent for capturing subtle long-term effects, this implies the limited applicability of cognitive testing in the acute setting, defining a floor effect. It can therefore not yet replace the use of mRS or CASE scores in the acute settings of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Another limitation of cognitive and patient-reported data is the dependency on available normative data. Although for most cognitive tests, data of a large and diverse reference group were available, this was not always the case for patient-reported outcome measures, and reference cohorts from literature did not always reflect the anti-NMDAR encephalitis population. A higher average age of some reference cohorts (i.e. WHO-DAS-II) may lead to a relative underestimation of patient-reported sequelae.

### Sleep characteristics in pediatric anti – methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis: a retrospective cohort study [^9e4d3983]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Rates of sleep problems in children with anti -N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis are unknown. Methods: We used a retrospective observational cohort database of children with a diagnosis of NMDA receptor encephalitis at a single freestanding institution. One-year outcomes were assessed with the pediatric modified Rankin Score (mRS), with 0 to 2 as good and 3 or greater as poor outcome. Results: Ninety-five percent (39/41) of children with NMDA receptor encephalitis had sleep dysfunction at onset; 34% (11/32) reported sleep problems at 1 year. Sleep problems at onset and propofol use were not associated with poor outcomes at 1 year. Poor sleep at 1 year correlated with mRS scores (range 2–5) at 1 year. Discussion: High rates of sleep dysfunction occur in children with NMDA receptor encephalitis. Persistent sleep problems at 1 year may correlate with outcomes as assessed by mRS at 1 year. Further studies comparing the relationship of poor sleep with outcomes in NMDA receptor encephalitis are needed.

### Autoantibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in health and disease [^df5d85eb]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

'ANTI-NMDAR ENCEPHALITIS' IS UNLIKELY A SEPARATE DISEASE ENTITY

Several current articles failed to confirm earlier 'exclusivity claims' of 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis'. Extreme delta brush had been interpreted as unique EEG pattern in adults with 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis', a statement now invalidated. Addressing the predisposition of AB carriers to epilepsy, high neurological AB prevalence (34.8% neurological AB; 3.6% NMDAR1-AB; pretreatment sera) was described in prospectively evaluated cases with epilepsy of unknown cause. AB+ patients showed greater likelihood of neuropsychiatric symptoms or autonomic dysfunction. Also in this study, immunoglobulin class and method of AB detection were not mentioned, BBB function not discussed, and the high overall AB seroprevalence in health and disease not considered.

Another recent claim is the 'characteristic pattern of whole-brain functional connectivity alterations in anti-NMDAR encephalitis that is well suited to explain the major clinical symptoms of the disorder'. The authors investigated at highly variable time points after the initial diagnosis 43 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis' cases by resting state fMRI. A large proportion of subjects had at the day of fMRI negative NMDAR1-AB titers. Thus, any conclusion linking the described dysconnectivity to NMDAR1-AB is problematic. Long-term persisting effects of NMDAR1-AB once they are eliminated by e.g. immunosuppression or plasmapheresis, have not yet been documented anywhere. Experimental approaches rather point to a rapid loss of effects after AB vanishing. Even more importantly, the study lacks a well matched group of encephalitis patients without history of NMDAR1-AB as adequate control. A connectivity disturbance is foreseeable for any kind of encephalitis.

### Clinical relevance of serum antibodies to extracellular N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor epitopes [^caed93f4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Autoimmune likelihood of patients' disease

To review the clinical relevance, each neurologist who cared for one or more of the patients (often one of the authors) was asked to provide a diagnosis. In most cases this was a clinical diagnosis, aided by the emerging reports of NMDAR encephalitis in the literature and discussions with one or more of the authors during the patient management. The diagnosis and treatment had been completed prior to this service review, but the authors made judgements regarding cases in which the NMDAR-Ab result came to light after a patient's illness or death, or if the patient was not seen by a neurologist. Subsequently, the clinicians were asked to consider the response to immunotherapies to help categorise the patients as Definite NMDAR-encephalitis, a Possible NMDAR-antibody-mediated disease or an Unlikely NMDAR-Ab-mediated or autoimmune disease.

To determine how the antibody levels and these categories related to the core clinical features of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis (encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive symptoms, seizures, extrapyramidal movement disorder), the number of features including an inflammatory CSF (cellular, raised protein or oligoclonal bands if tested) were tabulated. We did not include slow waves on EEG as this feature would be captured by the presence of encephalopathy.

Statistical analyses

The cell-based assay NMDAR scores for each group were compared with ANOVA, with post hoc comparisons.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis… [^126c67fc]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Observations We present a case of a woman in her late 30s who developed psychiatric symptoms that progressed to encephalopathy, seizures, autonomic instability, and hyperkinetic movements. The patient was found to have an ovarian teratoma and serum and cerebrospinal fluid NMDAR antibodies. Despite resection of the teratoma and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, the patient progressed to a minimally conscious state. Conclusions and Relevance As far as we know, this case represents the longest active treatment without improvement of a patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The patient had persistently high cerebrospinal fluid and serum antibody titers, which may be of prognostic significance. The frequency of an underlying tumor, almost always a teratoma, varies according to sex, age, and ethnicity3, 5; approximately 50% of women older than 12 years have an ovarian teratoma. Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed and showed an echogenic mass in the right ovary.

The mass was resected and the pathology revealed an ovarian teratoma. Lumbar puncture performed at the time of the teratoma resection showed a high titer of anti-NMDAR antibodies in the CSF. A positron emission tomography scan was also normal, showing no evidence of malignancy. The CSF and serum analyses performed 10 months after hospital admission, following complete oophorectomy and treatment with IVIg, steroids, 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide, and 10 doses of rituximab, showed a moderate and transient decrease of serum and CSF anti-NMDAR antibody concentrations. We also questioned whether we may have been missing a secondary source of immunological activation and antibody production. The patient had a teratoma removed from her right ovary and the contralateral ovary that was also excised was normal. The possibility remains there may have been another undetected teratoma at a distant site.

Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a relatively new disease characterized by mental status changes, seizures, autonomic instability, and hyperkinesis. Most patients do well with treatment and often make a near complete recovery, but a small proportion of patients do not improve. Since the antibody alters the levels of NMDAR synaptic receptors, 4 the persistent high levels of antibodies in our patient correlate with her lack of improvement, but it is unclear why she was refractory to all immunotherapies used.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^7d09d09c]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

A practical issue of the present study is the value of the CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab status as an indicator of an associated teratoma in the context of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. At the individual level, there is no available predictive surrogate marker for the association of an ovarian tumor or a primary tumor elsewhere. In the present study, initial radiologic examinations did not reveal an ovarian teratoma in 5 cases. In clinical practice, the detection of a small teratoma (mean tumor size of 2.3 cm in the present study) in a patient with a severe neurologic state requiring respiratory assistance and sedation is typically difficult but must be considered a high priority. Because of the observed 85% sensitivity and 90% negative predictive value in the adult female population at risk for ovarian teratomas, we suggest that CSF-IgA-NMDAR-Ab status could be a predictive indicator for managing the patient screening for an associated teratoma. For an IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive woman, when early radiologic pelvic investigations are negative, a second screening with pelvic CT or MRI or endovaginal ultrasound should be conducted promptly and repeated if negative. Future prospective studies are needed to further demonstrate the usefulness of CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab status as a biomarker for a teratoma in anti-NMDAR-Abs encephalitis.

### The clinical relevance of serum versus CSF NMDAR autoantibodies associated exclusively with psychiatric features: a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^734257ca]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis, we identified 79 patients with an isolated psychiatric syndrome associated with NMDAR autoantibodies who had undergone neurological investigation. Exploratory analysis revealed patients with CSF autoantibodies differed from those with serum-only autoantibodies on several demographic, clinical, and investigation finding variables.

With respect to demographic and clinical profile, patients with CSF NMDAR autoantibodies were more likely to be female and to have a rapid onset of symptoms. These clinical characteristics are consistent with the epidemiology of NMDARE, a disorder based on CSF NMDAR-antibody detection. In the largest observational study of NMDARE to date, 81% were female, and 38% had a tumour reported (most commonly an ovarian teratoma), which was a similar proportion to the CSF antibody-positive group in this study. According to current consensus criteria, all of the patients we identified with CSF NMDAR autoantibodies met the criteria for definite NMDARE and 94% of those treated with immunotherapy showed an improvement.

### Brain MRI characteristics of patients with anti – methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and their associations with 2-year clinical outcome [^81ace900]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Anti- N -methyl-D-aspertate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune-mediated disease without specific brain MRI features. Our aim was to investigate the brain MR imaging characteristics of anti- N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and their associations with clinical outcome at a 2-year follow-up.

Materials and Methods

We enrolled 53 patients with anti- N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and performed 2-year follow-up. Brain MRIs were acquired for all patients at the onset phase. The brain MR imaging manifestations were classified into 4 types: type 1: normal MR imaging findings; type 2: only hippocampal lesions; type 3: lesions not involving the hippocampus; and type 4: lesions in both the hippocampus and other brain areas. The modified Rankin Scale score at 2-year follow-up was assessed, and the association between the mRS and onset brain MR imaging characteristics was evaluated.

Results

Twenty-eight (28/53, 53%) patients had normal MR imaging findings (type 1), and the others (25/53, 47%) had abnormal MRI findings: type 2: 7 patients (13%); type 3: seven patients (13%); and type 4: eleven patients (21%). Normal brain MRI findings were more common in female patients (P = 0.02). Psychiatric and behavioral abnormalities were more common in adults (P = 0.015), and autonomic symptoms (P = 0.025) were more common in pediatric patients. The presence of hippocampal lesions (P = 0.008, OR = 9.584; 95% CI, 1.803–50.931) and relapse (P = 0.043, OR = 0.111; 95% CI, 0.013–0.930) was associated with poor outcome.

Conclusions

Normal brain MRI findings were observed in half of the patients. Lesions in the hippocampus were the most common MR imaging abnormal finding. The presence of hippocampal lesions is the main MR imaging predictor for poor prognosis in patients with anti- N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.

### Autoantibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in health and disease [^a3df0e05]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Humoral autoimmunity has gained highest interest in neurology and psychiatry. Despite numerous recent articles on this hot topic, however, the biological significance of natural autoantibodies (AB) and the normal autoimmune repertoire of mammals remained quite obscure. AB may contribute to disorder-relevant phenotypes and are even believed to induce diseases themselves, but the circumstances under which AB become pathogenic are not fully understood. This review will focus on the highly frequent AB against the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR1-AB) as an illustrating example and provide a critical overview of current work (please note that the new nomenclature, GluN1, is disregarded here for consistency with the AB literature). In particular, it will demonstrate how little is known at this point and how many conclusions are drawn based on small numbers of individuals, fragmentary experimental approaches or missing controls.

Recent Findings

NMDAR1-AB were investigated by clinicians world-wide with numerous small studies and case reports appearing yearly. Many publications were on 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis' cases or tried to separate those from other NMDAR1-AB associated conditions. Original exclusivity claims (e.g. electroencephalogram, EEG or functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI findings) turned out not to be exclusive for 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis'. Systematic analyses of representative NMDAR1-AB positive sera of all immunoglobulin (Ig) classes showed comparable distribution of different epitopes, often polyspecific/polyclonal, across health and disease. Sophisticated imaging tools provided findings on synapse trafficking changes induced by NMDAR1-AB from psychotic subjects but still lack epitope data to support any claimed disorder link. Persistently high titers of NMDAR1-AB (IgG) in immunized mice with open blood-brain barrier (BBB)-induced psychosis-like symptoms but failed to induce inflammation in the brain. Knowledge on peripheral NMDAR, for example in the immune system, and on potential inducers of NMDAR1-AB is only slowly increasing.

Summary

The present knowledge on the (patho) physiological role of NMDAR1-AB is very limited and still characterized by adamant rumors. Much more experimental work and more solid and informative clinical reports, including large numbers of subjects and adequate control groups, follow-up investigations and interdisciplinary approaches will be necessary to obtain a better understanding of the significance of humoral autoimmunity in general (in focus here: NMDAR1-AB) and its disease-relevance in particular.

### Autoimmunity: the good, the bad, and the ugly [^315ddbab]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The investigation for ovarian teratomas in patients with anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is complicated by the fact that a substantial number of patients do not appear to have a tumor, and in some cases there is evidence that the tumor is microscopic or missed in the initial investigations. The article by Desestret et al.suggests that in women with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, the detection in CSF of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) NMDAR antibodies should raise the suspicion for an underlying teratoma. Indeed, in a cohort of 94 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 41% also had CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies. While 49% of these patients had associated tumors, mainly ovarian teratomas, only 5% of those without IgA NMDAR antibodies had teratomas. The significance of this finding is unclear given that IgA NMDAR antibodies occurred more frequently in patients with high titer IgG NMDAR antibodies and it is known that high titer IgG antibodies associate more frequently with teratomas. The findings deserve further study to confirm this association.

### Antibody therapies in autoimmune encephalitis [^929c93d8]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders in which the host immune system targets self-antigens expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). The antibody epitopes can be located intracellularly which is associated with the presence of a concurrent tumor (Chapter 8) or extracellularly on which we will focus in this chapter. In 2007, anti- N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies were the first to be discovered and linked to a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome previously not thought to be immune-mediated. Meanwhile, more and more autoantibodies directed at neuronal cell surface antigens have been identified and associated with specific neurological phenotypes. Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) encephalitis typically manifests with subtle faciobrachial dystonic or other focal seizures followed by memory disturbances. Anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) encephalitis is characterized by a protracted course, and anti-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) antibodies induce an often paraneoplastic, treatment-responsive limbic encephalitis which frequently relapses. The presence of tumor varies per type of antibody. Some antibodies are commonly associated with tumors whereas in other antibody-associated syndromes, tumors are rare or absent.

The circulating neuronal cell surface antibodies are aimed at extracellular proteins which have a direct pathogenic effect by influencing the antigen function or causing antigen internalization in the absence of cell destruction. By counteracting the autoimmune response with immunosuppressive drugs, most patients, even those who are severely ill, make a substantial improvement. This is different from AE associated with antibodies targeting intracellular epitopes (i.e. paraneoplastic syndromes) in which the effect of immunotherapy is less established.

Current treatment of AE is based on immunotherapy and has been established according to clinical experience and along the concept of a B cell-mediated pathology induced by highly specific antibodies to neuronal surface antigens. The available evidence to treat AE is mainly based on retrospective data, and (randomized) clinical trials are largely lacking. This is due to the relative novelty of AE as well as the rarity of these diseases making large-scale international collaborations to study treatment effects necessary. Currently, we have most evidence-based experience treating anti-NMDAR encephalitis following the publication of one large, partially prospective cohort study. For the other AE types, mainly smaller cohorts or cases series have been published.

### Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis: case report and literature review of an under-recognized condition [^a4818fec]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDA-R) encephalitis is an immune-mediated syndrome that remains under-recognized despite a growing body of literature. This syndrome has been predominantly described in young females with a constellation of symptoms, including personality changes, autonomic dysfunction and neurologic decompensation. It is commonly associated with mature ovarian teratomas. We describe the classic presentation of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis in three dramatically different patients: Case A, a young woman with ovarian teratoma; Case B, the eldest case reported to date; and Case C, a young male with no identifiable tumor. We review the literature summarizing the differential diagnosis, investigative approach, treatment options and challenges inherent to this disorder. We advocate good supportive care, involvement of multiple health disciplines and use of immune-modulating therapies in patient management. These cases underscore the need for increased awareness and high diagnostic suspicion when approaching the patient with suspected viral encephalitis.

### Paraneoplastic anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in 1830? [^a778ee7e]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summarizing our interpretation, a young woman had newly onset seizures, followed by catatonia-like symptoms and hypoventilation. This was associated with an abdominal tumor, which was probably a teratoma. The symptoms disappeared after the spontaneous elimination of the tumor, and the patient remained healthy during the 11-year follow-up.

According to a recent position study, new-onset seizures and altered mental status (unresponsive state) with subacute onset meet the criteria for "possible autoimmune encephalitis". Epileptic seizures, altered mental status, abnormal posturing, and hypoventilation meet the symptoms criteria for "possible anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis". The young age and female sex as well as the presence of ovarian teratoma also strengthen our assumption that Dr. Linoli's case study might be the first description of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

In paraneoplastic anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, the symptoms usually resolve after tumor removal, may that be either ovarian or extraovarian. Regarding Dr. Linoli's patient, the symptoms were present when the tumor was present and disappeared after the tumor also disappeared. Thus, we state that the description of a paraneoplastic story can be dated back as far as to 1830, ahead of the description of Trousseau's syndrome in 1865.

Although this study is nationwide, there are some limitations associated with the retrospective design of this study. First, clinical data were sometimes difficult to assess from the documentation, especially follow-up data. However, we could overcome this issue as we saw or interviewed most patients in our clinic or had contact with the treating physician or caregiver. Second, the cohort is relatively modest in size also reflecting the rarity of the disease, yet we could include almost all patients accomplishing nationwide coverage. Because of the retrospective design, the ability to extract detailed functional outcomes was difficult, and we decided, therefore, to use the mRS, despite its limitations. However, as long-term outcome was not the primary scope of our study, the current amount of data was sufficient to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, physicians should be aware that anti-NMDAR encephalitis can occur at all ages and might be less rare later in life than previously anticipated. Complicating factor is the less outspoken nature of the disease in late-onset patients, but early treatment is even more important due to the link with malignancies and as recovery is already slower and less complete. Physicians requesting NMDAR antibody tests should be aware of the pitfalls of the test, including the lower sensitivity and specificity in serum, and the need for CSF confirmation. However, as no test is ever perfect, the physician should always link the clinical phenotype with the antibody results (even in CSF). In doubt, a reference laboratory should serve to confirm or refute the diagnosis.

### Differential expression of antibodies to NMDA receptor in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus [^230e73b0]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was most frequently associated with ovarian teratoma among neoplasms. Moreover, the resection of tumours usually facilitated the amelioration of the manifestation in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. It is therefore likely that antigen-specific immune responses to some specific antigens included in the ovarian teratoma might be responsible for the expression of anti-NR1/NR2 antibodies. In fact, it has been demonstrated that tissues in ovarian teratoma contain NMDA receptors. Moreover, histological analysis of ovarian teratoma has revealed that lymphocyte infiltration was more frequent in patients with encephalitis compared with non-encephalitis patients, suggesting the presence of antigen-driven immune responses.

Although the mechanism of the expression of a variety of autoantibodies in SLE remains unclear, it is not assumed as a simple antigen-specific immune response. Thus, in addition to antigen-driven responses, several mechanisms have been suggested, including polyclonal B cell activation, impaired apoptotic pathways or the outcome of idiotypic network dysregulation. Notably, the expression of anti-NR2 antibodies was correlated with the expression of anti-Sm antibodies along with the increasing activity of NPSLE. Thus, the positive correlation between these two autoantibodies strongly suggests the presence of abnormal responses other than antigen-specific reactions. In this regard, the mechanism of the expression of anti-NR2 is likely to be different from that of anti-NR1/NR2.

It should be pointed out that anti-NR1/NR2 was not detected in CSF from the two patients whose sera were positive for anti-NR1/NR2 in the present study. Since the presence of anti-NR1/NR2 in CSF is crucial to the development of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, it is suggested that anti-NR1/NR2 might not play any significant role in the development of neuropsychiatric manifestations even in these two patients with NPSLE. Thus, this type of encephalitis is considered to be extremely rare in SLE.

### The psychopathology of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis in adults: a systematic review and phenotypic analysis of individual patient data [^3a6e2411]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Early immunotherapy administration improves outcomes in patients with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis. As most patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis present to psychiatrists, the psychopathology of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis needs to be clearly defined to encourage accurate clinical identification and prompt treatment.

Methods

For this systematic review, we searched PubMed for all studies published in English between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 7, 2017, to identify individually reported adult patients (≥ 18 years) who satisfied consensus criteria for definite NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. After generating a list of 50 fine-grained, lower-level features, we extracted psychopathological data in addition to demographic and aetiological data. The lower-level features were later ordered within higher-level categories. As a means of quality control, we filtered the data according to proxy markers of psychiatric involvement in their description. Subsequently, we compared lower-level features from individual patient data with operationalised psychiatric syndromes using a constrained combination approach and principal component analysis, and did a network analysis to explore the inter-relationships between multiple lower-level features. The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017068981.

Findings

Of 1096 records identified in PubMed, 333 satisfied inclusion criteria and described 1100 patients in total with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. The psychopathology of 505 (46%) patients with reported psychiatric symptoms was described in more detailed terms than only psychiatric or behavioural. 464 (91%) of the 505 patients were from papers in which patient data were reported individually. The remainder of the analyses focused exclusively on these 464 patients. Median age was 27 years (IQR 22–34), 368 (79%) of 464 patients were female and in 147 (32%), NMDAR-antibody encephalitis was associated with ovarian teratoma. The five higher-level categories into which the 464 patients most frequently grouped were behaviour (316 [68%]), psychosis (310 [67%]), mood (219 [47%]), catatonia (137 [30%]), and sleep disturbance (97 [21%]). The overall pattern of lower-level features was statistically stable across subgroups classified by age, sex, pregnancy association, presence of ovarian teratoma, prior herpes simplex virus encephalitis, and isolated psychiatric presentations (two-way ANOVA p = 0·6–0·9). Constrained combination and principal component analyses found that mixtures of mood and psychosis syndromes fit each patient better than any single diagnosis alone, particularly for the patients in the psychiatric-described subgroup (mean ΔAkaike information criterion -0·04 in non-psychiatric-described subgroup vs 0·61 in psychiatric-described subgroup). The overlapping nature of the higher-level features was also enriched upon analysis of the psychiatric-described data (221 [67%] of 329 overlaps in non-psychiatric-described subgroup vs 96 [81%] of 118 overlaps in psychiatric-described subgroup, p = 0·0052). Network analysis confirmed that the features were closely related and consistent between individual patients; the psychiatric-described subgroup had a markedly high and narrow range of closeness centralities (92% above 0·93 in psychiatric-described subgroup vs 51% above 0·93 in the non-psychiatric group).

Interpretation

The distinctive aspect of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis psychopathology is complexity; core aspects of mood and psychotic disorders consistently coexist within individual patients. Alongside the predominant young female demographic, these psychopathological features could help psychiatrists identify patients who would benefit from cerebrospinal fluid testing and immunotherapies. Well-controlled prospective studies with bespoke inventories are needed to advance this clinically grounded approach.

### Anti-NMDAR encephalitis: a single-center, longitudinal study in China [^e881f741]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest Chinese anti-NMDAR encephalitis cohort to date. In our study, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is predominantly found in females (65.0%) with the median age at onset of 21 years. Most patients presented with psychiatric symptoms and seizures, and younger patients presented more often with movement disorders, which are consistent with previous studies.

However, our study reported a low ICU admission rate. The large cohort study of Titulaer et al.reported that 75% (435/563) of patients with mRS score ≥ 4 were admitted to the ICU. In our study, because of limited availability of medical recourses and concern of expenses, only 68/133 (51.1%) of the severe patients (mRS score ≥ 4) were admitted to the ICU.

The prevalence of an underlying neoplasm varied among studies. Titulaer et al.reported that 38% of the patients had a tumor, and Asian patients were more likely (45%) to have a teratoma. However, only 19.5% of the patients in our cohort had a tumor, with 29.4% of the females had an ovarian teratoma. Other studies of Chinese or Asian patients have also reported low prevalence of tumors (Lim et al. 22.7%; Wang et al. 8%; Liu et al. 6.7%; and Zhang et al. 8.1%). The heterogeneity among reports may be due to sample sizes and selection bias or other factors including genetic backgrounds and epidemiologic reasons, and future studies are required.

In tumor-negative patients, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has been reported to be the possible trigger. However, as the gold standard for the infection is PCR testing, which is expensive and time consuming, most patients received empirical treatment before or even without a definite diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. Thus post-HSV anti-NMDAR encephalitis was unable to assess in our current study.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^0ee00a6d]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The present study evaluates the presence of IgA-NMDAR-Abs in the CSF of patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and determines their relative contribution to this syndrome. In the retrospective cohort, 41% of the patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis had both CSF IgG- and IgA-NMDAR-Abs. This CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive rate was consistent with the 30% serologic IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive rate previously reported in NMDAR-Ab encephalitisand markedly higher than the false-positive rate observed in large seroprevalence studies. No significant differences in clinical and paraclinical presentation, severity, and prognosis according to the IgA status were identified. No specific clinical features were associated with CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab positivity, except that ovarian teratomas were much more frequent in patients with CSF IgA-NMDAR-Abs. These results suggest that CSF IgA-NMDAR-Abs could be biomarkers for the presence of an ovarian teratoma, without influencing the clinical course of this disease.

### Paraneoplastic anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in 1830? [^00854613]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was discovered by Dalmau et al. in 2005/2007, although cases were probably described already in 1997. Moreover, because of revisiting published cases dating back as far as the 19th century, more and more cases are suggested to be of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis etiology. Merwick et al.pointed out that from the case series published by Bickerstaff — in which Bickerstaff encephalitis was described — in one patient, the symptoms were indicative of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. In the late 1800s, ovariotomy (Battey's operation) was introduced as a treatment of — among others — "histeroepilepsy". In the course of the recent revisitation of these published cases, symptoms can also be attributed to anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in more than one patient; this suggestion is also supported by the observation of Battey, namely that "cystic degeneration" was common in the resected ovaries. This is the most common autoimmune encephalitis, where 80% of patients are women with a median age of 21. Epileptic seizures occur in 76%, catatonia-like episodes in 70%, whereas hypoventilation in 66% of patients. In adult women patients, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is associated with ovarian teratoma in 58% of cases. Other tumors are rare: in paraneoplastic cases, 94% of the underlying tumor is ovarian teratoma.

We found an interesting case report published in leading Hungarian-, German- and Italian-language medical journals referring to a presentation at the 3rd Meeting of the Italian Scientists in Florence held in 1841. We suggest that the description of an anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can be dated back as far as to the 19th century.

### Anti-NMDA encephalitis: an uncommon, autoimmune mediated form of encephalitis [^25273d8a]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We report an interesting case of a 19 year old female with findings on MRI suggestive of viral encephalitis. An extensive workup was negative for infectious causes and she was subsequently diagnosed with anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis is a highly lethal but treatable form of autoimmune encephalitis that has recently been characterized. It is frequently found in young women and associated with an underlying teratoma. Although rare, this diagnosis should be considered in young females for whom a rapid onset of encephalitis cannot be explained by more common causes.

### Comorbidities and their influence on outcomes and infectious complications in autoimmune encephalitis: a multicenter cohort study [^05a3d00f]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Comorbidities greatly influence the course of many diseases. However, systematic data on comorbidities in patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are scarce. We aimed to characterize comorbidities in patients with common AE variants and assess their influence on outcome and occurrence of infectious complications.

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective cohort study analyzed adult patients with definite anti-N-methyl — aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-leucine–rich glioma-inactivated-1 (LGI1), anti-contactin–associated protein-like-2 (CASPR2), and anti-immunoglobulin–like cell adhesion molecule-5 (IgLON5) AE registered by the GErman NEtwork for REsearch on AuToimmune Encephalitis between June 2004 and July 2023. Preexisting conditions (PECs), secondary diagnoses, and infectious complications documented during hospitalization were analyzed. Outcome was evaluated using a modified Rankin Scale (mRS), with unfavorable outcome defined as mRS > 2 after a minimum of 12 months of follow-up.

Results

Among 308 patients with AE (144 NMDAR-AE, 98 LGI1-AE, 47 CASPR2-AE, and 19 IgLON5-AE), nearly half had cardiovascular and metabolic/endocrine, one-third neurologic, and one-fifth psychiatric comorbidities. Accompanying autoimmunity was observed in 12.7%. Univariable analysis showed that the presence of ≥ 3 PECs (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.57–4.92), especially cardiovascular (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.09–3.30) and psychiatric PECs (OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.96–7.31), was associated with unfavorable outcome. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed psychiatric PECs as independent risk factors (OR 4.55, 95% CI 1.99–10.60). During hospitalization, 13.6% of patients developed severe infections, although these were not associated with unfavorable outcome (OR 1.94, 95% CI 0.97–3.89). AE disease severity (OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.38–27.67) and intensive care unit admission emerged as the only independent predictors of severe infections (OR 20.76, 95% CI 7.02–75.10).

Discussion

As premorbid psychiatric conditions are main factors associated with unfavorable outcomes, these patients would highly benefit from integrated interdisciplinary treatment centers, or at least heightened awareness of these factors. Concomitant autoimmunity affecting other organs is frequent and should be sought. The risk of severe infections during the acute phase of AE is moderate and, given their lack of effect on outcome, should not justify withholding appropriate immunotherapy, even in elderly patients with comorbidities. Future prognostic models should incorporate comorbidities, particularly psychiatric ones, to enhance risk assessment and guide personalized care strategies.

### Antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalopathies and immunotherapies [^cf48a13d]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

NMDAR Abs are usually found in serum and CSF. One study suggested serum testing alone was sufficient for diagnosis, as NMDAR Abs were not detected in the CSF of a few patients with NMDAR Ab encephalitis. However, a study of 250 individuals with NMDAR Ab encephalitis showed that NMDAR Abs, detected using 2 different assays, were present in the CSF of all patients tested, while they were absent from the serum of about 8% of these patients, and the authors recommend testing CSF for diagnosis. The main commercial assay for NMDAR Abs uses this approach but it is not clear whether the sensitivity is the same, and a multicenter study of clinically defined patients needs to be performed.

Absolute titers of NMDAR Ab are higher in serum than CSF, but if the IgG concentration in CSF is normalized to that in serum, the relative NMDAR Ab concentration in CSF is almost always higher, indicating specific intrathecal production of NMDAR Abs. This is usually taken as evidence of pathogenicity, and of the pathogenic relevance of the CSF Abs, but, in fact, the relative contributions of systemic and intrathecal NMDAR Abs to the disease pathology are difficult to assess and have not been clearly established. Notably, in some diseases [see voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC)-complex/leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) Abs], intrathecal production is much less evident.

NMDAR Ab encephalitis has now been described in all age groups, including infants and the elderly, but it remains chiefly a disease of young women, who comprise 70–100% of case series, with a median age at presentation of 21–23 years. Initially, most cases were reported to be associated with ovarian teratomas, or rarely other tumors, but as case ascertainment has increased, the proportion of tumor cases has dropped to 21–38%, largely because of the increased recognition of NMDAR Ab encephalitis in children and males, in whom tumors are much less common. Indeed, the largest cohort studied to date (577 patients) indicated that 18–41-year-old women were most at risk, and that children of both sexes aged < 12 years, or males, rarely had tumors. In older adults, the prevalence of other tumors, mostly carcinomas, increase again to around 23% of patients aged 45–84 years.

### CSF herpes virus and autoantibody profiles in the evaluation of encephalitis [^1352d2c4]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Neurologic autoimmunity may be triggered by cancer (paraneoplastic), infection (parainfectious), or it may be cryptogenic. Clinical disorders for which experimental models have been developed include anti-Yo autoimmunity, in women with cerebellar degeneration and breast or gynecologic adenocarcinoma, and ganglioside autoimmunity, in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome arising after Campylobacter infection.

Ovarian teratoma is a frequent accompaniment of paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis targeting the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDA-R). Recent studies revealed that NMDA-R antibodies frequently coexist in patients with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, and that some anti–NMDA-R encephalitis cases develop as a parainfectious autoimmune phenomenon, within weeks of HSV-1 encephalitis. Those studies confirmed suspicions that early relapse in HSV encephalitis, most notably in children, could be autoimmune. Typically, a striking biphasic illness occurs, whereby initial remission from viral encephalitis is followed by relapse with autoimmune encephalitis within 1 to 7 weeks of the initial presentation.

Other viruses from the Herpesviridae family may trigger neurologic autoimmunity, and the spectrum of antibodies encountered may extend beyond the NMDA-R. In this study, we undertook a broad evaluation of CSF specimens (CSFs) clinically referred for either herpes or autoimmune testing in order to assess the following: (1) the frequency of neural and nonneural antibodies in CSFs from patients with herpes virus PCR positivity (identified over 6 months), (2) the frequency of herpes viruses in stored CSFs from patients with autoimmune encephalitis (identified over 5 years) and controls without inflammatory or infectious neurologic disorders, and (3) incidental cases of autoimmune encephalitis in which a parainfectious cause was considered (encountered in the Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory over 1 year).

### Clinical relevance of serum antibodies to extracellular N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor epitopes [^e63457c2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

NMDAR-Abs are associated with a well-described disease that presents with psychosis, seizures, encephalopathy, cognitive impairment and movement disorders, often with CSF pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands. Although 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis' has been characterised in great detail, the range of clinical phenotypes is widening. Since 2008, the Oxford laboratory has reported NMDAR-Abs as Low Positive or Positive. Here, in order to inform the evaluation of future patients, we analysed the clinical features, antibody levels and treatment responses of the patients referred for testing from two specialist centres. We first divided the patients' conditions into four categories of Definite paraneoplastic, Definite non-paraneoplastic, Possible and Unlikely autoimmune disease based on the clinical features and any responses to immunotherapies. Although the two Definite categories (n = 25, all but 2 successfully treated with immunotherapy) contained the highest proportion (18/25, 72%) of Positive NMDAR-Abs, these were also seen in a proportion (5/18, 28%) of those in the Possible category but only in 2/13 (15%) of the Unlikely category. Conversely, Low Positive NMDAR-Abs were identified in seven of the Definite non-paraneoplastic cases and in several cases, both Definite and Possible, rose to Positive levels during the disease course. Ignoring results of sera scoring 1, as we did from 2011, would have reduced the number of Unlikely and Possible patients, including two with tumours, but also two of those designated as Definite.

### High sensitivity and specificity in proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^12b48177]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the validity of the proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis in paediatric patients.

Method

The diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDAR encephalitis proposed by Graus et al. (2016) use clinical features and conventional investigations to facilitate early immunotherapy before antibody status is available. The criteria are satisfied if patients develop four out of six symptom groups within 3 months, together with at least one abnormal investigation (electroencephalography/cerebrospinal fluid) and reasonable exclusion of other disorders. We evaluated the validity of the criteria using a retrospective cohort of paediatric patients with encephalitis. Twenty-nine patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 74 comparison children with encephalitis were included.

Results

As expected, the percentage of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who fulfilled the clinical criteria increased over time. During the hospital inpatient admission, most patients (26/29, 90%) with anti-NMDAR encephalitis fulfilled the criteria, significantly more than the comparison group (3/74, 4%) (p < 0.001). The median time of fulfilling the criteria in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was 2 weeks from first symptom onset (range 1–6). The sensitivity of the criteria was 90% (95% confidence interval 73–98) and the specificity was 96% (95% confidence interval 89–99).

Interpretation

The proposed diagnostic criteria for anti-NMDAR encephalitis have good sensitivity and specificity. Incomplete criteria do not exclude the diagnosis.

What This Paper Adds

The proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis by Graus et al. (2016) have high sensitivity and specificity in paediatric patients. The median time of fulfilling the criteria in patients with anti-NMDAR was 2 weeks from first symptom onset.

### Specific clinical and radiological characteristics of anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis following herpes encephalitis [^3be5425f]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) is the most common infectious encephalitis worldwide with an incidence of 2–4 cases per million persons per year. It is responsible for a high mortality, despite the appropriate use of intravenous acyclovir and the monitoring of severe patients in intensive care units, and for long-term sequelae in more than half of survivors. Notably, after initial improvement, 20–25% of patients subsequently harbor neurological deterioration compatible with autoimmune encephalitis (AE), associated with the detection of neuronal autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and a worse functional status during follow-up. In two-third of patients, the autoantibodies found are directed against the N -methyl — aspartate receptor (NMDAR), while they target an unknown neuronal surface antigen in the remaining cases. Of note, NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE) is a mainly idiopathic entity in which symptoms are specific and usually responsive to immunotherapy; the disease mostly occurs in young women, and one-third of them carries ovarian teratomas. In patients with HSE-NMDARE, symptoms typically occur within 3 months after HSE onset and mimic those of the regular NMDARE clinical spectrum, including behavioral changes, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and vigilance disorders. Above all, their improvement after immunomodulatory treatments demonstrates the importance of rapidly distinguishing this entity from viral sequelae or relapse.

Although HSE often triggers secondary NMDARE, there are few risk factors enabling physicians to predict HSE-NMDARE. To date, only the detection of autoantibodies in the CSF, and/or an increased blood type I interferon RNA signature are associated with a higher risk of HSE-NMDARE when performed at 21 days from HSE onset. However, since HSE is rare and HSE-NMDARE remains under-recognized, most patients do not benefit from state-of-the-art inflammatory monitoring, and parameters allowing to predict the disease remains needed.

In order to deepen knowledge and raise awareness regarding this entity, we described the clinical and radiological characteristics of patients with HSE-NMDARE diagnosed at the French Reference Center for Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndromes and Autoimmune Encephalitis (referred to below as the "French Reference Center") and compared them both to patients with HSE not followed by AE, and to patients with NMDARE not preceded by HSE.

### Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: an easily missed diagnosis in older patients [^55a4faec]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an important, treatable cause of encephalitis which remains under-recognised despite a growing body of the literature [1]. It is an immune-mediated syndrome which presents with a variety of neurological symptoms including headache, fever, personality change and seizures. Most case reports to date are of young adults, it is much less frequently reported in older adults. The syndrome has been associated with ovarian teratomas. The prognosis is good with early recognition and treatment, though may relapse. We present a case of NMDA encephalitis in an elderly patient who responded well to immunosuppressive therapy.

A, Patients with reported age at disease onset are displayed (n = 1517). Of these, sex was reported for 1497 of 1517 patients and tumor status for 1491 of 1517 patients. A total of 1160 of 1517 patients (76.5%) had an age at onset of 30 years or younger. Female sex was most pronounced among teenagers and young adults (age, 13 to 30 years; 634 of 763 [83.1%]), less pronounced in children 12 years and younger (237 of 383 [61.9%]), and reversed in adults 50 years and older (55 of 118 [46.6%]). Overall, 389 of 1524 patients (25.6%) had a tumor (ovarian teratoma or other ovarian tumor in 324 of 1524 [21.3%]), and tumors were more frequent in adults (290 of 802 [36.2%]) than children (93 of 698 [13.3%]; χ 2 = 102.4; P < .001), and in female patients (347 of 1097 [31.6%]) than male patients (33 of 395 [8.4%]; χ 2 = 82.9; P < .001).

### Seroprevalence of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in women with ovarian teratoma [^508fdc03]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Recently antibodies against neuronal receptors have been identified as cause of a new type of encephalitis. The anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDA-R) encephalitis is the prototype of these disorders. Patients have a high incidence of teratomata. Removal of teratoma is considered the essential treatment of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether neurologically asymptomatic individuals suffering from ovarian teratomata may have positive anti-NMDA-R antibodies to be detected by an established assay. Over a time period of 15 months, all patients suffering from ovarian teratomata without neurological symptoms were included in this prospective study. Twenty consecutive patients were pair matched to patients with other benign ovarian disease and healthy controls. Preoperatively, patients had a gynaecological examination, transvaginal ultrasound, neurological examination and determination of anti-NMDA-R antibodies. None of the patients or controls presented with neurological symptoms. All tumours could be removed completely by laparoscopy. Anti-NMDA-R antibodies were absent in the group of patients with teratomata as well as in patients with benign ovarian tumours and healthy controls. Testing for anti-NMDA-R antibodies revealed negative findings in well-characterised patients with ovarian teratomata lacking neurological symptoms. Our data support the current clinical practice that a systematic screening for anti-NMDA-R antibodies in teratoma patients is not indicated.

### CSF IgA NMDAR antibodies are potential biomarkers for teratomas in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^705f0670]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Detection of CSF IgA-NMDA-Abs and associated clinical presentation.

The cohort of 94 IgG-NMDAR-Ab encephalitis patients (median age 19 years, range 1–76) with available CSF comprised 25 children (median age 6 years, range 1–12; 17 girls and 8 boys), 61 female participants (median age 21 years, range 14–48), and 8 men (median age 33 years, range 22–76). The CSF samples obtained from these 94 individuals showed that 39 individuals (41%) were positive for IgA-NMDAR-Abs (figure 1). Among the 39 IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive patients, 30 patients were adult women, 3 patients were adult men, and 6 patients were children (age < 12 years; 4 girls and 2 boys). We compared the 39 IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive patients with the 55 IgA-NMDAR-Ab-negative patients identified in the cohort (table). The median age, sex ratio, and percentage with Caucasian origin were similar in both groups. The children tended to be underrepresented in the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive group (15% vs 34% in the IgA-NMDAR-Ab-negative group, without reaching significance after Bonferroni adjustment). The incidences of prodromal signs and the first symptoms were similar in both groups. The complete clinical pattern was also similar in both groups. The incidence of abnormalities in ancillary tests (MRI, EEG, and CSF) and the clinical severity (mRS at onset, ICU admission, death) were similar in both populations. Ninety-one patients (39 IgA-NMDAR-Ab-positive and 52 IgA-NMDAR-Ab-negative individuals) had a follow-up (median 24 months, range 3–24). The global progression and recovery were similar in the groups (figure 2). In multivariable analysis, no effect of the CSF IgA-NMDAR-Ab status on the time to recovery was identified.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a recently described paraneoplastic syndrome with prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms. We report a case of NMDA receptor encephalitis in a 15-year-old female related to the development of NMDA receptor autoantibodies triggered by an ovarian teratoma. Removal of the mature teratoma proved curative with eventual resolution of the paraneoplastic disease process and associated psychiatric symptoms. Increasingly, reports of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratomas in pediatric patients, as well as a novel assay to measure these antibodies, suggest an etiology for this disease process that may be amenable to prompt surgical excision. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management of the disease, as well as a review of the literature, are included.

### Autoimmune encephalitis at the neurological intensive care unit: etiologies, reasons for admission and survival [^d86ab7f6]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

As described in the literature, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically affects female patients prior to the age of 30 years and is frequently accompanied by ovarian teratoma. Accordingly, this was also the case in four of the five study patients diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in our cohort. In all except one of these patients, teratoma was subsequently detected during the hospital stay. Notably, the only patient with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis without cancer diagnosis died.

Although patients with encephalitis associated with cell surface antibodies have been shown to have a more favorable outcome compared to subjects with AE and intracellular antibodies, both deceased patients with "definite" autoimmune diagnosis in our series had anti-neuronal antibodies to cell surface. In both cases, death occurred only after hospital discharge.

Important limitations need to be considered when analyzing the results of our study. First, the retrospective study design provides lower diagnostic accuracy, and the relatively small sample size limits the generalizability of our findings. However, our results were comparable to the aforementioned series in most aspects. Secondly, we acknowledge that the number of AE patients with specific neuronal antibodies might be underrepresented as a systematic retesting, and re-evaluation of both serum and CSF was inconsistent. Moreover, patients with intracellular antigens may be low for the reason of management by oncologists. Finally, our study did not include patients younger than 18 years, while in one patient there were anamnestic hints pointing at earlier onset of AE. Therefore, we might have missed AE subtypes that more frequently occur in children. Concededly, studies with larger catchment area including other (medical, pediatric, etc.) ICU facilities would further complement our findings.

Our study suggests that clinical presentations and reasons for intensive care admission in critically ill AE patients are diverse, and the underlying conditions are dominated by status epilepticus. The association of comorbidity, malignancy, and the need for mechanical ventilation with adverse outcome should be considered in clinical practice and deserves further investigation in prospective studies. Further studies should also take the functional and cognitive status as outcome measure into account.

### Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis: an adolescent with an ovarian teratoma [^feb1ba63]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis has been reported to be associated with ovarian teratomas. In many patients, surgical excision has resulted in improvement.

Case

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented with confusion which later evolved into a comatose state. Imaging revealed an adnexal mass which was surgically removed and confirmed to be a mature teratoma. Her cerebral spinal fluid was positive for antibodies to NR1/NR2 heteromers of NMDA receptors.

Comments

Cystic teratomas are one of the most common benign ovarian lesions in children and young women. While an association of ovarian teratomas and paraneoplastic encephalitis is published in the neurologic literature, this association needs to be clarified for the practicing gynecologist who may be asked to consult on these patients.

### Comment: infection antedating autoimmunity – shared mechanisms in the brain? [^1adf7553]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a well-recognized immunotherapy-responsive condition, often diagnosed in younger individuals with characteristic clinical symptoms. In women, ovarian teratomas are frequently found and thought to trigger the antibody response against the NMDAR by ectopically expressing neuronal antigens. The present study describes the case of a patient with HSV encephalitis (HSVE) who develops a second episode of neurologic abnormalities, which is in fact NMDAR encephalitis.(1.)

### Ovarian teratoma associated with anti-NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate) receptor encephalitis [^2d1d9cee]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Anti-N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a paraneoplastic, immune-mediated encephalopathy with a known association with ovarian teratomas. We present the first case in the UK of a 7-year-old patient presenting with this condition. Having been previously fit and healthy, the patient presented with an acute onset of cognitive disturbances. The initial suspicion was that of an infective encephalopathy; however, the lumbar puncture results were negative. Electroencephalography reported diffuse background slowing, supporting a diagnosis of encephalopathy. Extensive autoimmune screening was done and found to be positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies. A whole body MRI found a right adnexal lesion consistent with ovarian teratoma. At laparoscopy, the right ovary was excised and histology confirmed a mature cystic teratoma with neural tissue. There were no postoperative complications with the patient's neurology recovering progressively at follow-up.

### Case report: anaesthetic management of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer associated with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^dac86477]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this case report, we present successful anaesthetic management of radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and highlight specific aspects of anaesthetic management for this rare type of encephalitis. For patients with this encephalitis, NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, nitrous oxide and tramadol, should be avoided, whereas benzodiazepines, opioids, muscle relaxants and curares, which have been demonstrated to have no significant effects on the NMDA pathway, are preferred. Medications that have indirect interactions with NMDARs can be considered but should be used with caution. Finally, adequate preparation, including ensuring the availability of vasoactive agents and monitoring throughout the perioperative period, particularly after surgery, is of vital importance.

There is scarce literature to date describing anaesthetic management for patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and further investigations are necessary to develop detailed guidelines for anaesthesiologists to assess surgery-related risk factors of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and to develop a stable perioperative anaesthetic plan for patients with this condition.

### Anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma: a case series and literature review [^56f3199f]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a group of disorders characterized by symptoms of dysfunction of the limbic and extra-limbic systems that occur in association with antibodies against intracellular antigens, synapses, or proteins located on the surface of nerve cells. Anti-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor encephalitis was first described in 2007 and has become one of the most commonly recognized autoimmune encephalitides. The disease is predominantly female (81%) and affects young patients (37% < 18years old, 95% < 45years old), with up to 58% of women over 18years old having ovarian teratoma. Clinical symptoms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis include psychiatric disorders (anxiety, agitation, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, delusions, and memory impairment); seizures and epileptic states; and other neurologic symptoms (muscle tone abnormalities, eye movement disorders, and central ventilatory disorders). Diagnosis of this condition can be difficult due to the non-specific nature of the symptoms, often leading to delays in appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, especially in young women with ovarian teratoma, has significantly improved the chances of full recovery and improved reproductive health outcomes for patients.

### Autoimmune encephalitis: clinical spectrum and management [^88622a3e]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune encephalitis comprises a group of disorders in which the host immune system targets self-antigens expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Some of the best-characterised diseases are associated with autoantibodies that target neuroglial antigens (table 1). These autoantibodies are considered pathogenic because they are directed against the extracellular — and hence in vivo exposed — domains of their target antigens. This fundamental property has led to much interest and excitement surrounding this rapidly expanding field, with new autoantibody targets described most years. Many established antigens are key synaptic proteins, ion channels or receptors, meaning that the extracellular domain-targeting autoantibodies are likely to directly modulate critical physiological processes.

Table 1
Demographic, clinical and paraclinical features of neuronal autoantibody syndromes

This field is of major clinical importance to all neurologists because these patients present with a wide variety of neurological features and typically respond to immunotherapies. Therefore, these conditions are often considered 'not to miss' diagnoses, with defined pathogenic agents that can present to cognitive, movement disorder, epilepsy, psychiatry and peripheral nerve clinics.

In this pragmatic review, which reflects our experience of managing > 200 cases with surface-directed autoantibodies, we highlight key clinical features to help identify these patients, outline immunological findings that inform laboratory testing and describe the clinically relevant disease biology of relevance to treatment decisions.

Autoimmune encephalitis is not rare

Until the discovery of neuroglial surface autoantibodies, infections were the most common known causes of encephalitis. However, over the last 20 years, the description of multiple autoantibodies targeting the extracellular domains of neuroglial proteins in patients with encephalitis has shifted this balance. For example, the California Encephalitis Project found that among persons under 30 years of age, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis was more common than any individual infectious cause of encephalitis. Also, autoimmune causes of encephalitis have been reported to be at least as common as viral causes in Olmsted County, USA. Interestingly, the incidence of autoimmune encephalitis rose in the second 10-year epoch of this study, likely owing to growing awareness of these disorders and more widespread diagnostic capacities. Nevertheless, as fever, focal neurological deficits and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis remain inclusion criteria for many 'all cause encephalitis' studies, such approaches likely continue to underestimate the prevalence of autoimmune causes, which often lack these features. In future, we predict that unbiased surveys in patients with encephalitis will show that the growing range of autoimmune causes significantly exceed those of infectious causes in developed countries.

### Non-tumor-associated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis in Chinese girls with positive anti-thyroid antibodies [^5222acc1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a new category of autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. The disease was first described in 2007, and it predominantly affects young women with or without ovarian teratomas. Most patients typically present with seizures, a decreased consciousness level, dyskinesia, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms. The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies in non-tumor-associated anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was first described in 2010. Additionally, anti-thyroid antibodies were found in teratoma-associated anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. We report the cases of 3 Chinese girls with non-tumor-associated anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with positive anti-thyroid antibodies. We followed up the details of their titers and suggest that anti-thyroid antibodies were an indicator of autoimmune predisposition in the development of non-tumor-associated anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis mimicking a primary psychiatric disorder in an adolescent [^b42e5fee]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (anti-NMDA) receptor encephalitis likely has a wider clinical spectrum than previously recognized. This article reports a previously healthy 16-year-old girl who was diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis 3 months after onset of severe depression with psychotic features. She had no neurological manifestations, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was normal. Slow background on electroencephalogram and an oligoclonal band in the cerebrospinal fluid prompted the search for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. She markedly improved over time but remained with mild neuropsychological sequelae after a trial of late immunotherapy. Only a high index of suspicion enables recognition of the milder forms of the disease masquerading as primary psychiatric disorders.

### Anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma: a case series and literature review [^6122d74a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Pathogenesis

The series of nine cases of NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma treated at Bach Mai Hospital and followed up from December 2016 to December 2023. This is an autoimmune disease characterized by symptoms of limbic and extra‐limbic dysfunction occurring in association with antibodies against synaptic or neuronal surface proteins. The pathogenesis of NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma is still not fully understood. Hypotheses suggest that anti‐NMDA receptor antibodies are associated with the presence of tumors, mainly ovarian teratomas, when the immune system attacks NMDA antigens present in tumor cells, and these antigens are also exposed on the surface of nerve cells. These antibodies cross the blood–brain barrier to damage brain parenchyma causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. The average age of onset is 19, mainly in women of reproductive age. Similar to other studies, only female patients were included due to the association with ovarian teratoma in the present study.

4.2 Symptoms and diagnosis

The most common presenting symptoms are fever (44%) and headache (67%), which are higher than those reported by Li et al. in 2022 (fever in 19%; headache in 26.4%). Other common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. These nonspecific symptoms are similar to those of viral infections and can lead to misdiagnosis in the early stages with other cases of meningitis or other neuroinfections.

The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms were behavioral and cognitive disorders (89% of patients). This rate was higher than that reported in other large‐scale studies (68% in the study by Titulaer et al. in 2013 and 23% in the study by Li et al. in 2022). Within 1 month of disease onset, 78% of patients had four or more symptom clusters, including behavioral and cognitive disorders; memory; speech; seizures; movement disorders; loss of consciousness; autonomic nervous system disorders; and central hypoventilation, similar to the observation by Li et al. that 50% of patients had 3–5 of these symptom clusters. Of these, 56% of patients had severe neurologic symptoms requiring ICU treatment, compared to 71% in another study.

### The differential expression and potential roles of circular RNAs in children with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis [^4dcbcc6b]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Medium credibility.

To explore the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in pediatric anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, we assessed the profiles of circRNAs and mRNAs in blood leukocytes from anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis patients and healthy controls using microarray analysis. 1196 circRNAs and 719 mRNAs (change ≥ 2, p < .05) were dysregulated in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis patients, relative to healthy controls, based on microarray data. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the host genes of dysregulated circRNAs are primarily associated with receptor internalization. In conclusion, circRNAs may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pediatric anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.

### Anti-NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma: a case series and literature review [^018ac152]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma is a complex clinical syndrome. This disorder is relatively rare and can cause a variety of severe neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, but most patients respond well to treatment with immunotherapy combined with ovarian tumor removal.

The treatment of anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving neurologists, obstetricians and gynecologists, oncologists, psychiatrists, and so on. Prognostic factors for good treatment outcomes include mild symptoms at onset and timely and appropriate treatment. There is limited information on the long‐term reproductive function of patients after treatment, and future prospective studies are needed to better understand the potential interaction between pregnancy and anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis.

### Diagnostic yield of anti-neuronal antibody testing in patients suspected of an infectious encephalitis [^3cffb82d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Acute encephalitis is a severe neurological disorder defined as inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The estimated incidence in high‐income countries is 5–10 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Presenting symptoms are generally an acute onset of fever, altered mental status, new onset of focal neurological symptoms, and generalized or focal seizures. The mortality rate, which exhibits significant variability across studies and pathogens, ranges between 5% and 20%. At least half of the surviving patients have neurological or cognitive deficits. Causes of encephalitis can be diverse, including viral, bacterial, and autoimmune diseases. Despite the advantages of rapid diagnostics and treatment on outcome, this range of potential causes poses significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment.

Over the last 35 years, novel diagnostic methods have increased the proportion of encephalitis patients with an identified etiology. In the past 15 years, multiple new autoantibodies have been identified, leading to newly defined syndromes such as anti‐NMDA‐receptor encephalitis, anti‐LG1 encephalitis, and many more. Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is increasingly a diagnostic consideration in patients with subacute onset of memory loss, altered mental status, and/or psychiatric symptoms. It is now estimated that 30%–40% of cases with encephalitis have an AIE, although this frequency may be an underestimation. As the presentation can be insidious, a lack of typical radiological or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities could lead to undiagnosed or misdiagnosed cases of AIE. In addition, a substantial number of patients with suspected AIE do not have detectable antibodies despite strong evidence of an immune‐mediated disorder, such as suggestive MRI or inflammatory CSF findings. Achieving a timely and accurate diagnosis of AIE is critical to improving patient outcomes and preventing long‐term disability. Delayed or missed diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatments that do not address the underlying autoimmune process. Clinical diagnostic criteria have been developed for diagnosing AIE in suspected patients, thereby providing guidance to clinicians in their diagnostic approach.

In this study, we investigated the yield of comprehensive diagnostic testing for anti‐neuronal antibodies in episodes of suspected encephalitis, where no obvious infectious, inflammatory, or alternative cause was found during hospitalization. Furthermore, we used the AIE diagnostic criteria to assess the included episodes retrospectively and compare them with the results of anti‐neuronal antibody testing.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^d38e8fa0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea — etiological investigations: In a child with suspected SC, the investigations carried out should mainly aim at demonstrating a preceding streptococcal infection, actively assessing for the presence of other manifestations of RF and ruling out differential diagnoses; neuroimaging should be considered in children with new-onset chorea, depending on the level of confidence of SC diagnosis and risk stratification; if neuroimaging is indicated, MRI is the modality of choice and brain CT may be considered in case of unavailability of brain MRI; although abnormalities may be demonstrable by SPECT or PET in children with SC, these are not routinely recommended in all patients; and at the first presentation of SC, the following investigations have a low utility in the evaluation of children with suspected SC, although in specific circumstances they may be useful for ruling out differential diagnoses, especially in case of features atypical for SC: electroencephalography unless seizures or encephalitis are suspected as a differential diagnosis, lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis unless encephalitis is a primary concern (ie, NMDAR encephalitis), and anti-basal ganglia antibodies.

### Frequency and characteristics of isolated psychiatric episodes in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^268fa6c7]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Patients with anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis often develop prominent psychiatric manifestations. The frequency and type of isolated psychiatric episodes (pure psychiatric symptoms without neurological involvement) either as initial presentation of the disease or as relapse are unknown.

Objective

To determine the frequency, symptoms, and outcome of isolated psychiatric episodes in a cohort of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational cohort of patients diagnosed during a5-year period (median follow-up, 2 years). A total of 571 patients with IgG antibodies against the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR were included in the study. Antibody studies were performed at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Barcelona, and clinical information was obtained by us or referring physicians.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Frequency, type of symptoms, and outcome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis and isolated psychiatric manifestations.

Results

Of 571 patients, 23 (4%) developed isolated psychiatric episodes, 5 at disease onset and 18 during relapse. For all 23 patients, age (median, 20 years), sex (91%female), and tumor association (43%; ovarian teratoma in all cases) were similar to the population at large. Predominant symptoms included delusional thinking (74%), mood disturbances (70%, usually manic), and aggression (57%). Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 10 of 22 patients (45%) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis in 17 of 22 patients (77%). Eighty-three percent of the patients had full or substantial recovery after immunotherapy and tumor resection when appropriate. After relapse, 17 of 18 patients(94%) returned to a similar or better prerelapse functional level.

Conclusions and Relevance

Isolated psychiatric episodes are rare but can occur as initial onset or relapse of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Recognition of these episodes is important because they respond to immunotherapy. In patients with new-onset psychosis, having a history of encephalitis, subtle neurological symptoms, and/or abnormal results on ancillary tests should prompt screening for NMDAR antibodies.

### Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis as an unusual cause of altered mental status in the emergency department [^34f9c123]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune encephalitis is a newly identified form of encephalitis whose incidence is on the rise. Awareness of this condition and symptom recognition are key to early diagnosis and prompt treatment, which may alter the course of the disease.

Case Report

A 35-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with lethargy, bizarre behavior, agitation, confusion, memory deficits, and word-finding difficulties. Her symptoms and evaluation were potentially consistent with a primary psychiatric disorder, but the absence of frank psychosis and presence of neurologic features related to memory and cognition prompted other considerations. In the ED we performed a lumbar puncture, and in addition to routine studies, ordered anti-NMDAR antibody screening. The screening studies returned positive, leading to treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulin and resulting in improvement to near baseline function. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although anti-NMDAR encephalitis is relatively uncommon, reports of this previously unrecognized condition are increasing, with an unclear true incidence of disease. Emergency providers should consider this diagnosis in their differential for patients presenting with new neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly in young women. Prompt treatment leads to near complete neurologic recovery in 75% of patients, whereas delays in diagnosis and treatment may be associated with worse outcomes including death.

### Decreased occipital lobe metabolism by FDG-PET / CT: an anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis biomarker [^8a074ec8]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis was described over a decade ago among women presenting with prodromal symptoms followed by the development of behavioral changes, hallucinations, memory deficits, seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and central hypoventilation, many of whom were found to have ovarian teratoma. Recent consensus criteria have emphasized the importance of recognizing the clinical presentation of anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis, incorporating MRI, EEG, and CSF analysis results.

Included in original descriptions of anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET has been recognized as a potentially useful biomarker in the initial evaluation and subsequent monitoring of patients with suspected autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and is included in consensus criteria for definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis (LE), but not other forms of AE such as anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis. This in part is due to the uncertainty of the specificity and practicality of FDG-PET in the evaluation of AE in general and of particular forms of AE, such as anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis. A gradient of anterior hypermetabolism to posterior cortical hypometabolism has been noted in anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis, although the specificity of this finding relative to other forms of AE is uncertain. In addition, isolated hypometabolism and hypermetabolism by FDG-PET have been reported in anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis. When noted, the gradient of anterior hypermetabolism to posterior hypometabolism has been reported to resolve with improvement in patient functional status, but prior descriptions of these changes have been primarily qualitative rather than quantitative.

We sought to semiquantitatively describe findings from dedicated brain FDG-PET/CT studies in patients with anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis compared with others with definite AE in the acute phase of illness. In addition, we sought to describe patterns of brain region metabolism in patients with anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis with differing degrees of neurologic disability.

### The utility of anti-SOX2 antibodies for cancer prediction in patients with paraneoplastic neurological disorders [^181b2f7b]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Paraneoplastic neurological disorders (PNDs) are a diverse group of conditions in which distant tumour effects are thought to underlie the neurological presentation. These effects are generally thought to be due to an immune-mediated process with cell-mediated and humoral components. In a Europe-wide review, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) was the commonest associated tumour in patients with PNDs, (present in over a third of cases), with non-small-cell lung cancer, thymoma, lymphoma, ovarian and breast cancer found in a further 37%.

Many PNDs are associated with specific onconeural antibodies against intracellular antigens (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2 (CRMP5), amphiphysin, Ma2), but there is considerable diversity such that no single antibody is associated with only one type of neurological presentation or underlying tumour. For example, anti-Hu antibodies are found in patients presenting with a range of PNDs such as subacute sensory neuronopathy (SSN), limbic encephalitis (LE), paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), but also in patients with LEMS where the presence of Hu antibodies may be a marker of an underlying small-cell lung tumour. In addition, although patients with particular paraneoplastic neurological phenotypes often develop specific tumours (e.g. SCLC found in over 90% of paraneoplastic LEMS and ovarian teratoma in over 90% of patients with anti-NMDA-R encephalitis), this is not always the case and some PND presentations can be associated with a number of different cancers (e.g. LE seen with tumours of the lung, testis, and breast, and also with Hodgkin's lymphoma, teratoma, or thymoma).

### Clinical relevance of serum antibodies to extracellular N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor epitopes [^1f6efccc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There are now a large number of requests for N -methyl — aspartate receptor autoantibody (NMDAR-Ab) tests, and it is important to assess the clinical relevance of all results, particularly when they are reported as 'Low Positive'.

Methods

The clinical data of 56 patients found Positive or Low Positive by the Oxford live cell-based assay were reviewed. An autoimmune basis for the condition was assigned as 'Definite', 'Possible' or 'Unlikely'. The number of core features (encephalopathy, psychiatric, cognitive, epileptic, extrapyramidal and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) was tabulated.

Results

Twenty-five (44.6%) patients had a Definite NMDAR-Ab encephalitis (eight ovarian teratomas, one Hodgkin's lymphoma), 18 (32.1%) a Possible NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and 13 (23.2%) an Unlikely autoimmune syndrome. Serum NMDAR-Ab levels were higher in patients with tumours. Positive NMDAR-Abs were found not only in patients with three or more core features and a Definite syndrome, but also in five patients classified as Possible. Conversely, Low Positive NMDAR-Abs were present in 7 Definite cases as well as in 13 Possible cases. Unlikely patients had mainly Low Positive antibodies and fewer core features. CSF NMDAR-Abs, only available in 11 pairs and at varying time points, broadly related to serum levels and were Positive in 3/3 patients with tumours but in only 2/5 Definite patients, and none of the Possible or Unlikely cases.

Interpretation

Using live cell-based assays, Positive and Low Positive antibodies can be of clinical significance. The number of core clinical features should help to select those patients in whom an immunotherapy intervention might be considered, irrespective of the antibody level.

### Critical care management of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^f300841d]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is considered an immune-mediated form of encephalitis with paraneoplastic and nonparaneoplastic forms. Delay in recognition is common and patients typically present to the ICU without a diagnosis or with complications following a delayed diagnosis. The aim of this review is to provide a focused overview for the ICU clinician regarding presentation, diagnosis, and critical care management.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

PubMed database search with manual review of articles involving anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.

Data Synthesis

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is increasingly encountered in the ICU. The cascade of events initiating anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody formation may involve an infectious trigger particularly in the setting of teratoma. Following a prodrome, most patients develop psychiatric symptoms followed by movement disorder. Classical, psychiatric, and catatonic phenotypes may be distinguished based on the presence and severity of symptoms. Early immunotherapy and low initial cerebrospinal fluid inflammation are independent predictors of positive outcomes in ICU patients. Concomitant organ failure, status epilepticus, and the identification of a tumor did not influence outcome in critically ill patients. Supportive care in the ICU includes management of various manifestations of dyskinesia, status epilepticus, autonomic disorders, and the need for general sedation. Common treatment strategies and limitations are discussed including the emerging role of bortezomib.

Conclusions

Intensivists should be familiar with the presentation and management of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Early diagnosis and immediate implementation of steroids, immunoglobulins, and/or plasmapheresis and immune therapy are associated with a good neurologic outcome although response may be delayed. The selection and timing of second-line immune therapy requires further study.

### Longitudinal measurement of cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis [^aec5e12e]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first description of patients with anti‐NMDARE with longitudinal follow‐up (median 29 months) simultaneously assessing NfL and anti‐NMDAR antibodies in the CSF. Similar to previous findings, anti‐NMDAR antibodies are detected in the CSF with higher sensitivity than in serum, and the CSF titer was shown to predict relapses more reliable than serum antibodies [2, 12]. For this reason, we chose to correlate CSF antibodies with CSF‐Nfl levels to avoid interference of Nfl levels by peripheral neurological comorbidities. NfL are emerging biomarkers especially in inflammatory central nervous system disorders; however, their value in anti‐NMDARE is still unclear. In our study, we made several interesting observations: (i) Although in all cases early treatment was initiated, CSF‐NfL peaked with delay in most cases within the first 6 months after disease onset, and in most cases, CSF antibody maximum titers preceded NfL peak levels. (ii) All patients with EDB detected prior to LP had significantly increased CSF‐NfL levels (> 2.500 pg/ml) and at least 10‐fold higher levels than patients without EDB. (iii) A clear relationship between CSF‐NfL levels and clinical course or anti‐NMDAR antibody titer could not be observed, and clinical nadir was reached before CSF‐NfL levels peaked. (iv) MRI hippocampal atrophy was seen in half of the patients and in 75% of patients with CSF‐NfL levels above 2.500 pg/ml. In two patients, CSF‐NfL peak was associated with hippocampal atrophy rather than hippocampal T2 signal alteration in MRI, which is contradictory to previous findings [19] (v) Reduction of inflammatory markers in CSF (cell count and intrathecal IgG synthesis) preceded CSF‐NfL peaks. (vi) Detection of teratoma did not seem to influence CSF‐NfL levels. In an earlier small study, a correlation between serum‐NfL and clinical course was found; however, we could not confirm this observation [20]. Otherwise, our results are in line with an anti‐NMDARE case report showing by repetitive measures that CSF‐NfL levels peak 4 months after symptom onset, far beyond anti‐NMDAR antibody maximum titers[21]. Given the fact that released NfL reflect neuroaxonal damage, our data support the assumption that severe axonal damage in anti‐NMDARE is not caused primarily by immune‐mediated mechanisms including anti‐NMDAR antibodies, but rather is related to epileptic seizures and intensive care treatment (days onset to ICU range 10–28), the latter being also a negative predictor of outcome[4]. EDB occurred several weeks before CSF‐NfL peak levels and may thus have influenced NfL levels prior to maximum. Delayed neuroaxonal injury, as mirrored by delayed detection of CSF‐NfL levels, may be due to synaptic degeneration. Limitations of our study that need to be noted are the small sample size, the retrospective analysis, and the arbitrarily chosen LP intervals according to clinical assessment. Hence, we were not able to rule out status epilepticus or epileptic seizures as possibly confounding factors and potential cause for elevated CSF‐NfL levels. Nevertheless, we could not observe epileptic seizures confirmed clinically or by EEG timely linked to the NfL apex.
