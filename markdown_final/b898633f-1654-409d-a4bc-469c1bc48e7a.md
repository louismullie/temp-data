What does it mean when a 46-year-old man is belching acidic liquid instead of air?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means when a 46-year-old man is belching acidic liquid instead of air. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the symptom terminology because "belching acidic liquid" likely represents regurgitation rather than true belching. Then, I should weigh the key differentials, primarily GERD versus rumination syndrome, while keeping mimics like achalasia in mind. Next, I will outline the pivotal historical discriminators and an initial empiric therapy approach. After that, I need to specify the objective testing algorithm if symptoms persist or are atypical. Finally, I will consider pathophysiology to guide management, including behavioral therapy for rumination, pharmacologic options, and when to escalate to reflux testing or surgery, ensuring I verify each step against current guidelines and consensus statements [^1146hUfd] [^114cCD18] [^113rMCXs].

> Let me first confirm the terminology because precision here steers the whole workup; regurgitation is the effortless return of sour or bitter gastric contents into the mouth, whereas belching is expulsion of gas, so "belching acidic liquid" is more consistent with regurgitation than simple belching, and I should not conflate the two without verification [^1146hUfd] [^112dscPR].

> Wait, let me verify the core differential before jumping to testing; GERD is the leading cause of regurgitation and is classically responsive to PPIs, but the Lyon 2.0 consensus emphasizes that regurgitation often persists despite acid suppression due to weakly acidic or nonacid reflux, while rumination syndrome presents with repetitive, effortless postprandial regurgitation of recently ingested food via a learned abdominothoracic maneuver, typically absent during sleep and frequently misdiagnosed as refractory GERD [^1146hUfd] [^1155sZnY] [^115H3d5F].

> Hold on, I should verify the historical discriminators that best separate these entities; timing within or up to two hours after meals with no nocturnal episodes and recognizable food favors rumination, whereas nocturnal regurgitation and sour taste favor GERD, and a poor response to an adequate 8‑week PPI trial should prompt reconsideration of rumination, reflux hypersensitivity, or other motility disorders, with the AGA advising that nocturnal regurgitation makes rumination less likely [^113rMCXs] [^114cCD18] [^1146hUfd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost forgot to screen for look-alikes; if there is dysphagia to solids and liquids or recurrent regurgitation unresponsive to PPIs, I should consider achalasia and other major motility disorders, ensuring they are not missed before labeling symptoms as refractory GERD or rumination, as recommended by ACG achalasia guidelines and reflux guidelines that also advise excluding cardiac causes in chest pain presentations [^116qiid3] [^116eAsZN] [^114cCD18].

> I should confirm the appropriate initial approach; in the absence of alarm features, an empiric once‑daily PPI trial for 8 weeks with lifestyle measures such as weight loss when appropriate, avoiding late meals, and head-of-bed elevation is guideline‑concordant, but I need to remember that persistent regurgitation on PPIs does not rule out reflux and often reflects weakly acid or nonacid events, so symptom reassessment after this trial is essential before escalating testing [^114cCD18] [^1158WG2M] [^1146hUfd].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm if symptoms are refractory or atypical; if classic GERD symptoms fail an adequate PPI trial or relapse off therapy, upper endoscopy off PPIs for 2–4 weeks is recommended to assess for erosive esophagitis, strictures, or alternative pathology, recognizing that a normal endoscopy does not exclude GERD and that further reflux monitoring may be needed [^114cCD18].

> Let me now examine the reflux testing sequence; ambulatory pH‑impedance monitoring off PPIs for 2–4 weeks helps determine acid versus weakly acid reflux burden and symptom association, and postprandial high‑resolution manometry with impedance after a test meal is the gold standard to objectively diagnose rumination when the history is suggestive but uncertain, with BSG guidance supporting this approach and diary documentation during monitoring to strengthen interpretation [^1146hUfd] [^116RhS4t] [^1153vhGk].

> I need to ensure my pathophysiologic framing is correct; GERD is driven by transient LES relaxations, hypotensive EGJ, impaired clearance, and sometimes hiatal hernia, while rumination reflects a learned abdominothoracic pressurization that reverses the esophagogastric gradient, and pH‑impedance clarifies that persistent regurgitation on PPI often relates to weakly acid or nonacid reflux rather than ongoing acid exposure, which importantly reframes therapy choices [^1158WG2M] [^1155sZnY] [^111uAAsx].

> Let me reconsider medical management if GERD is likely; optimize PPI timing and adherence, consider twice‑daily dosing if partial response, reinforce lifestyle measures, and if objective testing confirms pathologic reflux with persistent regurgitation, antireflux surgery can be considered in selected patients, recognizing that fundoplication reduces acid and weakly acidic reflux but may alter belching dynamics, which I should counsel about in advance [^114cCD18] [^115YPYSm].

> I should double‑check the evidence‑based approach for suspected rumination; first‑line therapy is diaphragmatic breathing with biofeedback, which in randomized trials yields substantial reductions in rumination events, and baclofen 10 mg three times daily can reduce events via TLESR suppression in selected patients, with patient education and reassurance being crucial to success and often sufficient to avoid unnecessary acid escalation [^115H3d5F] [^114SR4nd] [^116RhS4t].

> But wait, what if symptoms still defy categorization; ambulatory 24‑hour manometry combined with pH‑impedance can map temporal relationships among pressure patterns, reflux, and symptoms, identify coexisting supragastric belching or behavioral phenotypes, and guide non‑GERD behavioral interventions when appropriate, aligning with Lyon and expert reviews that stress excluding behavioral mimics before escalating antireflux therapy [^116q8FgH] [^111avmrf] [^1146hUfd].

> In summary for this 46‑year‑old, I initially thought "belching" implied gas expulsion, but the description of acidic liquid makes regurgitation more likely, so GERD remains the leading diagnosis; however, if episodes are predominantly postprandial without nocturnal symptoms and persist despite an adequate PPI trial, rumination syndrome should be strongly suspected, prompting targeted diaphragmatic breathing and, if needed, postprandial HRM‑impedance for confirmation, while refractory or atypical presentations should trigger endoscopy off PPIs and pH‑impedance monitoring to phenotype reflux and direct therapy [^1146hUfd] [^114cCD18] [^115H3d5F].

Belching liquid acid in a 46-year-old male most likely reflects **GERD with regurgitation** [^1146hUfd] or **rumination syndrome** [^1155sZnY], and less commonly achalasia or other motility disorders [^116qiid3] [^1146hUfd]. Key risks include **esophagitis, Barrett's, and aspiration** [^114cCD18] [^116VC8bw] [^115KM5vq]. Evaluate with upper endoscopy, pH-impedance monitoring, and high-resolution manometry [^114cCD18] [^1146JBGq]; treat with PPIs, lifestyle changes, and diaphragmatic breathing for rumination [^113rMCXs] [^1155sZnY], reserving surgery for refractory cases [^114cCD18].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

- **Mechanism**: Transient LES relaxations, reduced LES pressure, hiatal hernia, impaired clearance, and delayed gastric emptying drive reflux [^1146hUfd] [^1158WG2M].
- **Regurgitation**: Effortless return of sour/bitter gastric contents to the mouth, often incompletely responsive to acid suppression [^1146hUfd] [^111uAAsx].
- **Complications**: Esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's, and aspiration risk [^1146hUfd] [^114cCD18] [^116VC8bw].

---

### Rumination syndrome

- **Mechanism**: Subconscious abdominal wall contraction with low EGJ pressure reverses the gradient, causing postprandial regurgitation [^1155sZnY] [^116RhS4t].
- **Triggers**: Dyspeptic symptoms, GERD, and supragastric belching can provoke or worsen episodes [^1155sZnY] [^111Ycw2D].
- **Complications**: Dental erosion, malnutrition, and aspiration risk [^1155sZnY] [^114TgfZ6] [^115KM5vq].

---

### Esophageal motility disorders

Among esophageal motility disorders, **achalasia** [^116qiid3] is characterized by impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis, leading to stasis and regurgitation [^112asZyF], whereas **IEM** has weak peristalsis that impairs clearance and increases reflux and regurgitation [^1146hUfd].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

### Clinical history and physical examination

History should characterize **frequency, timing, triggers, and associated symptoms** (heartburn, dysphagia, weight loss, respiratory symptoms) [^114dCSRZ], while the **exam** assesses for **dental erosion, weight loss, and respiratory signs of aspiration** [^114cCD18].

---

### Diagnostic tests

| **Diagnostic test** | **Indication** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Upper endoscopy (EGD) | Alarm symptoms or refractory GERD | Esophagitis, Barrett's, strictures, malignancy [^114cCD18] [^116VC8bw] |
| pH-impedance monitoring | Quantify acid/non-acid reflux; symptom correlation | Reflux burden, symptom association [^1146hUfd] [^111avmrf] [^1146JBGq] |
| High-resolution manometry (HRM) | Suspected motility disorder or rumination | LES dysfunction, peristalsis, rumination pattern [^1155sZnY] [^116RhS4t] [^114Nwzo8] |
| Barium esophagram | Structural evaluation if endoscopy unavailable | Strictures, rings, hiatal hernia [^111qABDy] |

---

## Potential complications

- **Esophageal injury**: Esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's, and malignancy risk [^1146hUfd] [^114cCD18] [^116VC8bw].
- **Aspiration**: Pneumonia and chronic cough [^1146hUfd] [^115KM5vq].
- **Dental erosion**: From repeated acid exposure [^1155sZnY] [^115KM5vq] [^114TgfZ6].
- **Nutritional impact**: Weight loss and malnutrition [^1155sZnY].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

PPIs are **first-line** for acid suppression and mucosal healing. Consider **prokinetics** when delayed gastric emptying or motility disorders are present. Lifestyle measures include **weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, and avoiding late meals** [^114cCD18] [^1158WG2M].

---

### Behavioral therapy

Behavioral therapy includes **diaphragmatic breathing** — first-line for rumination and effective at reducing episodes [^1155sZnY] [^113rMCXs] — and **CBT**, which addresses psychological drivers and supports adherence [^1155sZnY] [^115H3d5F].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgical options include **fundoplication** for refractory GERD with objectively confirmed reflux [^114cCD18] and **POEM** for achalasia or severe motility disorders [^116qiid3].

---

Belching liquid acid in a middle-aged man most often reflects GERD or rumination, with motility disorders as differentials; **confirm with endoscopy, pH-impedance, and manometry** [^114cCD18] [^111avmrf], then tailor therapy to mechanism and severity.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy indications, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This should ideally be done after proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are stopped for 2–4 weeks if classic GERD symptoms do not respond adequately to an 8-week empiric trial of PPIs or if symptoms return when PPIs are discontinued.

### Rumination syndrome: Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1155sZnY]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on rumination syndrome:

- **Definition**: RS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by the effortless and repetitive regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach to the oral cavity, followed by either re-swallowing or spitting.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of RS involves a voluntary but unconscious process consisting of a coordinated abdominothoracic muscle response. This includes thoracic suction, crural diaphragm relaxation, and increased intragastric pressure, which collectively reverse the esophagogastric pressure gradient due to low lower esophageal sphincter and intrathoracic pressures. The exact trigger for rumination events is unclear, but they may result from dyspeptic symptoms as patients seek relief through regurgitation or venting. GERD and pathological supragastric belching can also be mechanisms provoking or aggravating RS. Enhanced visceral pain perception and poor postprandial accommodation of the stomach have been suggested as the mechanisms for epigastric pain and the feeling of bloating in patients with RS.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RS in the US is estimated at 5.8%, with higher rates observed in children and adolescents.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RS include female gender, smoking, adherence to a gluten-free diet, and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, a history of eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, depression) have been identified as independent risk factors for RS. Functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis may also contribute.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^1146hUfd]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Typical symptoms of GERD consist of heartburn, esophageal chest pain, and regurgitation. The relationship of belching to reflux disease is variable, but belching can be part of reflux pathophysiology. Chronic cough and wheezing have a low but potential pathophysiological relationship to reflux disease. Hoarseness, globus, nausea, abdominal pain, and other dyspeptic symptoms in the absence of typical symptoms have a low likelihood of pathophysiological relationship to reflux disease.

The modern diagnosis of GERD starts with the identification of troublesome symptoms, but not all symptoms carry equal weight. Burning sensations beneath the breastbone (heartburn) or retrosternal chest pain may be interchangeable when responsive to empiric antisecretory medication, especially after cardiac etiology for chest pain is ruled out. Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of patients with heartburn, and half of patients with non-cardiac chest pain, report a response to short-term antisecretory therapy; however, a 10%–25% placebo effect can confound this response. Thus, response to an empiric PPI trial alone is insufficient for a conclusive GERD diagnosis. Both heartburn and chest pain can arise from motor disorders, such as achalasia, and DGBI mechanisms.

Regurgitation, the effortless presence of sour or bitter gastric content in the mouth, often does not fully improve with acid suppression alone. Acidic reflux episodes can become weakly acidic or non-acidic following antisecretory therapy, where regurgitation becomes an important mechanism for refractory GERD leading to clinically relevant outcomes.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, is a physiological phenomenon that occurs in everyone, particularly after consuming large and fatty meals. Under normal conditions, efficient esophageal clearing mechanisms return most of the refluxed material to the stomach, preventing symptoms. However, when the reflux of gastric contents is substantial or aggressive, it can lead to troublesome symptoms and/or complications, adversely affecting health-related quality of life and resulting in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The Montreal consensus classifies GERD into esophageal and extra-esophageal syndromes, with associations established or proposed with GER. Up to two-thirds of patients with esophageal symptoms have a macroscopically normal mucosa at endoscopy and are usually considered to have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).

GERD is primarily a motor disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis. The main motility abnormalities include impaired function of the lower esophageal sphincter, abnormal esophageal clearance, and delayed gastric emptying in up to 40% of cases. While the presence of a hiatal hernia favors reflux, this association is not mandatory. The consequence of these motor abnormalities is the presence of acid inappropriately in contact with the esophageal mucosa. Additionally, the amount of reflux increases markedly after meals in both healthy individuals and GERD patients, primarily due to the increase of transient (inappropriate) lower esophageal sphincter relaxations caused by food-induced gastric accommodation.

A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency department following sudden onset chest pain with collapse. He was refurbishing his home when he collapsed on the floor with chest and abdominal pain. After regaining consciousness 1 hour later, he called emergency services due to persisting chest discomfort that worsened with inspiration. Upon arrival at the emergency department, his pulse was thready (88/58 mm Hg) with pulsus paradoxus on inspiration. High-sensitivity troponin I was elevated at 325 ng/L (normal range 1–34 ng/L). Fluid resuscitation was administered and contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: a stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A good medical history is vital for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is a red flag alarm symptom requiring oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after investigations including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be found.

This review suggests an algorithm of history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. It also discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### The role of ambulatory 24-hour esophageal manometry in clinical practice [^114Y5aiD]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Furthermore, to assess whether ambulatory manometry could help identify patients whose cough symptoms may benefit most from antireflux treatment, Sifrim et al. measured the relationship between chronic cough and acidic reflux among 22 patients. The authors applied 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring and manometry with four solid-state pressure sensors (Unisensor AG), positioned in the stomach, LES, and at 5 and 10 cm proximal to the LES. Subjects went back home and were encouraged to maintain usual meals and daily activities while keeping a diary of cough events. The authors defined a "cough burst" as ≥ 2 rapid simultaneous pressure peaks occurring within 3 seconds, and subjects with < 5 cough bursts within 24 hours were subsequently excluded.

Study findings revealed that the majority of cough events (69.4%) were unrelated to reflux, whereas 30.6% took place within 2 minutes of a reflux episode. Of these coughing episodes around reflux events, almost half (49.0%) occurred following a reflux event (reflux-cough), whereas the other half occurred before a reflux event (51.0%). Among the 22 patients, 45% were found to have a positive SAP between reflux and cough. The authors subsequently concluded that ambulatory pressure/pH-impedance monitoring may provide relevant data that can affect diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making, as it can reliably identify those patients whose cough symptoms may benefit from more aggressive antireflux treatment. In an even larger study, Blondeau et al. measured the relationship between reflux and cough among 100 patients using simultaneous ambulatory manometry.

Once it was established that there was large left-sided hydronephrosis, the urology team was consulted on its management. An ultrasound-guided interventional cystic drainage was performed, which drained up to 4 L of fluid. A nephrostomy drain tube was left in situ and was kept on free drainage. This was removed 1 week later.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic cough: A possible mechanism elucidated by ambulatory pH-impedance-pressure monitoring [^115mNuL6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Another hypothesis for reflux-cough episodes is the stimulation of a vagal esophagobronchial reflex by reflux, triggering the cough reflex. Studies involving saline and acid infusion have shown that cough frequency and amplitude are greater with acid than saline. Infusion of acid into the esophagus increases cough sensitivity in patients with GERD and cough. Decreases in distal reflux and coughs after anti-GERD therapy in patients with unexplained cough support the distal-reflux reflex mechanism. However, there is little evidence for transient distal reflux inducing cough or the associated reflux characteristics. We found distal reflux contributed to 74.6% of reflux-cough episodes, the refluxate being acidic in almost half and weakly acidic in 40.4%. We also tried to compare additional characteristics of distal reflux that did or did not cause cough but failed because of the huge difference in frequency of these episodes (47 distal refluxes causing cough vs. 3735 distal refluxes not causing cough).

Esophageal dysmotility is another important mechanism in GERD. Ineffective esophageal motility and large breaks are associated with reflux-cough events. Meanwhile, long-term exposure to acid is negatively correlated with esophageal body motility. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated esophageal motility during long-term acid reflux in individuals with chronic cough (CC) and GERD. We found that most primary and secondary peristalsis is ineffective (61.8%-88.6%), and low pressure amplitude in both the distal and proximal esophagus results in 38.5% ineffective esophageal motility (IEM).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend considering esophageal manometry as part of the evaluation for refractory GERD. This is particularly suggested for patients who have normal endoscopy and pH monitoring results and for those who are candidates for surgical or endoscopic treatment.

### Rumination syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1169nSyX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by effortless and repetitive regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach to the oral cavity, followed by either re-swallowing or spitting. Rumination is thought to occur due to a reversal of the esophagogastric pressure gradient. This reversal is achieved through a coordinated abdominothoracic maneuver consisting of thoracic suction, crural diaphragm relaxation, and an increase in intragastric pressure.

A careful history is important for diagnosing rumination syndrome; patients often report "vomiting" or "reflux", and thus, the diagnosis can be missed. Objective testing is available with high-resolution manometry or gastroduodenal manometry. An increase in intra-gastric pressure followed by regurgitation is a key characteristic distinguishing rumination from other disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux.

The mainstay of treatment for rumination syndrome is behavioral therapy through diaphragmatic breathing, in conjunction with patient education and reassurance.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this review was to critically appraise recent key developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy for rumination syndrome. A literature search using OVID (Wolters Kluwer Health, New York, NY, USA) to examine the MEDLINE database from its inception until May 2016 was conducted using the search terms "rumination syndrome", "biofeedback therapy", and "regurgitation". Reference lists and personal libraries of the authors were used to identify supplemental information. Articles published in English were included.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^116RhS4t]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with suspected rumination can often be diagnosed clinically based on a typical history. However, if the diagnosis is unclear, if the patient needs convincing of the diagnosis, or if objective evidence is required prior to therapy, high-resolution manometry (HRM) with impedance following a test meal can be utilized to identify diagnostic features. Simultaneous impedance provides additional confirmatory and diagnostic information.

- **GRADE evidence**: Moderate
- **Strength recommendation**: Strong

Rumination is an underreported syndrome characterized by near effortless postprandial regurgitation. It was once thought to be confined to childhood and those with developmental disabilities, but it is now recognized to occur at all ages. The history is key for diagnosis. According to the Rome III diagnostic criteria, the individual must experience at least three months of regurgitation without preceding nausea or retching only during and up to two hours after meals, never at night. The regurgitated food typically tastes "pleasant" (not acidic) such that it can be chewed and re-swallowed. A variety of other symptoms may be present, including heartburn, nausea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, so diagnosis by history alone may not always be possible.

The cardinal event during or immediately preceding rumination is voluntary (although subconscious) abdominal wall contraction. This is associated with low pressure at the gastro-oesophageal junction, which is easily overcome by a sudden rise in intragastric pressure. These events, combined with the retrograde passage of gastric contents, are best appreciated when correctly evaluated.

### Rumination syndrome and dental erosions in children [^114TgfZ6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome is characterized by the effortless regurgitation of recently ingested food, which is then either reswallowed or spit out. Dental erosion (DE) affects 2% to 5% of the population and is defined as the loss of tooth structure due to a chemical process that does not involve bacteria. Our objective was to compare the frequency of DE among children with rumination syndrome to healthy controls.

We enrolled 30 patients aged 4 to 21 years who were diagnosed with rumination syndrome, along with 30 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Patients were evaluated by pediatric dentists for the presence of DE using the validated grading system by Taji et al. Patients with rumination were more likely to have DE (P < 0.001). Of the patients with rumination syndrome, 23 (77%) had DE, compared to 4 (13%) of the control subjects. DEs are more frequent in patients with rumination syndrome.

While 'worst day' analysis might be more appropriate in patients with intermittent symptoms, specificity decreases, and the risk of a false positive diagnosis increases due to brief or isolated alterations in acid exposure. Therefore, 'average' analysis is a more conservative assessment of pathological acid exposure, and a positive result is more likely to be true, as it reduces variability.

The most logical approach in clinical practice appears to be to decide at 48 hours whether to prolong the wireless pH monitoring study further. If the first 2 days provide consistent results (i.e. both are clearly positive or both are clearly negative), then it is unlikely that the subsequent 2 days will alter the diagnosis, and further prolongation is likely to be unnecessary. Conversely, if the results of the first 2 days are discordant, markedly variable, or borderline, prolonging the study duration would provide more data on which to base a definitive diagnosis. However, the latest wireless pH recorders are capable of recording for 96 hours, and if such a recorder is utilized, the patient should simply be asked to bring their recorder back in 96 hours, so that the patient does not need to make an extra visit at 48 hours.

### Unusual cause of dyspnoea: A case presentation of an echocardiographic pitfall [^115qrRF9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old Austrian woman with a recent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement presented with recurring progressive dyspnoea (NYHA III). She had undergone surgery six months prior due to a hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the tricuspid aortic valve. Access was achieved via median sternotomy, and following a bypass application lasting one hour and the initiation of cardioplegia, the calcified valve was replaced by a Mitroflow pericardial prosthesis with a diameter of 21 mm. The operation proceeded without complications, and the patient was extubated the day after surgery.

Initially, her symptoms improved over the first few months. However, she subsequently experienced a rapid decline in her performance level, although she reported no other general symptoms or fever. Clinically, the patient showed signs of cardiac decompensation with minimal pretibial edema, but without orthopnoea. An electrocardiogram indicated pre-existing atrial fibrillation with normal frequency and no pathological signs of repolarization.

Auscultation revealed a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left parasternal border with multidirectional conduction, prompting the performance of a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. The echocardiography indicated normal chamber sizes and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, but showed significant right atrial dilatation with low tricuspid regurgitation due to coaptation dysfunction. The systolic regurgitation velocity was 2.8 m/sec, equating to slight pulmonary hypertension.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic cough: A possible mechanism elucidated by ambulatory pH-impedance-pressure monitoring [^1131FTPY]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

According to the Montreal definition and classification, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes esophageal and extra-esophageal symptoms. Chronic cough (CC), defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks, is accepted as a definite extra-esophageal symptom and affects an estimated 9%-33% of European and US individuals with GERD. GERD, asthma, and postnasal drip are considered the most important factors contributing to chronic cough. Two possible pathophysiological mechanisms, namely "reflux theory" and "reflex theory", may cause reflux-induced cough episodes.

Acid reflux has been identified as one of the most important causes of chronic cough, and some patients with CC benefit from anti-acid therapy. However, many patients experience significant adverse effects of anti-acid therapy without benefit. Studies have also shown that weakly acidic reflux plays a role in reflux-induced cough. Increased esophageal exposure to acid associated with esophageal dysmotility has been identified in patients with extra-esophageal symptoms.

Most studies using traditional manometric techniques have identified associations between ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) and both long exposure time and poor clearance of reflux events. The Chicago Classification and Lyon Consensus provide more details regarding esophageal dysmotility as assessed by esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM); however, HRM has been infrequently used to assess GERD with CC.

### Rumination syndrome: When to suspect and how to treat [^114SR4nd]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by effortless regurgitation of recently ingested food. The disorder is rare but likely under-recognized and leads to impaired quality of life among those affected. This review discusses recent studies which examined the pathophysiology, diagnoses, and therapy of rumination syndrome.

- **Recent findings**: The pathogenesis of rumination syndrome remains incompletely understood. Therapeutic options, which appear effective, include behavioral therapy with diaphragmatic breathing and pharmacotherapy with baclofen. A randomized trial of behavioral therapy and biofeedback therapy led to a 74% ± 6% reduction in rumination activity (from 29 ± 6 before to 7 ± 2 daily events after intervention) compared to 1% ± 14% during sham (from 21 ± 2 before to 21 ± 4 daily events after intervention) (P = 0.001). A recent randomized trial of baclofen at a dose of 10 mg three times daily led to symptomatic improvement in 63% of patients with rumination syndrome.

- **Summary**: This review summarizes a clinical approach to diagnosing and treating rumination syndrome. Behavioral therapy consisting of diaphragmatic breathing, with or without biofeedback, remains the most effective treatment strategy for patients with rumination syndrome.

### How to effectively use and interpret the barium swallow: Current role in esophageal dysphagia [^111qABDy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The barium swallow is a commonly performed investigation, though recent decades have seen major advances in other esophageal diagnostic modalities.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this review is to clarify the rationale for components of the barium swallow protocol, provide guidance on interpretation of findings, and describe the role of the barium swallow in the diagnostic paradigm for esophageal dysphagia in relation to other esophageal investigations. The barium swallow protocol, interpretation, and reporting terminology are subjective and non-standardized. Common reporting terminology and an approach to their interpretation are provided.

- **Timed barium swallow (TBS) protocol**: A TBS protocol provides a more standardized assessment of esophageal emptying but does not evaluate peristalsis. Barium swallow may have higher sensitivity than endoscopy for detecting subtle strictures. It has lower overall accuracy than high-resolution manometry for diagnosing achalasia but can help secure the diagnosis in cases of equivocal manometry. TBS has an established role in the objective assessment of therapeutic response in achalasia and helps identify the cause of symptom relapse.

- **Barium swallow in other conditions**: It has a role in evaluating manometric esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, in some cases helping to identify where it represents an achalasia-like syndrome. Furthermore, it should be performed in dysphagia following bariatric or anti-reflux surgery, to assess for both structural and functional postsurgical abnormalities.

In summary, barium swallow remains a useful investigation in esophageal dysphagia.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116jaSPh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a commonly diagnosed chronic disorder in western countries. According to the Montreal Classification, GERD is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Despite GERD typically presenting with esophageal symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, it may also present with extraesophageal symptoms. The most common extraesophageal manifestations of GERD include chronic cough, asthma, and laryngitis.

There are two mechanisms proposed to explain extraesophageal syndromes caused by GERD. The first is a direct way via irritation and/or microaspiration, and the second is an indirect, vagally mediated way. Irritation occurs with the entrance of gastroduodenal contents into the pharynx and larynx, with or without microaspiration in deeper airways, due to the disturbance of normal protective mechanisms. In the second mechanism, symptoms are caused by a vagally mediated esophago-tracheal-bronchial reflex when reflux reaches the lower esophagus. It is known from embryological studies that the esophagus and bronchial tree share a common innervation via the vagus nerve.

Nowadays, several tests have improved the diagnostic field of typical GERD. However, the investigation of extraesophageal manifestations of GERD is still difficult, and new methods and studies are needed to improve these diagnostic problems.

### A 45-year-old man with a lung mass and history of charcoal aspiration [^116hBv1W]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old man was seen in consultation for evaluation of a spiculated right-lower-lobe mass that enlarged over one year. The patient had suffered accidental instillation of activated charcoal into the right lung via a nasogastric tube two years prior to this consultation, resulting in respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Biopsy of the mass showed anthracosis and granulomatous inflammation. A positron emission tomography scan was strongly positive at the lesion, leading to a right-lower-lobectomy with partial diaphragmatic resection. On gross examination of the mass, a charcoal concretion was evident. Histologic examination showed intrinsic and surrounding granulomatous inflammation without tumor. The patient recovered uneventfully and, after one year, had not experienced further complications.

### Barium studies for detecting esophagopharyngeal reflux events [^117DKKMy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Esophagopharyngeal reflux (EPR) is among the factors involved in the supraesophageal complications of reflux disease and is diagnosed by the regurgitation of barium from the upper third of the esophagus into the pharynx in the absence of swallowing during a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. EPR is detected in approximately 20% of patients undergoing these studies and occurs in different clinical groups without disease-specific associations. The vast majority of patients with EPR show esophageal motor abnormalities on swallowing studies. Notably, prolonged esophageal clearing time is independently and strongly associated with EPR. Our data suggest that the oropharyngeal phase of deglutition is impaired in more than 50% of patients with both gastroesophageal reflux disease and EPR. In the subset of patients with EPR, oral abnormalities are mostly related to tongue function. Based on the data emerging from our videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, it seems plausible that EPR occurs as a result of an underlying esophageal motor dysfunction facilitated by impaired oral deglutition. As a consequence, when examining patients for EPR, both esophageal and oropharyngeal abnormalities should be sought.

### Approach to esophageal absent contractility: can we do better [^111KaJme]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Patients with absent contractility (AC) often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Erosive esophagitis (EE) is a common finding in AC and has been reported in up to 65% of scleroderma patients with AC and concomitant esophageal symptoms. Due to the potential for reflux symptoms, severe EE, esophageal stricture, esophageal candidiasis, Barrett's esophagus, aspiration, esophageal cancer, and malnutrition, AC can be a debilitating lifelong condition that negatively impacts quality of life.

In this review, we aim to present the most therapeutic approaches for AC and its complications, with a focus on GERD management, nutritional support, and the potential role of endoscopic or surgical interventions.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^1153vhGk]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Restrictions during ambulatory oesophageal reflux monitoring**: During the recording period, patients should be encouraged to partake in their usual daily activities. Restrictions on diet, smoking, alcohol, and exercise should be minimal to increase the chance of correlating symptoms and oesophageal acid exposure. Meal periods should be removed from the pH or pH/impedance recording analysis to improve the separation of normal and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure. To help determine this and improve the recording and analysis of symptoms, patients should complete a diary during reflux monitoring to document the timing of meals, symptoms, and supine periods.

- **Duration of ambulatory oesophageal pH or pH/impedance monitoring**: Patients should ideally undergo a minimum of 24 hours of reflux monitoring. International consensus has suggested that a minimum of 16 hours of monitoring is needed to obtain clinically useful data.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rumination syndrome [^113rMCXs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The AGA 2018 guidelines recommend that in screening and diagnosis for rumination syndrome, the presence of nocturnal regurgitation, dysphagia, nausea, or symptoms occurring in the absence of meals makes the diagnosis of rumination syndrome less likely.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: Expert review [^115KM5vq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

In specific circumstances regarding gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly in patients with extraesophageal symptoms, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing for extraesophageal manifestations of GERD. These include laryngitis, chronic cough, asthma, and dental erosions in patients with GERD. This evaluation helps determine whether GERD may be a contributing factor to these conditions.

### Barrett's esophagus [^116VC8bw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Barrett's esophagus can be associated with various factors including age greater than 50 years, dysphagia, chest pain, obesity, male sex, tobacco use, heartburn, intestinal metaplasia in the distal esophagus, dysplasia in the distal esophagus, food regurgitation, white race, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hiatal hernia.

### Modern diagnosis of GERD: The Lyon consensus [^111Ycw2D]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

HRM studies performed during the postprandial period could be of interest for identifying pathophysiological mechanisms in GERD, particularly reflux episodes that tend to occur postprandially. A reflux episode may occur during a TLESR from low LES pressure or in conjunction with rumination (increased gastric pressure with or without decreased thoracic pressure) or supragastric belching (air swallowing to initiate belching). Postprandial HRM has also been used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs targeted at TLESRs, rumination, and supragastric belching. However, several limitations exist, including the lack of normative postprandial HRM data, difficulties with standardization of the test meal, and unclear optimal duration of the recording period.

- **Motility findings in GERD**: The most common motility pattern in GERD is a normal study. However, either the EGJ or the esophageal body, or both, can be abnormal. The EGJ can be hypotensive, with or without a hiatus hernia. Peristalsis can be fragmented, ineffective, or absent, with or without contraction reserve. The Lyon Consensus endorses the hierarchical classification of motility findings in GERD by first evaluating EGJ morphology and function with LES-CD separation and the EGJ-CI. Second, it characterizes the integrity of peristalsis as normal, weak, fragmented, or absent. Third, it evaluates contraction reserve.

This classification is intended to be used in conjunction with the Chicago Classification.

### Telemetry capsule for ambulatory pH monitoring: Is it time for a change [^116JVWCS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no clear gold standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most common practice, a therapeutic trial of antisecretory therapy, falls short of being ideal. Endoscopy is insensitive and impractical as an early diagnostic test for the majority of patient presentations. Ambulatory reflux monitoring offers the most effective means of documenting the presence of abnormal esophageal acid exposure and abnormal reflux frequency, and it helps to correlate the association of symptoms and reflux episodes. However, even this diagnostic test has fallen short of being an adequate and reliable standard for diagnosis. Telemetry capsule monitoring offers the opportunity for creative improvement in the diagnostic utility of pH monitoring and is the subject of the study discussed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^114Nwzo8]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Patients prior to antireflux surgery**: Although there is currently no evidence to rule out or tailor antireflux surgery in patients with minor motor disorders, oesophageal manometry should be performed in advance for all patients being considered for surgery to rule out LOS dysfunction (i.e. achalasia) as well as major motor disorders of the oesophageal body (e.g. diffuse oesophageal spasm).

	- **GRADE evidence**: High.
	- **Strength recommendation**: Strong.

- **Symptomatic patients after antireflux surgery**: HRM can provide useful diagnostic information not obtainable by standard manometry among patients with dysphagia after antireflux surgery.

	- **GRADE evidence**: Low.
	- **Strength recommendation**: Conditional/weak.

- **Patients with suspected rumination**: Rumination syndrome can be confidently diagnosed clinically on the basis of a typical history. However, if the diagnosis is unclear, if the patient needs convincing of the diagnosis, or if objective evidence is required prior to therapy, HRM with impedance following a test meal can be utilized to identify diagnostic features. Simultaneous impedance provides additional confirmatory and diagnostic information.

	- **GRADE evidence**: Moderate.
	- **Strength recommendation**: Strong.

### Relationships between air swallowing, intragastric air, belching and gastro-oesophageal reflux [^112dscPR]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

With each swallow, a certain amount of air is transported to the stomach. The stomach protects itself against excessive distention by swallowed air through belching (gas reflux). The mechanism of belching, transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, is also one of the mechanisms underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether the swallowing of air leads to an increase in the size of the intragastric air bubble and to gastro-oesophageal reflux.

- **Methods**: Multichannel intraluminal impedance measurement was used to quantify the incidence of air swallowing in 20 healthy volunteers before and following a meal. Radiography was used to measure the size of the intragastric air bubble. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was assessed by impedance and pH measurement.

- **Results**: The rate of air swallowing was correlated to the size of the intragastric air bubble postprandially and to the rate of gaseous gastro-oesophageal reflux. The number of air swallows and the size of the intragastric air bubble did not correlate with the number of liquid acid and non-acid reflux episodes.

- **Conclusions**: In healthy subjects, air swallowing promotes belching but does not facilitate acid reflux.

### Current trends in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1158WG2M]. Gut and Liver (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroesophageal reflux disease:

- **Definition**: GERD is a disorder characterized by symptoms or signs caused by regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, or lungs.

- **Pathophysiology**: GERD is due to transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure, hiatal hernias, impaired esophageal clearance, and delayed gastric emptying.

- **Epidemiology**: The estimated prevalence of GERD symptoms in the US ranges from 6% to 30%, with a weekly prevalence of symptoms approaching 20%.

- **Disease course**: Reflux of gastric contents leads to damage of the esophagus, heartburn, bronchoconstriction, esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Barrett's esophagus occurs in about 10% of patients with chronic GERD.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11126SPy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The management of patients with extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging. In the absence of specific diagnostic methods capable of identifying individuals who might respond to antireflux therapy, an empiric trial of PPI therapy is the common approach. More invasive diagnostic testing should be reserved for those with poor or partial response to the initial PPI therapy to exclude reflux as the cause of patients' persistent symptoms. Future trials are needed to improve these diagnostic problems and identify the subgroup of individuals with extraesophageal reflux manifestations who may benefit from PPI therapy or antireflux surgery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rumination syndrome [^115ekoaD]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by effortless postprandial regurgitation. The disorder appears uncommon, although only limited epidemiologic data are available. Awareness of the characteristic symptoms is essential for recognizing the disorder and thus avoiding the long delay in diagnosis that many patients experience. Although objective testing by postprandial esophageal high-resolution impedance manometry is available in select referral centers, a clinical diagnosis can be made in most patients.

The main therapy for rumination syndrome is behavioral modification with postprandial diaphragmatic breathing. This clinical practice update reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of rumination syndrome.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should strongly consider rumination syndrome in patients who report consistent postprandial regurgitation. Such patients often are labeled as having refractory gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Presence of nocturnal regurgitation, dysphagia, nausea, or symptoms occurring in the absence of meals does not exclude rumination syndrome but makes the presence of it less likely.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should diagnose rumination syndrome primarily on the basis of Rome IV criteria after an appropriate medical work-up.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Diaphragmatic breathing with or without biofeedback is the first-line therapy in all cases of rumination syndrome.

- **Best practice advice 5**: Instructions for effective diaphragmatic breathing can be provided by speech therapists.

### Diagnosis and management of severe respiratory acidosis: A 65-year-old man with a double-lung transplant and shortness of breath [^111vhnmU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a primary increase in whole-body carbon dioxide stores caused by a positive carbon dioxide balance. This acid-base disorder, if severe, may be life-threatening, thus requiring prompt recognition and expert management. The case presented highlights the essential features of the diagnosis and management of respiratory acidosis.

A brief description of the modifiers of carbon dioxide production, the pathogenesis of respiratory acidosis, and an algorithm for the assessment and management of this disorder is included. Key teaching points include the clinical value of both arterial and venous blood gas analyses and the importance of proper recognition of a primary respiratory arrest, in contrast to primary circulatory arrest, when managing a patient who requires resuscitation from "cardiorespiratory arrest".

### Effects of age on the gastroesophageal junction, esophageal motility, and reflux disease [^113Si9Lo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims: The prevalence of complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increases with age; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is uncertain. This study assessed (1) whether physiologic degradation of the gastroesophageal junction and esophageal motility occurs with aging, and (2) whether these effects are associated with increased esophageal acid exposure and reflux symptoms in the elderly.

Methods: A retrospective study of 1307 patients referred for investigations of reflux symptoms (median age, 49 years; range, 15–92 years) was conducted. Manometry assessed LES pressure, LES length, and esophageal peristalsis. Ambulatory pH studies assessed esophageal acid exposure (% time pH < 4) during a period of 24 hours; reflux symptoms were assessed by a validated questionnaire.

Results: On multivariate regression, esophageal acid exposure was associated independently with decreasing LES pressure (P < .0001) and abdominal LES length (P < .0004). Dysmotility exacerbated reflux in the recumbent position (P < .004). Acid exposure increased with age (P < .0001), with a 1.1%/24 hours (95% confidence interval, 0.4%-1.4%) increase in acid exposure every decade (more pronounced in the recumbent position). The age-related increase in acid exposure was associated independently with decreasing abdominal LES length (P < .001) and increasing dysmotility (P < 0.01). Reflux symptoms increased with acid exposure (P < .001); however, at any given level of exposure, symptom severity was less in the elderly (P < .006).

Conclusions: Age was associated with an increase in esophageal acid exposure, leading to more pronounced reflux symptoms.

### Current trends in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114oF87g]. Gut and Liver (2018). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be associated with several symptoms and conditions including difficulty sleeping, epigastric abdominal pain, laryngitis, hiatal hernia, and a burning sensation. Contributing factors include obesity, cigarette smoking, eating large meals or eating late at night, and coffee consumption. The disease can also lead to chest pain, characterized by both a cardiac and non-cardiac nature, food regurgitation, and pregnancy complications. Additional symptoms and associated conditions include dysphagia, food impaction, alcohol consumption, asthma, scleroderma, chronic cough, and connective tissue diseases.

### Detection and characteristics of rumination syndrome in patients presenting for gastric symptom evaluation [^115ydvgy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome involves effortless, repeated regurgitation, and can overlap with other upper gastrointestinal disorders, including gastroparesis. To inform better diagnostic detection of rumination, we aimed to identify the frequency and characteristics of rumination in patients presenting for gastric symptom evaluation and assess demographic and clinical characteristics that could differentiate those with versus those without rumination.

- **Methods**: Consecutively referred patients to two tertiary academic centers for gastric symptom specialty evaluation were included (N = 242). We obtained demographic information, gastric emptying scintigraphy, upper gastrointestinal symptoms using the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms (PAGI-SYM), and a Rome IV-based rumination questionnaire.

- **Key results**: Thirty-one of the 242 (12.8%) patients met criteria for rumination syndrome, with 48% reporting associated psychosocial impairment. Comparing those with rumination and those without, there were no differences in race, gender, frequency of diabetes, or frequency of gastroparesis. The median PAGI-SYM score for rumination patients was higher than for those without (3.03 vs. 2.55; unadjusted p = 0.043, adjusted p = 0.30), largely driven by increased heartburn/regurgitation subscale scores (2.71 vs. 1.57; unadjusted p = 0.0067, adjusted p = 0.046), itself influenced by elevated daytime regurgitation/reflux (3.0 vs. 2.0; unadjusted p = 0.007, adjusted p = 0.048). There were no significant differences on the remaining PAGI-SYM subscales.

Overdosage may lead to excessive diuresis with electrolyte depletion and dehydration. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Emesis should be induced, or gastric lavage performed. Correct dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic coma, and hypotension by established procedures. If required, give oxygen or artificial respiration for respiratory impairment.

In the mouse, the oral LD50 of ethacrynic acid is 627 mg/kg, and the intravenous LD50 of ethacrynate sodium is 175 mg/kg.

### Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or not, and in whom [^112PKYUy]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite progress in knowledge and effective therapies for acid-sensitive problems, the indications for gastroscopy seem even more confusing than before. The primary care physician, faced with the patient with undifferentiated symptoms, is now less sure when to seek an endoscopy, which is actively discouraged in many healthcare settings. Management guidelines, based essentially on maximizing the yield from endoscopy, may define the direction of travel but do not sit comfortably in the consultation setting.

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing Synjardy or Synjardy XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than six days and some up to two weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

Withhold Synjardy or Synjardy XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Synjardy or Synjardy XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms arise.

### Esophageal impedance monitoring: Clinical pearls and pitfalls [^1146JBGq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The development of intraluminal esophageal impedance monitoring has improved our ability to detect and measure gastroesophageal reflux without dependence on acid content. This ability to detect previously unrecognized weak or nonacid reflux episodes has had important clinical implications in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In addition, with the ability to assess bolus transit within the esophageal lumen, impedance monitoring has enhanced the recognition and characterization of esophageal motility disorders in patients with nonobstructive dysphagia.

The assessment of the intraluminal movement of gas and liquid has also been proven to be of diagnostic value in conditions such as rumination syndrome and excessive belching. Further, alternative applications of impedance monitoring, such as the measurement of mucosal impedance, have provided novel insights into assessing esophageal mucosal integrity changes as a consequence of inflammatory change.

Future applications for esophageal impedance monitoring also hold promise in esophageal conditions other than GERD. However, despite all of the clinical benefits afforded by esophageal impedance monitoring, important clinical and technical shortcomings limit its diagnostic value and must be considered when interpreting study results. Overinterpretation of studies or application of impedance monitoring in patients can have deleterious clinical implications. This review will highlight the clinical benefits and limitations of esophageal impedance monitoring and provide clinical pearls and pitfalls.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of mitochondrial disorders: a systematic review [^114Mkq2n]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction**: Gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction may manifest as either gastroesophageal reflux or achalasia. Gastroesophageal reflux is common in mitochondrial disorders (MIDs) and is pathophysiologically the opposite of achalasia. Gastroesophageal reflux has been reported in mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), MNGIE, and in nonsyndromic MIDs. Achalasia can occur at various locations along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, for example, at the cricopharyngeal sphincter, the gastroesophageal sphincter, or the rectum.

The cause of achalasia in MID patients remains unknown, but it can be speculated that affection of the smooth muscle cells by the metabolic defect or affection of the autonomic innervation with reduced parasympathetic tone may lead to sympathetic overinnervation or permanent contraction of smooth muscle cells. Possibly, achalasia results from a failure of smooth muscle fibers to relax, which may cause a sphincter to remain closed and fail to open when needed. Achalasia is an exceedingly rare GI manifestation of pediatric MIDs but has been occasionally reported in adults. In a 6-year-old female and a 6-month-old male with multiple mtDNA deletions, achalasia was the dominant feature and occurred at 3 and 7 years of age, respectively. Gastroesophageal reflux was found only in the male, starting at age 6 months.

Cricopharyngeal achalasia has been reported in Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS) patients and may lead to dysphagia. Cricopharyngeal achalasia has also been reported in mtDNA deletion syndromes, such as KSS.

### A perspective on the clinical relevance of weak or nonacid reflux [^111uAAsx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Advances in ambulatory esophageal reflux monitoring that incorporated impedance electrodes to pH catheters have resulted in better characterization of retrograde bolus flow in the esophagus. With pH-impedance monitoring, in addition to acid reflux episodes identified by pH drops below 4.0, weakly acid reflux (WAR, pH 4–7) and nonacid reflux (NAR, pH > 7.0) are also recognized, although both may be included under the umbrella term NAR. However, despite the identification of ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring, data on the clinical relevance and prognostic value of NAR are limited. The Lyon Consensus, an international expert review that defines conclusive metrics for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), identifies NAR as "supportive" but not conclusive for GERD.

- **Purpose**: This review provides perspectives on whether NAR fulfills three criteria for clinical relevance: whether NAR sufficiently explains the pathogenesis of symptoms, whether it is associated with meaningful manifestations of GERD, and whether it can predict treatment efficacy.

### The role of ambulatory 24-hour esophageal manometry in clinical practice [^116q8FgH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, ambulatory 24-hour esophageal manometry enables the assessment of temporal relationships between reflux and cough, diagnoses rumination, and identifies esophageal dysmotility as the likely cause of non-cardiac chest pain — particularly when questions remain after traditional testing. Although primarily a tool for expert centers and not widely known, it offers advantages over stationary manometry by evaluating esophageal function over an extended period. This can add critical information to ambulatory pH-impedance testing. Further research is necessary to understand the value of ambulatory manometry in clinical practice and establish a diagnostic classification system.

### Classification of oesophageal motility abnormalities [^1164UH86]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Manometric examination of the oesophagus frequently reveals abnormalities whose cause is unknown and whose physiological importance is not clear. A large body of literature dealing with oesophageal motility abnormalities has evolved over the past few decades; however, comparisons among studies have been compromised by the lack of a widely accepted system for classifying the abnormal motility patterns and by the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for the putative disorders.

Based on an extensive review and analysis of the literature, this report suggests an operational scheme to be used for the general classification of oesophageal motility abnormalities and proposes standardised manometric criteria for the putative oesophageal motility disorders. By applying the guidelines proposed in this report, clinicians and researchers can determine if their patients fulfil the manometric criteria for a putative motility disorder, which should facilitate and improve comparisons among patients and studies.

However, it is important to emphasize that fulfilment of the proposed criteria does not establish the clinical importance of the motility abnormalities.

### Severe pediatric rumination syndrome: Successful interdisciplinary inpatient management [^116zijpD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome is a condition that occurs when people constantly regurgitate and expel or reswallow food soon after they eat. The most severe cases of rumination syndrome can be debilitating, requiring total parenteral nutrition or enteral tube feedings. We report our experience with the treatment of children with severe rumination syndrome.

- **Patients and methods**: Five patients with severe rumination syndrome received a novel inpatient interdisciplinary approach, which involved pediatric psychology, pediatric gastroenterology, clinical nutrition, child life, therapeutic recreation, and massage therapy.

- **Results**: Inpatient hospitalization lasted between 9 and 13 days. The treatment was successful in all 5 of the patients; they left with complete caloric intake orally.

- **Conclusions**: This treatment protocol could benefit pediatric gastroenterologists, pediatricians, and child psychologists in managing both standard and severe cases of rumination syndrome.

### Treatment of achalasia in the era of high-resolution manometry [^112asZyF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Achalasia is a rare primary esophageal motor disorder characterized by the absence of peristalsis and defective relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), resulting in impaired bolus transport and food stasis in the esophagus. Achalasia occurs equally in men and women, with an incidence of 1 in 100,000 individuals and a prevalence of 10 in 100,000. The peak incidence occurs between 30 and 60 years of age.

The most frequent symptoms of achalasia are dysphagia for both solids and liquids, regurgitation of saliva and undigested food, respiratory complications (nocturnal cough and aspiration), chest pain, heartburn, and weight loss. Heartburn can mimic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Dysphagia and regurgitation usually respond to treatment, but chest pain is much more difficult to treat.

The Eckardt symptom score is the grading system most frequently used for the evaluation of symptoms, stages, and efficacy of achalasia treatment. A symptom score of 0–1 corresponds to clinical stage 0, a score of 2–3 to stage I, a score of 4–6 to stage II, and a score greater than 6 to stage III. Stages 0 and I indicate remission of the disease, whereas stages II and III represent failure of treatment.

The pathogenesis of achalasia is not well understood, but it is believed to be due to an inflammatory neurodegenerative process with possible viral involvement. Measles and herpes viruses have been suggested as causal candidates. However, molecular techniques have failed to confirm these claims, and the causative agent remains undiscovered.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rumination syndrome: A critical review [^112spEi9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Rumination syndrome (RS) is characterized by the repeated regurgitation of material during or soon after eating, followed by subsequent rechewing, reswallowing, or spitting out of the regurgitated material. RS is classified as both a "Functional Gastroduodenal Disorder" by the Rome Foundation's "Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction, 4th edition", and a "Feeding and Eating Disorder" by the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition".

RS is often inaccurately diagnosed or missed, resulting in prolonged symptoms and delayed treatment for patients. There is a lack of clear consensus on the diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment of RS. Guided by existing research and clinical expertise, this review synthesizes available evidence and provides recommendations for clinical use. A case example is presented alongside a critical summary of the literature at the time of writing to:

- **Increase clinicians' understanding**: of heterogeneous clinical presentations.
- **Suggest assessment strategies**: to facilitate accurate diagnosis.
- **Provide a schematic for intervention options**.

Overall, clinicians are recommended to recognize the heterogeneous features of RS when considering diagnosis, to assess for RS symptoms through clinical history, and to treat RS with targeted diaphragmatic breathing while employing other methods as augmented interventions or alternative treatments.

### Recent insights on functional heartburn and reflux hypersensitivity [^116tedph]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

It must be emphasized that RH patients are not a homogeneous population. A subset of RH patients seems to have reflux symptoms generated by behavior disorders, such as supra-gastric belching (SPG) or rumination, and should be treated with non-GERD therapeutic approaches, like diaphragmatic breathing or cognitive-behavioral therapy. These non-GERD, behavioral subgroups might explain why many RH patients fail to respond not only to PPIs but also to pain modulators. Thus, the segregation of these non-GERD RH patients from those with FH might have important therapeutic implications.

On the other hand, the lack of a perfect tool to diagnose with certainty the various phenotypes of patients with typical GERD symptoms makes it difficult to categorize patients reliably into subsets of functional esophageal disorders. In addition, this fact also calls into question the Rome IV assumption that RH is caused exclusively by visceral hypersensitivity. Only the future availability of more accurate diagnostic techniques will enable a more precise understanding of the complexity of GERD syndromes and better refinements in the diagnosis of both RH and FH.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^112McHs8]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Summary of all recommendations:

- **Oesophageal manometry, including high-resolution manometry**:

	- **Technical aspects of oesophageal manometry**:

		1.1 In patients undergoing evaluation for dysphagia, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is superior to standard manometry in terms of reproducibility, speed of performance, and ease of interpretation.
		GRADE evidence: High
		Strength recommendation: Strong

		1.2 The addition of impedance to HRM can be a helpful adjunct to 'visualise' bolus movement and peristalsis effectiveness; however, its utility in clinical practice and impact on therapeutic decision making is not yet clear.
		GRADE evidence: Moderate
		Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak

		1.3 Normal values for HRM are manufacturer and catheter specific.
		GRADE evidence: High
		Strength recommendation: Strong

		1.4 Adjunctive testing (e.g. larger volumes of water, solid/viscous swallows, or a test meal) can provide additional information and unmask pathology not seen with standard water swallows, as they are more representative of normal swallowing behavior and more likely to induce symptoms and, in turn, improve diagnostic yield.
		GRADE evidence: High
		Strength recommendation: Strong

- **Patients with dysphagia**:

		1.5 Patients with dysphagia should preferably have an endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders prior to manometry. Barium swallow should be considered where endoscopy is not possible and/or where structural disorders require further scrutiny.
		GRADE evidence: Moderate
		Strength recommendation: Strong

- **Patients with achalasia**:

		1.6 In p [text seems truncated].

### Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of uninvestigated esophageal dysphagia [^114dCSRZ]. Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal dysphagia:

- **Definition**: Esophageal dysphagia is characterized by difficulty transporting food down the esophagus due to involvement of the esophageal body and esophagogastric junction.

- **Pathophysiology**: Esophageal dysphagia is caused by structural or inflammatory abnormalities, including strictures, rings, webs, malignancy, reflux esophagitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. It is also associated with motility disorders such as achalasia, ineffective esophageal motility, esophageal spasm, and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of esophageal dysphagia include difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, intermittent or progressive dysphagia, food bolus impaction, food regurgitation, heartburn, weight loss, anorexia, respiratory distress, hypotension, and atypical chest pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with GERD is 0.46 per 100,000 individuals.

### Nexium [^114xgWpF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Nexium can have other serious side effects. See "What are the possible side effects of Nexium?"

Nexium is a prescription medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It reduces the amount of acid in your stomach. Nexium is used in adults:

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: For 4 to 8 weeks to treat the symptoms of GERD, it may also be prescribed to heal acid-related damage to the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis) and to help continue this healing. GERD happens when acid in your stomach backs up into the esophagus, causing a burning feeling in your chest or throat, sour taste, or burping.

- **Stomach ulcers**: For up to 6 months to reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in some people taking pain medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: To treat patients with a stomach infection (Helicobacter pylori) along with the antibiotics amoxicillin and clarithromycin.

- **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**: For the long-term treatment of conditions where your stomach makes too much acid, including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. This is a rare condition in which the stomach produces a more than normal amount of acid.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^1153PJYZ]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and anatomic site of the problem in most patients and is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic 'anomalies' are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders.

- **Next diagnostic procedure**: The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow, or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis.

Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### Effects of anti-reflux surgery on weakly acidic reflux and belching [^115YPYSm]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) is the most frequently performed operation for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). However, 12% of the patients have persistent reflux symptoms, and 19% develop gas-related symptoms after LNF. Weakly acidic reflux and inability to belch have been alleged to cause these symptoms, respectively. The effect of LNF on weakly acidic reflux and (supra) gastric belching was evaluated.

- **Methods**: In 31 patients, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, stationary oesophageal manometry, and 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring off acid secretion inhibiting drugs were performed before and 6 months after primary LNF for GORD that was refractory to proton pump inhibitors. Patients filled out validated questionnaires on GERD-HRQoL before and 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.

- **Results**: LNF reduced reflux symptoms (18.6→1.6; p = 0.015). The procedure drastically reduced the incidence (number per 24 hours) of acid (76.0→1.6; p < 0.001) and weakly acidic (13.6→5.7; p = 0.001) as well as liquid (53.4→5.4; p < 0.001) and mixed reflux episodes (36.3→1.9; p < 0.001). In contrast, gas reflux was reduced to a lesser extent (35.6→25.7; p = 0.022). Proximal, mid-oesophageal, and distal reflux were reduced to a similar extent. Persistent GORD symptoms were neither preceded by acid nor by weakly acidic reflux. The number of air swallows did not change, but the number of gastric belches (GBs) was greatly reduced (68.5→23.9; p < 0.001). Twenty-three patients had supragastric belches (SGBs), both before and after surgery, whereas eight patients had no SGBs at all.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111Zprka]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The most common extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include chronic cough, asthma, and laryngitis. There are two mechanisms proposed to explain extraesophageal syndromes caused by GERD. The first is a direct mechanism involving irritation and/or microaspiration, while the second is an indirect, vagally mediated mechanism. The investigation of extraesophageal manifestations of GERD is challenging, and empirical therapy with proton pump inhibitors, usually at double dose for at least three months, remains the most common approach.

### The gastro-sphincteric pressure gradient: A new parameter to diagnose a rumination episode [^115cWTtx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Rumination is defined as the repetitive, effortless regurgitation of recently ingested food into the mouth. These episodes are preceded by a rise in intragastric pressure (IGP) and mainly occur postprandially. IGP peaks greater than 30 mmHg have been proposed as a cutoff to differentiate rumination from reflux events. In clinical practice, we observed that this cutoff, which does not consider esophagogastric junction (EGJ) resistance, is not always reached.

We studied 27 patients with rumination syndrome [age: 43.6 years, 59% female] and 28 gastro-esophageal reflux disease patients [age: 45.9 years, 54% female]. For each rumination episode, reflux event, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR), or straining without regurgitation, the following parameters were registered: maximal IGP, IGP, and EGJ pressure preceding the respective episodes. We also quantified the gastro-sphincteric pressure gradient (GSPG) prior to the respective episodes.

- **Key results**: Five reflux episodes were characterized by a maximal IGP greater than 30 mmHg. In 28% of the rumination episodes, the IGP peak did not exceed 30 mmHg. Median GSPG was positive for rumination episodes and significantly higher compared with TLESRs, reflux episodes, and straining without regurgitation (7 [3–13] vs. 0 [-1–0] vs. 0 [-1–0] vs. -9 [-13–2]; p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions & interpretations**: Applying the proposed cutoff of 30 mmHg, 28% of the rumination episodes were missed. We found that the GSPG differentiates between rumination (positive GSPG), TLESRs and reflux events (GSPG around 0), and straining without regurgitation.

### Unusual cause of dyspnoea: A case presentation of an echocardiographic pitfall [^115fpamR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

In the case of the reported patient, only after the recent aortic valve replacement did we decide against a new intervention, as she was advanced in years and had shown resilience after cardiac recompensation. The new onset of tricuspid regurgitation and the jet of a medium-sized LV-RA shunt were still overloading the right heart. Additionally, the diastolic disorder of relaxation was believed to be the reason for the patient's dyspnoea and further cardiac decompensation.

After optimizing medication, the patient hardly sensed dyspnoea anymore and reported general satisfaction. Both the right and left ventricles were of normal size, and pulmonary hypertension was low. According to the guidelines of the American Heart Association, no further interventions were indicated (see Figure 3).

- **Figure 3**: Two-dimensional color-flow Doppler echocardiogram shows the Gerbode defect and low tricuspid regurgitation (arrows) in apical 4-chamber view.

In agreement with the patient, continuous clinical and echocardiographic check-ups are now carried out to detect the hemodynamic activity of the defect in time. In summary, the Gerbode defect is a rare complication that might still be misinterpreted as only pulmonary hypertension and thus be underdiagnosed.

The new onset of dyspnoea after cardiac surgery should always prompt further investigation, where transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are convenient diagnostic instruments in addition to simple auscultation.

### Modern diagnosis of GERD: The Lyon consensus [^111avmrf]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The Lyon Consensus builds on the Porto Consensus of 2002, providing recommendations for the use and interpretation of reflux testing techniques in 2018, including oesophageal HRM and baseline impedance measurement that were not widely available in 2002. The primary indication for reflux testing is in distinguishing among patients with pathological reflux burden, reflux-mediated hypersensitivity, and functional syndromes.

The Lyon Consensus attempts to augment this approach by stratifying the significance of findings into those that are conclusive of pathological GERD, as opposed to suggestive of the diagnosis. It also proposes the concept of 'borderline' or inconclusive evidence when additional evidence can sway the final judgment towards or away from GERD. This is an area where novel metrics and diagnostic techniques may prove helpful. Conditions that can mimic GERD, such as achalasia, supragastric belching, and rumination syndrome, need to be excluded with appropriate testing.

Any one conclusive finding provides strong evidence for the presence of GERD. While a normal EGD does not exclude GERD on its own, this provides strong evidence against GERD when combined with AET < 4% and < 40 reflux episodes on pH-impedance monitoring off proton pump inhibitor therapy. When evidence is inconclusive or borderline, adjunctive or supportive findings can add confidence to the presence or absence of GERD.

### Advanced achalasia mimicking delayed gastric emptying during standard gastric emptying scintigraphy [^114nVoJj]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old man underwent outpatient nuclear medicine gastric-emptying scintigraphy (GES) for dysphagia and regurgitation. The standard solid-meal GES showed significant elongated tracer retention with a calculated 96% retention rate at 3 hours, leading to a presumed diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying. However, subsequent CT of the chest and abdomen and upper gastrointestinal fluoroscopy demonstrated normal size and function of the stomach but revealed an enormously dilated esophagus with food debris, consistent with achalasia.

Attention should be paid to the location and shape of the visualized "stomach" to recognize that a significantly dilated esophagus can mimic an elongated stomach during GES.

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and its variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides themselves on good history taking.

### Gelastic seizures misdiagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112U3F4S]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease can have variable manifestations, including regurgitation, irritability, arching, choking, and apnea. The disorder is also frequently mistaken for seizures, such as in Sandifer syndrome. We report six patients in whom the opposite phenomenon occurred: their seizures were mistaken for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Six of 77 patients (6.8%) with gelastic seizures and epilepsy symptomatic of hypothalamic hamartomas were noted to be misdiagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease in infancy. Typically, gelastic seizures are not diagnosed until months or even years later. The delayed diagnosis of hypothalamic hamartomas can lead to a potentially deleterious syndrome involving refractory epilepsy, developmental problems, and precocious puberty. Gelastic seizures should be considered among the conditions that can mimic reflux symptoms.
