## Question

Which patient populations require heparin to warfarin bridging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patient populations require heparin-to-warfarin bridging and how to apply the evidence and guidelines to decide when to bridge versus when to avoid bridging. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where bridging is considered, namely perioperative interruption of warfarin and initiation of warfarin. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials like BRIDGE and PERIOP2, and what they actually show. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations across AF, mechanical valves, VTE, and device procedures. After that, I should stratify thromboembolic risk categories and reconcile areas of controversy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note special populations and dosing details where bridging may still be reasonable despite bleeding risk.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts. Bridging is typically considered in two scenarios: temporary interruption of warfarin for an elective procedure or surgery, and initiation of warfarin when a rapid anticoagulant effect is needed while warfarin's delayed onset leaves the patient unprotected, so I need to keep both in mind as I weigh evidence and guidelines [^1139gwNk] [^1178Szfi].

> Now, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The BRIDGE randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in atrial fibrillation showed that forgoing LMWH bridging during warfarin interruption was noninferior to bridging for arterial thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding, which is a pivotal result arguing against routine bridging in AF [^114tPkxh]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: major bleeding was 1.3% without bridging versus 3.2% with bridging, confirming a clinically meaningful harm signal for bridging in AF, and this has been echoed by subsequent analyses and reviews [^114tPkxh] [^117CLx8R].

> Next, I should review PERIOP2, which focused on postoperative bridging after procedures in patients with AF or mechanical valves. The trial found that postoperative LMWH bridging did not reduce thromboembolism and increased bleeding, reinforcing the message that routine postoperative bridging is harmful in these populations, especially when bleeding leads to prolonged anticoagulant interruption that itself increases thrombotic risk [^116Dy68e] [^117CLx8R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about device procedures. I need to check device-specific data. The BRUISE-CONTROL randomized trial demonstrated that continuing therapeutic warfarin through pacemaker or ICD implantation dramatically reduced clinically significant pocket hematomas compared with interruption plus heparin bridging, without increasing thromboembolic events, establishing uninterrupted warfarin as preferred in this setting [^113dJJA3]. Let me double-check guideline alignment: CHEST and ACC/AHA/ACCP endorse continuation of VKA over interruption with bridging for device procedures, which aligns with this trial signal [^1163LAZM] [^115ErXWS].

> I will now examine contemporary guideline positions. CHEST 2022 issues a strong recommendation against heparin bridging for AF patients requiring warfarin interruption, and a conditional suggestion against bridging for VTE as the sole indication, while allowing that selected high-risk VTE cases may merit bridging. For mechanical valves, CHEST suggests against routine bridging despite historical practice, emphasizing individualized decisions and the lack of high-quality comparative data [^112Q3U5X] [^1126HKPY]. The ACC/AHA/ACCP AF guideline similarly recommends temporary cessation without bridging for most AF patients undergoing procedures, with explicit exceptions for mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA, and supports uninterrupted VKA for device surgery in appropriate candidates [^115ErXWS] [^114yW3p7]. ASH VTE guidance also advises against routine LMWH bridging during VKA interruption, again reserving it for select high-risk scenarios [^1149ARZf].

> Let me think about thromboembolic risk stratification, because that is the crux. High-risk features include mechanical heart valves, particularly mitral or older-generation valves, recent arterial or venous thromboembolism within about 3 months, active cancer, and severe thrombophilia; moderate risk includes bi-leaflet aortic valves without other risk factors or VTE beyond 3 months but within 12 months; low risk includes stable AF without high CHA2DS2-VASc features and remote VTE, and guidelines generally advise against bridging in low-to-moderate risk groups while allowing consideration in high-risk groups with careful bleeding assessment [^1126HKPY] [^112Q3U5X] [^115xyL1o].

> But wait, what about mechanical valves specifically. Historically, many clinicians bridged all mechanical valves, yet current guidance is more nuanced. CHEST suggests against routine bridging even in valve patients, and ACC/AHA valvular guidance emphasizes individualized decisions given the absence of robust randomized data in this subgroup and the known bleeding penalty with bridging; thus, I should confirm valve position, type, and patient-specific risks before deciding to bridge [^112Q3U5X] [^1158iCqD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought all mechanical valves required bridging, but that blanket approach is no longer supported; bridging may still be reasonable for mitral valves or those with prior thromboembolism, but it is not universally mandated and must be balanced against bleeding risk [^1158iCqD].

> Next, I should review VTE-specific considerations. For patients with VTE as the sole indication requiring VKA interruption, CHEST suggests against therapeutic-dose bridging given higher bleeding without clear thrombotic benefit, but it allows that selected high-risk cases such as very recent VTE, active cancer, or severe thrombophilia may warrant bridging after multidisciplinary review. Observational and systematic reviews corroborate increased bleeding with bridging and no consistent reduction in recurrent VTE, reinforcing caution [^117Eu9yG] [^116ezArV] [^115yzc3v]. I should double-check that this applies to elective procedures. Urgent settings may alter the calculus, but the default remains no bridging unless risk is clearly high [^117Eu9yG].

> I need to ensure I cover warfarin initiation, not just interruption. Observational data in NVAF suggest that routine heparin bridging at warfarin initiation increases bleeding without reducing stroke, so bridging is not recommended for routine NVAF starts. Exceptions include situations requiring rapid protection, such as acute VTE or certain post-ablation contexts, where short-term bridging may be considered while monitoring bleeding risk closely [^1133VVmi] [^116kfTgS]. Hold on, I should verify post-ablation guidance: expert consensus supports bridging when initiating warfarin after ablation if not already anticoagulated, with attention to minimizing bleeding, which is a niche but important scenario [^111qh27E].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most AF patients undergoing elective procedures, stop warfarin 5 days pre-op and do not bridge, then resume warfarin 12–24 hours post-op when hemostasis is secure. For device implantation, prefer continued therapeutic warfarin over interruption with bridging to reduce pocket hematoma. For VTE, avoid routine bridging and reserve it for high-risk phenotypes such as very recent events, active cancer, or severe thrombophilia. For mechanical valves, individualize and avoid reflexive bridging, recognizing that mitral-position or prior thromboembolism may tilt toward bridging in select cases after multidisciplinary discussion [^114UwJy8] [^1178Szfi] [^1163LAZM] [^115ErXWS] [^117Eu9yG] [^1158iCqD].

> I should confirm dosing and timing details if bridging is chosen despite risks. Full-dose LMWH regimens such as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily or dalteparin 100 IU/kg twice daily are standard, with the last preoperative dose given about 24 hours before the procedure and often at half the total daily dose to mitigate intraoperative bleeding; postoperatively, wait at least 24 hours after low-to-moderate bleed risk procedures and 48–72 hours after high bleed risk procedures before restarting therapeutic LMWH, and consider low-dose prophylaxis initially if early anticoagulation is needed but bleeding risk remains high [^114UwJy8] [^114mcHVo] [^115yhoay]. Hold on, I should verify that routine anti-Xa monitoring is not advised; CHEST suggests against routine anti-Xa level checks during LMWH bridging, which helps streamline care [^111L5NAZ].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In pregnancy with mechanical valves, maternal thrombotic risk is high and bridging strategies require specialist input given historical complications with LMWH. In LVAD patients, early UFH bridging after implantation is standard per transplant society guidance. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and bridging is generally avoided unless clearly high risk. For DOACs, interruption without bridging is the norm given short half-lives, with resumption timing tailored to agent, renal function, and procedural bleeding risk [^111RwQHd] [^1121MbS5] [^113MKsNV] [^112jnRz3] [^115ErXWS].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence and guidelines. Routine heparin bridging is not indicated for most patients, especially those with AF or VTE undergoing elective procedures. Bridging may be considered for patients at very high thrombotic risk such as certain mechanical valves, recent arterial or venous thromboembolism, active cancer, or severe thrombophilia, but only after weighing bleeding risk and coordinating timing carefully, and even then the balance often favors no bridging given consistent increases in bleeding without proven reductions in thromboembolism in randomized and pooled analyses [^114tPkxh] [^115NMEks] [^112Q3U5X] [^117CLx8R].

Heparin-to-warfarin bridging is indicated for patients at **high thromboembolic risk** who require temporary interruption of warfarin for procedures or surgery, including those with mechanical heart valves (especially mitral or older-generation), recent venous thromboembolism (within 3 months), or atrial fibrillation with very high stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 4 with prior stroke/TIA) [^1126HKPY] [^1158iCqD]. Bridging is not recommended for low-to-moderate risk patients, including those with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation without recent stroke/TIA [^114tPkxh], as it increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^115nZcRy]. For device procedures, continue warfarin rather than bridging [^113dJJA3] [^1163LAZM]. Individualize decisions based on patient risk, procedure type, and timing [^114jb8NA].

---

## Indications for heparin-to-warfarin bridging

### Mechanical heart valves

- **High-risk mechanical valves**: Mitral or tricuspid mechanical valves, or older-generation valves (e.g. ball-in-cage, tilting-disc) [^111DKmXC].
- **Recent thromboembolic events**: History of valve thrombosis or thromboembolism despite therapeutic anticoagulation [^notfound].
- **Multiple mechanical valves**: Especially if any are mitral or older-generation [^115WzPew].

---

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE)

Recent VTE within 3 months carries a **high recurrence risk** during warfarin interruption [^117Eu9yG]. Severe thrombophilia (e.g. antithrombin III deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome) also confers high recurrence risk and may warrant bridging [^115xyL1o].

---

### Atrial fibrillation (AF)

AF patients with **very high stroke risk** — CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 4 with prior stroke or TIA — are appropriate candidates for bridging [^1126HKPY]. Recent stroke or TIA (within 3 months) likewise represents high short-term thromboembolic risk [^notfound].

---

## Situations where bridging is not recommended

### Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)

For **low-to-moderate stroke risk** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≤ 3 without prior stroke/TIA), bridging increases bleeding without reducing thromboembolism [^114tPkxh]. The BRIDGE trial showed that forgoing bridging was noninferior for thromboembolism and reduced major bleeding [^115kywJb].

---

### Pacemaker or defibrillator implantation

For pacemaker or defibrillator implantation, **continued warfarin** is preferred over interruption with bridging to reduce pocket hematoma risk [^113dJJA3] [^1163LAZM].

---

### Low bleeding risk procedures

For low bleeding risk procedures (e.g. dental, dermatologic, cataract), **continued warfarin** is acceptable and bridging is unnecessary [^116wGkvC].

---

## Risks and benefits of bridging

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduces thromboembolism in high-risk patients | Increases bleeding complications [^114tPkxh] |
| Maintains anticoagulation during warfarin interruption | Prolonged hospitalization and higher costs [^114zpXGN] |
| Individualized based on patient risk and procedure | Not beneficial in low-to-moderate risk patients [^114tPkxh] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **CHEST 2022**: Bridging for high thromboembolic risk; avoid in low-to-moderate risk [^1126HKPY].
- **ACC/AHA 2024**: No bridging for AF (except mechanical valves or recent stroke/TIA); continue warfarin for device procedures [^115ErXWS].
- **ASH 2018**: Avoid routine bridging in VTE; reserve for high-risk cases [^1149ARZf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Use UFH or adjust LMWH dosing [^112vn2YQ].
- **Bleeding risk**: Individualize bridging; delay postoperative LMWH if bleeding risk is high [^114mcHVo].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and procedure type influence decisions [^114jb8NA].

---

Heparin-to-warfarin bridging is indicated for **high-risk patients** — mechanical heart valves, recent VTE, or AF with very high stroke risk — but is not recommended for low-to-moderate risk patients because of increased bleeding without added benefit. Individualize decisions based on patient risk, procedure, and timing.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions.

It is impossible to confidently estimate the GI procedural bleeding risk associated with uninterrupted warfarin therapy (vs warfarin interruption), given the limitations of the published literature, heterogeneity of patient populations and procedure type, and imprecision of the results. The absence of studies in advanced endoscopic procedures (with higher baseline bleeding risk), and differences in clinical consequences of luminal and extraluminal bleeding associated with such endoscopic GI procedures, limits our ability to comment on the safety of proceeding without interrupting warfarin. The evolving role of mechanical hemostasis may render some advanced procedures safer with continued warfarin in the future; however, current evidence supporting this strategy is scant.

The planned procedure type (Table 3) and its associated risk of postprocedural bleeding, and the baseline risk of thromboembolism will influence the recommendation, as will resource requirements associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of anticoagulation (e.g. laboratory tests and clinic visits). For patients on warfarin who are undergoing elective and planned outpatient endoscopic GI procedures, we suggest warfarin be continued unless they are undergoing an advanced endoscopic procedure (Table 3), which may incur a higher risk of procedural bleeding, in which case 5 days of temporary interruption without bridging heparin would be appropriate, as discussed in PICO 12.

Bridge therapy — evidence on perioperative heparin bridging for vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — indicates limited benefit: A meta-analysis of 34 studies (total of 12,278 patients included) of vitamin K antagonist users undergoing elective procedures found no difference in thrombotic events between bridged and unbridged groups; two randomized trials (PERIOP2 and BRIDGE) assessing bridging patients on warfarin found no reduction in thromboembolic events versus placebo; and in DOAC-treated atrial fibrillation patients (PAUSE), discontinuing DOACs without heparin bridging yielded low thromboembolic event rates. The text also notes that, for certain patients, the risks of bridging may outweigh the benefits.

### Personalizing bridging anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation-a microsimulation analysis [^113AExWN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation who are initiating warfarin or require interruption of anticoagulation. Current guidelines recommend bridging for patients at high risk of stroke. Among patients with atrial fibrillation and one or more risk factors for ischemic stroke, the recently published BRIDGE trial found forgoing bridging during interruption to be, on average, noninferior to bridging with respect to ischemic complications, with significantly fewer hemorrhagic complications.

Objective

We sought to examine the benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation across the spectrum of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk and thereby enable more nuanced, risk-stratified decision-making when bridging is considered during initiation or interruption of vitamin K antagonists.

Design

A Monte Carlo simulation, using a combination of literature-derived estimates, registry data, and trial data.

Main Measures

Net clinical benefit, weighting for ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhages, and extracranial major hemorrhages.

Key Results

The benefits and harms of bridging anticoagulation vary according to underlying patient risk profiles for both thromboembolic stroke and major intracranial bleeding. Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of hemorrhage derive benefit from bridging during initiation or interruption of warfarin therapy. Patients at similarly high or low risk of both outcomes may receive benefit from bridging during initiation and bridging during interruption, but this was sensitive to underlying assumptions. The need for stratification along both axes of risk was robust to a wide range of parameters.

Conclusions

Bridging anticoagulation may provide benefit to patients at high risk of ischemic stroke and low risk of intracranial hemorrhage who are initiating or interrupting warfarin therapy, while patients at high or low risk of both complications may be harmed. The use of bridging anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation should be considered only after stratification by risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112vn2YQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Heparin bridging — management points should be considered when administering heparin bridging, including that bridging is most often done with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) using a therapeutic-dose regimen (eg, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg bid, dalteparin 100 IU/kg bid); bridging with therapeutic-dose IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) is another treatment option, for example, in patients with severe renal insufficiency or who are dialysis-dependent; and other types of heparin bridging may include intermediate-dose regimens (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg bid). Heparin bridging should be administered in a manner to minimize the risk for bleeding that would require re-operation or another intervention, and avoidance of major bleeding is important because it typically requires a longer period of anticoagulant interruption that, in turn, exposes patients to an increased risk for thromboembolism.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^116GFjDS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which include apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, are now first‐line therapy for treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Many patients taking chronic anticoagulant therapy will require temporary interruption for a surgical procedure. Management of the anticoagulant in the perioperative period can be complicated because the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent differ, most significantly as compared with warfarin.

Because of its long half‐life, warfarin is often interrupted several days before the procedure. For patients with a high risk of thrombotic complications, "bridging" therapy with low molecular weight heparin or other short‐acting parenteral anticoagulants are frequently used while the anticoagulant activity of warfarin wanes or returns to therapeutic range. This practice, however, is associated with higher risk of bleeding compared with those in whom bridging therapy was not initiated. In contrast to warfarin, DOACs have both a short half‐life and rapid onset of action, which make them ideal for perioperative use and removes the necessity of bridging anticoagulation. Prior studies have compared postoperative outcomes of patients following the perioperative interruption of DOACs vs. warfarin and found no major differences in postoperative rates of major bleeding or thromboembolic events. However, because these were post hoc analyses of clinical trials, the patient samples include a more selective population that is commonly seen in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to compare 30‐day postoperative bleeding and thromboembolic events associated with DOAC versus warfarin management in the perioperative period in a practice‐based cohort of patients.

### The BRIDGE trial: what the hospitalist should know [^115kywJb]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation patients often require warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure or surgery. Heparin bridging therapy has been frequently used during warfarin interruption under the premise of providing a theoretical mitigation against thromboembolism that overweighs expected higher rates of bleeding. Up until recently, little definite clinical evidence was available to guide the hospitalist on optimal perioperative anticoagulant management. The landmark BRIDGE (Perioperative Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial provided high-quality evidence that a simple interruption of warfarin in the average atrial fibrillation patient undergoing an elective procedure or surgery is noninferior to bridging therapy for efficacy and superior to bridging therapy in preventing major bleeding. To guide the hospitalist, we propose a treatment algorithm based on these recent data. We review the literature that led to the trial and highlight its practice-changing implications as a proof of concept that calls to question the premise of heparin bridging therapy beyond the atrial fibrillation population.

### Reduced-dose warfarin or interrupted warfarin with heparin bridging for pacemaker or defibrillator implantation: a randomized trial [^111pWeAz]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative management with reduced-dose warfarin is of potential interest by eliminating the need for bridging while still maintaining a degree of anticoagulation. The outcomes of this regimen have not been well determined.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial we compared two regimens for management of anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with implantation of a pacemaker or defibrillator. Half dose of warfarin for 3–6 days, depending on the baseline international normalized ratio (INR), before surgery aiming at an INR of ≤ 1.7 was compared with interrupted warfarin for 5 days with preoperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) at therapeutic dose for 2.5 days. Main safety outcome was pocket hematoma. Secondary outcomes were major bleeding, thromboembolism - all within 1 month, days of hospitalization and number of patients requiring correction of INR with vitamin K.

Results

The study was planned for 450 patients but it was discontinued prematurely due to a change in practice. Pocket hematoma occurred in 4 of 85 patients (5%) randomized to the bridged regimen and in 3 of 86 patients (3%) randomized to reduced-dose warfarin. One pocket hematoma in each group was severe. There were no major hemorrhages or thromboembolism within the 1-month window. Duration of hospitalization was similar in the two groups. Correction of INR the day before surgery with vitamin K had to be used for significantly more patients in the reduced-dose warfarin group (41%) than in the bridged regimen group (6%).

Conclusion

The reduced-dose warfarin regimen appeared to have similar safety after device implantation as interrupted warfarin with preoperative LMWH bridging. Due to premature discontinuation no firm conclusion can be drawn. The reduced-dose warfarin regimen often failed to achieve the intended preoperative INR.

### Pacemaker or defibrillator surgery without interruption of anticoagulation [^113dJJA3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients requiring pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) surgery are taking warfarin. For patients at high risk for thromboembolic events, guidelines recommend bridging therapy with heparin; however, case series suggest that it may be safe to perform surgery without interrupting warfarin treatment. There have been few results from clinical trials to support the safety and efficacy of this approach.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with an annual risk of thromboembolic events of 5% or more to continued warfarin treatment or to bridging therapy with heparin. The primary outcome was clinically significant device-pocket hematoma, which was defined as device-pocket hematoma that necessitated prolonged hospitalization, interruption of anticoagulation therapy, or further surgery (e.g., hematoma evacuation).

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial after the second prespecified interim analysis. Clinically significant device-pocket hematoma occurred in 12 of 343 patients (3.5%) in the continued-warfarin group, as compared with 54 of 338 (16.0%) in the heparin-bridging group (relative risk, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Major surgical and thromboembolic complications were rare and did not differ significantly between the study groups. They included one episode of cardiac tamponade and one myocardial infarction in the heparin-bridging group and one stroke and one transient ischemic attack in the continued-warfarin group.

Conclusions

As compared with bridging therapy with heparin, a strategy of continued warfarin treatment at the time of pacemaker or ICD surgery markedly reduced the incidence of clinically significant device-pocket hematoma.

### Heparin bridging in warfarin anticoagulation therapy initiation could increase bleeding in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients: a multicenter propensity-matched analysis [^116kfTgS]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of heparin-bridging therapy during the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAC) in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of heparin-bridging therapy during OAC initiation in NVAF patients.

Patients/Methods

This study included 5327 consecutive warfarin-naïve NVAF patients who received OAC that was initiated with (n = 1053) or without (n = 4274) heparin bridging at four tertiary hospitals. Stroke and bleeding events within 30 days of OAC were evaluated.

Results

While there was no difference in the incidence of stroke (0.5% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.381), major bleeding rate (0.9% vs. 0.3%, P = 0.004) was higher in heparin-bridged than in non-bridged patients. This trend remained in the propensity score-matched population (stroke 0.5% vs. 0.6%, P = 0.762; major bleeding 0.8% vs. 0.1%, P = 0.019). A high CHA2 DS2 -VASc score was an independent predictor for stroke, whereas bridging therapy had no beneficial effect in preventing stroke regardless of CHADS2 or CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores. The HAS-BLED score had a predictive value for major bleeding (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.11–2.92, P = 0.018), and heparin-bridging therapy was associated with a higher major bleeding rate (odds ratio 4.44, 95% confidence interval 1.68–11.72, P = 0.003), especially in patients with a HAS-BLED score of ≥ 1.

Conclusions

The heparin-bridging therapy increased bleeding without the benefit of preventing stroke at the initiation of OAC in NVAF. Our data suggest that heparin bridging should not be considered at the initiation of OAC in NVAF patients.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

Periprocedural management

Whether to discontinue VKAs in patients undergoing a procedure depends on the degree of invasiveness and expected bleeding. Minor dental or surgical procedures associated with minimal bleeding risk may allow for continuation of VKA; however, coordination with the proceduralist and the provider managing anticoagulation is needed. For more invasive procedures, VKA doses should be held 4 to 5 days before the procedure to allow INR values to return to normal. Because of the initial prothrombotic state and delayed onset of anticoagulation with initiation of VKAs, a practice of bridging with a shorter-acting anticoagulant (usually UFH or LMWH) may be instituted. Adult studies have shown that perioperative bridging therapy may not be needed for most patients, especially in light of the fact that it has been shown to lead to a threefold increased risk of major bleeding. Adult patients who may require bridging are those at high risk of thrombosis, including patients who have had a recent VTE within the previous month, who have a history of VTE during prior pauses in anticoagulation therapy, or in those who are undergoing a procedure with high inherent risk for VTE. A single-center retrospective study in children reported no instances of major bleeding or thromboembolism in 61 instances of periprocedural interruption in warfarin, whether bridging was instituted or not, and, therefore, the authors suggest bridging only for pediatric patients at high risk for thrombosis. Postoperatively, anticoagulation should be initiated as soon as the bleeding risk has declined and it is deemed safe by the proceduralist. For those who are bridging, the bridging agent should be continued until the INR has reached desired therapeutic range.

Management of bleeding

Management of bleeding in patients with VTE being treated with VKAs is mostly extrapolated from the adult data. The adult guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians suggest that for INR between 4.5 and 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be held until the INR returns to the desired range. For INRs of > 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be reversed with oral vitamin K. For major bleeding at any INR level, VKAs should be reversed rapidly with IV vitamin K along with an activated prothrombin concentrate. Limited pediatric data have shown that most children on VKAs with supratherapeutic INR values and no bleeding symptoms may be safely monitored with observation alone.

### Anticoagulation therapy: perioperative anticoagulation-are we at' a bridge too far'? [^116HWte5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The perioperative management of patients with atrial fibrillation who require an elective surgical or other invasive procedure is an area of ongoing uncertainty. Accumulating evidence from observational studies suggests that the use of bridging anticoagulation with heparin, although well-intentioned, might not reduce perioperative thromboembolism and can increase bleeding.

### The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116wGkvC]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). The primary objectives of this article are the following: (1) to address the perioperative management of patients who are receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and require an elective surgical or other invasive procedures; and (2) to address the perioperative use of bridging anticoagulation, typically with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). A secondary objective is to address the perioperative management of such patients who require urgent surgery. The recommendations in this article incorporate the grading system that is discussed in this supplement (Guyatt G et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Briefly, Grade 1 recommendations are considered strong and indicate that the benefits do (or do not) outweigh risks, burden, and costs, whereas Grade 2 recommendations are referred to as suggestions and imply that individual patient values may lead to different management choices. The key recommendations in this article include the following: in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose subcutaneous (SC) LMWH or IV UFH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 1C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at moderate risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH, therapeutic-dose IV UFH, or low-dose SC LMWH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 2C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at low risk for thromboembolism, we suggest low-dose SC LMWH or no bridging over bridging with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH or IV UFH (Grade 2C). In patients with a bare metal coronary stent who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C); in patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C). In patients who are undergoing minor dental procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure and co-administering an oral prohemostatic agent (Grade 1B); in patients who are undergoing minor dermatologic procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C); in patients who are undergoing cataract removal and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C).

### Peri-procedural anticoagulation in patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation [^111EYwwQ]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is being used with increasing frequency as a strategy to manage atrial fibrillation. Patients undergoing this procedure are at increased short-term risk of thromboembolism for several days and up to 4 weeks or longer after their ablation, and anticoagulation management surrounding the ablation procedure remains controversial. Although no conclusive recommendations can be made, published guidelines and data support therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 weeks prior and intravenous heparin during the ablation. Warfarin may either be continued through the ablation or stopped 2–5 days prior. If the latter approach is chosen, a pre-ablation bridging strategy of enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily is reasonable in selected patients unless the patient's bleeding risk dictates using a lower dose regimen (0.5mg/kg twice daily) or avoiding bridging altogether. Fewer data are available for post-ablation management strategies, and current practice patterns are based largely on single-center experiences in smaller, non-randomized studies. For lower risk patients (CHADS₂ 0–1), either warfarin or aspirin may be utilized without bridging. In higher thromboembolic risk patients (CHADS₂ ≥ 2), either enoxaparin (1mg/kg twice daily) or heparin may be started within the first 12–24h post-procedure. For patients with bleeding risk factors, enoxaparin may be subsequently reduced to 0.5mg/kg until the INR is therapeutic, although the efficacy of this lower dosing regimen has not been well studied. In accordance with national guidelines, warfarin should be continued post-ablation for a minimum of 2 months and then indefinitely in patients with a CHADS₂ score ≥ 2.

### Comparison of a single end point to determine optimal initial warfarin dosing (5 mg versus 10 mg) for venous thromboembolism [^111cWavH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

There remains considerable controversy regarding optimal initial warfarin dosing in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Therefore, an open-label, randomized trial comparing 2 warfarin initiation nomograms (5 vs 10 mg) was conducted in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. All participants received fondaparinux for ≥ 5 days as a "bridge" to warfarin. The primary end point was defined as the number of days necessary to achieve 2 consecutive international normalized ratio laboratory test values > 1.9. A total of 50 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to each of the treatment arms. The median time to 2 consecutive international normalized ratios was 5 days in the 2 groups. There was no statistical difference in achieving the primary end point using either the 5- or the 10-mg nomogram (p = 0.69). These results should provide clinicians with increased warfarin dosing options in patients presenting with acute venous thromboembolism.

### Periprocedural anticoagulation management of patients with venous thromboembolism [^113SKHc6]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) often require temporary warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure. The incidence of thromboembolism and bleeding related to periprocedural anticoagulation management of such patients is unknown.

Methods and Results

In a protocol-driven, inception cohort design study, all VTE patients (n = 775) referred for periprocedural anticoagulation management (1997–2007) were followed-up to estimate the 3-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism and bleeding. Patients were stratified by thrombus acuity (acute, < 30 days; subacute, 31–90 days; or chronic ≥ 91 days). Decisions to provide "bridging" low-molecular-weight heparin were based on estimated thromboembolism and bleeding risk. Low-molecular-weight heparin was more often administered in acute (87%) and subacute (81%) VTE compared to chronic VTE (59%; P < 0.001). The 3-month cumulative incidence of thromboembolism (1.8%), major hemorrhage (1.8%), and mortality (1.7%) were low and did not differ by management strategy. Active cancer was the only independent predictor of thrombotic recurrence (HR, 4.86; 95% CI, 1.6–14.5; P = 0.005), major hemorrhage (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 2.1–21.7; P = 0.001), and death (HR, 32.7; 95% CI, 4.3–251.2; P = 0.0008).

Conclusions

Thromboembolism, bleeding, and death among VTE patients in whom anticoagulation is temporarily interrupted for an invasive procedure is low. Cancer patients require particular care given their propensity for both clotting and bleeding.

### The effect of heparin infusion intensity on outcomes for bridging hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation [^117VsDKs]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative bridging in atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with low thromboembolic rates but high bleeding rates. Recent guidance cautions the practice of bridging except in high risk patients. However, the practice of bridging varies widely and little data exist regarding appropriate anticoagulation intensity when using intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Hypothesis

To determine if high intensity UFH infusion regimens are associated with increased bleeding rates compared to low intensity regimens for bridging patients with AF.

Methods

We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of admitted patients with non-valvular AF receiving UFH for ≥ 24hours. UFH intensities were chosen at the providers' discretion. The primary endpoint was the rate of bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis during UFH infusion or within 24hours of discontinuation. The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events, arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarctions and death during UFH infusion.

Results

A total of 497 patients were included in this analysis. Warfarin was used in 82.1% and direct acting oral anticoagulants in 14.1% of patients. The rate of any bleed was higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens (10.5% vs 4.9%, odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–4.90). Major bleeding was significantly higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens. There was no difference in composite thrombotic events or death.

Conclusions

Low intensity UFH infusions, targeting lower anticoagulation targets, were associated with decreased bleeding rates without a signal of increased thromboembolic events in hospitalized AF patients.

### Regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy: American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine evidence-based guidelines (fifth edition) [^115xyL1o]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Periprocedural warfarin management and bridging — For patients at high thromboembolic risk (defined as a risk of arterial thrombosis of > 10% per year or venous thromboembolism [VTE] risk exceeding 10% per month), bridging therapy may be used, whereas the ACCP guidelines recommend against heparin bridging for patients at low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk. Warfarin is discontinued 5 days prior to the surgical date, and in high-risk patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; enoxaparin 1 mg/kg two times per day) is initiated once the PT INR has fallen below the lower end of the target range, ensuring creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min and platelet counts (≥ 100×10⁹/L); the last dose of LMWH is given in the morning on the day preceding the procedure. For VTE indications, bridging LMWH can be considered if the thrombotic event occurred within 3 months, if there is active cancer, or if documented severe thrombophilia is present; otherwise, warfarin can be stopped 5 days prior and restarted after the procedure, with appropriate DVT prophylaxis warranted during the periprocedural interval prior to therapeutic warfarin resumption.

### Postoperative low molecular weight heparin bridging treatment for patients at high risk of arterial thromboembolism (PERIOP2): double blind randomised controlled trial [^115WzPew]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and oversight

PERIOP2 was a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. The protocol was designed by the steering committee and approved by the institutional review board at each participating centre. The study was funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR-MCT79607) and had support from Pfizer in the form of the study drug. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00432796). Pfizer did not have any role in the design or conduct of the study, analysis of the data, or preparation of the manuscript. The study drugs (dalteparin or placebo) were prepared in each local centre by pharmacists not involved in the patient's care.

Patients

We used the same patient population as our pilot study. Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they were aged 18 years or older and had mechanical heart valves (with or without atrial fibrillation), atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter and a CHADS 2 risk factor (previous transient ischaemic attack or stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, age greater than 75, moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction). Additionally, eligible patients were receiving long term anticoagulation with warfarin and required elective non-cardiac surgery or an invasive procedure in which the physician requested an absence of warfarin effect. Patients were excluded for any of the following reasons: active bleeding within 30 days before stopping warfarin; platelet count < 100×10⁹/L; spinal or neurosurgery; life expectancy less than three months; calculated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min; multiple mechanical valves or a Starr-Edwards valve, mechanical valve with history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy [^113f8nWk]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy provides guidelines for outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy. The ACCP guidelines recommend short-term warfarin therapy, with the goal of maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 ± 0.5, after major orthopedic surgery. Therapy for venous thromboembolism includes an INR of 2.5 ± 0.5, with the length of therapy determined by associated conditions. For patients with atrial fibrillation, the INR is maintained at 2.5 ± 0.5 indefinitely; for most patients with mechanical valves, the recommended INR is 3.0 ± 0.5 indefinitely. Use of outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as safe and effective as inpatient unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. The ACCP recommends starting warfarin with unfractionated heparin or LMWH for at least five days and continuing until a therapeutic INR is achieved. Because patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer who have been treated with LMWH have a survival advantage that extends beyond their venous thromboembolism treatment, the ACCP recommends beginning their therapy with three to six months of LMWH. When invasive procedures require the interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy, recommendations for bridge therapy are determined by balancing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism. Patients at higher risk of thromboembolization should stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery and start LMWH or unfractionated heparin two to three days before surgery.

Vitamin K antagonist therapy — bridging for a single subtherapeutic INR: For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). Supporting observational data include a 2008 retrospective study of 2,597 adults in which 1,080 low-INR patients were matched to 1,517 therapeutic-INR patients with no significant difference in thromboembolic events, and a study of 294 mechanical heart valve patients where bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin was prescribed in 14 cases and thromboembolic event incidence was 0.3% (95% CI, 0%-1.9%) overall and 0.4% (95% CI, 0%-2.0%) without bridging.

### Left ventricular assist devices: a primer for the general cardiologist [^1121MbS5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

ANTICOAGULATION AND ANTIPLATELET THERAPY

Because of the interaction of blood along the surface of the LVAD, with a resultant development of thrombus, all patients require anticoagulation with coumadin and aspirin. Once perioperative bleeding and coagulopathy subside, anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is usually initiated, with an INR goal of 2.0 to 3.0. International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines recommend intravenous unfractionated heparin bridging within 48 hours after LVAD implantation. The recommended dose of aspirin is 325mg for patients with an HMII or HeartWare device, and 81 mg for an HM3 device.

However, it is important to remember that the anticoagulation regimen of an individual patient may be adjusted based on their personal history and their risk of bleeding versus clotting. This may result in some patients being on reduced or no anticoagulation.

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^1178Szfi]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116d1oAY]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

### The effect of heparin infusion intensity on outcomes for bridging hospitalized patients with atrial fibrillation [^111M3iFN]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a 4‐ to 5‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to patients in sinus rhythm. 1 The annual risk of stroke is 1.69% to 4.2% in patients with AF, with 15% of strokes in the United States attributed to AF. 2 To mitigate this risk, hospitalized patients are often treated with parenteral anticoagulation during perioperative interruption of oral anticoagulation or while oral anticoagulation is sub‐therapeutic.

Recent studies suggest perioperative bridging in patients with AF provides limited benefit in terms of preventing thromboembolic events, but increases bleeding rates. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Most studies, including the BRIDGE trial, 3 the only randomized placebo‐controlled trial, evaluated perioperative bridging strategies for elective surgeries, whereas the data for bridging hospitalized patients with acute issues has until recently not been addressed. 5 These studies enrolled predominantly low to moderate thromboembolic risk patients (mean CHADS₂ = 2.1‐2.4 and CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 3.6‐4.1) and limited patients at higher thromboembolic risk. Studies have also shown that perioperative bridging in AF is associated with a 4‐fold risk of bleeding compared to non‐bridging strategies (any bleed rates: 5%‐34% and major bleed rates: 3%‐9%) with undifferentiated thromboembolic events (0%‐4%). 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Current guidelines and expert consensus support perioperative bridging with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients taking oral vitamin K antagonists who are at high risk for thromboembolism, indicated by a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score greater than 5 to 6 or a prior thromboembolic event. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, there is currently limited data and differing consensus within guidelines and literature regarding UFH dosing intensity for bridging in AF. The perioperative antithrombotic CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control aPTT value (considered low intensity), while the antithrombotic therapy in AF CHEST guidelines recommend targeting an anti‐Xa of 0.3 to 0.7 units/mL (considered high intensity). 10, 11 Furthermore, many major guidelines do not provide any recommendations on anticoagulation targets for bridging in AF. 8, 13, 14 Comparing the safety and efficacy of high vs low intensity UFH infusion regimens has not been addressed.

Continuation of VKAs around cardiac device procedures is based on the premise that the patient's INR at the time of the procedure is < 3.0.

Abstract

Background

Perioperative bridging in atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with low thromboembolic rates but high bleeding rates. Recent guidance cautions the practice of bridging except in high risk patients. However, the practice of bridging varies widely and little data exist regarding appropriate anticoagulation intensity when using intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Hypothesis

To determine if high intensity UFH infusion regimens are associated with increased bleeding rates compared to low intensity regimens for bridging patients with AF.

Methods

We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of admitted patients with non‐valvular AF receiving UFH for ≥ 24 hours. UFH intensities were chosen at the providers' discretion. The primary endpoint was the rate of bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis during UFH infusion or within 24 hours of discontinuation. The secondary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular events, arterial thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarctions and death during UFH infusion.

Results

A total of 497 patients were included in this analysis. Warfarin was used in 82.1% and direct acting oral anticoagulants in 14.1% of patients. The rate of any bleed was higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens (10.5% vs 4.9%, odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.07‐4.90). Major bleeding was significantly higher among high intensity compared to low intensity UFH regimens. There was no difference in composite thrombotic events or death.

Conclusions

Low intensity UFH infusions, targeting lower anticoagulation targets, were associated with decreased bleeding rates without a signal of increased thromboembolic events in hospitalized AF patients.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

### Periprocedural management of patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant requiring an elective procedure or surgery [^116WN6EW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic therapy with oral anticoagulants (OACs), including vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin and direct OACs (DOACs), is a common clinical problem. The optimal perioperative management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy is anchored on four key principles: (i) risk stratification of patient-related and procedure-related risks of thrombosis and bleeding; (ii) the clinical consequences of a thrombotic or bleeding event; (iii) discontinuation and reinitiation of OAC therapy on the basis of the pharmacokinetic properties of each agent; and (iv) whether aggressive management such as the use of periprocedural heparin bridging has advantages for the prevention of postoperative thromboembolism at the cost of a possible increase in bleeding risk. Recent data from randomized trials in patients receiving VKAs undergoing pacemaker/defibrillator implantation or using heparin bridging therapy for elective procedures or surgeries can now inform best practice. There are also emerging data on periprocedural outcomes in the DOAC trials for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes the evidence for the periprocedural management of patients receiving chronic OAC therapy, focusing on recent randomized trials and large outcome studies, to address three key clinical scenarios: (i) can OAC therapy be safely continued for minor procedures or surgeries; (ii) if therapy with VKAs (especially warfarin) needs to be temporarily interrupted for an elective procedure/surgery, is heparin bridging necessary; and (iii) what is the optimal periprocedural management of the DOACs? In answering these questions, we aim to provide updated clinical guidance for the periprocedural management of patients receiving VKA or DOAC therapy, including the use of heparin bridging.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of DOACs — evidence from randomized trials and observational analyses indicates that perioperative management in major DOAC vs warfarin trials was generally non-standardized with 15% to 20% receiving heparin bridging, and a meta-analysis of > 19,000 such patients reported perioperative ATE rates of 0.5% to 1.0% and major bleeding rates of 2% to 5%. Additional studies around catheter ablation showed mixed findings: an observational study reported an increase in bleeding with periprocedural DOAC continuation while another reported no difference, and a 306-patient randomized trial comparing 1-day interruption vs no interruption found no significant difference in bleeding outcomes (11.3% vs 9.7%; risk difference = 1.7%; 95% CI −5.5 to 8.8).

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115ErXWS]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) periprocedural anticoagulation management — In patients with AF (excluding those with recent stroke or TIA, or a mechanical valve) on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) undergoing an invasive procedure or surgery, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging anticoagulation is recommended. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation and an annual predicted risk of thromboembolism of ≥ 5% undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, continued anticoagulation is recommended in preference to interruption of warfarin and bridging anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of pocket hematoma. In patients with AF with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2 or equivalent risk of stroke on DOAC anticoagulation and undergoing pacemaker or defibrillator implantation or generator change, either uninterrupted or interrupted DOAC is reasonable. If an invasive procedure or surgery cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted DOAC, the timing of DOAC interruption should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. After DOAC interruption for a procedure or surgery, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated. For patients with AF on warfarin who are holding warfarin for a surgery or procedure, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered.

### Anticoagulation of patients on chronic warfarin undergoing arrhythmia device surgery: wide variability of perioperative bridging in Canada [^1118mhzR]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In patients undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery, it is common practice to discontinue oral anticoagulation and to perform heparin bridging in order to reduce the risk of bleeding and minimize the risk of thromboembolic events.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the perioperative anticoagulation strategies currently in use.

Methods

A survey presented four clinical scenarios of patients on oral anticoagulation undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery. The scenarios represented a gradient of perceived thromboembolic risk based on the presence of atrial fibrillation, a mechanical heart valve, previous stroke, and the remainder of the CHADS₂ risk factors (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > 75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack). Respondents were offered six options that included discontinuing oral anticoagulation without heparin, three different heparin bridging protocols, and ongoing oral anticoagulation with reduced or therapeutic dose warfarin.

Results

Based on responses from 38 (61%) of 62 electrophysiologists surveyed across Canada, 83% of respondents held warfarin without bridging in a low-risk, 78-year-old patient with atrial fibrillation (CHADS₂ score 1). In three higher-risk patient scenarios, 67% to 100% of respondents chose heparin bridging or ongoing warfarin; 38% to 72% of respondents chose heparin bridging, with 23% to 36% choosing variable use of ongoing warfarin. In all three cases where respondents indicated that they would bridge, each of the three heparin regimens was chosen by at least 20% of respondents.

Conclusion

There is a wide range of approaches to perioperative management in patients on oral anticoagulation undergoing cardiac rhythm device surgery. Clinical equipoise is evident and supports the need for comparative studies.

### LMWH for perioperative anticoagulation in patients on chronic warfarin therapy [^112SGmZy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current data regarding low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use for perioperative anticoagulation in patients receiving chronic warfarin therapy.

Data Sources

Data were obtained from the Sixth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy guidelines and a MEDLINE search (1996-January 2003). Search terms included heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, perioperative care, and anticoagulants.

Data Synthesis

Heparin is the most common agent used as bridge therapy for perioperative anticoagulation in patients on chronic warfarin therapy; LMWHs are also used. Studies that evaluated enoxaparin and/or dalteparin were reviewed.

Conclusions

Although published studies demonstrate efficacy and safety of LMWHs, more data are needed to support their use as bridge therapy.

Periprocedural anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation when uninterrupted therapy is not feasible — interruption and resumption: If a procedure cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, temporary cessation of oral anticoagulation without bridging is recommended (1) excluding those with recent stroke or TIA or a mechanical valve; the timing of interruption of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) should be guided by the specific agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk (1); bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin should not be administered except in patients with a mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA (3: Harm); and resumption of anticoagulation is the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery (2a).

### Who are we bridging? Description of warfarin patients receiving injectable bridging therapy [^115cZLCW]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence guiding the decision to provide injectable anticoagulant bridging therapy during periods of subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is sparse. This study aims to identify the types of patients currently bridged within an academic medical center's Thrombosis Service, to highlight patient populations for future study of bridging outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive cohort study included patients taking warfarin managed by University of Utah Health Thrombosis Service who received outpatient enoxaparin bridging between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Anticoagulation indication, reason for bridging, and type of procedure were validated via manual chart review.

Results

During the one-year study period, 181 unique patients (9.4% of the service's total warfarin population) experienced 244 bridging episodes, mostlyin the periprocedural setting (67.6%) for gastrointestinal-type procedures (39.4%). The most common anticoagulation indications in all bridged patients were antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (23.2%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (21.5%), or a mechanical mitral valve plus another indication (13.3%). Most bridging episodes for VTE occurred > 3 months from the acute event, with the rationale for bridging including breakthrough VTE (31%) or APS (23%). Just over one-half of bridged patients fit the guideline-recommended criteria for high thrombotic risk, and just over one-third were low-moderate thrombotic risk.

Conclusions

In this one-year outpatient study, warfarin patients received enoxaparin bridging most commonly due to a gastrointestinal procedural interruption in the setting of APS, VTE with a prior breakthrough thrombotic event, or mechanical mitral valve. Just over one-third of bridged patients were guideline-classified as low-moderate thrombotic risk, indicating these populations may warrant further investigation or bridging de-escalation.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anticoagulation management — vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption, bridging, and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) resumption — is summarized as follows: In atrial fibrillation (AF) patients on VKA, the BRIDGE trial randomized 1844 patients to low-molecular-weight heparin bridging or placebo starting 3 days preoperatively and continued 5 days postoperatively, with warfarin held from preoperative day 5 through postoperative day 1, and bridging anticoagulation was noninferior for prevention of thromboembolism but increased the risk of major bleeding; a simple DOAC interruption strategy without heparin bridging resulted in minimal time off DOAC with low bleeding and low thromboembolic risk, and among approximately 11% of DOAC-treated patients who received heparin bridging bleeding risk increased without reduction in thromboembolic risk, so most patients with AF will not benefit from bridging anticoagulation. For resumption after interruption, once hemostasis is achieved after a low or moderate bleeding risk procedure it is reasonable to restart VKA as early as 12 to 24 hours and it is suggested to resume VKA at the previous therapeutic dose, whereas DOACs should be resumed when full anticoagulation is clinically appropriate, which may be as early as 6 hours postoperatively if hemostasis has occurred; in the PAUSE trial, DOACs were resumed 48 to 72 hours after high bleeding risk procedures.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^112phF81]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Our study suggests that the periprocedural interruption of DOACs may be associated with a higher incidence of 30‐day minor bleeds, major bleeds, and bleeds requiring medical therapy when compared with the interruption of nonbridged warfarin. However, no difference in bleeding or thromboembolic events was noted between patients with warfarin who received bridging therapy and DOAC‐treated patients. Further studies that investigate the effects of perioperative interruption of DOACs and warfarin on postoperative outcomes while addressing potential issues of confounding variables are warranted.

### Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism: a registry-based cohort study [^115yzc3v]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of bridging anticoagulation increases a patient's bleeding risk without clear evidence of thrombotic prevention among warfarin-treated patients with atrial fibrillation. Contemporary use of bridging anticoagulation among warfarin-treated patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) has not been studied.

Methods

We identified warfarin-treated patients with VTE who temporarily stopped warfarin for a surgical procedure between 2010 and 2018 at six health systems. Using the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians guideline, we assessed use of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation based on recurrent VTE risk. Recurrent VTE risk and 30-day outcomes (bleeding, thromboembolism, emergency department visit) were each assessed using logistic regression adjusted for multiple procedures per patient.

Results

During the study period, 789 warfarin-treated patients with VTE underwent 1529 procedures (median, 2; interquartile range, 1–4). Unadjusted use of bridging anticoagulation was more common in patients at high risk for VTE recurrence (99/171, 57.9%) than for patients at moderate (515/1078, 47.8%) or low risk of recurrence (134/280, 47.86%). Bridging anticoagulation use was higher in high-risk patients compared with low- or moderate-risk patients in both unadjusted (P = 0.013) and patient-level cluster-adjusted analyses (P = 0.031). Adherence to American College of Chest Physicians guidelines in high- and low-risk patients did not change during the study period (odds ratio, 0.98 per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.05). Adverse events were rare and not statistically different between the two treatment groups.

Conclusions

Bridging anticoagulation was commonly overused among low-risk patients and underused among high-risk patients treated with warfarin for VTE. Adverse events were rare and not different between the two treatment groups.

### Perioperative bridging interruption with heparin for the patient receiving long-term anticoagulation [^113cbZHD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a timely and concise review of the most recent clinical data in the field of bridging (anticoagulation) therapy with heparin for the at-risk patient receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who requires temporary interruption for an elective invasive procedure or surgery.

Recent Findings

A recent systematic review found that the quality of studies of bridging therapy published before June 2001 was generally poor. More recent larger prospective cohort studies and registries of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation, including patients with mechanical heart valves, who underwent bridging therapy with mostly treatment-dose low-molecular-weight heparin for both major and non-major elective invasive procedures or surgeries have been completed. These studies reveal an overall thromboembolic complication rate of 1.22 (95% CI 0.81–1.77) and an overall major bleed rate of 2.94 (95% CI 2.28–3.74). Standardized low-molecular-weight heparin bridging regimens using postoperative bleeding risk assessments optimized good clinical outcomes, and bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin appears to be at least as safe as unfractionated heparin and produces substantial cost savings through reduction in length of stay in the hospital.

Summary

Perioperative bridging therapy with heparin, either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, appears to be safe and effective for patients, including those with mechanical heart valves, receiving long-term oral anticoagulation who require temporary interruption, especially for non-high-bleeding risk procedures such as minor surgery and invasive procedures. Further studies, including randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials, are needed to optimize bridging therapy for specific patients and procedures.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SrpqN]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention to some limitations of this study is needed. First, 12 out of the 18 studies were observational, and the number of patients enrolled in the randomized controlled trials was relatively small. Second, the heterogeneity of results among studies was high, which may relate to the variations in the preoperative thromboembolic risks, types of procedure and definitions of outcomes. Third, few patients were classified as high thromboembolic risk, 13, 20, 22, 25, 26 and the safety and benefit of bridging anticoagulation among these patients remain uncertain. Fourth, most of the included studies were relevant to warfarin‐treated patients; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to patients receiving NOACs. Fifth, types and doses of bridging regimens (UFH or LWMH; prophylactic dose or therapeutic dose), and the timing of periprocedural initiation of bridging were different across studies. Finally, we are unable to conduct subgroup analyses of high‐risk vs low‐risk procedures and outcomes of fatal bleeding due to unavailability of individual data of the included studies.

In conclusion, bridging anticoagulation was associated with increased bleeding risk compared to non‐bridging management. Besides, thromboembolism risk was similar between these two strategies. Our results do not support the use of routine bridging during the periprocedural interruption of oral anticoagulation.

### Chronically anticoagulated patients who need surgery: can low-molecular-weight heparins really be used to "bridge" patients instead of intravenous unfractionated heparin? [^1115K8hg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Patients at high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events often receive chronic treatment with long-term oral anticoagulants such as warfarin. However, if these patients require an invasive procedure, they may require a temporary interruption of their warfarin therapy to minimize their bleeding risk during the procedure. As warfarin has a long half-life and an unpredictable pharmacokinetic profile, short-acting parenteral anticoagulants, such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), may be of benefit in protecting the patient from thromboemboli while their warfarin dose is withheld. Such "bridging therapy" has traditionally been provided in-hospital with intravenous UFH; however, recent data have suggested that LMWH may be an effective alternative, with potential cost-savings due to the ability to provide bridging therapy in the outpatient setting.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^112FM2o4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), a treatable risk factor for ischemic stroke, is considered a worldwide epidemic predicted to increase in the coming decades. Indeed, in 2010, the estimated global prevalence of AF was 33.5 million. 1 Oral anticoagulation is the cornerstone treatment for NVAF patients with a moderate or high risk of thromboembolic complication. 2

Although direct oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) have been on the market since 2010, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs: warfarin, acenocoumarol, fluindione) remain a standard treatment in the management of NVAF.

Recently, several studies have examined the risks of bleeding and of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (IS/SE) associated with perioperative heparin bridging anticoagulation in patients with NVAF. 3, 4, 5, 6 However, no studies have investigated bridging risks during VKA initiation in outpatient settings.

It has been shown that the bleeding risk is highest during the first month of VKA initiation. 7 This risk may be greatest when a VKA is combined with another antithrombotic agent, particularly in patients for whom a bridging therapy is indicated. Bridging therapy at the initiation of VKA therapy consists of transitioning a bridging agent (low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH] or other pentasaccharide, eg, fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin) to a VKA.

There is an overall consensus in favor of a bridging therapy prior to urgent cardioversion in patients with life‐threatening hemodynamic instability caused by new‐onset NVAF. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The recommendation in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 is less clear for those with stable NVAF who do not require rapid anticoagulation. In real‐life conditions, a bridging regimen is commonly used in those with a low stroke risk. 16, 17, 18, 19 This practice is not supported by evidence.

VKA use has declined recently in favor of direct oral anticoagulants; however, the latest available results have shown that they are still more widely used than direct oral anticoagulants. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Since millions of patients worldwide may be at risk of being unnecessarily exposed to bridging therapy, adverse health outcomes associated with management of VKA still warrant investigation.

Therefore, the purpose of this cohort study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a bridging regimen during the initiation of VKA therapy in NVAF patients in outpatient care.

Conclusions

Bridging therapy was widely used at the initiation of oral anticoagulation in a stable NVAF population. This practice did not decrease the IS/SE risk but increased the bleeding risk. These findings do not support the use of routine bridging in this population.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

VTE maintenance and bridging guidance emphasizes VTE-specific dosing and selective use of parenteral bridging. The VTE maintenance dose of rivaroxaban should be 20 mg daily, not 15 mg daily, as studied in the PIONEER-AF-PCI trial. An unusual scenario described is a patient on a treatment dose of a DOAC for VTE prior to PCI who develops significant renal dysfunction, warranting transition to a VKA. In patients requiring a VKA, bridging with low–molecular-weight heparin is associated with increased bleeding risk and should therefore be reserved for patients judged to be at a very high risk of recurrent VTE, such as those within 3 months of a VTE.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nZcRy]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An estimated 2.5 million patients use oral anticoagulants for the prevention of arterial thromboembolic events in North America, and one‐tenth of them require temporary interruption in preparation for an elective procedure or surgery. 1, 2 However, the safety and efficacy of bridging anticoagulation is not completely clarified for patients who need an anticoagulation interruption before invasive procedures. Two main concerns remain unsolved, the risk of thromboembolism, and the risk of bleeding. 1, 2

To reduce the bleeding risk for patients undergoing invasive procedures, oral anticoagulant is typically interrupted prior to the procedure, and then continued when hemostasis is achieved postprocedurally. 1, 2 Because the interruption of anticoagulation may expose patients to the risk of thromboembolism, heparin bridging (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low‐molecular‐weight heparin [LMWH]) is administered to minimize the period of inadequate level of anticoagulation. 1, 2 It is of great importance to confirm whether bridging therapy reduces thromboembolic risk and to ascertain the safety of bridging therapy in relation to bleeding risk. 3

There have been many published articles related to bridging anticoagulation, 4, 5 but the quality of evidence with best practices is uneven across studies. Current guidelines from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest bridging anticoagulation used in patients with a high thrombosis risk, such as certain mechanical valve prostheses or recent pulmonary embolism during interruption of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy. 3 However, these recommendations are primarily based on observational studies and experts' opinions. 3

Although Siegal and colleagues concluded that bridging anticoagulation increases bleeding risk and produces similar thromboembolic risk, their review included only one underpowered randomized trial together with some observational studies with no control arm to assess the safety and efficacy of bridging therapy. 6 To better clarify the risk and benefit of bridging therapy, we updated the current published data and conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks between patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation with or without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1158iCqD]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease — planned interruption of VKA and bridging — When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure and restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows; bridging with intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (intravenous UFH) or 12 hours (subcutaneous LMWH) before the procedure. There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials in adequate numbers of prosthetic heart valve patients, evidence derives mostly from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups, and in other patient groups bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing thromboembolism; accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and account for the tradeoffs between thrombosis and bleeding.

### Meta-analysis of safety and efficacy of uninterrupted warfarin compared to heparin-based bridging therapy during implantation of cardiac rhythm devices [^116nE8PV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Optimal management of perioperative anticoagulation in patients undergoing pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation is not yet established. We performed a meta-analysis of the published literature to assess the safety and efficacy of perioperative heparin-based bridging therapy versus uninterrupted warfarin therapy in patients undergoing pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE (1950 to 2012), EMBASE (1988 to 2012), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (fourth quarter 2011), and reports presented at scientific meetings (1994 to 2011). Randomized controlled trials, case-control, or cohort studies comparing the safety and efficacy of uninterrupted warfarin therapy to heparin-based bridging therapy were eligible. Outcomes reported in eligible studies were rates of bleeding and thromboembolic events. Of 3,195 reports initially reviewed, we identified 8 studies enrolling 2,321 patients for the meta-analysis. Maintenance of therapeutic warfarin was associated with significantly lower bleeding postoperatively compared to heparin-based bridging therapy (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.50, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in risk of thromboembolic events between these 2 strategies (odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 3.02, p = 0.58). In conclusion, strategy of uninterrupted warfarin therapy throughout pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation is associated with decreased risk of bleeding without increasing risk of thromboembolic events. This strategy is a viable alternative to heparin-based bridging therapy.

### Periprocedural thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy [^111RwQHd]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy pose a clinical challenge when therapy needs to be interrupted for surgical or invasive procedures. Maintaining anticoagulation places them at risk for serious bleeding complications, whereas discontinuing anticoagulation puts them at risk of thromboembolic complications. Most patients can undergo dental procedures, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without discontinuing anticoagulation. The main patient groups that may require a periprocedural alternative to oral anticoagulation (periprocedural thromboprophylaxis or bridging) include patients with prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation, and hypercoagulable states and patients with chronic venous thrombosis who are undergoing surgery. Currently, there is little consensus on the appropriate perioperative treatment of patients on long-term warfarin therapy. There are an increasing number of studies that evaluate the benefits of periprocedural bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in place of unfractionated heparin (UFH). An advantage of LMWH over UFH is that perioperative conversion from warfarin therapy with LMWH can be carried out in the outpatient setting, which is more convenient for patients and is cost effective. As with the use of UFH, there are reports of maternal thromboembolic complications with LMWHs in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves. This review brings together the available data on periprocedural bridging to assess the available options for patients on long-term warfarin therapy who are undergoing surgical procedures. It provides a rationale for using LMWHs while individualizing the risks versus benefits in a given patient population.

### Periprocedural bridging in patients with venous thromboembolism: a systematic review [^116ezArV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are the most widely used anticoagulants, and bridging is commonly administered during periprocedural VKA interruption. Given the unclear benefits and risks of periprocedural bridging in patients with previous venous thromboembolism, we aimed to assess recurrent venous thromboembolism and bleeding outcomes with and without bridging in this population.

Methods

We performed a systematic review searching the PubMed and Embase databases from inception to December 7, 2017 for randomized and nonrandomized studies that included adults with previous venous thromboembolism requiring VKA interruption to undergo an elective procedure, and that reported venous thromboembolism or bleeding outcomes. Quality of evidence was graded by consensus.

Results

We included 28 cohort studies (20 being single-arm cohorts) with, overall, 6915 procedures for analysis. In 27 studies reporting perioperative venous thromboembolism outcomes, the pooled incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism with bridging was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4%-1.2%) and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.8%) without bridging. Eighteen studies reported major or nonmajor bleeding outcomes. The pooled incidence of any bleeding was 3.9% (95% CI, 2.0%-7.4%) with bridging and 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.7%) without bridging. In bridged patients at high thromboembolic risk, the pooled incidence for venous thromboembolism was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-2.5%) and 7.5% (95% CI, 3.1%-17.4%) for any bleeding. Quality of available evidence was very low, primarily due to a high risk of bias of included studies.

Conclusions

Periprocedural bridging increases the risk of bleeding compared with VKA interruption without bridging, without a significant difference in periprocedural venous thromboembolism rates.

### Perioperative bridging anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114tPkxh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation who need an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure. We hypothesized that forgoing bridging anticoagulation would be noninferior to bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of perioperative arterial thromboembolism and would be superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which, after perioperative interruption of warfarin therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive bridging anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (100 IU of dalteparin per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo administered subcutaneously twice daily, from 3 days before the procedure until 24 hours before the procedure and then for 5 to 10 days after the procedure. Warfarin treatment was stopped 5 days before the procedure and was resumed within 24 hours after the procedure. Follow-up of patients continued for 30 days after the procedure. The primary outcomes were arterial thromboembolism (stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack) and major bleeding.

Results

In total, 1884 patients were enrolled, with 950 assigned to receive no bridging therapy and 934 assigned to receive bridging therapy. The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4% in the no-bridging group and 0.3% in the bridging group (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 0.8; P = 0.01 for noninferiority). The incidence of major bleeding was 1.3% in the no-bridging group and 3.2% in the bridging group (relative risk, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78; P = 0.005 for superiority).

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation who had warfarin treatment interrupted for an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, forgoing bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism and decreased the risk of major bleeding.

### Predictors of major bleeding in peri-procedural anticoagulation management [^114x7XEj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate periprocedural management for chronically anticoagulated patients requires assessment of patient-specific thrombosis and bleeding risks. However, predictors of post-procedure bleeding are unknown.

Objectives

To determine the 3-month cumulative incidence and independent predictors of peri-procedural bleeding in chronically anticoagulated patients requiring temporary warfarin interruption for an invasive procedure.

Methods

In a protocol driven, cohort study design, all patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Thrombophilia Center for peri-procedural anticoagulation management (1997–2007; n = 2182), were followed forward in time to determine the 3-month cumulative incidence of peri-procedural bleeding (Kaplan-Meier product limit) and potential predictors of bleeding (Cox proportional hazards). Decisions to 'bridge' with low-molecular-weight heparin were based on estimated thromboembolism and bleeding risk.

Results

Indications for chronic anticoagulation included venous thromboembolism (38%), atrial fibrillation (30%) and mechanical heart valves (27%). Of these, 1496 (69%) patients received bridging therapy. The 3-month cumulative incidence rates of major and overall bleeding were 2.1% and 5.1%, respectively. Major bleeding occurred more frequently in patients receiving bridging therapy (3% vs. 1%; P = 0.017). Independent predictors (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval) of major bleeding included mitral mechanical heart valve (2.2; 1.1–4.3), active cancer (1.8; 1.0–3.1), prior bleeding history (2.6; 1.5–4.5) and re-initiation of heparin therapy within 24 h after the procedure (1.9; 1.1–3.4).

Conclusion

Factors predisposing to peri-procedural bleeding are primarily patient-specific. Premature heparin re-initiation is an avoidable provider-specific variable to consider.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114mcHVo]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) bridging — postoperative resumption timing: We suggest waiting at least 24 hours before resuming LMWH bridging after a low-to-moderate-bleed-risk surgery/procedure and at least 48 to 72 hours after a high-bleed-risk surgery/procedure; when resumption is delayed for 48 to 72 hours in patients considered at high risk for postoperative VTE, low-dose LMWH can be administered for the initial 2 to 3 days before transition to LMWH bridging.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^1131RnGZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Several reasons may explain this. First, recommendations in guidelines 9, 10, 12 and summaries of product characteristics 14, 15 do not strongly advise against bridging therapy. Indeed, several health professionals have criticized the lack of clarity of these guidelines. 17, 18, 19, 42, 43

Second, it may be possible that some physicians continue to believe in the theoretical possibility of a transient hypercoagulable state when starting VKA therapy due to the difference in plasma half‐life between vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and proteins C and S, which are important components in coagulation inhibition. A rapid decrease in protein C and S levels may lead to thrombotic occlusions of the microvasculature resulting in necrosis, particularly of the skin. 44 Unlike our study, results from a nested case–control study conducted on AF patients using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink supported this theory, since Azoulay et al found a 71% increased risk of stroke in the first 30 days of warfarin use compared with nonuse, whereas a decreased risk was observed after 30 days of use. 45 However, this theory does not justify the routine use of bridging therapy since VKA‐induced skin necrosis occurs mostly in patients with inherited or acquired thrombophilia, such as protein C or S deficiencies, 44 and several case studies have also reported that LMWH can also lead to skin necrosis. 46, 47 Lastly, there is insufficient evidence justifying systematic use of bridging therapy. This study showed that bridging therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding without any beneficial effect, and only 1 study conducted on 5327 patients in hospital settings was found that could put our results into perspective. 16 Kim et al reported bleeding and stroke rates of 1.0% and 0.3%, while in our study they were 0.35% to 0.17%, respectively. The lower rates here may lie in the difference between the study settings, (ie, our analytic sample managed in outpatient care may be healthier than hospitalized patients). Despite the different incidence rates, Kim et al 16 found results similar to ours for bleeding and stroke risks: they observed an increased bleeding risk associated with bridging therapy (odds ratio 4.44, 95% CI 1.68–11.72) and a comparable stroke risk between bridged and nonbridged groups.

### Outcomes in patients undergoing periprocedural interruption of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants [^115U19ux]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative (MAQI 2) is a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan/Blue Care Network‐funded multicenter collaborative of anticoagulation management services in the state of Michigan. MAQI 2 was formed in 2008 with the goal of improving patient safety and outcomes by collecting and comparing patient clinical data, identifying best practices, and conducting quality improvement initiatives. Currently, there are six hospitals in Michigan participating in the program. Patients initiated on either a DOAC or warfarin are randomly selected for entry into the MAQI 2 database and followed longitudinally so long as they remain on therapy and are managed at the participating health system. All data abstractors undergo training, and each center undergoes regular audits to ensure high‐quality data collection and agreement with predefined data element definitions. More information about MAQI 2 has been previously described. Institutional review board approval has been obtained at each site and the coordinating center (University of Michigan).

2.1 Patient selection

Patients who had a temporary interruption of DOAC or warfarin therapy for an elective surgical procedure were included if they had follow‐up for at least 3 months after the procedure. Patients with indications for anticoagulant use other than AF or VTE were excluded.

2.2 Data collection

Baseline patient information, including demographics, medications, and comorbidities were abstracted from patient charts at the time of anticoagulation initiation. Information about medication changes, new comorbidities, procedures, and bleeding or thrombotic events were abstracted for each patient interaction with the anticoagulation management service for warfarin‐treated patients and at regular 6‐month follow‐up intervals for DOAC‐treated patients. Procedural data abstracted from the medical record included the date of procedure, anticoagulation interruption and restart dates, whether or not heparin bridging was used, and the type of procedure. The procedures were categorized into having low or high bleed risk based on categories from the BRIDGE trial.

2.3 Outcomes

The primary outcomes of our study were 30‐day postoperative thromboembolic or bleeding events. Thromboembolic events included the composite of transient ischemic attacks, ischemic stroke, and VTE. Bleeding events were classified into minor bleeds, major bleeds, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds (CRNMB). Criteria for major and CRNMBs were based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.

For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

Management of anticoagulation in elective cases

Three factors that need to be considered in the case of elective surgeries are (1) when to stop, (2) whether to bridge, and (3) when to restart.

Discontinuation prior to surgery: General recommendations are summarized in the table (table 8) below and are according to the American College of Chest Physician 2012 Guidelines published in Chest, the RE-LY trial published in Circulation 2012, the ROCKET AF trial, and the manufacturer's recommendations.

Table 8
Recommendations for timing of discontinuation of anticoagulation for elective surgery

Patients whose procedures are at low risk of bleeding may continue oral anticoagulation therapy. This is particularly true for high-risk patients such as those with mechanical heart values.

Indications for bridging: The need for perioperative bridging is decided on by taking into account the patient's thromboembolism and hemorrhage risk and stratifying them into low, medium and high risk. In the case of warfarin, recommendations are summarized in the flow chart below (figure 3), adapted from the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines. Bridging may be achieved either with intravenous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin. Temporary interruption of vitamin K antagonism agents, without bridging while the INR is subtherapeutic, is recommended for patients with bileaflet mechanical aortic valve replacements and no other risk factors. All other mechanical valve settings should undergo bridging.

Efficacy of bridging: Whether or not outcomes are really better with bridging patients on vitamin K antagonists remains uncertain. A meta-analysis published by Siegal et al in 2012 found that the rate of thromboembolism was equivalent in patients who underwent periprocedural heparin bridging; however, there was a significantly higher number of patients who had major bleeding complications in those undergoing heparin bridging. These results were replicated in a randomized controlled trial by Douketis et al in 2015 demonstrating non-inferiority between patients undergoing no bridging versus those with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging and a significant reduction of major bleeding complications in those patients who did not undergo bridging.

### Use and outcomes associated with bridging during anticoagulation interruptions in patients with atrial fibrillation: findings from the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of atrial fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) [^115c6rTt]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Temporary interruption of oral anticoagulation for procedures is often required, and some propose using bridging anticoagulation. However, the use and outcomes of bridging during oral anticoagulation interruptions in clinical practice are unknown.

Methods and Results

The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) registry is a prospective, observational registry study of US outpatients with atrial fibrillation. We recorded incident temporary interruptions of oral anticoagulation for a procedure, including the use and type of bridging therapy. Outcomes included multivariable-adjusted rates of myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, cause-specific hospitalization, and death within 30 days. Of 7372 patients treated with oral anticoagulation, 2803 overall interruption events occurred in 2200 patients (30%) at a median follow-up of 2 years. Bridging anticoagulants were used in 24% (n = 665), predominantly low-molecular-weight heparin (73%, n = 487) and unfractionated heparin (15%, n = 97). Bridged patients were more likely to have had prior cerebrovascular events (22% versus 15%; P = 0.0003) and mechanical valve replacements (9.6% versus 2.4%; P < 0.0001); however, there was no difference in CHA2DS2-VASc scores (scores ≥ 2 in 94% versus 95%; P = 0.5). Bleeding events were more common in bridged than nonbridged patients (5.0% versus 1.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.84; P < 0.0001). The incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, hospitalization, or death within 30 days was also significantly higher in patients receiving bridging (13% versus 6.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.94; P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Bridging anticoagulation is used in one quarter of anticoagulation interruptions and is associated with higher risk for bleeding and adverse events. These data do not support the use of routine bridging, and additional data are needed to identify best practices concerning anticoagulation interruptions.

### How I treat anticoagulated patients undergoing an elective procedure or surgery [^1118PP1p]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The periprocedural management of patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant therapy remains a common but difficult clinical problem, with a lack of high-quality evidence to inform best practices. It is a patient's thromboembolic risk that drives the need for an aggressive periprocedural strategy, including the use of heparin bridging therapy, to minimize time off anticoagulant therapy, while the procedural bleed risk determines how and when postprocedural anticoagulant therapy should be resumed. Warfarin should be continued in patients undergoing selected minor procedures, whereas in major procedures that necessitate warfarin interruption, heparin bridging therapy should be considered in patients at high thromboembolic risk and in a minority of patients at moderate risk. Periprocedural data with the novel oral anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, are emerging, but their relatively short half-life, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics should simplify periprocedural use. This review aims to provide a practical, clinician-focused approach to periprocedural anticoagulant management.

### Continuing warfarin therapy is superior to interrupting warfarin with or without bridging anticoagulation therapy in patients undergoing pacemaker and defibrillator implantation [^114zpXGN]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend stopping oral anticoagulation and starting bridging anticoagulation with intravenous heparin or subcutaneous enoxaparin when implanting a pacemaker or defibrillator in patients at moderate or high risk for thromboembolic events. A limited body of literature suggests that device surgery without cessation of oral anticoagulation may be feasible.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of device surgery in orally anticoagulated patients without interrupting warfarin therapy.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 459 consecutive patients on chronic warfarin therapy who underwent device surgery from April 2004 to September 2008. Warfarin was continued in 222 patients during the perioperative period. Warfarin was temporarily held and bridging therapy administered in 123 patients. Warfarin was temporarily held without bridging therapy in 114 patients.

Results

There were no significant differences with regard to age, sex, or risk factors for thromboembolism in the three groups. Patients who continued taking warfarin had a lower incidence of pocket hematoma (P = 0.004) and a shorter hospital stay (P < .0001) than did patients in the bridging group. Holding warfarin without bridging is associated with a higher incidence of transient ischemic attacks (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Temporarily interrupting anticoagulation is associated with increased thromboembolic events, whereas cessation of warfarin with bridging anticoagulation is associated with a higher rate of pocket hematoma and a longer hospital stay. Continuing warfarin with a therapeutic international normalized ratio appears to be a safe and cost-effective approach when implanting a pacemaker or defibrillator in patients with moderate to high thromboembolic risk.

### Single-arm study of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin for patients at risk of arterial embolism who require temporary interruption of warfarin [^111wtzNE]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

When warfarin is interrupted for surgery, low-molecular-weight heparin is often used as bridging therapy. However, this practice has never been evaluated in a large prospective study. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bridging therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin initiated out of hospital.

Methods and Results

This was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm cohort study of patients at high risk of arterial embolism (prosthetic valves and atrial fibrillation with a major risk factor). Warfarin was held for 5 days preoperatively. Low-molecular-weight heparin was given 3 days preoperatively and at least 4 days postoperatively. Patients were followed up for 3 months for thromboembolism and bleeding. Eleven Canadian tertiary care academic centers participated; 224 patients were enrolled. Eight patients (3.6%; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.9) had an episode of thromboembolism, of which 2 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.2 to 3.2) were judged to be due to cardioembolism. Of these 8 episodes of thromboembolism, 6 occurred in patients who had warfarin deferred or withdrawn because of bleeding. There were 15 episodes of major bleeding (6.7%; 95% CI, 4.1 to 10.8): 8 occurred intraoperatively or early postoperatively before low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, 5 occurred in the first postoperative week after low-molecular-weight heparin was restarted, and 2 occurred well after low-molecular-weight heparin was stopped. There were no deaths.

Conclusions

Bridging therapy with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is feasible; however, the optimal approach for the management of patients who require temporary interruption of warfarin to have invasive procedures is uncertain.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Table 4 — post-ablation anticoagulation after atrial fibrillation ablation indicates that in patients who are not therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin at the time of AF ablation, low molecular weight heparin or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge to resumption of systemic anticoagulation with warfarin following AF ablation, and initiation of a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor after ablation may be considered as an alternative post procedure anticoagulation strategy. Because of the increased risk of post procedure bleeding on full dose low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg bid) a reduction of the dose to 0.5 mg/kg should be considered. Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitor is recommended for at least two months following an AF ablation procedure. Decisions regarding the continuation of systemic anticoagulation agents more than two months following ablation should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF, and discontinuation of systemic anticoagulation therapy post ablation is not recommended in patients who are at high risk of stroke as estimated by currently recommended schemes (CHADS2, or CHA2DS2-VASc).

Introduction

Uncertainty remains as to whether patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves who require interruption of vitamin K antagonists for invasive procedures benefit from bridging with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after the procedure. Many published and diverse protocols and guidelines have sought to address this common clinical problem, and the concern has always been that these patients are at high risk of thrombotic complications caused by a procoagulable state while off vitamin K antagonists.

In the typical bridging strategy, warfarin is held for four or five days before the procedure and is resumed after the procedure, on the same day or one or two days later.LMWH is given once or twice a day at a therapeutic dose for three to five days before the procedure and for a minimum of four days after the procedure until the international normalised ratio (INR) is therapeutic. The goal of bridging with LMWH is to reduce the risk of perioperative thromboembolism by minimising the time without anticoagulation while reducing bleeding risks with a short acting anticoagulant that allows for minimal or no anticoagulant effect at the time of interruption.

Bridging has been most studied in patients with atrial fibrillation in several observational or single armed studies. A recently completed double blind placebo controlled trial suggested that LMWH bridging is not necessary before or after the procedure for patients on warfarin. However, patients with mechanical heart valves were usually excluded from such studies and patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke were not well represented. In a previous single arm, multicentre pilot study of dalteparin bridging given once daily to 224 patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves, we found that the rate of thrombosis after the procedure was 3.1%; 75% of the events occurred in patients who had anticoagulation held due to a bleeding event after the procedure. These findings suggest that bridging after the procedure caused harm potentially because of a longer period without anticoagulation due to bleeding, which then led to thrombotic events.

Based on this information we performed a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the necessity of postoperative bridging with the LMWH dalteparin in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic mechanical valves who required warfarin to be held for a procedure. We hypothesised that patients who would receive placebo after the procedure would have fewer bleeding events and a lower rate of thromboembolism because of the association of thromboembolism with bleeding in our pilot study. We chose to only study the LMWH dose after the procedure because the dose before the procedure was unlikely to be causing harm and might be of benefit.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1161x5Qh]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CLx8R]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our analyses showed bridging anticoagulation was associated with a nearly threefold increased risk of overall and major bleeding compared to non‐bridging management and there was no significant difference in the risk of thromboembolism between the two strategies. Findings were broadly consistent across subgroups irrespective of study design.

In this study, we critically selected relevant studies and conducted a rigorously scientific synthesis of research results. Prior meta‐analyses evaluating the risk and benefit of bridging anticoagulation are flawed with inclusions of few randomized trials 6 and studies with no control arm, 6 no separate analysis of three strategies (interrupted anticoagulation with bridging therapy, interrupted anticoagulation without bridging therapy and continuous oral anticoagulation), 6, 28 and no detailed assessment of study quality. 28 We found that bridging anticoagulation was associated with higher bleeding risk and similar thromboembolic risk compared to non‐bridging strategy. Our subgroup analyses further showed the higher bleeding risk of bridging therapy seemed to be augmented in patients receiving interrupted anticoagulation without bridging therapy compared to those with continuous anticoagulation.

Our analysis demonstrated the risk of periprocedural thromboembolic events was 0.89% and 0.46% for the bridged and non‐bridged patients, respectively, and the difference did not reach statistical significance. Some possible reasons may explain this finding. First, most patients were classified as having a moderate risk of thromboembolism in individual studies; however, the risk‐stratification criteria were inconsistent across studies, which may particularly bias the results of observational studies, for example, indication bias (patients in a higher thromboembolic risk may be given a bridging anticoagulation). Second, the overall number of thromboembolic events was small, which may yield underpowered statistics. Third, interruption and reinitiation of warfarin may deplete protein C and protein S and thereafter contribute to a hyper‐coagulable status. Protein C and S are two vitamin K‐dependent plasma proteins that work together as a natural anticoagulant system, and deficiency in proteins C and S is associated with thrombotic tendency. 29 Fourth, it takes at least 5 days for the international normalized ratio to normalize after stopping warfarin 29 and NOACs are eliminated in 48 to 72 hours after discontinuation 30; therefore, in patients who discontinued warfarin for < 5 days or NOACs < 48 hours, the risk of thromboembolism may remain low due to residual anticoagulation.

### Variations in perioperative warfarin management: outcomes and practice patterns at nine hospitals [^1158QWA7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Before surgery, most patients receiving oral anticoagulation require temporary cessation of treatment. Physicians sometimes substitute heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin for oral anticoagulation in the perioperative setting ("bridging therapy"). We sought to characterize rates of bridging therapy use at 9 clinical centers to determine the extent to which the use of bridging is explained by clinical characteristics of patients (vs physician style) and to determine the 30-day incidence of thrombotic and bleeding complications.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study. Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation was classified as none, prophylactic-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin, or full-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin. We collected data on patient and surgery characteristics, anticoagulation management, and thromboembolic and bleeding events.

Results

A total of 492 of 497 consecutive patients completed the study; 54%, 14%, and 33% of patients had no, prophylactic, and full (therapeutic) doses, respectively, of heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin postprocedure. Two hospitals treated more than 80% of their patients with full-dose heparin, whereas the remaining 7 hospitals used full-dose heparin in an average of 22% of cases (P < .001); this variation persisted after adjustment for patient characteristics. There were 4 thromboembolic events (0.8%) and 16 major bleeding events (3.2%). Full-dose heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin postprocedure was associated with a higher likelihood of major bleeding: adjusted odds ratio 4.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–14.7).

Conclusion

Management of anticoagulation after an invasive procedure varies widely and is not explained by clinical characteristics of patients alone. The risk of major bleeding is strongly associated with the use of postoperative therapeutic doses of heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin.

2.2 Data retrieval and quality evaluation

Included studies met all of the following criteria: patients ≥ 18 years of age, long‐term use of oral anticoagulant before a procedure, elective invasive procedure or surgery, comparison of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation and non‐bridging management (continuous oral anticoagulation or interrupted oral anticoagulation without bridging therapy), reporting of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and articles published in peer‐reviewed journals. Studies with unclear reporting of thromboembolic or bleeding events, case reports, or letters to the editor were excluded. Studies with no control arm or designed specific to patients using novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were also excluded. Two authors (H.C.K. and F.L.L.) independently reviewed and collected data, including study design, patient characteristics of interest and relevant outcomes. The third blinded reviewer (Y.H.T.) resolved any disagreements between reviewers.

Patients were classified as bridged if they received any bridging therapy with UFH or LMWH in the periprocedural period. Patients were classified as non‐bridged if they interrupted oral anticoagulation without heparin bridging or continued use of oral anticoagulants during periprocedural period. Classification of high and low thromboembolic risk was based on the definitions described in the primary studies.

Primary outcomes were thromboembolic events and overall bleeding events. Secondary outcome was major bleeding events. Thromboembolic events were defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism occurring during the follow‐up period. Major bleeding was defined as a need for transfusion, drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/L, requirement for surgical hemostasis, need for rehospitalization, intracranial hemorrhage, or fatal bleeding.

Study quality was assessed with criteria adapted from the Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, ninth ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence‐Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 8 Disagreements on data acquisition were resolved by consensus with the third reviewer.

### Cost-effectiveness of bridging anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^113kYZSD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation during initiation and interruption of warfarin. Guidelines recommend bridging patients at high risk of stroke, while a recent randomized trial demonstrated overall harm in a population at comparatively low risk of ischemic stroke. Theory suggests that patients at high risk of stroke and low risk of hemorrhage may benefit from bridging, but data informing patient selection are scant.

Objective

To estimate the utility and cost-effectiveness of bridging anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, stratified by thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with lifelong time horizon, from the perspective of a third-party payer MAIN MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per bridged patient; US dollars per QALY gained KEY RESULTS: Unselected patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation may be harmed by bridging anticoagulation. Hospital admission for bridging is almost never cost-effective, and generally harmful. Among patients carefully selected by both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, outpatient bridging can be beneficial and cost-effective. Results were sensitive to how effectively heparin products reduce stroke risk.

Conclusions

Outpatient bridging anticoagulation can be beneficial and cost-effective for a subset of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation during interruption or initiation of warfarin. Admission for bridging should be avoided.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^111qh27E]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — postablation anticoagulation: In patients not therapeutically anticoagulated prior to ablation and in whom warfarin will be used postablation, low molecular weight heparin or intravenous heparin should be used as a bridge for initiation of systemic anticoagulation with warfarin following AF ablation; Time in therapeutic range (TTR) should be > 65% – 70% on warfarin. Systemic anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC is recommended for at least 2 months postcatheter ablation of AF, and adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended regardless of apparent success or failure of the procedure. Decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 2 months post ablation should be based on the patient's stroke risk profile and not on the perceived success or failure of the ablation procedure. In patients not anticoagulated prior to ablation or in whom anticoagulation with a NOAC or warfarin has been interrupted, administration of a NOAC 3 to 5 hours after achievement of hemostasis is reasonable postablation. Patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on patient values and preferences should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — scope and PICO framework include the following: Approximately 15% to 20% of patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy will require a surgery/procedure annually, and 10% to 15% of patients with coronary stents will require surgery within 2 years of implantation, highlighting the clinical burden. The current American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines have expanded to address 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions, and the aims are (1) to provide evidence-based recommendations for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving antithrombotic therapy; and (2) to provide practical guidance to clinicians for managing such patients in the perioperative period. The PICO questions and guideline statements are separated into four broad categories: patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) focused on warfarin, among patients receiving a VKA the use of perioperative heparin bridging, patients receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), and patients receiving an antiplatelet drug.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^117Eu9yG]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) on VKA therapy — perioperative bridging: we suggest against heparin bridging for patients with VTE as the sole clinical indication who require VKA interruption for an elective surgery/procedure (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence), supported by evidence that there are no randomized trials and observational data show no benefit with more bleeding, including an observational cohort of 755 patients comparing bridging (n = 214) vs no bridging (n = 514) with no significant difference in recurrent VTE or bleeding, and a systematic review totaling 6,195 VKA-treated patients showing higher any bleeding with bridging 3.9% [95% CI: 2.0–7.4] vs 0.4% [95% CI: 0.1–1.7] and no effect on recurrent VTE 0.7% [95% CI: 0.4–1.2] vs 0.5% [95% CI: 0.3–0.8]; implementation notes clarify that suggesting against therapeutic-dose bridging does not preclude low-dose heparin, typically started within 24 hours after surgery and continued for up to 5 days while VKA is resumed, and that in selected high-risk VTE cases (e.g., recent (< 3 months) history of VTE, severe thrombophilia, selected active cancer) pre- and post-operative heparin bridging is suggested.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^115eDW5R]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy interruption in children: a single centre experience [^114KkbH1]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of anticoagulant therapy in paediatrics is common, with vitamin K antagonists remaining the most commonly prescribed therapy. There is a weak evidence base behind many of the recommendations for anticoagulant therapy in paediatric patients. One of the areas requiring further research is the management of anticoagulant therapy interruption. Interruption to anticoagulation is the period surrounding a planned invasive procedure whereby long term anticoagulation is ceased, and recommenced post procedure. The word bridging refers to the use of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin to anticoagulate during the period of sub therapeutic INR. To date institutional protocols for bridging anticoagulation are based on adult guidelines. However, there are currently no studies validating the extrapolation of these guidelines to paediatrics. This study seeks to review the clinical outcomes associated with current bridging practices employed at a tertiary metropolitan children's hospital.

Methods

The patient population was selected from the warfarin management registry of a Clinical Haematology service of a major metropolitan children's hospital. The admission history of these patients was queried to identify admissions where anticoagulation interruption would typically be required. Namely, these were dental extraction, cerebral or cardiac angiography, or cardiac catheterization. Data relating to demographics, anticoagulant therapy interruption plan, and clinical outcomes were recorded.

Results

A total of 61 admissions for children aged between 1 year and 17 years and 11 months were analysed for this study. Congenital heart disease (CHD) was the primary underlying disease for which long-term oral anticoagulation with warfarin was indicated. Children with Moyamoya in this cohort were treated more consistently compared to the other disease groups. There were no instances of major bleeding (n = 0) or thrombotic events (n = 0).

Conclusion

This study describes the current practices and outcomes associated with anticoagulant therapy interruption at one institution thereby filling an evidence gap in the paediatric anticoagulant management. It achieved this by analysing the largest and most representative cohort to date. This project is a stepping stone from which future studies of safety and efficacy of paediatric anticoagulation interruption management can be developed.

### Oral anticoagulation management in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device implantation [^116URv1D]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Continued use of bridging therapy is somewhat unexpected given the evidence of increased bleeding complications and worse outcomes with heparinoid bridging. The Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery (BRIDGE) trial demonstrated that interrupted warfarin without bridging is noninferior to low‐molecular‐weight heparin bridging in patients undergoing elective surgery with respect to prevention of arterial thromboembolism, with lower rates of major bleeding complications. 14 In 2012, Gold and colleagues conducted a large meta‐analysis across 13 studies in 5978 patients undergoing device implantation while on warfarin, 72% of which were anticoagulated due to AF. 15 Uninterrupted OAC during device implantation did not result in excess bleeding relative to no therapy, whereas patients managed with a heparin‐bridging strategy had over 5‐fold increased bleeding compared to continued OAC. 10 Another meta‐analysis by Ghanbari and colleagues in 2007 demonstrated reduced bleeding risk in patients treated with uninterrupted warfarin relative to heparin bridging, without increased risk of thromboembolic stroke. 16 In early 2013, BRUISE‐CONTROL demonstrated that uninterrupted warfarin reduces pocket hematoma formation 4‐fold compared to heparin bridging, with no difference in thromboembolic complications. 5 However, our findings suggest that these studies may not have resulted in immediate, dramatic changes in device implantation anticoagulation management. For instance, there was no evidence that perioperative anticoagulant management changed after publication of BRUISE‐CONTROL (Figure 2).

The risk of a major adverse event in the first 30‐days after device implantation was low regardless of anticoagulation management strategy. Two of 3 patients (66%) who suffered a stroke/TIA had valvular AF, although perioperative management of anticoagulation management did not differ in this subgroup (Figure 2). The unadjusted rate of adverse events in those who received bridging were higher compared to the other treatment groups; however, some caution is required given the relatively small sample.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^111Ca7gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is a situation that occurs frequently and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding. Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk. For patients who are receiving warfarin who need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is the optimal approach or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used. The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives, but they introduce other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent. Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular consideration given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^116ufVzy]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation bridging — who and how to bridge — should be used selectively for high thrombotic risk. If an individual is particularly high risk (e.g., pulmonary embolus within the last 3 months, severe thrombophilia, or artificial heart valve), bridging anticoagulation in the form of intravenous or low molecular weight heparin can be employed only after multidisciplinary discussion. Bridging is advised when the INR is down to 2, unfractionated heparin should be stopped 6 hours before the procedure and low molecular weight heparin should be held on the morning of the procedure, and both can be restarted 6–12 hours after the procedure unless hemostasis intervention is needed.

### Periprocedural antithrombotic management: a review of the literature and practical approach for the hospitalist physician [^111TTkoZ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients who are on long-term antithrombotic therapy (e.g. warfarin and/or antiplatelet agents) must be assessed for temporary discontinuation for a procedure or surgery, making this a salient topic for the hospitalist physician. Discontinuation of antithromhotic therapy can place patients at increased risk of thromboembolic complications while continuing antithrombotic therapy can increase procedure-related bleeding risk. Bridging anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparins is often used in the periprocedural period, but a great deal of uncertainty exists about how and when to use bridging anticoagulation. Because there is very little Level 1 evidence to define optimal care, both clinical practice and expert consensus guideline opinions vary. For the hospitalist, it is of critical importance to understand the available data, controversies, and management options in order to approach patient care rationally. This review provides a step-wise literature-based discussion addressing the following four questions: (1) What is the optimal management of antiplatelet therapy in the periprocedural period? (2) Are there very low bleeding risk procedures that do not require interruption of oral anticoagulation? (3) Are there low thromboembolic risk populations who do not require periprocedural bridging? (4) How do you manage patients who must discontinue anti-coagulants but are at an increased thrombotic risk?

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114UwJy8]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) perioperative management and bridging — For patients on a VKA, warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) for most patients, or the day after procedure (i.e. D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. For high thrombotic risk populations, bridging is suggested with full-dose, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), for example enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily, or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily, with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D–1) at half the total daily dose. Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure.

### The current status of bridging anticoagulation [^1138dfau]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

For patients prescribed chronic vitamin K antagonist therapy requiring a surgical or invasive procedure, the question of whether or not to bridge and how to bridge is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Bridging anticoagulation has evolved over the years and the evidence base for current practice is deficient in many areas. Clinical trials currently being completed with conventional anticoagulants should help strengthen the evidence base for future practice. The availability of novel oral anticoagulants is a welcome addition, though their optimal management peri-procedure is yet to be determined. Prospective multi-centre controlled studies that can provide the evidence base for novel oral anticoagulant peri-procedural management are required.

### Thromboembolic and bleeding risk of periprocedural bridging anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116STUmW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although thromboembolism may cause severe morbidity and mortality, it should be weighed against the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. 31 Considering the higher risk of bleeding related to bridging anticoagulation, our results suggested non‐bridging management seems to have a favorable risk‐benefit profile in terms of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. There are some explanations for the bleeding risk of bridging anticoagulation. First, residual anti‐Xa effect or heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia may contribute to postoperative bleeding. 32 Second, due to the interindividual variability in the sensitivity of aPTT test (the most common laboratory measurement to monitor UFH), control of aPTT range may not correlate well with the activity of bridging anticoagulation. 33

NOACs have been increasingly used for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with moderate‐to‐high risk. 32 NOACs are non‐inferior for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and associated with less bleeding compared to warfarin. 34 NOACs have advantages of short half‐lives, fast onset of action, predictable pharmacokinetic properties (concentration‐dependent), and few drug‐drug interactions. 35 Although the experience of periprocedural use of NOACs is accumulating, there are limited data available pertaining to the bridging anticoagulation for patients on NOAC therapy in terms of perioperative bleeding risk. 36 The Dresden NOAC registry revealed major bleeding rate of 1.2% and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding rate of 3.4% in patients using NOACs during invasive procedures. 37 A subgroup analysis of the RE‐LY trial showed no significant difference in the risk of periprocedural major bleeding between patients using dabigatran 110 mg (3.8%), dabigatran 150 mg (5.1%), or warfarin (4.6%). 38 However, these studies did not compare the bleeding risk between bridging and non‐bridging therapy. 37, 38 Whether it is better for patients using NOACs to receive bridging anticoagulation is currently unclear. Two specific reversal agents for NOACs have been approved in the United States: idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban reversal. 39, 40 Tailoring periprocedural management of NOACs to the type of invasive procedure may reduce the risk of bleeding.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113ixG4y]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) perioperative management for interventional procedures states warfarin is continued for minimal bleed risk, whereas for low to moderate and high bleed risk it is stopped for 5 days; other guidance recommends it be stopped for 3–5 days, and individualized care may achieve an appropriate INR below 1.5 after stopping for 2 days. Warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) or the day after procedure (D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. "Bridging suggested for high thrombotic risk populations with full-dose, subcutaneous LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily), with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D-1) at half the total daily dose". Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for VTE prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure. Initiation of low molecular heparin therapy has been questioned and is no longer a recommendation as it increases the risk.

### Short-term risk of bleeding during heparin bridging at initiation of vitamin K antagonist therapy in more than 90 000 patients with Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation managed in outpatient care [^1164Pr9f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A causal relationship between bridging anticoagulation and studied outcomes cannot be confirmed as these findings are based on an observational study. Lastly, although as many confounding factors as possible were taken into account, such as comorbidities and concomitant medications, the confounding effect of unmeasured and/or unknown factors cannot be ruled out. However, our results should not be affected by diagnostic biases since databases to define bridging status and end points are completely independent.

### Clinical outcomes with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin as bridging therapy in patients on long-term oral anticoagulants: the REGIMEN registry [^114qgPtj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who receive long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy often require interruption of OAC for an elective surgical or an invasive procedure. Heparin bridging therapy has been used in these situations, although the optimal method has not been established. No large prospective studies have compared unfractionated heparin (UFH) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the perioperative management of patients at risk of thromboembolism requiring temporary interruption of long-term OAC therapy.

Patients/Methods

This multicenter, observational, prospective registry conducted in North America enrolled 901 eligible patients on long-term OAC who required heparin bridging therapy for an elective surgical or invasive procedure. Practice patterns and clinical outcomes were compared between patients who received either UFH alone (n = 180) or LMWH alone (n = 721).

Results

Overall, the majority of patients (74.5%) requiring heparin bridging therapy had arterial indications for OAC. LMWH, in mostly twice-daily treatment doses, represented approximately 80% of the study population. LMWH-bridged patients had significantly fewer arterial indications for OAC, a lower mean Charlson comorbidity score, and were less likely to undergo major or cardiothoracic surgery, receive intraprocedural anticoagulants or thrombolytics, or receive general anesthesia than UFH-bridged patients (all P < 0.05). The LMWH group had significantly more bridging therapy completed in an outpatient setting or with a < 24-h hospital stay vs. the UFH group (63.6% vs. 6.1%, P < 0.001). In the LMWH and UFH groups, similar rates of overall adverse events (16.2% vs. 17.1%, respectively, P = 0.81), major composite adverse events (arterial/venous thromboembolism, major bleed, and death; 4.2% vs. 7.9%, respectively, P = 0.07) and major bleeds (3.3% vs. 5.5%, respectively, P = 0.25) were observed. The thromboembolic event rates were 2.4% for UFH and 0.9% for LMWH. Logistic regression analysis revealed that for postoperative heparin use a Charlson comorbidity score > 1 was an independent predictor of a major bleed and that vascular, general, and major surgery were associated with non-significant trends towards an increased risk of major bleed.

Conclusions

Treatment-dose LMWH, mostly in the outpatient setting, is used substantially more often than UFH as bridging therapy in patients with predominately arterial indications for OAC. Overall adverse events, including thromboembolism and bleeding, are similar for patients treated with LMWH or UFH. Postoperative heparin bridging should be used with caution in patients with multiple comorbidities and those undergoing vascular, general, and major surgery. These findings need to be confirmed using large randomized trials for specific patient groups undergoing specific procedures.
