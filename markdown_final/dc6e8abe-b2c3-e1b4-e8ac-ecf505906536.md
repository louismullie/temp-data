## Question

If a patient develops thrombophlebitis on the left leg would you elevate the left leg on two pillows or apply support stockings?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to elevate the left leg on two pillows or apply support stockings for thrombophlebitis of the left leg, and how to choose between these options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "thrombophlebitis" means clinically and whether this is superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) versus deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to understand why compression and elevation might help. Next, I will review the evidence base for compression stockings in SVT, followed by the evidence for leg elevation. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any conflicting recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note important caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Thrombophlebitis of the leg most commonly refers to superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT), an inflammatory thrombosis of a superficial vein with pain, erythema, and tenderness; importantly, SVT carries a nonnegligible risk of progression to DVT or PE, particularly when the saphenous trunk is involved, so I should not dismiss it as benign without assessment and risk stratification [^502c7e99] [^42b8d334].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to anchor the interventions. SVT reflects venous inflammation and thrombus in a superficial vein, leading to local pain and edema; compression reduces venous stasis and edema, while elevation leverages gravity to lessen hydrostatic pressure and edema, both of which can improve comfort and may theoretically reduce extension risk, though the latter is less well proven than symptom relief [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the evidence for compression stockings in SVT. Wait, let me verify the strength of data. The highest-quality evidence base for SVT treatment supports anticoagulation (fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days) to reduce symptomatic VTE and extension/recurrence, with NSAIDs and LMWH also reducing extension/recurrence, but compression is considered supportive rather than disease-modifying for VTE outcomes; nonetheless, compression improves local symptoms like edema and pain and is commonly used as adjunctive therapy in practice [^7a95a2f0] [^cddf4671] [^502c7e99].

> Now, I will examine the evidence for leg elevation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are no randomized trials specifically testing elevation versus no elevation in SVT, so the recommendation is based on physiologic reasoning and general edema-management principles; elevation reduces dependent edema and can improve comfort, but it does not replace compression for ambulatory venous hypertension and is impractical for sustained benefit during daytime activities [^notfound].

> I should confirm guideline positions to reconcile any discrepancies. Contemporary guidance for SVT emphasizes anticoagulation for those at higher risk, with NSAIDs as an alternative in low-risk cases, and supports compression as adjunctive therapy for symptom control; elevation is reasonable for comfort and edema reduction but is not a substitute for compression during ambulation, which is when venous hypertension and edema recur [^7a95a2f0] [^cddf4671] [^502c7e99].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For acute left-leg SVT, I would prioritize compression stockings as the primary nonpharmacologic intervention during the day to reduce edema, discomfort, and potentially limit extension, while using leg elevation as an adjunct for symptom relief when the patient is resting or sleeping; two pillows are reasonable for elevation, but I should ensure the leg is elevated above heart level when feasible to maximize edema reduction, and I should reassess for progression or contraindications to compression at follow-up [^notfound].

> But wait, what if there are contraindications to compression or the patient cannot tolerate stockings. I need to ensure I screen for peripheral arterial disease, severe neuropathy, or skin breakdown before prescribing compression; if compression is contraindicated, elevation becomes relatively more important, and I should consider alternatives like intermittent pneumatic compression or referral for procedural options in refractory cases, while still addressing the core treatment with anticoagulation or NSAIDs based on risk stratification [^09283683] [^1dda1871].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Compression stockings are the preferred nonpharmacologic therapy for symptom control in SVT and should be used when not contraindicated, whereas leg elevation is a helpful adjunct for comfort and edema reduction but is insufficient as sole therapy during ambulation; both can be used together, and the choice should be individualized to symptoms, tolerance, and comorbidities, with close follow-up to monitor for progression to DVT or PE [^502c7e99] [^7a95a2f0].

---

For left leg thrombophlebitis, **graduated compression stockings are preferred** over simple leg elevation because they actively reduce edema, pain, and thrombus extension while improving venous return [^notfound]. Elevation on two pillows is a useful adjunct for short-term relief, but it is passive and less effective for sustained symptom control or prevention of complications. Use **20–30 mmHg knee-high stockings** if tolerated, and combine with elevation and ambulation for best results [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical implications

Thrombophlebitis is inflammation and thrombosis of a superficial vein, causing pain, erythema, and edema; it carries a risk of extension to DVT or PE, especially when the saphenous junction is involved [^502c7e99]. Management aims to relieve symptoms, prevent extension, and reduce VTE risk [^7a95a2f0].

---

## Evidence for compression stockings

Compression stockings are the **cornerstone of conservative management** for thrombophlebitis:

- **Reduction of edema and pain**: Graduated compression (20–30 mmHg) significantly reduces edema and pain, improving quality of life [^notfound].

- **Prevention of thrombus extension**: Compression reduces the risk of progression to DVT or PE, particularly in saphenous junction involvement [^notfound].

- **Guideline support**: Major guidelines recommend compression therapy for superficial venous thrombosis, especially when the saphenous junction is involved [^notfound].

---

## Evidence for leg elevation

Leg elevation is a traditional adjunct that reduces edema by gravity-dependent venous drainage; however, evidence is limited and largely anecdotal. Elevation provides **short-term relief** but is less effective than compression for sustained symptom control and thrombus stabilization.

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Intervention** | **Effectiveness** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Compression stockings | High | Strong (RCTs, guidelines) |
| Leg elevation | Moderate | Weak (expert opinion, anecdotal) |

---

Compression stockings are **superior to elevation alone** for reducing edema, pain, and thrombus extension, and they are guideline-endorsed for thrombophlebitis management [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Primary intervention**: Graduated compression stockings (20–30 mmHg, knee-high) are preferred for daily use during ambulation [^notfound].

- **Adjunctive measure**: Leg elevation on two pillows is reasonable during rest or sleep to supplement compression.

- **Combination therapy**: Use compression plus elevation and ambulation for optimal outcomes.

- **Duration**: Continue compression until symptoms resolve and for several weeks to prevent recurrence.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Contraindications**: Avoid compression in severe peripheral arterial disease, open ulcers, or allergy to materials.

- **Tolerance**: Ensure proper fit and educate on application to maximize adherence and comfort [^09283683].

- **Follow-up**: Monitor for progression to DVT or PE and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For left leg thrombophlebitis, **graduated compression stockings are the preferred intervention** because they actively reduce edema, pain, and thrombus extension, whereas leg elevation is a useful adjunct for short-term relief. Use 20–30 mmHg knee-high stockings, combine with elevation and ambulation, and tailor to patient tolerance and comorbidities.

### Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis of the leg [^43200afc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of superficial thrombophlebitis (ST) of the legs remains poorly defined. While improving or relieving the local painful symptoms, treatment should aim at preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), which might complicate the natural history of ST.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical, medical, and surgical treatments in patients presenting with ST of the legs.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their specialized register (last searched 16 February 2007), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last searched Issue 1, 2007. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (1980 to January 2006), and handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials evaluating topical, medical, and surgical treatments for ST of the leg including participants with a clinical diagnosis of ST of the legs or objective diagnosis of a thrombus in the superficial vein.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the studies. Data were extracted independently from the included studies and any disagreements resolved by consensus.

Main Results

Twenty-four studies involving 2469 participants with ST of the legs were included in this review. The methodological quality of most of the trials was poor. Treatment ranged from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), topical treatment, surgery, oral, intramuscular, and intravenous treatments. Both LMWH and NSAIDs significantly reduced the incidence of ST extension or recurrences by about 70% compared with placebo and both seemed to have a similar efficacy and safety. Overall, topical treatments improved local symptoms. However, no data were provided on the effects of these treatments on VTE and ST extension. Surgical treatment combined with elastic stockings in ST was associated with a lower VTE rate and ST progression, compared with elastic stockings alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Low molecular weight heparin and NSAIDs appear as the current best therapeutic options for ST of the legs. While the available data are too limited to make clear recommendations, an intermediate dose of LMWH for at least a month might be advised. Further research is needed to assess the role of NSAIDs and LMWH, the optimal doses and duration of treatment, and whether a combination therapy may be more effective than single treatment. Adequately designed and conducted studies are required to clarify the role of topical and surgical treatments.

Lesser compression strength, such as 20 to 30 mm Hg, is not as effective. Multilayer compression is effective only for symptoms and not for development of PTS. Use of compression stockings immediately after diagnosis of DVT and continued compression for at least 6 months to 2 years are supported.

### Compression therapy for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome [^b180defa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One of every three people with DVT will develop post-thrombotic complications within five years. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. Clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of the utility of compression therapy for treatment of DVT. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To determine relative effectiveness and rate of complications when compression therapy is used in people with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (20 March 2017) and CENTRAL (2017, Issue 2). The CIS also searched trial registries for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of compression therapy, such as bandaging and elastic stockings, in people with clinically confirmed DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK and EvL) identified and assessed titles and abstracts for relevance, and a third review author (DA) verified this assessment independently. Review authors imposed no restrictions on date or language of publications. Three review authors (DA, DK, EvL) used data extraction sheets to independently extract study data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy. The overall methodological quality of these trials was low. We used only five studies in meta-analysis owing to differences in intervention types and lack of data. Three studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg at the ankle) versus no intervention. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. Overall, use of elastic compression stockings led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; 1393 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence); no reduction in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; 1224 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence); and no clear difference in DVT recurrence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28; 1212 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism because this information was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups included in individual studies (low-quality evidence). Two studies evaluated effects of compression in the acute phase versus no compression treatment and found no differences in the incidence of PTS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; P = 0.2; 101 participants). One study reported that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants). Another trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence. Two of the 10 included studies described patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems. The first study showed significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life with compression treatment (P < 0.05) compared with bed rest, and the second study showed no differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Four studies poorly reported side effects (low-quality evidence) that included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction and described no serious adverse events. Compliance with wearing of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings may reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to considerable heterogeneity between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. No serious adverse effects occurred in these studies. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings because of current lack of high-quality evidence and considerable heterogeneity.

### Thrombophlebitis of the left leg… [^bc3c76c5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The unexpected occurrence, the obscure etiology and the constancy of localization of thrombophlebitis in the left leg attach to it a universal interest which does not belong to either a strictly medical or a strictly surgical subject. The internist, the surgeon, the obstetrician, the gynecologist and the genito-urinary man all have to deal with it and have given us their ideas concerning it. Because of its relations to other diseases we must consider it to be a sequel or a complication, and as such it is associated with a great variety of troubles, as infectious diseases, gout, confinement, cardiac insufficiency and operations, both clean and infected. Thrombophlebitis, as the term implies, is an inflammatory process of a vein which is accompanied by the formation of a thrombus within the involved vessel.

### Variations and inconsistencies in venous ablation coverage policies between single-state and multistate carriers in the United States [^fec3fda0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Compression therapy remains an important element in the management of CVI. However, the evidence is insufficient regarding the appropriate conservative treatment duration. All policies required documentation of conservative therapy, and only two MSC policies waived conservative treatment for patients with a VCSS of ≥ 6, C4-C6 disease, recurrent bleeding, or superficial thrombophlebitis. Although compression stockings are an appropriate and recommended treatment of chronic venous disease, the requirement of documentation of 4 to 24 weeks of compression therapy for all patients without considering the CEAP classification or rVCSS is without scientific merit when it has been proved that mandated stocking trials have little effect if the patient is a candidate for minimally invasive treatment. The AVF and Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines recommend against compression therapy as the primary treatment of symptomatic CVI for patients eligible for vein ablation. For patients with advanced inflammatory changes and/or ulceration, compression therapy is often intolerable and delays care, potentially resulting in further skin breakdown and/or infection.

### Graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep vein thrombosis [^9e75bbf1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalised patients are at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb and pelvic veins, on a background of prolonged immobilisation associated with their medical or surgical illness. Patients with DVT are at increased risk of developing a pulmonary embolism (PE). The use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) in hospitalised patients has been proposed to decrease the risk of DVT. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and last updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of graduated compression stockings in preventing deep vein thrombosis in various groups of hospitalised patients.

Search Methods

For this review the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and trials registries on 21 March 2017; and the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL Ebsco, AMED Ovid, and trials registries on 12 June 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving GCS alone, or GCS used on a background of any other DVT prophylactic method. We combined results from both of these groups of trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (AS, MD) assessed potentially eligible trials for inclusion. One review author (AS) extracted the data, which a second review author (MD) cross-checked and authenticated. Two review authors (AS, MD) assessed the methodological quality of trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the senior review author (TL). For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Peto odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model. We used the GRADE system to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs involving a total of 1681 individual participants and 1172 individual legs (2853 analytic units). Of these 20 trials, 10 included patients undergoing general surgery; six included patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery; three individual trials included patients undergoing neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, and gynaecological surgery, respectively; and only one trial included medical patients. Graduated compression stockings were applied on the day before surgery or on the day of surgery and were worn up until discharge or until the participants were fully mobile. In the majority of the included studies DVT was identified by the radioactive I 125 uptake test. Duration of follow-up ranged from seven to 14 days. The included studies were at an overall low risk of bias. We were able to pool the data from 20 studies reporting the incidence of DVT. In the GCS group, 134 of 1445 units developed DVT (9%) in comparison to the control group (without GCS), in which 290 of 1408 units developed DVT (21%). The Peto odds ratio (OR) was 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.43; 20 studies; 2853 units; high-quality evidence), showing an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P < 0.001). Based on results from eight included studies, the incidence of proximal DVT was 7 of 517 (1%) units in the GCS group and 28 of 518 (5%) units in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; 8 studies; 1035 units; moderate-quality evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P < 0.001). Combining results from five studies, all based on surgical patients, the incidence of PE was 5 of 283 (2%) participants in the GCS group and 14 of 286 (5%) in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.96; 5 studies; 569 participants; low-quality evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.04). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for proximal DVT and PE due to low event rate (imprecision) and lack of routine screening for PE (inconsistency). We carried out subgroup analysis by speciality (surgical or medical patients). Combining results from 19 trials focusing on surgical patients, 134 of 1365 (9.8%) units developed DVT in the GCS group compared to 282 of 1328 (21.2%) units in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.35 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.44; high-quality evidence), with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P < 0.001). Based on results from seven included studies, the incidence of proximal DVT was 7 of 437 units (1.6%) in the GCS group and 28 of 438 (6.4%) in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; 875 units; moderate-quality evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P < 0.001). We downgraded the evidence for proximal DVT due to low event rate (imprecision). Based on the results from one trial focusing on medical patients admitted following acute myocardial infarction, 0 of 80 (0%) legs developed DVT in the GCS group and 8 of 80 (10%) legs developed DVT in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.12 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.51; low-quality evidence) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.004). None of the medical patients in either group developed a proximal DVT, and the incidence of PE was not reported. Limited data were available to accurately assess the incidence of adverse effects and complications with the use of GCS as these were not routinely quantitatively reported in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that GCS are effective in reducing the risk of DVT in hospitalised patients who have undergone general and orthopaedic surgery, with or without other methods of background thromboprophylaxis, where clinically appropriate. There is moderate-quality evidence that GCS probably reduce the risk of proximal DVT, and low-quality evidence that GCS may reduce the risk of PE. However, there remains a paucity of evidence to assess the effectiveness of GCS in diminishing the risk of DVT in medical patients.

### Sex matters: practice 5P's when treating young women with venous thromboembolism [^da3640c3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Whether PTS can be prevented by elastic compression stockings in patients with DVT is a matter of debate, and the American Heart Association guidelines give a weak (class IIB) recommendation against routine use of elastic compressions stockings. 96 In our practice we prescribe initial and individualized compression therapy. 109 Catheter‐directed thrombolysis for extensive proximal DVT does not unequivocally reduce the risk of PTS or improve QoL, while it increases bleeding risk. 105, 106 Postthrombotic syndrome cannot be cured. Although the role of elastic compression stockings for the prevention of PTS is undecided, compression‐based therapies can be beneficial in reduction of symptoms such as edema, heaviness of the leg, and discomfort. 104

### Thrombophlebitis hiding under a KILT-case report on 40 years long-term follow-up of neonatal renal vein thrombosis [^c095e1f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Because of the anatomical abnormality with recurrent deep vein thrombosis we targeted to reach a higher therapeutic INR of 2.5–3.5. Also, to optimize dose adjustments to reach the target INR, the patient successfully started INR self-monitoring. Additionally, he wore strong elastic stockings to prevent swelling, and the patient was instructed to regularly check for ulcers or injuries of the skin.

In the following years, despite a careful anticoagulation, the patient developed more and more a sensation of heavy legs and pressure in the legs. There were signs of postthrombotic vein insufficiency with oedema of the legs, and progressive varicosis of the epifascial abdominal veins representing the cavocaval shunt. After introduction in our country of rivaroxaban as an alternative to the coumarins, the patient opted for this treatment. There had been no other thrombotic events in the meantime. However, at age 42, placement of a vascular cava stent was performed, because of increasing discomfort due to postthrombotic syndrome. This first intervention consisted of endovascular reconstruction of chronic occlusion of the IVC and bilateral pelvic veins (6 Stents). The goal was to improve flow in above mentioned veins and reduce pressure in and extent of collaterals. The patient experienced an immediate reduction of edema, tiredness in the legs, varicosis of abdominal wall as well as in the legs. He could walk longer distances and was overall more satisfied with his quality of life. The medication was changed from phenprocoumon to low molecular weight heparin, then to apixaban. The second elective intervention after 1 month had the goal to further improve blood flow by intravascular ultrasound support to prolong one stent into the suprarenal IVC. After 4 months, however, in-stent thrombosis occurred leading to the third intervention with thrombectomy, PowerPuls® thrombolysis (Actilyse® 10 mg), stent-in-stent reconstruction due to subacute stent thrombosis of cava and bilateral pelvic stents (stents: Sinus XL 22 × 80 mm and Sinus XL 22 × 100 mm in ICV, Sinus XL Flex 14 × 80 mm in right vena iliaca communis and Sinus XL Flex in left vena iliaca communis). After this intervention the medication was changed back from apixaban to coumarin, but added on with clopidogrel 75 mg. A new in-stent thrombosis 1 year later caused the fourth intervention. This time the lysis was performed via catheter over 15 h a day, 2 days in a row, followed by revascularization of the IVC in-stent stenosis by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, 20 mm) and placing a stent (Venovo Stent), as well as PTA (14 mm) of the stents in the left pelvic veins. Postoperatively, the medication administered was enoxaparin according to weight (2 × 100 mg daily) and clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for post-thrombotic syndrome, more specifically with respect to compression stockings, ESVS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering below knee elastic compression stockings exerting a pressure of 20–40 mmHg at the ankle to reduce the severity of symptoms in patients with PTS.

### The post-thrombotic syndrome: progress and pitfalls [^c1d132fc]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in up to one half of patients after symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and is the most common complication of DVT. Typical features of PTS include chronic pain, swelling, heaviness, oedema and skin changes in the affected limb. In severe cases, venous ulcers may develop. The frequency of PTS is likely to be reduced by preventing DVT with the use of effective thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients and settings and by minimising the risk of ipsilateral DVT recurrence. Use of compression stockings for 2 years after DVT appears to reduce the incidence and severity of PTS but issues remain regarding their use and effectiveness. Future research should focus on elucidating the pathophysiology and risk factors for PTS, assessing the safety and effectiveness of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PTS and evaluating the optimal use of compression stockings to prevent and treat PTS. In addition, new therapies to treat PTS should be sought and evaluated.

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^35c179eb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Antiembolism stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices

Antiembolism/thromboembolism deterrent (TED) stockings generate a constant pressure of at least 25 mmHg 32, 33, whereas intermittent pneumatic compression devices produce an intermittent pressure of approximately 40 mmHg for 12 s each minute 34. As the risk of compartment syndrome increases at pressures above 30 mmHg, the application of antiembolism stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices could increase the risk of a patient developing compartment syndrome. It has been suggested that both modalities of thromboprophylaxis should not be used concurrently during extended surgery in the lithotomy or Lloyd‐Davies position, because of this risk 35.

Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance 36 requires only that patients should be offered either modality, and there may be specific contraindications to one or other form of thromboprophylaxis. However, the potential risk of causing (or at least increasing the risk of) WLCS seems unlikely to represent adequate justification for not using one or both forms of prophylaxis, properly undertaken, in high‐risk circumstances such as prolonged pelvic surgery. There are no randomized trials or even observational studies that have compared the risks of WLCS in patients with, and without TED stockings or intermittent pneumatic calf compression. The theoretical possibility that measures taken to reduce the risks of thromboembolism (taken alone or together) might increase the risk of WLCS has therefore to be evaluated based on the balance of the relative risks of these two potentially fatal postoperative complications.

In the absence of any form of thromboprophylaxis, the risk of an asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is up to 25 per cent and the risk of a fatal pulmonary embolism is 0·5 per cent following abdominopelvic surgery 37. It therefore seems inappropriate to avoid carefully applied TED stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic calf compression devices, purely because of potential concerns about causing WLCS.

Postprocedural care after endovenous ablation includes compression therapy and a conditional duplex scan recommendation. Graduated compression stockings with an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mm Hg or an elastic/nonelastic wrap are applied, and elastic compression is supported for at least 1 week with leg compression day and night. Given that the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), heat-induced thrombus extension, or pulmonary embolism (PE) is rare, the guideline states, "we suggest postprocedural duplex scanning within 24 to 72 hours", and rates the supporting evidence as low quality (GRADE 2C).

### Treating superficial venous thrombophlebitis [^43f7f3a0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) is characterized as a localized inflammatory condition of the venous vessels underlying the skin. It arises from thrombosis of a superficial vein, and clinical presentation usually involves pain, erythema, and tenderness at the sites of inflammation. Although the condition is usually self-limited and not serious or fatal, symptomatic superficial thrombophlebitis can be debilitating, limit movement and certain capabilities, or progress to involve the deep venous system and cause pulmonary embolism. SVT is typically associated with venous valvular insufficiency, pregnancy, infection, and prothrombotic conditions, including malignancy. Currently, medical therapies comprising bedrest, elastic stockings, compression bandages, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and low molecular weight heparins are used to reduce the extension of inflammation and recurrence of thrombotic events in patients experiencing SVT. In patients refractory to conservative measures, surgical interventions such as phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, saphenous junction ligation, or saphenous vein stripping are potential treatments.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^2b24618a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad57eaca]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study selection, data extraction and analysis

We included systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the following criteria: (a) study population of elderly (≥ 70 years) with venous insufficiency and swollen legs without recent (≤ 2 years) deep vein thrombosis; (b) evaluating the preventive effects of European standard compression stockings class 2 or 3; (c) compared to a different class of compression stockings, other interventions to promote venous backflow or no intervention; (d) assessed on thrombosis, leg ulcer and mobility (primary outcomes) or other health related outcomes such as pain, discomfort, quality of life or post-thrombotic syndrome (secondary outcomes). Compliance was not defined as an outcome in the original protocol, but following feedback, we included compliance as a secondary outcome post hoc.

Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of records identified by the search. Records appearing to meet the inclusion criteria and those with insufficient details were obtained in full text. Two reviewers independently assessed the full text publications according to a pre-defined inclusion form. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

The first author (KTD) described the included trials with regard to population, intervention, comparison, outcome and main results in tables. Another reviewer (HTM) checked the extracted information. Two reviewers (KTD, HTM) independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Risk of Bias assessment tool.

We conducted meta-analysis in Review Manager (RevMan5.3) software, when studies were sufficiently similar in terms of design, population, interventions and outcomes. We calculated relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). We used a random effects model to account for pooling effects due to the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies. Double-data entries were performed. We planned to do subgroup analysis based on population and degree of compression, but due to the small number of studies, this was not feasible.

We assessed the quality of the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). The assessment involves within-study risk of bias, directness of evidence, inconsistency of effect estimates (heterogeneity), precision of effect estimate and risk of publication bias. The GRADE assessment indicates the extent to which we can have confidence in the effect estimate. Confidence of the effect estimates were described as high, moderate, low and very low (Table 1).

### Compression therapy for treating post-thrombotic syndrome [^968dfac2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) characterised by chronic complaints such as oedema and skin changes including; venous ectasia, varicose veins, redness, eczema, hyperpigmentation, and in severe cases fibrosis of the subcutaneous adipose in the affected limb. These chronic complaints are the effects of venous outflow restriction that can cause symptoms such as heaviness, itching, pain, cramps, and paraesthesia. Twenty to fifty percent of people with DVT develop post-thrombotic complications. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of PTS during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. There have been limited studies regarding the effectiveness of compression therapy for prevention or treatment of PTS. As a result, clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of compression therapy during treatment of DVT and in the treatment of PTS. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of post-thrombotic syndrome, including elastic compression stockings and mechanical devices compared with no intervention, placebo and with each other.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries on 2 July 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included trials that evaluated compression therapy for the treatment of PTS. The primary outcomes were severity of PTS and adverse effects. There were no restrictions on date or language. Two review authors (SA, DNK) independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted and summarised data and one review author (DNK) verified them. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We assessed methodological study quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used GRADE to assess the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.

Main Results

We identified four trials, with 116 participants, investigating the effectiveness of compression therapy for treatment of PTS. The methodology used by each trial was too heterogeneous to perform a meta-analysis, so we reported our findings narratively. Two trials studied the effect of graduated elastic compression stockings (GECS) on improvement of PTS symptoms. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while the other found no benefits on PTS severity compared to placebo (very low-certainty evidence). There was very limited evidence available for adverse effects and quality of life (QoL). The two studies did not report on compliance rates during the study period. Two trials studied the effects of intermittent mechanical compression devices. Both reported improvement in PTS severity (low-certainty evidence). Improvement of the severity of PTS was defined by treatment 'success' or 'failure'. Only one study comparing compression devices evaluated adverse effects and QoL. Although 9% of the participants experienced adverse effects such as leg swelling, irritation, superficial bleeding, and skin itching (moderate-certainty evidence), QoL was improved (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies did not assess compliance using intermittent mechanical compression devices. None of the studies evaluated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low-certainty evidence regarding the use of GECS for treatment of PTS as assessed by two small studies of short duration. One study reported beneficial haemodynamic effects, while one found no benefits on PTS severity compared to control/placebo stockings. There is very limited evidence for adverse effects, patient satisfaction, QoL, and compliance rates. There is low-certainty evidence favouring use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices compared to a control device for the treatment of severity owing to different measurements used by the studies reporting on this outcome and small studies of short duration. There is moderate-certainty evidence of improved QoL but possible increased adverse effects related to compression device use owing to small studies of short duration. High-certainty evidence to support the use of compression therapy in prevention of PTS is lacking and any conclusions drawn from current evidence should be interpreted with care. Further research is needed to assess whether compression can result in long-term reduction and relief of the symptoms caused by PTS, or prevent deterioration and leg ulceration.

### Individualised versus standard duration of elastic compression therapy for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (IDEAL DVT): a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, allocation-concealed, non-inferiority trial [^63c14f11]. The Lancet: Haematology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Therapy with elastic compression stockings has been the cornerstone for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome for decades in patients after acute deep venous thrombosis. It is uncertain who benefits most from therapy, and what the optimum duration of therapy should be. We therefore aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of individualised duration of compression therapy versus the standard duration of 24 months following an initial treatment period of 6 months.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, single-blind, allocation-concealed, non-inferiority trial at 12 hospitals in the Netherlands and two in Italy. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg and without pre-existent venous insufficiency (Clinical Etiological Anatomical and Pathophysiological score < C3) to receive either individualised duration of elastic compression therapy or standard duration of therapy for 24 months following an initial treatment period of 6 months. Randomisation was done with a web-based automatic randomisation programme (TENALEA) and a random block size (2–12), and was stratified by centre, age, and body-mass index. In the initial phase, compression was applied within 24 h of diagnosis according to three prespecified protocols. All patients received elastic compression stockings (30–40 mm Hg) for 6 months, and were instructed to wear them every day during ambulant hours. Thereafter treatment was tailored on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms scored according to the Villalta post-thrombotic syndrome scale; patients assigned to individualised therapy with two consecutive Villalta scores of 4 or less were instructed to stop using the stockings. Patients were followed up for 2 years and assessed at five clinic visits at study inclusion, and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after diagnosis (stocking allocation was not revealed to the assessors). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with post-thrombotic syndrome at 24 months diagnosed according to original Villalta criteria (a score of ≥ 5 on two consecutive occasions at least 3 months apart) assessed by intention to treat. The predefined non-inferiority margin for the difference in success rates was set at 7·5%. This study has been completed and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01429714.

Findings

Between March 22, 2011, and July 1, 2015, we enrolled 865 patients and randomly assigned 437 to individualised duration compression stockings and 428 to standard duration. 283 (66%) of 432 patients in the intervention group were advised before 24 months to stop wearing elastic compression stockings (236 [55%] of 432 patients after 6 months, and 47 [11%] of 432 at 12 months). Post-thrombotic syndrome occurred in 125 (29%) of 432 patients receiving individualised duration of therapy and in 118 (28%) of 424 receiving standard duration of therapy (odds ratio for difference 1·06, 95% CI 0·78 to 1·44). The absolute difference was 1·1% (95% CI -5·2 to 7·3), thus meeting the non-inferiority margin. 24 patients died, 17 (4%) in the individualised treatment group and seven (2%) in the standard duration group, but no deaths were related to treatment. No serious adverse events related to the intervention occurred.

Interpretation

Individualised therapy with elastic compression stockings for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome was non-inferior to standard duration of therapy of 24 months. Individualising the duration is effective and could shorten the length of therapy needed, potentially enhancing patients' wellbeing.

### Compression therapy after invasive treatment of superficial veins of the lower extremities: clinical practice guidelines of the American Venous Forum, Society for Vascular Surgery, American college of phlebology, Society for Vascular Medicine, and International Union of Phlebology [^ab2465d2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). High credibility.

Compression device selection and practicality — elastic stockings may be challenging for some patients to don and doff, particularly among patients who are morbidly obese in whom very high leg venous pressure from increased intra-abdominal pressure can overwhelm an elastic product and lead to recurrent edema with a high risk for recurrent ulceration; aids for donning and doffing stockings are often awkward. Velcro compression devices are an alternative to elastic stockings because their inelastic nature produces higher compression during ambulation, which reduces venous stasis and edema; they are adjustable for tightening or loosening as leg volume changes and are easy to apply and remove, even in patients with physical limitations.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^502c7e99]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Despite recognition that superficial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity and little consensus on its management. While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated. Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratified treatment based on this distinction. Several therapies including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce pain and inflammation, however, given the associated progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of note, the application of warm compresses to the site of SVT has never been evaluated in any study.

### Treatment of lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis [^7a95a2f0]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What treatments for lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis are associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTE), major bleeding, and superficial venous thrombosis extension?

Bottom Line

Fondaparinux (2.5 mg) subcutaneously once daily for 45 days is associated with fewer symptomatic VTEs and lower rates of superficial venous thrombosis extension and recurrence with no increases in major bleeding compared with placebo. Low-molecular-weight heparin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with lower rates of superficial thrombophlebitis extension or recurrence, but data regarding symptomatic VTEs are inconclusive.

Risk of Bias

Included studies were at a mix of low, unclear, and high risk of bias. Older studies tended not to have published protocols and were at unclear or high risk of selective reporting. Many of the trials demonstrated incomplete outcome data, in part, this was due to difficulties in ensuring all patients had venography in the applicable trials. This was accounted for in the risk of bias assessment, but differential attrition between individual trial arms or lack of adequate explanation for attrition were considered as introducing a high risk of bias. Blinding was performed well across the trials, including the use of a double-dummy approach in many trials. Even when blinding was considered not possible to implement, many trials opted for a single-blinded approach, and knowledge of the intervention by trial participants was considered to have a low risk of influencing the outcome of objectively diagnosed VTE. Randomization sequence generation was well performed but details regarding allocation concealment were often omitted. A full risk of bias assessment is available in the Supplemental Table (Supplemental Digital Content Table 2).

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations Assessment

The quality of evidence from the 2 trials included in the head-to-head meta-analysis was graded as high-quality evidence, with good consistency, directness, precision, and low risk of bias. The quality of evidence for the pooled rate of PE and VTE-related mortality was downgraded to moderate quality evidence in light of the risk of bias. The quality of evidence for the pooled rate of DVT in trial arms was downgraded to very low in light of the serious risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.

### Compression stockings for preventing deep vein thrombosis in airline passengers [^d7d9d758]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Air travel might increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It has been suggested that wearing compression stockings might reduce this risk. This is an update of the review first published in 2006.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wearing compression stockings versus not wearing them for preventing DVT in people travelling on flights lasting at least four hours.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (10 February 2016). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CENTRAL (2016, Issue 1)).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of compression stockings versus no stockings in passengers on flights lasting at least four hours. Trials in which passengers wore a stocking on one leg but not the other, or those comparing stockings and another intervention were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. We sought additional information from trialists where necessary.

Main Results

One new study that fulfilled the inclusion criteria was identified for this update. Eleven randomised trials (n = 2906) were included in this review: nine (n = 2821) compared wearing graduated compression stockings on both legs versus not wearing them; one trial (n = 50) compared wearing graduated compression tights versus not wearing them; and one trial (n = 35) compared wearing a graduated compression stocking on one leg for the outbound flight and on the other leg on the return flight. Eight trials included people judged to be at low or medium risk of developing DVT (n = 1598) and two included high-risk participants (n = 1273). All flights had a duration of more than five hours. Fifty of 2637 participants with follow-up data available in the trials of wearing compression stockings on both legs had a symptomless DVT; three wore stockings, 47 did not (odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.25, P < 0.001; high-quality evidence). There were no symptomless DVTs in three trials. Sixteen of 1804 people developed superficial vein thrombosis, four wore stockings, 12 did not (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.13, P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). No deaths, pulmonary emboli or symptomatic DVTs were reported. Wearing stockings had a significant impact in reducing oedema (mean difference (MD) -4.72, 95% CI -4.91 to -4.52; based on six trials; low-quality evidence). A further two trials showed reduced oedema in the stockings group but could not be included in the meta-analysis as they used different methods to measure oedema. No significant adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that airline passengers similar to those in this review can expect a substantial reduction in the incidence of symptomless DVT and low-quality evidence that leg oedema is reduced if they wear compression stockings. Quality was limited by the way that oedema was measured. There is moderate-quality evidence that superficial vein thrombosis may be reduced if passengers wear compression stockings. We cannot assess the effect of wearing stockings on death, pulmonary embolism or symptomatic DVT because no such events occurred in these trials. Randomised trials to assess these outcomes would need to include a very large number of people.

### Effect of compression stockings on post thrombotic syndrome in patients with deep vein thrombosis: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^089d70ae]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether compression stockings are effective in the prevention of post thrombotic syndrome in patients with deep vein thrombosis remains unknown. Since the recently published SOX trial, no meta-analysis has been done to re-evaluate the available literature on whether compression stockings are beneficial in these patients. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of elastic compression stockings on preventing post thrombotic syndrome in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception to July 29, 2015, with no language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials comparing compression therapy with placebo (either none or placebo stockings) in patients with deep vein thrombosis. We did a meta-analysis with primary outcome as incidence of post thrombotic syndrome. Secondary outcomes analysed were mortality and recurrence of deep vein thrombosis. Sensitivity analysis was done for heterogeneity, study quality, diagnosis by Villalta scoring, and non-delayed randomisation.

Findings

We identified 674 reports, of which six were randomised controlled trials including 1462 patients. Use of elastic compression stockings was not associated with prevention of post thrombotic syndrome compared with controls (OR 0·56 [95% CI 0·27–1·16]; 36% [269/739] vs 45% [322/723]; p = 0·12). Subgroup sensitivity analysis showed that elastic compression stockings were not associated with prevention of post thrombotic syndrome despite trying to account for heterogeneity (OR 0·63 [95% CI 0·29–1·33]; 27% [63/234] vs 37% [85/231]; p = 0·23), diagnosis by Villalta scoring (0·81 [0·36–1·84]; 43% [228/535] vs 45% [235/517]; p = 0·62), nor those that patients randomised within 1 month of diagnosis (0·57 [0·22–1·45]; 41% [258/631] vs 49% [304/615]; p = 0·24). Secondary outcomes such as mortality (OR 0·98 [95% CI 0·68–1·41]; 10% [68/703] vs 10% [67/690]; p = 0·92) or recurrence of deep vein thrombosis (OR 0·93 [95% CI 0·66–1·31]; 6·4% [70/1094] vs 6·8% [73/1066]; p = 0·69) did not differ significantly between the treatment and control groups.

Interpretation

In patients with deep venous thrombosis, use of elastic compression stockings does not significantly reduce the development of post thrombotic syndrome, however the current body of evidence is limited and we believe at present there is equipoise and further conclusive studies are needed to establish the role of this therapy.

Funding

None.

General considerations for compression therapy after varicose vein interventions — Five categories are available (compression bandages, compression stockings, self-adjustable Velcro devices, compression pumps, and hybrid devices), and compression bandages and compression stockings are most commonly used for short-term application; training for proper application is essential; multicomponent bandages should be applied with a pressure of approximately 50 mm Hg on the lower leg and > 30 mm Hg on the thigh; elastic textiles increase sub-bandage pressure when patients stand up or walk; compression stockings produce less pressure increases than compression bandages when standing up and when walking, yet have been shown to be effective in reducing edema and pain vs no stockings and seem to have anti-inflammatory properties.

### Effects of preventive use of compression stockings for elderly with chronic venous insufficiency and swollen legs: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78b15a5d]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a condition with impaired blood flow in the deep leg veins, and is usually caused by inadequate venous valves. The condition is characterized by symptoms like oedema, skin changes, fatigue, leg pain and a sensation of heaviness in the leg, and can be diagnosed by using ultrasound techniques to detect venous reflux and pooling of blood in deep leg veins. Venous insufficiency may develop into chronic leg ulcer and deep vein thrombosis. Venous thrombosis may damage the valves, and symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency following a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are called post-thrombotic syndrome. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification is an accepted standard for classifying chronic venous disorders. The chronic venous disorders are classified from C0 to C6 based on the severity of venous symptoms. The prevalence of venous insufficiency varies considerably between genders, ethnic backgrounds and age groups. A German cross-sectional study from 2008 included more than 3000 people aged 18 to 79 years, and estimated the overall prevalence of venous insufficiency to 31%. The risk of venous insufficiency increases with age.

Physical activity, smoking cessation, weight reduction, leg elevation, anticoagulant drugs and medical compression stockings may reduce symptoms and prevent progress of chronic venous insufficiency. External compression, such as medical compression stockings, may reduce oedema and swelling, and improve microcirculation. Medical compression stockings reach the knee or the hip and usually exert a pressure of 20 to 40 mmHg. Different standards exist, but according to the European standard, compression stockings are categorised into four classes. Class 1 stockings exert pressures below 20 mmHg and are used to prevent oedema. Class 2 stockings exert pressures between 20 and 30 mmHg and are used in the prevention of venous insufficiency and varicose veins. Class 3 stockings result in high compressions between 30 and 40 mmHg and are used for chronic venous insufficiency, whereas class 4 stockings exert very high compression above 40 mmHg and are primarily used in the treatment of lymphoedema.

### Passive leg raising and compression stockings: a note of caution [^ea8986dd]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In a recent editorial in Critical Care, Monnet and Teboul emphasize the value of passive leg raising (PLR) as a reliable bedside indicator of fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. This is because PLR induces changes in venous return, regardless of the mode of ventilation or the underlying cardiac arrhythmias. In their eloquently written editorial, they provide five practical rules for performing a PLR maneuver.

The authors state that during PLR about 300 mL of blood is auto-transfused from the lower limbs and splanchnic circulation into the central compartment, resulting in an increased cardiac output. This maneuver has been validated in cohorts of patients with either hypovolaemic or septic shock. It is a prerequisite of the test that the volume of blood that is auto-transfused be sufficient to increase mean circulatory pressure which drives venous return. We hypothesize that this may not be the situation in all patients and that, if there is no change in cardiac output, blood pressure, or right atrial pressure, an inadequate volume of blood will be returned to the right heart. This may be relevant in patients with elastic compression stockings, which are widely used to prevent venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. The effectiveness of PLR as a measure of fluid responsiveness can be compromised by elastic compression stockings. Consequently, we would recommend that elastic compression stockings be routinely removed prior to the PLR maneuver.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep vein thrombosis [^b1c5f51c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

One of the settings where deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb and pelvic veins occurs is in hospital with prolonged immobilisation of patients for various surgical and medical illnesses. Using graduated compression stockings (GCS) in these patients has been proposed to decrease the risk of DVT. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000 and updated in 2010.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of graduated compression stockings in preventing DVT in various groups of hospitalised patients.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched March 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 2).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving GCS alone; or GCS used on a background of any other DVT prophylactic method. Results from both these groups of trials were combined in this update.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update one review author (AS) extracted the data. These were cross-checked and authenticated by a second author (MJD). Two review authors (AS and MJD) assessed the quality of trials. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Nineteen RCTs were identified involving 1681 individual patients and 1064 individual legs (2745 analytic units). Of these 19 trials, nine included patients undergoing general surgery, six included patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, and only one trial included medical patients. Graduated compression stockings were applied on the day before surgery or on the day of surgery and were worn up until discharge or until the patients were fully mobile. In the majority of the included studies DVT was identified by the radioactive I(125) uptake test. Overall, included studies were of good quality. In the treatment group (GCS) of 1391 units 126 developed DVT (9%) in comparison to the control group (without GCS) of 1354 units where 282 (21%) developed DVT. The Peto odds ratio (OR) was 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.41) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P < 0.00001). Based on results from eight included studies, the incidence of proximal DVT was 7 of 517 (1%) units in the treatment group and 28 of 518 (5%) units in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.53) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.0002). Based on results from five included studies, the incidence of PE was 5 of 283 (2%) participants in the treatment group and 14 of 286 (5%) in the control group. The Peto OR was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.96) with an overall effect favouring treatment with GCS (P = 0.04). Limited data were available to accurately assess the incidence of adverse effects and complications with the use of GCS.

Authors' Conclusions

GCS are effective in diminishing the risk of DVT in hospitalised patients, with strong evidence favouring their use in general and orthopaedic surgery. However, evidence for their effectiveness in medical patients is limited to one trial.

Post‑thrombotic syndrome — clinical features, evaluation, and management in obesity: Post‑thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic disorder due to long‑term effects of inflammation, scarring, and other damage to veins/valves in patients experiencing one or more deep vein thromboses (DVT), and PTS can be described by the Villalta scale, as well as the Ginsberg measure and CEAP classification. Symptoms include edema, pain, or heaviness of the affected leg with skin that may become thickened or discolored, and imaging may include Doppler ultrasound, with additional procedures including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography. Noninterventional treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing further complications via elevating legs, compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression units, venous reducing drugs, anticoagulants, healthful nutrition, routine physical activity, and attaining a healthy body weight, while interventional treatments include vein angioplasty or stent placement.

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) for post-thrombotic syndrome: Use of IPC may be helpful to relieve PTS symptoms, but its role in preventing venous leg ulcers (VLU) is unknown. Use of IPC should be based on individual assessment as little evidence exists. A small randomized crossover trial in patients with PTS found that compared with placebo-level pressure, IPC with a level of compression of 50 mm Hg was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms. Two other groups of patients who may benefit from IPC are those with severe difficulty in donning standard compression stockings and those who are immobile.

### Early experience with diclofenac topical gel for moderate to severe postablation phlebitis [^97a611e4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: Thirty-eight patients treated with diclofenac topical gel for moderate to severe postablation phlebitis had similar pain reduction trends as those treated with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone. Most patients preferred the diclofenac topical gel owing to its ease of use and immediate local pain reduction. Patients treated with diclofenac gel often had significant pain relief and did not require a second oral agent.
- **Take Home Message**: Diclofenac topical gel, alone or in combination with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, resulted in significant pain relief when patients developed moderate to severe postablation phlebitis.

Postablation thrombophlebitis of the superficial truncal veins can develop after open surgical, chemical, or endovenous ablation. Moreover, chemical ablation has been cited in several reports to have an increased risk of inflammatory reactions at the early and intermediate postoperative periods. Historically, these symptoms are usually managed with supportive care, including extremity elevation, warm or cool compresses, compression stockings, ambulation, and/or oral (PO) NSAIDs. The pharmacological treatment for postablation phlebitis with PO NSAIDs remains under continuous research because no single agent has been found to be more effective than another. Several large-scale orthopedic studies evaluated diclofenac topical gel for osteoarthritis, and found fewer side effects and better patient adherence than PO NSAIDs owing to its localized effects. The use of topical anti-inflammatory agents in the setting of postablation phlebitis has been reported, but still remains novel. Therefore, this study assesses diclofenac 1% topical gel as a stand-alone treatment for patients with moderate to severe phlebitis after ablation.

ASH 2019 VTE prevention — pneumatic compression devices versus graduated compression stockings in major surgery: The panel suggests using pneumatic compression devices over graduated compression stockings for patients undergoing major surgery, recognizing that there was very low certainty evidence for a net health benefit/harm. The recommendation applies to patients undergoing major surgery who are considered at risk for VTE, and in settings where pneumatic compression devices are not available, the use of graduated compression stockings is reasonable, because mechanical prophylaxis is an acceptable and feasible option.

### Controversies in venous thromboembolism: to treat or not to treat superficial vein thrombosis [^9af6d890]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

The management of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is poorly defined and remains controversial overall. SVT has long been considered a benign, self-limited disease, but recent studies show that SVT carries a nonnegligible risk for recurrence, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. Current guidelines recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux, but results of several surveys indicate that the majority of patients with SVT receive nonanticoagulant therapy only, which includes compression stockings or bandages, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical application of heparin gel, or surgical interventions. However, several recent observational and interventional studies provide better insight into the optimal treatment of patients with SVT who are at different risks for thromboembolic complications. This educational review summarizes the available evidence and aims to provide practical guidance based on a clinical decision pathway.

### Graduated compression stockings as adjuvant to pharmaco-thromboprophylaxis in elective surgical patients (GAPS study): randomised controlled trial [^d056cfea]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was new VTE within 90 days of surgery, either lower limb deep vein thrombosis with or without symptoms, proven by duplex ultrasound, or pulmonary embolism with symptoms confirmed by imaging. Participants were invited to undergo a bilateral full lower limb duplex ultrasound scan between 14 and 21 days after surgery to capture the peak incidence of VTE. Whole leg venous ultrasound scans were performed, which evaluated deep veins from the common femoral vein to calf veins. Symptoms suggestive of VTE could trigger imaging at any point during the trial. If a positive diagnosis was made, the treating clinical team and local principal investigator were informed and the patient was treated in accordance with local hospital guidelines. An anonymised copy of the scan report was sent to the trial coordinating centre where the primary outcome was verified by an independent blinded clinical expert. The 90 day endpoint is in line with the definition of hospital acquired thrombosis. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life (assessed by using EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol five dimensions five levels)), compliance with stockings and LMWH, GCS related lower limb complications, bleeding complications, adverse reactions to LMWH, and all cause mortality.

Statistical analysis

The supplementary material gives full details of the original and revised sample size calculations. The original sample size was 2236 for the primary outcome of VTE at 90 days. This sample was intended to have 90% power at a one sided 2.5% level of significance to detect a 3.5% non-inferiority margin (considered to be clinically important) over an assumed 6% event rate in the group randomised to LMWH and GCS; this rate was adjusted for 10% loss to follow up and the group sequential design. We derived the imaging confirmed VTE event rate of 6% from a recent systematic review that identified randomised controlled trials with arms exploring VTE outcomes in patients who had elective surgery. This margin was chosen because clinicians would not tolerate more than 3.5% absolute deterioration in VTE event rate over combination therapy. The margin also preserves 61% of the established treatment effect over no intervention. When we stratified patients by age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years) and VTE risk category (moderate or high risk), four subpopulations were identified.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^d26eec3f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — We recommend that all patients be treated with knee-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg) for at least 2 years after the procedure (Grade 1C). Compression stockings improve calf muscle pump function, reduce edema, and likely improve cutaneous microcirculation. The use of graded elastic compression stockings decreases by 50% the incidence of objectively defined postthrombotic syndrome after a first episode of "proximal" DVT treated with conventional anticoagulation. In a randomized trial of 194 patients, the incidence of mild-to-moderate and severe postthrombotic syndrome was 20% and 11%, respectively, among patients receiving compression stockings compared with 47% and 23% among those in the control group. Prandoni et al similarly found the use of compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle) reduced the 2-year incidence of any post-thrombotic syndrome from 49.1% to 24.5%. Among those treated with optimal anticoagulation, 4.3 patients need to wear compression stockings to prevent one case of post-thrombotic syndrome. On the basis of these data, current guidelines recommend the prescription of graded elastic compression stockings (40 mm Hg at the ankle) for at least 2 years after a proximal thrombotic event treated with conventional anticoagulation (Grade 1A). Although early thrombus removal strategies likely also reduce the incidence of the postthrombotic syndrome, no reports have evaluated the adjunctive effect of compression stockings in this patient population. The evidence supporting the use of compression stockings among patients treated with early thrombus removal strategies is indirect, but the potential benefits likely exceed the risks, and their use can be strongly recommended (Grade 1C).

Graduated compression stockings — classification and comparative evidence: Graduated compression stockings are classified by ankle pressure with Class 1 exerting an ankle pressure < 20 mm Hg, Class 2 providing moderate compression between 20 and 30 mm Hg, and Class 3 being high compression with ankle pressures > 30 mm Hg. When comparing different levels of compression and lengths, there was no clear difference in this Cochrane review, patient preference was largely driven by comfort, and none of the studies assessed quality of life (QOL). Overall, there was insufficient high quality evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins.

Suggestions for good clinical practice — device adherence, stocking pressure, and dosing emphasize that adherence with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) often is less than optimal and, therefore, should be monitored actively, with efforts made to achieve at least 18 h of use daily, and portable, battery-powered devices capable of recording and reporting proper wear time may facilitate monitoring. Proper fit and adherence with elastic stockings (ES) is necessary to ensure efficacy; the correct pressure at the ankle level for primary prophylaxis is 18 to 23 mm Hg, which is lower than for therapeutic stockings used to treat postthrombotic syndrome (30–40 mm Hg), and thigh-high elastic stockings are favored over calf-high stockings. Relative contraindications to IPC and ES include dermatitis, skin breakdown, or ulceration; peripheral vascular disease; lower-extremity bypass procedure; and lower-extremity trauma with plaster cast, and unilateral compression in an unaffected limb should not be used as the sole means of prophylaxis. In the overwhelming majority of trials that demonstrated efficacy, LDUH and LMWH were given 2 h preoperatively, and LMWH appears to be effective and is possibly associated with a lower risk of bleeding when the first dose is given 12 h preoperatively. When using pharmacologic prophylaxis, we suggest following the manufacturer's recommendations for dosing, and it may be advisable for every institution to have a formal, written policy for preventing VTE in surgical patients.

Clinical Question

Which treatments for lower extremity superficial thrombophlebitis (ST) are associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) vs placebo?

Bottom Line

A dose of 2.5 mg of fondaparinux administered subcutaneously once daily for 45 days is associated with fewer cases of symptomatic VTE without an increase in major bleeding vs placebo. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with lower rates of ST extension or recurrence vs placebo, but data regarding symptomatic VTE remain inconclusive. Oral rivaroxaban requires further evaluation.

After discharge, patients were treated with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice a day) for minimum of 30 days. This was considered the initial anticoagulation period. They were also instructed to wear graded compression stockings, 20 to 30 or 30 to 40 mmHg, on both legs for 90 days. At the end of this initial anticoagulation period, enoxaparin could be substituted for an oral anticoagulant in those patients requiring long‐term anticoagulation. If limb swelling and discomfort did not allow standard graded compression stocking use, leg wraps, leg elevation, and pumps were used initially to reduce the swelling and pain. Patients were encouraged to ambulate early and often, as tolerated.

Contrast venography imaging was collected preprocedure, after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, post‐USAT, and after adjunctive therapy. Analysis was conducted by a core laboratory (Syntactx, New York, NY). Venous duplex ultrasound imaging was collected post posture and at each follow‐up visit and analyzed by a vascular ultrasound core laboratory (VasCore, Boston, MA).

### The post-thrombotic syndrome [^d4eca837]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

The post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent, sometimes disabling complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that reduces quality of life and is costly. This article discusses risk factors for PTS after DVT and available means to prevent and treat PTS, with a focus on new information in the field. After DVT, PTS will develop in 20% to 50% of patients, and severe PTS, including venous ulcers, will develop in 5% to 10%. The principal risk factors for PTS are anatomically extensive DVT, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, persistent leg symptoms 1 month after acute DVT, obesity, and older age. By preventing the initial DVT and ipsilateral DVT recurrence, primary and secondary prophylaxes of DVT will prevent cases of PTS. Based on recent evidence from a large multicenter trial, routine use of elastic compression stockings (ECS) after DVT to prevent PTS is not advocated, but in patients with DVT-related leg swelling that is bothersome, a trial of ECS is reasonable. Selecting DVT patients for catheter-directed thrombolytic treatment as a means of preventing PTS should be done on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on patients with extensive thrombosis, recent symptoms onset, and low bleeding risk. For patients with established PTS, daily use of ECS may help to relieve symptoms and edema. Intermittent compression devices can be tried in patients with moderate-to-severe PTS whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with ECS alone. A supervised exercise training program may improve PTS symptoms. Management of post-thrombotic ulcers should ideally involve a multidisciplinary approach. Important areas for future research are summarized.

### Elastic compression stockings for prevention of the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with and without residual vein thrombosis and / or popliteal valve reflux [^43366717]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of elastic compression stockings (ECS) for the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) arising after a proximal deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is controversial. Although most randomized studies showed a substantial reduction of PTS with the use of ECS, the recent, large SOX clinical trial that used sham stockings as a comparator failed to confirm these findings. Accordingly, most international guidelines no longer recommend routine use of ECS for the prevention of PTS. Nevertheless, ECS are still commonly prescribed in clinical practice.

A recent systematic review showed that patients with DVT who at 6 weeks or later had either residual vein thrombosis (RVT) or popliteal valve reflux (PVR) had a higher risk of subsequent PTS than those without these findings. As these ultrasound features are associated with longstanding venous hypertension that could be modified by compression therapy, the early identification of RVT and PVR has the potential to identify a subgroup of patients who may still benefit from the use of ECS.

In a prospective cohort study of 869 patients with a proximal DVT that was either unprovoked or associated with transient risk factors, we observed an increased risk of PTS in those with RVT. Briefly, all patients received initial treatment with unfractionated or low-molecularweight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists according to international guidelines, with individual treatment duration (ranging between 3 and 24 months) based on each patient's preferences and risk profile. Patients with recent (< 2 years) ipsilateral DVT and those requiring indefinite anticoagulation were not eligible. Patients were advised to wear ECS (30–40 mmHg at the ankle) for at least 2 years, and were followed-up for 3 years. They were instructed to report in a booklet how long they wore the stockings, the use of not permitted stockings, and the occurrence of any adverse effects impairing their use. At 3 months, an ultrasound assessment was done to document the presence of RVT (vein diameter under maximum compressibility > 4 mm)and PVR (retrograde flow through the popliteal valve after manual compression of the mid-thigh > 0.5 seconds, which persisted after repeating the maneuver with a tourniquet). The Villalta scale was used to assess the development of PTS every 6 months. A score of 5 to 14 in two, even non-consecutive, assessments indicated non-severe PTS, while a score ≥ 15 or the presence of a skin ulcer in a single assessment indicated severe PTS.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^84e22e1e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal for acute deep venous thrombosis — evidence quality and research priorities — Most recommendations are weak (Grade 2) and based on the "very low quality of the underlying evidence". A systematic review "does suggest some benefit with respect to reducing the incidence of the postthrombotic syndrome". Successful application "requires careful patient selection" and patient preference consideration, and the use of patient-important outcomes "should be strongly encouraged over technical outcomes such as lytic success and surrogate markers such as reflux and residual venous obstruction". Randomized trials including ATTRACT and CaVenT "are currently underway" and are anticipated to inform guideline revisions. Key evidence gaps include the "optimal thrombolytic dose", comparative "safety and efficacy of different thrombolytic agents and mechanical thrombectomy devices", the "appropriate intensity of anticoagulation" during thrombolysis, limited data on adjuvants "such as intermittent pneumatic compression", and the need for the "quality-of-life benefits and cost-effectiveness of this therapy" to be more thoroughly evaluated.

### The role of thrombolysis in the clinical management of deep vein thrombosis [^7f7cfe21]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The cornerstones of current management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are the routine use of anticoagulant therapy, graduated elastic compression stockings, and early ambulation. Thrombolytic therapy was previously reserved only for patients with life-, limb-, or organ-threatening complications. However, the postthrombotic syndrome has been increasingly recognized as a frequent and serious long-term complication of DVT. In parallel, endovascular thrombolytic methods have evolved considerably in recent years, prompting discussion and controversy as to whether they should be more liberally used. In some centers, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is now routinely used in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. Randomized trials are currently under way to determine when the use of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is appropriate in patients presenting with acute proximal DVT.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — recommendation categories and implications are defined as follows: Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A) states that "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence (1B) uses "RCTs with important limitations… or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies" and implies "Strong recommendation, can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation". Strong recommendation, low-quality or very low-quality evidence (1C) relies on "Observational studies or case series" and implies "Strong recommendation but may change when higher quality evidence becomes available". Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A) indicates "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens", is supported by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and implies "Weak recommendation, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values".

Mechanical prophylaxis was ordered less often than pharmacologic prophylaxis (5.5% patient-days for anti-embolic stockings and 16.5% patient-days for pneumatic compression devices). These two devices were most often ordered when no anticoagulant was administered (Figure 2). More specifically, anti-embolic stockings were administered for 8.3% patient-days, and pneumatic compression devices on 34.8% patient-days. Overall, there were 1,245 patient-days (9.8%) during which both mechanical prophylaxis (anti-embolic stockings and pneumatic compression devices) and pharmacological prophylaxis were applied. Inferior vena cava filters were inserted in 31 patients (1.6%), for a total of 157 patient-days. Two-thirds of inferior vena cava filters were inserted prophylactically (21/31 filters, 67.7%), and two patients developed a leg deep venous thrombosis after the filter insertion during their ICU stay.

Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was considered to be a benign and self-limiting condition. However, it is now appreciated that a significant proportion of those presenting with SVT will have concomitant deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or are at significant risk of developing deep venous thromboembolism. Potential therapeutic options include topical preparations, compression therapy (stockings, bandages), medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anticoagulants (therapeutic or prophylactic doses) and surgery, ligation or stripping, of superficial veins. The treatment of choice is therapeutic/intermediate dose low molecular weight heparin or prophylactic dose fondaparinux administered for 4–6 weeks. The cost-effectiveness of treatment is a concern and more targeted therapy is required.

### Knee length versus thigh length graduated compression stockings for prevention of deep vein thrombosis in postoperative surgical patients [^cc146960]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Graduated compression stockings (GCS) are a valuable means of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalised postoperative surgical patients. But it is still unclear whether knee length graduated compression stockings (KL) or thigh length (TL) stockings are more effective.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to systematically analyse the randomised, controlled trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of KL versus TL GCS as a thromboprophylaxis tool in hospitalised patients undergoing various types of surgery.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2012) and CENTRAL (2012, Issue 1). The authors searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (until 27 February 2012) and they also searched the reference lists of relevant articles to identify additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials published in any language on KL versus TL GCS used as a thromboprophylaxis tool in hospitalised patients of any age and either gender.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was undertaken independently by two review authors using data extraction sheets and confirmed by the third review author.

Main Results

Three studies, with a combined total of 496 patients, matched the inclusion criteria for this review. All three included studies evaluated the role of KL and TL in thromboprophylaxis among a group of postoperative patients. These studies showed no significant difference in the ability of the two modalities of leg compression to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in postoperative patients. In both the fixed-effect model (odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 3.07, P = 0.21) and random-effects model (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.06, P = 0.63) KL graduated compression stockings were as effective as TL stockings in thromboprophylaxis. However, there was significant heterogeneity (Tau(2) = 0.50; Chi(2) = 4.12, df = 2 (P = 0.13); I(2) = 51%) among trials. Results of this review may be considered weak because there was significant heterogeneity among included trials resulting from inadequate randomisation techniques, allocation concealment, power calculations and the absence of intention-to-treat analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that there is insufficient high quality evidence to determine whether or not KL and TL GCS differ in their effectiveness in terms of reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalised patients. A major multicentre RCT is required to address this issue. In the meantime, the decision on which type of stocking to use in clinical practice is likely to be influenced by factors such as patient compliance, ease of use and cost implications.

Recommendation strength interpretation — strong vs conditional: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as strong or conditional and has the following interpretation. For a strong recommendation: for patients, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not; for clinicians, most individuals should follow the recommended course of action and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed; for policy makers, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; for researchers, the recommendation is supported by credible research, and on occasion a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. For a conditional recommendation: for patients, the majority would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; for clinicians, different choices will be appropriate for individual patients; for policy makers, policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders; for researchers, this recommendation is likely to be strengthened by additional research.

### Anticoagulant drug therapy for thrombophlebitis in the lower extremities… [^edda7044]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Patients ill of acute thrombophlebitis in the lower extremities frequently are treated by the administration of anticoagulant drugs for one to four weeks, by operative venous ligation, or by a combination of these methods. Therapy by bed rest, elevation, and elastic supports alone is not often recommended because ligational and anticoagulant therapeutic techniques are assumed to reduce the incidence of thromboembolic complications and hasten recovery from the illness. This study was undertaken in an attempt to determine whether or not therapy for thrombophlebitis including an anticoagulant regimen is superior to the use of elastic supports, elevation of the leg, and bed rest without specific anticoagulant drug therapy. Material The case records reviewed were those of patients with venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis in the veins of the lower extremities treated in the Barnes Hospital between Jan. 1, 1954, and Jan. 1, 1958. Patients dying of pulmonary embolus or other cause were.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Superficial venous thrombophlebitis (SVT) rationale and evidence — Studies show that SVT may progress to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 6% to 44% of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE); and 2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE, and superficial venous thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the greatest association with VTE. Although the majority of SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins confers greater morbidity. These recommendations are supported by two recent systematic reviews; the 2018 Cochrane review included 35 studies involving 7296 patients with SVT of the legs, and most studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (Higgins 2017). This tool addresses seven specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues (Differences between protocol and review). In this review we included unit‐of‐analysis issues under the domain of 'other issues', for example where a cluster‐randomised trial had been undertaken but analysed at the individual level in the study report. We assessed blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete outcome data for each of the review outcomes separately. We note that blinding of participants and personnel as to whether or not participants had been allocated to compression is impossible and therefore performance bias is a risk. Performance bias may be introduced when awareness of treatment allocation results in deviations from intended interventions and/or differential co‐interventions use or care between groups not specified in study protocol which may influence outcomes. We scrutinised study reports and protocols (where available) to understand if, and how, studies attempted to minimise and document protocol deviations and differential care/co‐interventions compensated for this: for example, the study protocol might have been used to highlight the need to balance co‐interventions as well as potentially measuring and reporting this.

We assessed risk of bias for each domain as either low risk, high risk or unclear risk. Since wound healing is a subjective outcome, unblinded outcome assessment represents a high risk of bias (Hróbjartsson 2012). We therefore recorded only open intervention studies with blinded outcome assessment as being at low risk of detection bias.

We resolved all disagreements in risk‐of‐bias assessment by discussion and, where required, we sought the input of a third review author. Where possible, useful and feasible, when a lack of reported information resulted in a judgement of unclear risk of bias, we contacted study authors for clarification. We present our assessment of risk of bias using two risk‐of‐bias summary figures; one is a summary of bias for each item across all studies, and the second shows a cross‐tabulation of each trial by all of the risk‐of‐bias items. We classified studies with an assessment of high risk of bias for one or more of the seven domains as being at high risk of bias overall for the specified outcome (Differences between protocol and review).

### Elastic compression stockings for prevention of the post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with and without residual vein thrombosis and / or popliteal valve reflux [^563f75b4]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results are robust, as they are based on a prospective observation of patients with proximal DVT who were followed up for as long as 3 years. Furthermore, the assessment of the adequacy of use of ECS was done by physicians who were unaware of clinical outcomes or potential confounders. To minimize the effect of potential confounders, patients with recent ipsilateral DVT were excluded, as were patients with a short life expectancy and those requiring indefinite anticoagulation. The main limitation of our study was the lack of random allocation to ECS or no ECS. However, the two study groups were virtually comparable for demographic and clinical characteristics.

The clinical implication of our observations in combination with results of contemporary studies is that in patients without RVT at 3 months, ECS can be safely withheld as long as leg complaints have disappeared, ideally after completing the first 6 months following the thrombotic episode. However, there is still uncertainty regarding patients with substantial damage to their venous system, as demonstrated by the presence of RVT at 3 months. Hence, we believe that trials should be initiated to assess the effect of ECS in patients with proximal DVT and RVT. As our patients were instructed to use ECS from the beginning, and the likelihood of RVT at 3 months was substantial (> 50%), we think that both in clinical practice and in further confirmatory studies ECS should be given as soon as possible after the acute DVT to all patients while awaiting the ultrasound test, which has the potential to help decisions on the subsequent approach.

In conclusion, our results show that the ultrasound assessment of RVT in patients with proximal DVT has the potential to identify those who are likely to benefit from the long-term use of ECS. While awaiting confirmation from properly randomized clinical trials, they are, in our opinion, plausible enough to inform the long-term management of patients with proximal DVT.

### Compression for venous leg ulcers [^409741a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Up to one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins, resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (or varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment is the application of a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it was unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and, if so, which method of compression is the most effective.

Objectives

To undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects on venous ulcer healing of compression bandages and stockings. Specific questions addressed by the review are:1. Does the application of compression bandages or stockings aid venous ulcer healing? 2. Which compression bandage or stocking system is the most effective?

Search Methods

For this second update we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (31 May 2012); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 5, 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to May Week 4 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 30 May 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 21); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 May 2012). No date or language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

RCTs recruiting people with venous leg ulceration that evaluated any type of compression bandage system or compression stockings were eligible for inclusion. Eligible comparators included no compression (e.g. primary dressing alone, non-compressive bandage) or an alternative type of compression. RCTs had to report an objective measure of ulcer healing in order to be included (primary outcome for the review). SECONDARY OUTCOMES of the review included ulcer recurrence, costs, quality of life, pain, adverse events and withdrawals. There was no restriction on date, language or publication status of RCTs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction was performed by one review author and verified independently by a second review author.

Main Results

Forty-eight RCTs reporting 59 comparisons were included (4321 participants in total). Most RCTs were small, and most were at unclear or high risk of bias. Duration of follow-up varied across RCTs. Risk ratio (RR) and other estimates are shown below where RCTs were pooled; otherwise findings refer to a single RCT. There was evidence from eight RCTs (unpooled) that healing outcomes (including time to healing) are better when patients receive compression compared with no compression. Single-component compression bandage systems are less effective than multi-component compression for complete healing at six months (one large RCT). A two-component system containing an elastic bandage healed more ulcers at one year than one without an elastic component (one small RCT). Three-component systems containing an elastic component healed more ulcers than those without elastic at three to four months (two RCTs pooled), RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.67), but another RCT showed no difference between groups at six months. An individual patient data meta-analysis of five RCTs suggested significantly faster healing with the four-layer bandage (4LB) than the short stretch bandage (SSB): median days to healing estimated at 90 and 99 respectively; hazard ratio 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.58). High-compression stockings are associated with better healing outcomes than SSB at two to four months: RR 1.62 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.10), estimate from four pooled RCTs. One RCT suggested better healing outcomes at 16 months with the addition of a tubular device plus single elastic bandage to a base system of gauze and crepe bandages when compared with two added elastic bandages. Another RCT had three arms; when one or two elastic bandages were added to a base three-component system that included an outer tubular layer, healing outcomes were better at six months for the two groups receiving elastic bandages. There is currently no evidence of a statistically significant difference for the following comparisons:⋅alternative single-component compression bandages (two RCTs, unpooled);⋅two-component bandages compared with the 4LB at three months (three RCTs pooled);⋅alternative versions of the 4LB for complete healing at times up to and including six months (three RCTs, unpooled);⋅4LB compared with paste bandage for complete healing at three months (two RCTs, pooled), six months or one year (one RCT for each time point);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with paste bandages for the outcome of change in ulcer area at three months (one small RCT);⋅adjustable compression boots compared with the 4LB with respect to complete healing at three months (one small RCT);⋅single-layer compression stocking compared with paste bandages for outcome of complete healing at four months (one small RCT) and 18 months (another small RCT);⋅low compression stocking compared with SSB for complete healing at three and six months (one small RCT);⋅compression stockings compared with a two-component bandage system and the 4LB for the outcome of complete healing at three months (one small, three-armed RCT); and,⋅tubular compression compared with SSB (one small RCT) for complete healing at three months.

Secondary Outcomes

4LB was more cost-effective than SSB. It was not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding other secondary outcomes including recurrence, adverse events and health-related quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Compression increases ulcer healing rates compared with no compression. Multi-component systems are more effective than single-component systems. Multi-component systems containing an elastic bandage appear to be more effective than those composed mainly of inelastic constituents. Two-component bandage systems appear to perform as well as the 4LB. Patients receiving the 4LB heal faster than those allocated the SSB. More patients heal on high-compression stocking systems than with the SSB. Further data are required before the difference between high-compression stockings and the 4LB can be established.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The primary objective of this systematic review was to estimate the rate of VTE development during mid-term follow-up in patients with lower limb SVT without DVT and PE who received any systemic anticoagulation according to the treatment duration. Following the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) rule, the main question was: "How does the duration of anticoagulation therapy impact the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with superficial vein thrombosis of lower limbs within mid-term follow-up?" The systematic review protocol, including all planned analyses, was registered a priori through PROSPERO, an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (CRD42021271486).

Search strategy

An electronic Medline and Cochrane Library search was done on September 1, 2023. It was performed according to the pre-specified strategy and keywords. Search terms for PubMed: ((("thrombophlebitis"[MeSH Terms]) OR (superficial vein thrombosis)) OR (superficial thrombophlebitis)) AND ("anticoagulants"[MeSH Terms]); search terms for Cochrane Library: ("superficial venous thrombosis"):ti, ab, kw OR ("thrombophlebitis"):ti, ab, kw AND ("anticoagulant therapy"):ti, ab, kw OR ("anticoagulation"):ti, ab, kw OR ("anticoagulant"):ti, ab, kw). Additionally, lists of references of the relevant publications and personal archives of the authors were screened for any complementary information. The search was restricted by language (English) but not publication date. No additional search was done for unpublished or preprint data, conference abstracts, and other papers not indexed.
