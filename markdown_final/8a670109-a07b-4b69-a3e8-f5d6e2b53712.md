## Question

What is the recommended management of C. difficile in long-term care facilities?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management of Clostridioides difficile infection in long-term care facilities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinct epidemiology and risk profile of CDI in LTCFs. Then, I should verify the diagnostic triggers and testing algorithms suitable for LTCF workflows. Next, I will evaluate evidence-based treatment pathways by severity and recurrence. After that, I need to establish infection prevention and control measures tailored to LTCFs. Finally, I will address antimicrobial stewardship, surveillance, transitions of care, and secondary prevention strategies to reduce recurrence and transmission risk.

> Let me first confirm the elevated epidemiologic risk in LTCFs, because if I underappreciate baseline risk, I may miss opportunities for earlier testing and prevention. LTCF residence is associated with substantially higher CDI odds and severity compared with community dwellers, and this excess persists even after matching for hospital exposure and antibiotic consumption, underscoring LTCF residence itself as a risk amplifier [^116vgagm]. I should also remember that LabID surveillance data from LTCFs show high 30‑day all-cause mortality and acute-care admissions, particularly among residents over 80 years, which heightens the need for rapid diagnosis and escalated care pathways when indicated [^113HLNVw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality without considering co-factors. LTCF residents accumulate multiple risk factors: advanced age, frequent or prolonged antibiotic exposure, and comorbidity burden, with transitions between hospital and post-acute settings contributing to recurrent exposure and risk of acquisition and recurrence, reinforcing the need for integrated LTCF-hospital-community strategies [^116DyV2q] [^113SGgpe] [^114BWw4x]. Additionally, CDI confers increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in older adults, which should inform thresholds for escalation and post-acute monitoring plans [^112qGtoM].

> I need to check the trigger for testing in LTCFs to avoid both overtesting colonized residents and missing true cases. The standard indication remains unexplained new-onset of three or more unformed stools in 24 hours, with attention to testing during IBD flares when diarrhea accompanies the flare, and to testing when diarrhea is accompanied by systemic signs such as severe cramps or sepsis indicators, even though gross blood is uncommon in CDI, to avoid delayed diagnosis of atypical presentations in older adults [^113noTrB] [^113nxxPH]. While waiting for confirmatory testing, I should confirm that residents with suspected CDI are placed on preemptive contact precautions if same-day results are not available, to interrupt transmission early in congregate settings [^116xoMdY].

> Wait, let me verify the best diagnostic algorithm, because I initially thought a highly sensitive NAAT alone would suffice in high-risk LTCF populations, but that could inflate false positives due to colonization. A two-step algorithm is preferred: screen with NAAT or GDH, then confirm with toxin A/B EIA to improve positive predictive value and align treatment with toxin-mediated disease, and avoid single stand-alone rapid tests given poor PPV in endemic settings [^115qirmV] [^117KtWgx] [^116uWpkm] [^113ga8DT]. Operationally, pairing PCR with reflex toxin EIA has reduced incident CDI rates and sharpened case attribution in implementation studies, which is useful for LTCF–hospital communication and surveillance alignment [^114mwR9c].

> Next, I should review LTCF-specific operational barriers to timely testing and how to mitigate them. I should double-check whether physician orders are slowing stool submission; surveys show many LTCFs require orders before testing, causing delays relative to acute care, and underdiagnosis is common, so empowering nurses with standing protocols to submit diarrheal stools and standardizing collection logistics can shorten time-to-isolation and treatment start [^115nEzGT] [^116ga2wv]. Incorporating combined pathogen testing workflows during viral gastroenteritis seasons and reinforcing isolation pending results can improve appropriate precautions in real time for LTCF residents [^112rkACB].

> Now, I will examine first-line therapy for an initial non-severe episode. I almost recommended metronidazole out of habit, but wait, guidelines now preferentially recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, given lower recurrence, with oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days as an acceptable alternative; metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 10 days is reserved only when fidaxomicin and vancomycin are unavailable because of lower efficacy and neurotoxicity risks with repeated exposure [^1136xbnm] [^112pEs27] [^113RZaKD]. This aligns with gastroenterology guidance that endorses fidaxomicin or vancomycin as standard options for initial non-severe CDI in adults [^111pwDqz].

> Let me consider severity assessment next, because treatment and triage hinge on accurate categorization. I should confirm severity using IDSA/SHEA criteria based on WBC count, serum creatinine, and the presence of complications, and classify fulminant disease when hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon are present, which mandates immediate escalation and often hospital transfer from the LTCF [^115tV8vV] [^116fuSg5].

> For severe and fulminant disease, I need to ensure dosing and combinations are correct. For severe CDI without shock or ileus, fidaxomicin 200 mg BID for 10 days or vancomycin 125 mg QID for 10 days are appropriate, and I should avoid routinely adding IV metronidazole in severe disease because it has not shown benefit in that context [^114bsveu] [^112twzqy]. For fulminant CDI with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon, I should initiate oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours plus IV metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours promptly, and consider adjunctive IV tigecycline on a case-by-case basis if the patient is deteriorating, while arranging urgent surgical consultation and transfer to higher-acuity care if in an LTCF [^117F9Hxo] [^1154jM2q] [^1143ytzm].

> I should double-check strategies for recurrence, because LTCF residents often cycle between settings with high recurrence risk. For the first recurrence, fidaxomicin, either standard or extended-pulsed, is preferred over a standard vancomycin course, while vancomycin taper/pulse remains reasonable when fidaxomicin is not feasible; for multiple recurrences, FMT after standard antibiotic pretreatment or the addition of bezlotoxumab during standard therapy should be considered based on patient risk profile, availability, and regulatory constraints [^116gZZ47] [^115pnM2B] [^1113yWmK]. But wait, what if resource constraints in LTCFs limit access to fidaxomicin or bezlotoxumab? Cost-effectiveness modeling has sometimes favored vancomycin for a first recurrence, and meta-analytic data support bezlotoxumab's efficacy for preventing recurrence without clear safety signals, so individualized decisions balancing efficacy, access, and payer constraints are warranted [^116N8M4w] [^114XoZk7].

> Let me verify adjunctive and special-population considerations to avoid missing key nuances. If substantial delays in laboratory confirmation are expected or fulminant disease is suspected, empiric anti-CDI therapy should be initiated without waiting for results, with prompt de-escalation if CDI is excluded, and in nonresponding cases I should re-evaluate the diagnosis carefully to exclude mimics or complications such as ischemic colitis or CMV, especially in the immunosuppressed [^1178XKj2] [^111M9dEN]. In immunocompromised residents and those with IBD, standard first-line anti-CDI therapy applies, and I should not withhold necessary IBD immunosuppression during flares treated for CDI, though careful monitoring for deterioration is essential [^11327cUR] [^113nkRna].

> Next, I should review infection prevention and control measures tailored to LTCFs, since environmental contamination and shared equipment drive spread. Residents with suspected or confirmed CDI should be placed on contact precautions with priority for private rooms with dedicated toilets when available, and if facility CDI rates remain high despite standard measures, consider prolonging contact precautions until discharge and avoid cohorting with discordant MDRO statuses to prevent cross-transmission of other pathogens [^116b4yN8] [^114ipHnv] [^111GpD8d]. I need to ensure that cleaning protocols use sporicidal agents for daily and terminal cleaning during outbreaks or hyperendemic conditions and that disposable patient equipment is used when possible, with thorough reprocessing of reusable items to reduce spore burden in shared environments [^112DcGYb] [^1123VpBq] [^111gBBfk].

> I should confirm antimicrobial stewardship priorities, because reducing nonessential antibiotic exposure is one of the most effective CDI prevention levers in LTCFs. A multipronged approach that includes guideline-concordant testing, early isolation, and stewardship has reduced CDI incidence in implementation studies, and targeted stewardship in LTCF-affiliated programs has reduced unnecessary non-CDI antibiotics even if total exposure and recurrence do not always decline, emphasizing the need for persistent, multifaceted interventions [^114mwR9c] [^115Jh4j8]. The LTCF-specific call to action reinforces that stewardship and minimizing high-risk antibiotics are central pillars of CDI control in extended-care settings [^116DyV2q].

> Hold on, I should verify surveillance and data feedback loops, because without them, prevention falters. Facilities should use standardized case definitions and stratify CDI rates by location to detect clusters and guide interventions, and conduct routine surveillance for healthcare facility–onset CDI to identify elevated rates or outbreaks that warrant intensified cleaning and cohorting strategies, with consistent communication across LTCF and hospital partners during transitions [^114Y4hca] [^114w4X33] [^117WJ1UF]. Incorporating an admission screening question about recent liquid stools and implementing two-step testing improved attribution and reduced hospital-onset CDI in practice, a process improvement that can be adapted to LTCF admission and readmission workflows to tighten detection and isolation [^114mwR9c].

> I need to ensure recurrence prevention is addressed during transitions of care, because many LTCF residents are discharged before completing therapy and may be mid-course at readmission. For high-risk residents with prior recurrences precipitated by systemic antibiotics, very selective prophylaxis with microbiota-sparing anti-CDI agents can be considered in consultation with ID specialists, and in those ineligible for or relapsing after FMT, long-term suppressive oral vancomycin may be considered, acknowledging limited evidence and the need to balance risks of resistance and microbiome injury against recurrence prevention [^115B19Nh] [^112wjLRV]. Hmm, wait a minute, what about probiotics to prevent antibiotic-associated CDI in LTCFs? The AGA suggests certain probiotic strains can be offered for CDI prevention in adults on antibiotics, but practice is variable and this should be individualized given strain specificity and resident vulnerability, so I would frame this as a conditional option rather than a core strategy in LTCFs [^117GqtfU].

> Let me not forget staff education and communication, because even strong policies fail without frontline buy-in. Qualitative work highlights knowledge gaps in diagnostic criteria and prevention practices among healthcare personnel, supporting targeted education, easy-to-access protocols, and closed-loop feedback to sustain adherence to testing algorithms, isolation procedures, environmental cleaning, and stewardship actions in LTCFs [^111u4Ctz]. This is consistent with earlier findings that LTCFs often have policy manuals but variable implementation, underscoring the need for practical, audited workflows rather than policies on paper alone [^115nEzGT].

> To synthesize, I should confirm that an LTCF-ready CDI program integrates: high suspicion for new-onset diarrhea with rapid testing and preemptive precautions; a two-step diagnostic algorithm to align therapy with toxin-mediated disease; severity-based treatment prioritizing fidaxomicin or vancomycin and prompt escalation for fulminant cases; structured pathways for recurrence including bezlotoxumab or FMT when appropriate; robust contact precautions and sporicidal cleaning with equipment controls; antimicrobial stewardship to reduce unnecessary exposure; standardized surveillance with feedback; and deliberate transitions-of-care planning to complete therapy and prevent recurrence, adapting choices to feasibility and resident risk profiles in the LTCF context [^1141Wu3a] [^115qirmV] [^1136xbnm] [^1113yWmK] [^1123VpBq].

Management of C. difficile infection (CDI) in long-term care (LTC) requires a coordinated approach [^1141Wu3a] encompassing **prompt two-step diagnostic testing** [^115qirmV] and **first-line therapy with fidaxomicin** [^1136xbnm] or vancomycin [^112pEs27]. For recurrences, treat with fidaxomicin [^116gZZ47] or a vancomycin taper/pulse, and consider **bezlotoxumab** [^114XoZk7] or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [^114dQnbP] for multiple recurrences [^1113yWmK]. Implement strict infection control — contact precautions, hand hygiene, and sporicidal cleaning [^1123VpBq] — and maintain antimicrobial stewardship [^116DyV2q] to reduce recurrence and transmission.

---

## Diagnosis and severity assessment

- **Testing indications**: Test patients with ≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours without an alternative explanation [^1141Wu3a].

- **Testing method**: Use a two-step algorithm (GDH/toxin EIA with NAAT confirmation) [^115qirmV] to distinguish infection from colonization [^113ga8DT].

- **Severity assessment**: Use WBC, creatinine, and complications (hypotension, shock, ileus, megacolon) [^115tV8vV] to guide therapy [^116fuSg5].

---

## Pharmacologic management

### Initial episode

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Alternative therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-severe | Fidaxomicin [^1136xbnm] 200 mg PO BID ×10 days | Vancomycin [^112pEs27] 125 mg PO QID ×10 days |
| Severe | Fidaxomicin [^116ob42S] 200 mg PO BID ×10 days [^114bsveu] | Vancomycin [^115N6o6h] 125 mg PO QID ×10 days |
| Fulminant | Vancomycin 500 mg PO/NG Q6H + metronidazole 500 mg IV Q8H [^117F9Hxo] | Rectal vancomycin if ileus [^117F9Hxo] |

---

### Recurrent CDI

For recurrent CDI, the **first recurrence** should be treated with fidaxomicin (standard or extended-pulsed) [^116gZZ47] or a vancomycin taper/pulse. For **multiple recurrences**, consider FMT [^114dQnbP] or bezlotoxumab with standard antibiotics [^114XoZk7] [^1113yWmK].

---

## Infection control measures

- **Contact precautions**: Private room with dedicated toilet [^116b4yN8]; cohort only if necessary [^111GpD8d].

- **Hand hygiene**: Soap and water preferred; alcohol-based rubs are less effective against spores [^1123VpBq].

- **Environmental cleaning**: Daily and terminal cleaning with sporicidal agents [^112DcGYb]; use disposable equipment when possible [^1123VpBq].

---

## Antimicrobial stewardship

Antimicrobial stewardship in LTC should include **stewardship programs** to reduce unnecessary antibiotics — especially high-risk agents (clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins) [^116DyV2q] — and **education** to train staff on appropriate antibiotic use and CDI prevention [^111u4Ctz].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

For monitoring and follow-up, **clinical monitoring** should track symptoms, hydration, and electrolytes, with reassessment if no improvement in 48–72 hours; **surveillance** should track CDI rates and recurrences to guide interventions [^114w4X33].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include care for **immunocompromised patients**, in whom fidaxomicin or vancomycin should be used as first-line therapy [^11327cUR], and the potential role of **probiotics**; consider specific strains for prevention in patients receiving antibiotics [^117GqtfU].

---

Effective CDI management in LTC hinges on **accurate diagnosis, appropriate therapy, and rigorous infection control**, supported by stewardship and surveillance to limit recurrence and transmission.

### Clostridium difficile infection in long-term care facilities: A call to action for antimicrobial stewardship [^116DyV2q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Across the United States, the baby boomers are entering into their elderly years. As they are America's largest generation to do so at the time of writing, their need for care will greatly affect nursing homes, long-term care facilities, and long-term acute-care hospitals (LTACHs). Unfortunately, the rise of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), particularly in extended-care facilities, might become the biggest obstacle in their care. Elderly extended-care-facility residents are at an elevated risk of CDI simply due to their advanced age and the fact that they are receiving care in an extended-care facility. LTACHs experience a high incidence rate of CDI, and these infections can lead to major complications for a patient's health. Other factors that contribute to higher risk for CDI include receiving multiple courses of antibiotics, longer length of antibiotic treatment, and previous CDI. Although this obstacle to proper care is great, some simple solutions are available to healthcare providers. Probiotics may help improve natural immunity in patients, and strict adherence to antimicrobial stewardship standards could help reduce this serious bacterial threat.

### Efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies against Clostridioides difficile toxins for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114XoZk7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection is one of the most common health care-associated infections. To reduce recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), monoclonal antibodies against Clostridioides difficile toxin A (actoxumab) and toxin B (bezlotoxumab) were developed. In the present study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess their efficacy and safety.

- **Materials and methods**: An electronic database was searched for relevant randomized controlled trials assessing bezlotoxumab and/or actoxumab. Outcomes included the rate of rCDI and adverse events, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events.

- **Results**: Four randomized controlled trials comparing antitoxin antibodies (n = 1916) versus placebo (n = 889) were identified. rCDI was significantly reduced by bezlotoxumab plus actoxumab (risk ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval = 0.41–0.70, P < 0.001) and bezlotoxumab monotherapy (risk ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.51–0.76, P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed that bezlotoxumab plus actoxumab was remarkably effective for patients with high-risk features such as being inpatients, receiving vancomycin treatment, and having the BI/NAP/027 strain. Regarding safety, there was no difference in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events, as well as all-cause mortality, between bezlotoxumab-treated patients and placebo.

- **Conclusions**: The results of our meta-analysis demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of bezlotoxumab for the prevention of rCDI. Bezlotoxumab may be a good therapeutic option for severe C. difficile infection.

### Cost-effectiveness of three different strategies for the treatment of first recurrent Clostridium difficile infection diagnosed in a community setting [^116N8M4w]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

A significant portion of patients with Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) experience recurrence, and there is little consensus on its treatment. With the availability of newer agents for CDI and the added burdens of recurrence, a cost-effectiveness analysis may provide insight on the most efficient use of resources.

- **Design**: A decision-tree analysis was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of three possible treatments for patients with first CDI recurrence: oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin. The model was performed from a payer's perspective with direct cost inputs and a timeline of 1 year. A systematic review of literature was performed to identify clinical, utility, and cost data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $100,000 per QALY gained. The robustness of the model was tested using one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

- **Results**: Vancomycin had the lowest cost ($15,692) and was associated with a QALY gain of 0.8019 years. Bezlotoxumab plus vancomycin was a dominated strategy. Fidaxomicin led to a higher QALY compared to vancomycin, at an incremental cost of $500,975 per QALY gained. Based on our WTP threshold, vancomycin alone was the most cost-effective regimen for treating the first recurrence of CDI. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the model's robustness.

- **Conclusions**: Vancomycin alone appears to be the most cost-effective regimen for the treatment of first recurrence of CDI.

### Infection prevention and control practices related to Clostridium difficile infection in Canadian acute and long-term care institutions [^115nEzGT]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen in Canadian health care facilities, and infection prevention and control (IPC) practices are crucial to reducing C. difficile infections (CDIs). We performed a cross-sectional study to identify CDI-related IPC practices in Canadian health care facilities.

- **Methods**: A survey assessing facility characteristics, CDI testing strategies, CDI contact precautions, and antimicrobial stewardship programs was sent to Canadian health care facilities in February 2005.

- **Results**: Responses were received from 943 (33%) facilities. Acute care facilities were more likely than long-term care (P < .001) and mixed care facilities (P = 0.03) to submit liquid stools from all patients for CDI testing. Physician orders were required before testing for CDI in 394 long-term care facilities (66%), which is significantly higher than the proportions in acute care (41%; P < .001) and mixed care sites (49%; P < .001). A total of 841 sites (93%) had an infection control manual, 639 (76%) of which contained CDI-specific guidelines. Antimicrobial stewardship programs were reported by 40 (29%) acute care facilities; 19 (54%) of these sites reported full enforcement of the program.

- **Conclusion**: Canadian health care facilities have widely varying C. difficile IPC practices. Opportunities exist for facilities to take a more active role in IPC policy development and implementation, as well as antimicrobial stewardship.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^115xdFfF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Evolution of guideline-based antimicrobial recommendations to treat C. difficile infection. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States (US), imposing a major burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is significant as well. It is estimated that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 were approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching "C. difficile" in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI.

### Clostridium difficile infection increases acute and chronic morbidity and mortality [^112qGtoM]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to quantify short- and long-term outcomes of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in the elderly, including all-cause mortality, transfer to a facility, and hospitalizations.

- **Design**: Retrospective study using 2011 Medicare claims data, including all elderly persons coded for CDI and a sample of uninfected persons. Analysis of propensity score-matched pairs and the entire population stratified by the propensity score was used to determine the risk of all-cause mortality, new transfer to a long-term care facility (LTCF), short-term skilled nursing facility (SNF), and subsequent hospitalizations within 30, 90, and 365 days.

- **Results**: The claims records of 174,903 patients coded for CDI were compared with those of 1,318,538 control patients. CDI was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–1.81; attributable mortality, 10.9%), new LTCF transfer (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.67–1.82), and new SNF transfer (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 2.46–2.58) within 30 days in matched-pairs analyses. In a stratified analysis, CDI was associated with the greatest risk of 30-day all-cause mortality in persons with the lowest baseline probability of CDI (hazard ratio [HR], 3.04; 95% CI, 2.83–3.26); the risk progressively decreased as the baseline probability of CDI increased. CDI was also associated with increased risk of subsequent 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year hospitalization.

- **Conclusions**: CDI was associated with increased risk of short- and long-term adverse outcomes, including transfer to short- and long-term care facilities.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA): 2021 focused update guidelines on management of Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^1136rEaT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is a focused update on the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in adults, specifically addressing the use of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab for treatment. Developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), this guideline is intended for healthcare professionals who care for adults with CDI. This includes specialists in infectious diseases, gastroenterologists, hospitalists, and pharmacists, as well as any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients.

The panel's recommendations for the management of CDI are based on evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. The panel followed a systematic process which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and the strength of recommendations using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary, and rationale that support each recommendation, as well as knowledge gaps, can be found online in the full text.

Practice guidelines favor fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

- **Objectives**: To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Participants**: Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

- **Interventions**: Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

- **Results**: Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favoring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1,951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA/SHEA) guidelines describe recommended therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).

- **Objective**: To describe CDI treatment and, among those with severe CDI, determine predictors of adherence to the 2010 IDSA/SHEA treatment guidelines.

- **Design**: We analyzed 2013–2015 CDI treatment data collected through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify predictors of guideline-adherent therapy.

- **Patients**: A CDI case was defined as a positive stool specimen in a person aged ≥ 18 years without a positive test in the prior 8 weeks; severe CDI cases were defined as having a white blood cell count ≥ 15,000 cells/μl.

- **Main measures**: Prescribing and predictors of guideline-adherent CDI therapy for severe disease.

- **Key results**: Of 18,243 cases, 14,257 (78%) were treated with metronidazole, 7683 (42%) with vancomycin, and 313 (2%) with fidaxomicin. The median duration of therapy was 14 (interquartile range, 11–15) days. Severe CDI was identified in 3250 (18%) cases; of 3121 with treatment data available, 1480 (47%) were prescribed guideline-adherent therapy. Among severe CDI cases, hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.90, 3.24), age ≥ 65 years (aOR 1.37; 95% CI 1.10, 1.71), Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 3 (aOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.04, 1.55), immunosuppressive therapy (aOR 1.21; 95% CI 1.02, 1.42), and inflammatory bowel disease (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.13, 2.17).

### Transitions of care in infection: A need of the hour [^114BWw4x]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a complex disease that, by virtue of both its initial virulence and proclivity for recurrent episodes, causes high morbidity, mortality, and financial burden. This burden is felt by patients and their families as well as the U.S. healthcare system. Recurrent CDI episodes can occur in 25–65% of patients, with a cycle of multiple recurrences in a single patient contributing to the complexity of care. Patients with or suspected of having CDI will receive treatment, and their care will be managed across multiple healthcare settings, involving many different levels of healthcare workers. Understanding this infection is essential for all who are involved in the care of these patients. A well-structured and implemented transition of care process can ease the burden on the healthcare system, patients, and their families; reduce the cost of care; and improve patient outcomes. We review the development of transitions of care processes, resource guides, and their relevance to improving the management of CDI.

### Health care-associated Clostridioides difficile infection: Learning the perspectives of health care workers to build successful strategies [^111u4Ctz]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is one of the most common health care-associated infections that negatively impact patient care and health care costs. This study takes a unique approach to C. difficile infection (CDI) control by investigating key prevention obstacles through the perspectives of Stanford Health Care (SHC) frontline health care personnel.

- **Methods**: An anonymous qualitative survey was distributed at SHC, focusing on the knowledge and practice of CDI prevention guidelines, as well as education, communication, and perspectives regarding CDI at SHC.

- **Results**: 112 survey responses were analyzed. Our findings unveiled gaps in personnel's knowledge of C. difficile diagnostic guidelines and revealed a need for targeted communication and guideline-focused education. Health care staff shared preferences and recommendations, with the majority recommending enhanced communication of guidelines and information as a strategy for reducing CDI rates. The findings were then used to design and propose internal recommendations for SHC to mitigate the gaps found.

- **Discussion**: Many guidelines and improvement strategies are based on strong scientific and medical foundations; however, it is important to ask whether these guidelines are effectively translated into practice. Frontline health care workers hold empirical perspectives that could be key in infection control.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings emphasize the importance of including frontline health care personnel in infection prevention decision-making processes, and the strategies presented here can be applied to mitigate the gaps identified.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^114kKMFz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issuance from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios.

In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014-present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020.

The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune-boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab.

### The attributable burden of Clostridium difficile infection to long-term care facilities stay: A clinical study [^116vgagm]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Advanced age, history of hospitalization, and antibiotic consumption are associated with the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) represent a setting where CDI has been increasingly reported. This study aimed to estimate the actual attributable burden of CDI to LTCF stay and determine the characteristics of disease epidemiology in this setting.

- **Design**: IRB-approved retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: LTCF and community.

- **Participants**: One thousand seven hundred and sixty-one patients.

- **Measurements/Results**: The prevalence of CDI among LTCF residents was 22.4%, whereas the prevalence of CDI among community residents was 6.7% (P < .001). The prevalence of CDI among LTCF residents was significantly higher in both the 18–64 (P < .001) and the ≥ 65 age groups (P < .010). Measures of hospital exposure and antibiotic consumption between LTCF and community residents prior to CDI diagnosis were non-significant. A strict matching (1:2) between LTCF and community residents adjusting for age, total number of hospital admissions, and antibiotic consumption showed that the odds of CDI for an LTCF resident were 6.89 times larger than the odds for a community resident (OR = 6.89, 95%, 4.67–10.17). For an LTCF resident with CDI, the odds of manifesting severe disease were 3.25 times larger than the odds for a community resident with CDI (OR = 3.25, 95%, 1.81–5.86). LTCF residents were more frequently hospitalized (P = 0.002), required longer hospital stays for their CDI management (P = 0.03), and had more recurrent CDI cases than community residents.

### The always evolving diagnosis and management of Clostridioides difficile colitis: What you need to know [^11677GSk]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, pharmacologic management, and surgical options for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are rapidly evolving, presenting a challenge for the busy surgeon to remain updated on the latest clinical guidelines. This review provides an evidence-based practical guide for CDI management tailored to the needs of surgeons and surgical intensivists. Historically, the diagnosis of CDI relied on slow cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assays, but now, the rapidly resulting nucleic acid amplification tests and enzyme immunoassays have become mainstream.

In terms of antibiotic therapy, metronidazole and oral vancomycin were the main "workhorse" antibiotics in the early 2000s, but large randomized controlled trials have now demonstrated that fidaxomicin produces superior results. Regarding surgical intervention, total abdominal colectomy was once the only procedure of choice; however, diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage is emerging as a viable alternative. Novel adjuncts such as fecal microbiota transplantation and targeted therapy against toxin B (bezlotoxumab) are playing an increasingly important role in the management of CDI.

### Transitions of care in infection: A need of the hour [^111EH5gW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacillus that can be transmitted from person to person or through contact with environmental contamination, which can lead to a diarrheal illness in humans: C. difficile infection (CDI). Data show that after an initial episode of CDI, up to 25% of patients experience a recurrence. Furthermore, of the patients who have had a recurrence, up to 65% will experience subsequent recurrences. A vicious cycle of infection–reinfection impedes recovery, thereby exacerbating the substantial morbidity and economic impact associated with CDI.

Patients with suspected CDI are recognized, diagnosed, and managed in multiple healthcare settings, which provide a complex web of potential pathways for CDI transmission. Traditionally known to infect the hospitalized elderly, CDI now affects community members and residents of post-acute and long-term care facilities. CDI complications such as dehydration, profuse diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, pseudomembranous colitis, or sepsis can result in hospitalizations, and patients with a CDI have an average hospital length of stay of 8.0 days for an index episode and 9.3 days for a recurrent CDI (rCDI) episode. Hospitalized patients with CDI are frequently discharged home or to long-term care facilities prior to completion of CDI therapy and with a high risk of recurrence and readmissions. Recurrent CDI not only impacts patient quality of life but also imposes an increased healthcare burden and costs in terms of rehospitalization.

### Impact of a multipronged approach to reduce the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infections in hospitalized patients [^114mwR9c]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). High credibility.

Effective approaches to reduce Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) in hospitalized patients are essential. This study reports data from three years preceding and three years following successful interventions, with a detailed analysis of all cases in the first year after implementation.

- **Methods**: The interventions included a nursing protocol to identify cases present on admission by asking if the patient had one or more liquid stools in the last 24 hours, and a two-step testing algorithm with samples positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the C. difficile toxin gene reflexing to an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the toxin antigen.

- **Results**: Healthcare-associated infections due to CDI fell from approximately 160 in each of the preceding three years to less than 65 in each of the subsequent three years (P < .001), while the ratio of observed-to-expected hospital-onset cases diminished to approximately 0.50 (P < .02). In the first year, 395 samples were PCR positive, but only 118 (29.9%) of these were EIA positive. Of the PCR positive/EIA positive samples, 55 (46.6%) were from hospital day one or two and classified as present on admission. The mean time from stool collection to report of PCR results was approximately 7.5 hours, and the EIA took only an average of 68 additional minutes to be reported.

- **Conclusions**: The number of incident CDI cases can be dramatically decreased by implementing an admission screening question and a two-step testing algorithm.

### Current and emerging management options for Clostridium difficile infection: What is the role of fidaxomicin [^114fgwnP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was mainly limited to oral metronidazole and vancomycin, neither of which is optimal. Up to 25% of patients with CDI experience recurrence of infection within 30 days following treatment with these agents, while approximately 45–65% of these patients experience further, and sometimes multiple, recurrences. Recurrent CDI (ReCDI) represents a major treatment challenge for which new therapeutic options are sorely needed.

Fidaxomicin is a first-in-class, oral macrocyclic antibiotic with targeted bactericidal activity against C. difficile and minimal effect on the constituents of the normal colonic microflora. This microflora-sparing activity allows for more rapid restoration of the normal colonic microflora in patients with CDI. In two separate, but almost identical, phase 3 clinical trials in which patients with CDI were treated with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin, fidaxomicin demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in comparison with the best available treatment. While non-inferiority was demonstrated with respect to rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment, significantly fewer fidaxomicin-treated patients experienced disease recurrence, which translated into clinically significant improvements in sustained clinical cure.

Subsequent sub-population analyses suggest that these benefits extend to older patients, patients with severe CDI, renally impaired patients, and patients with a prior episode of CDI. For CDI patients receiving concomitant antibiotics, fidaxomicin achieved significantly better rates of clinical cure.

### The use of laboratory-identified event surveillance to classify adverse outcomes due to infection in Canadian long-term care facilities [^113HLNVw]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Low credibility.

Adverse outcomes following Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are not often reported for long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. This study focused on the adverse outcomes due to CDI identified in Alberta LTCFs.

All positive Clostridioides difficile stool specimens identified by laboratory-identified (LabID) event surveillance in Alberta from 2011 to 2018, along with Alberta Continuing Care Information System data, were used to define CDI in Alberta LTCFs. CDI cases were classified as long-term care onset, hospital onset, and community onset. Laboratory records were linked to provincial databases to analyze acute-care admissions and mortality within 30 days post CDI. Age, sex, case classification, episode, and operator type were investigated using logistic regression.

Overall, 902 CDI cases were identified in 762 LTCF residents. Of all CDI events, 860 (95.3%) were long-term care onset, 38 (4.2%) were hospital onset, and 4 (0.4%) were community onset. The CDI rate was 2.0 per 100,000 resident days. In total, 157 residents (20.6%) had 30-day all-cause mortality, and 126 CDI cases (14.0%) had 30-day all-cause acute-care admissions. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher in residents aged > 80 years compared to those ≤ 80 years (24.9 vs. 12.3 per 100 residents; P < .001). Furthermore, residents aged > 80 years with hospital-onset CDI and those staying in private or voluntary LTCFs were more likely to have 30-day all-cause acute-care admissions.

The prevalence of CDI adverse outcomes in LTCFs was found to be high using LabID event surveillance.

### European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases: 2021 update on the treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection in adults [^113ue2qN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

- **Methods and questions**: Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent, and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI, and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis?

- **Outcome measures**: Outcome measures for the treatment strategy were clinical cure, recurrence, and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI, the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations were performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of recommendations.

### Quantifying transmission of Clostridium difficile within and outside healthcare settings [^113SGgpe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The compartmental model structure for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) within each setting (hospital, long-term care facility, and community) classifies patients based on their antimicrobial drug use and colonization status. Patients are categorized as not receiving antimicrobial drugs (N), receiving antimicrobial drugs (A), having a recent history of receiving antimicrobial drugs (O), uncolonized (U), asymptomatically colonized (C), symptomatically infected (CDI), or colonized and subject to recurrence (RC) of CDI. Arrows indicate changes in individual epidemiologic status, with subscripts denoting primary, secondary, or tertiary CDI.

This epidemiologic model is integrated within a model of patient flow among the hospital, long-term care facility (LTCF), and community, parameterized from national survey data. Patients with CDI remain hospitalized for an additional 3.1 days (95% CI 2.3–4.0 days). They have a 96% (95% CI 93%–99%) probability of being diagnosed and undergoing isolation protocols that reduce transmission by 53% (95% CI 37%–72%). Furthermore, it is assumed that individuals in the community or LTCF with developed CDI are hospitalized with probabilities of 26% (95% CI 23%–28%) and 27% (95% CI 23%–32%), respectively.

The model also describes transitions between settings (hospital, LTCF, and the non-healthcare community) for CDI, with rates parameterized at demographically calibrated, age-specific rates. Hospitalized patients with a CDI diagnosis are subjected to enhanced isolation protocols to reduce transmission.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "IDSA criteria for Clostridioides difficile infection severity" is a tool designed to stratify patients with Clostridioides difficile infection into severity categories. This stratification aids in guiding appropriate treatment strategies and predicting patient outcomes.

- **Severity assessment**: The primary components of the IDSA criteria include white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and the presence of complications such as hypotension or shock, ileus, and megacolon. The white blood cell count and serum creatinine level are used as markers of systemic inflammation and renal function, respectively. The presence of complications indicates a more severe disease course.

- **Scoring system**: The severity of the infection is determined by a cumulative score based on these components. A score of 1 or 2 indicates a non-severe infection, a score of 3 or more indicates a severe infection, and a score of 7 or more indicates a fulminant infection. This scoring system allows for a nuanced understanding of the patient's condition, facilitating individualized treatment plans and potentially improving patient outcomes.

- **Input requirements**: To determine the severity of a Clostridioides difficile infection, this calculator requires three specific inputs: white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and the presence of any complications. Each input is scored based on certain conditions, and these scores are summed to provide an overall severity assessment.

### Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection in the critically ill: An expert statement [^115R5CSi]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) infection (CDI) represents a worrisome condition, often underestimated, with severe clinical presentations frequently requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The aim of the present expert statement was to provide an overview of the management of CDI in critically ill patients, for whom CDI is a formidable problem, largely related to the use and abuse of antibiotics. The available knowledge about the pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment concerning critically ill patients affected by CDI has been reviewed, although most existing information comes from studies performed outside the ICU, and evidence on several issues in this specific context is scarce.

- **Preventive and therapeutic strategies**: Potential strategies aimed at stemming the phenomenon were discussed, including fecal microbiota transplantation. This could represent a highly interesting option for critically ill patients, but evidence is limited and future well-designed studies are needed.

- **Challenges for ICU physicians**: A special insight into the specific challenges faced by ICU physicians caring for critically ill patients with CDI was also proposed.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management of infection [^113bv8ST]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years, presenting a significant challenge in preventing recurrence. Approximately 25% of patients with an initial infection and 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes experience recurrence, highlighting the need for effective, data-driven treatment. Clinical treatment guidelines serve as an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating quality data to make informed recommendations.

As the understanding of CDI evolves, there has been an increase in guideline issues from various global societies, with recommendations refined to address more relevant clinical scenarios. This review discusses the evolution of clinical guidelines over three periods: Initial Guidelines (1995–1997), Second Wave (2009–2013), and the Modern Era (2014–present).

In earlier periods, metronidazole or vancomycin were recommended for initial infections. However, in the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020, fidaxomicin became the preferential treatment. For first recurrences, treatments have shifted from using the same antimicrobial as the initial episode to offering multiple options for one or more recurrences. Additionally, immune-boosting treatments, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab, have been added to the regimen.
