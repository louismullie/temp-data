## Question

What is the duration of antibiotics for patient with pneumonia? Severe pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the duration of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia, including how to handle severe pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity stratification. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline recommendations for community-acquired pneumonia. Next, I will examine randomized trials that inform shorter courses. After that, I need to check special populations and exceptions, including MRSA, Pseudomonas, bacteremia, and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and confirm safety monitoring and stop criteria, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because duration hinges on whether this is community-acquired pneumonia versus hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, and on severity markers such as ICU admission, CURB-65, or ATS/IDSA severe CAP criteria. I should confirm that most high-quality data and recommendations pertain to CAP outside the ICU, whereas HAP/VAP follow different rules, and that severe CAP generally implies ICU-level care or high severity scores, which affects both empiric therapy and duration decisions [^760f62a6] [^f252df94].

> Next, I should review the core principle for CAP duration. The ATS/IDSA 2019 guideline recommends a minimum of 5 days for most CAP, with therapy continued until the patient achieves clinical stability and for no less than 5 total days. Clinical stability is defined by resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation, and this applies across severities unless special circumstances arise, which I will verify shortly [^760f62a6] [^a3af71d4] [^37eb851a].

> Wait, let me verify whether shorter courses can be safe in selected CAP patients. The pivotal randomized trial by Uranga et al. showed that stopping antibiotics at day 5 using stability criteria was noninferior to physician-directed durations, with similar clinical success at day 10 and day 30, supporting a 5-day strategy anchored to stability rather than fixed longer courses. This reinforces the guideline stance and helps counter the inertia toward 7–10 day courses [^2a39ef55] [^3aa40c0e].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence for even shorter courses in nonsevere CAP. The 2025 ATS update suggests that in adult inpatients with nonsevere CAP who achieve clinical stability, it is reasonable to consider less than 5 days, with a minimum of 3 days, although this is a conditional recommendation and should be applied cautiously with close monitoring. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize this to severe CAP or unstable patients, where evidence is thinner [^56fe38d1].

> I will now examine severe CAP, because this is where clinicians often extend therapy. Initially, I thought the default should be 7–10 days, but wait, let me verify the guideline language. The ATS/IDSA 2019 guideline still anchors duration to clinical stability with a minimum of 5 days for most CAP, including severe cases, and extends to 7 days only when MRSA or Pseudomonas are suspected or confirmed, or when there are complications like extrapulmonary infection. So, I should correct my initial inclination and emphasize that even severe CAP does not automatically mandate longer than 5 days if the patient stabilizes quickly and there are no MRSA/Pseudomonas concerns [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions. For suspected or confirmed MRSA or Pseudomonas, a 7-day total course is recommended. For bacteremia with typical CAP pathogens, shorter courses are generally acceptable if the patient stabilizes, though I need to be cautious and individualize based on source control and response. For immunocompromised hosts or slow response, extending beyond 5 days may be reasonable, but I should confirm that extensions are tied to objective instability or atypical features rather than habit [^760f62a6] [^c1275f1d].

> Let me consider HAP and VAP, because duration differs from CAP. For HAP and VAP, ATS/IDSA recommends 7 days, with the caveat that nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas may have higher recurrence with short courses. I should double-check that this 7-day standard is supported by RCTs showing more antibiotic-free days and fewer recurrences due to MDR organisms with 7–8 days versus 10–15 days, which it is, including the classic 8 vs 15 day VAP trial [^e0221a0e] [^438c2597] [^e632a9cd].

> I need to ensure I incorporate stewardship and safety monitoring. Excess antibiotic days are common and harmful; each extra day increases adverse events without improving outcomes, so I should use clinical stability to time discontinuation and avoid treating beyond normalization of vitals by more than 2 days. Serial assessment of temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, mental status, and oral intake guides safe cessation, and in select settings, procalcitonin can support earlier discontinuation, though clinical criteria remain paramount [^4eaef665] [^21d7370e] [^0a62208c].

> But wait, what if the patient is not improving as expected. I should confirm that failure to stabilize by 72 hours should trigger reassessment of the diagnosis, antimicrobial coverage, and source control, rather than simply extending antibiotics. This is especially critical in severe CAP, where delays in appropriate therapy or unrecognized complications drive worse outcomes [^ccf53237].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most CAP, treat for a minimum of 5 days and stop when the patient is afebrile for 48–72 hours with no more than one instability criterion and is otherwise clinically stable. For nonsevere CAP that stabilizes quickly, 3–5 days may suffice in carefully selected patients. For severe CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas, 5 days is usually adequate if stability is achieved. For MRSA or Pseudomonas, plan for 7 days. For HAP/VAP, default to 7 days, extending only for slow response or nonfermenters. And for immunocompromised hosts or complicated courses, individualize beyond 5–7 days based on response and source control [^760f62a6] [^56fe38d1] [^e0221a0e].

> Finally, I should confirm pediatric nuances briefly. In children, high-quality RCTs show that 3–5 days of amoxicillin is noninferior to 7–10 days for uncomplicated CAP, with the CAP-IT trial demonstrating noninferiority of 3 vs 7 days for retreatment, which supports shorter courses in ambulatory pediatric CAP when clinically improved [^b6bde9c4] [^6ccebd83].

---

For most patients with pneumonia, **5 days of antibiotics** is sufficient if clinical stability is achieved, with extension to 7 days for severe cases or when MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected or confirmed [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a]. Shorter courses (3–5 days) may be appropriate in select nonsevere cases with rapid clinical response, but **not in severe pneumonia** [^56fe38d1] [^e1647064]. Procalcitonin can help guide earlier discontinuation in severe cases, but clinical stability remains the primary criterion [^0a62208c] [^a3af71d4].

## General principles guiding antibiotic duration

- **Clinical stability**: Antibiotics should be continued until the patient achieves clinical stability, defined by normalization of vital signs (temperature ≤ 37.8°C, heart rate ≤ 100/min, respiratory rate ≤ 24/min, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, oxygen saturation ≥ 90% or PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg on room air), ability to tolerate oral intake, and normal mentation [^a3af71d4] [^37eb851a].

- **Minimum duration**: Regardless of clinical stability, a minimum of 5 days of antibiotic therapy is recommended for most patients with CAP [^760f62a6] [^52b9834d].

- **Individualized approach**: The duration should be tailored based on patient-specific factors, including severity of illness, comorbidities, response to therapy, and presence of complications [^7458d546] [^18f82a2c].

---

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) | 5 days | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a] |
| Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) | 7 days | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a] |
| Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) | 7 days | Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence [^895cc90b] [^e0221a0e] |
| Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) | 7 days | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^438c2597] [^e632a9cd] |
| CAP with MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa | 7 days | Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a] |

## Evidence supporting shorter antibiotic courses

Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that **shorter antibiotic courses** (≤ 5 days) are as effective as longer courses (7–10 days) in non-severe CAP, with no significant differences in clinical cure, mortality, or relapse rates [^e1647064] [^02ead562]. Shorter courses are associated with reduced antibiotic exposure, lower risk of adverse events, and decreased healthcare costs [^d0737f27] [^4eaef665].

---

## Role of biomarkers in determining duration

Biomarkers, particularly procalcitonin, have been studied to guide antibiotic discontinuation. Procalcitonin-guided algorithms have been shown to **reduce antibiotic duration** without compromising clinical outcomes in severe CAP and other respiratory infections [^0a62208c] [^62d14bc4]. However, clinical stability remains the primary criterion for discontinuation, and biomarkers should be used adjunctively [^a3af71d4].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged antibiotic therapy

Prolonged antibiotic therapy beyond the shortest effective duration is associated with several risks, including:

- **Increased adverse events**: Higher incidence of antibiotic-related adverse effects, including Clostridioides difficile infection [^4eaef665] [^358582dd].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Greater selective pressure leading to antimicrobial resistance [^d0737f27] [^16541ab4].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Longer hospital stays and higher treatment costs [^599be338].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require longer courses (10–14 days) depending on clinical response and presence of complications [^notfound].

- **Complicated pneumonia**: Presence of empyema, lung abscess, or necrotizing pneumonia may necessitate prolonged therapy (10–14 days) and surgical intervention [^3aa40c0e].

- **Pediatric patients**: Shorter courses (3–5 days) have been shown to be effective in non-severe pediatric CAP, with clinical stability guiding discontinuation [^b6bde9c4] [^6ccebd83].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-severe CAP**: 5 days of antibiotic therapy, ensuring clinical stability before discontinuation [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

- **Severe CAP**: 7 days of antibiotic therapy, with extension only if clinical response is suboptimal or complications arise [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

- **HAP/VAP**: 7 days of antibiotic therapy, with adjustments based on clinical response and microbiological data [^895cc90b] [^438c2597].

- **MRSA or Pseudomonas**: 7 days of antibiotic therapy, with consideration of longer courses if clinical response is delayed [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

---

The duration of antibiotic therapy for pneumonia should be **individualized** based on clinical stability, severity of illness, and patient-specific factors. For most patients, 5 days is sufficient, while severe cases or those involving MRSA or Pseudomonas require 7 days. Prolonged therapy should be avoided to minimize adverse effects and resistance.

### How to choose the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with pneumonia [^7458d546]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The appropriate duration of antimicrobial treatment in patients with pneumonia remains a matter of controversy. The purpose of this article is to review different approaches that have been used to determine the duration of antimicrobial therapy mainly driven either by the antibiotic chosen, isolated pathogen, host characteristics, or severity of the disease.

Recent Findings

When considered individually, every approach has strengths and weaknesses. Targeting the duration of antibiotic therapy based on a single biomarker, such as procalcitonin, is a promising approach that showed a reduction in antibiotic exposure in different settings, diseases, and study populations. Furthermore, an individualized approach according to time to reach clinical stability takes into account all the previous cited factors and may be another feasible and effective strategy to determine the most appropriate duration of the antibiotic therapy in patients with pneumonia.

Summary

A shorter duration of antibiotic course based on response to treatment may be favorable in patients with pneumonia due to a potential reduction of adverse events and antibiotic resistance, the opportunity to enhance patients' compliance and to decrease healthcare costs.

Importance

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not been well established.

Objective

To validate Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for duration of antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients with CAP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was a multicenter, noninferiority randomized clinical trial performed at 4 teaching hospitals in Spain from January 1, 2012, through August 31, 2013. A total of 312 hospitalized patients diagnosed as having CAP were studied. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, through February 28, 2015.

Interventions

Patients were randomized at day 5 to an intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and the antibiotic treatment was stopped at this point if their body temperature was 37.8°C or less for 48 hours and they had no more than 1 CAP-associated sign of clinical instability. Duration of antibiotic treatment in the control group was determined by physicians.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical success rate at days 10 and 30 since admission and CAP-related symptoms at days 5 and 10 measured with the 18-item CAP symptom questionnaire score range, 0–90; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.

Results

Of the 312 patients included, 150 and 162 were randomized to the control and intervention groups, respectively. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 66.2 (17.9) years and 64.7 (18.7) years in the control and intervention groups, respectively. There were 95 men (63.3%) and 55 women (36.7%) in the control group and 101 men (62.3%) and 61 women (37.7%) in the intervention group. In the intent-to-treat analysis, clinical success was 48.6% (71 of 150) in the control group and 56.3% (90 of 162) in the intervention group at day 10 (P = 0.18) and 88.6% (132 of 150) in the control group and 91.9% (147 of 162) in the intervention group at day 30 (P = 0.33). The mean (SD) CAP symptom questionnaire scores were 24.7 (11.4) vs 27.2 (12.5) at day 5 (P = 0.10) and 18.6 (9.0) vs 17.9 (7.6) at day 10 (P = 0.69). In the per-protocol analysis, clinical success was 50.4% (67 of 137) in the control group and 59.7% (86 of 146) in the intervention group at day 10 (P = 0.12) and 92.7% (126 of 137) in the control group and 94.4% (136 of 146) in the intervention group at day 30 (P = 0.54). The mean (SD) CAP symptom questionnaire scores were 24.3 (11.4) vs 26.6 (12.1) at day 5 (P = 0.16) and 18.1 (8.5) vs 17.6 (7.4) at day 10 (P = 0.81).

Conclusions and Relevance

The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society recommendations for duration of antibiotic treatment based on clinical stability criteria can be safely implemented in hospitalized patients with CAP.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^18f82a2c]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic duration for respiratory tract infections should be tailored to the patient's needs

It is evident that there is substantial interindividual variability in how drugs are handled, and it seems unlikely that the optimal duration of therapy is precisely the same for all patients. Factors such as age, comorbidities, underlying health conditions, frailty, and immune status vary among individuals, making it unlikely that a one-size-fits-all approach would be effective. This highlights the importance of individualised and patient-centred medical care, considering the unique characteristics and needs of each patient when determining the duration of therapy for RTIs. Llewelyn et al. emphasized that the traditional idea of completing a fixed antibiotic course overlooks the reality that patients can react differently to the same antibiotic. In hospital settings, several studies indicate that biomarkers like procalcitonin can help determine when to discontinue antibiotic treatment. However, outside of hospitals, where frequent testing is not feasible, patients might be advised to stop treatment once they start feeling better. A clinical trial found that using fever resolution as a guide for stopping antibiotics in cases of community-acquired pneumonia reduced the average duration of antibiotic treatment by half without compromising clinical success. In a landmark study, a three-day antibiotic course with intravenous amoxicillin was as efficacious as 8 days of treatment in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate-severe community-acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial three days of therapy, which accounted for 78.5% of the participants. It would not be unreasonable to think that the percentage of patients with pneumonia who feel better after three days would be even higher in primary care. However, studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of discontinuing antibiotic therapy upon the resolution of symptoms have not yet been conducted in the primary care setting.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia? [^d0737f27]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and promotes reduction of adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improved patient compliance.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7-14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia… [^3aa40c0e]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In 2007, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society developed recommendations for the duration of antibiotic treatment based on stability criteria proposed by Halm et al. 14 The guidelines suggested a minimum of 5 days of treatment, patients achieving an afebrile state for 48 to 72 hours, and patients meeting no more than 1 CAP-associated instability criteria before therapy discontinuation. 15 A longer duration was recommended if the initial therapy was not active against the identified pathogen or if the patient's condition was complicated by extrapulmonary infection, such as meningitis or endocarditis. Patients in the intervention group were treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days, and the antibiotic treatment was stopped at this point if their body temperature was 37. 8°C or less for 48 hours and they had no more than 1 CAP-associated sign of clinical instability, defined as systolic blood pressure less.

than 90 mm Hg, heart rate greater than 100/min, respiratory rate greater than 24 /min, arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, or Pao2 less than 60 mm Hg in room air. 15 In contrast, duration of antibiotics in the control group was determined by physicians as in clinical practice. 14 days; had already taken antibiotics in the 30 days before admission; required a longer duration of therapy because of an uncommon cause; required a chest tube; or had a condition complicated by extrapulmonary infection, such as meningitis or endocarditis. Patients who died or were transferred to the intensive care unit before randomization or who declined to participate or give inform consent were also excluded. Four patients and 101 patients from the control and intervention groups, respectively, were receiving antibiotics for only 5 days.

No significant differences were found between groups in time until clinical improvement and days to return to normal activity measured at day 30, radiographic resolution at day 30, or adverse effects by day 30. In agreement with previous data, 29 most of our patients reached stability by day
3. Given that the IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend15 antibiotic treatment should be discontinued after 48 hours of stability, this implies no more than 5 days of treatment in most cases, although this does not currently happen in clinical practice.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^599be338]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main value of the current study is that it shows the medium and long-term safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients admitted for a case of CAP, based on clinical stability criteria, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications; nor did it lead to higher mortality or readmission rates, nor differences in the systemic inflammation presented by these patients. That is, the fact that there are no significant long-term differences in the main results under study between the control and intervention groups, validates our proposal to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with clinically stable CAP from the point of view of the long-term safety of the patient.

The beneficial effects of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment have been studied widely. On the one hand, it reduces antimicrobial resistance, possible adverse effects and costs, while, on the other hand, it improves adherence to treatment. However, despite current evidence avoiding unnecessarily prolonged treatments remains an arduous task, likely due to a false sense of security provided by longer-term treatments. In fact, a retrospective study carried out in the United States in patients admitted for CAP, observed that the average duration of antibiotic treatment exceeded the recommended time by 74 and 71% for patients aged 18–64 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively.

A remarkable strength of this study is that it is based on a clinical trial with a unique design where the doctor him or herself decided on the type of antibiotic and in which similar cure rates were obtained for both groups. Likewise, unlike most of the studies published so far and despite the exclusion of patients requiring admission to Intensive Care, up to 40% of patients with IV and V PSI were included. However, the evidence for critically ill patients is limited. Chastre et al. carried out a double-blind clinical trial in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia in which they compared 8-day versus 15 day antibiotic regimens. The authors observed no differences between the two groups except in the case of non-fermenting gram-negative germs. Recently, in a meta-analysis in which they compared regimens of ≤ 6 days versus ≥ 7 days with similar results, they carried out a sub-analysis in patients with severe pneumonia, observing lower mortality in the group with the shorter regimen (2.2% vs. 4.7%).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^760f62a6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^fac9fede]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^c073cd76]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published to date. In 2007, IDSA / ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 h and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials involving adults with mild-to-moderate CAP comparing the same types of antibiotic, short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics were compared to 7 to 10 day regimens. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens, observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates in both groups. When evaluating only the most severe patients, mortality was 2.2% in the group with a shorter regimen compared to 4.7% in the long regimen group.

### Short treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia [^e1647064]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lower respiratory tract infections are one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. Usual guidelines for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend 5-7days of antibiotic treatment. In daily practice, physicians often prescribe 9-10days of antibiotic treatment. Among available strategies to decrease antibiotic use, possibly preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing treatment durations is the safest and the most acceptable to clinicians. We aim to review data evaluating the efficacy of short antibiotic duration in adult CAP and which criteria can help clinicians to reduce antibiotic treatment.

Recent Findings

Several studies and meta-analyses demonstrated that the treatment duration of 7days or less was sufficient for CAP. Two trials found that 3-day treatments were effective, even in hospitalized CAP. To customize and shorten duration, clinical and biological criteria have been studied and reflect patient's response. Indeed, stability criteria were recently shown to be effective to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Procalcitonin was also studied but never compared with clinical criteria.

Summary

Treatment duration for CAP is still under debate, but several studies support short durations. Clinical criteria could be possibly used to discontinue antibiotic treatment.

### A week seems to be weak: tailoring duration of antibiotic treatment in Gram-negative ventilator-associated pneumonia [^108783b1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal length of antimicrobial therapy has not been extensively studied for a great majority of infections and, in critically ill patients affected by ventilator-associated pneumonia, is a persisting and unsolved issue confronting clinicians. The integration of biomarkers, clinical judgment, and microbiologic eradication might help to define a shorter duration for some ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli, but until these strategies are implemented in clinical practice for individualizing antibiotic treatment, a short-course duration does not seem to tailor a long benefit.

### Short-course versus long-course intravenous therapy with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months [^05f8e599]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality from infectious disease, responsible for an estimated 1.3 million deaths annually in children under five years of age, many of which are in low-income countries. The World Health Organization recommends intravenous antibiotics for five days as first-line treatment for children with severe pneumonia. Although controversy exists regarding the specific clinical features used to diagnose pneumonia, the criteria for diagnosis of severe pneumonia are better defined and are widely used to triage children for referral and second-line therapy. In 2011 it was estimated that approximately 120 million new cases of pneumonia occur globally each year in children under five years of age, of which 14 million become severe episodes. Hospitalisation for severe pneumonia in children places a significant burden on both patients and their families, including substantial expense, loss of routine, and decrease in quality of life. By reducing the duration of hospital treatment, healthcare burdens could potentially be reduced and treatment compliance may improve. This is an update of a review published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) with the same antibiotic for severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to December week 3, 2016), Embase (1974 to 22 December 2016), and four trials registers (23 August 2017), together with reference checking of all relevant trials and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of short-course (two to three days) versus long-course (five days) intravenous antibiotic therapy (alone or in combination with oral antibiotics) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months. We excluded children with any other debilitating disease, including those infected with HIV. We also excluded children who had developed pneumonia during their hospital stay (i.e. with nosocomial infection). There was no restriction on the type of antibiotic used, the dose, or the frequency of dosing.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Our searches identified 4295 records, however no studies met our predefined inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified no randomised controlled trials comparing a short course (two to three days) of intravenous antibiotics compared to a long course (five days) for severe pneumonia in children aged two months to 59 months that met our inclusion criteria.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^796ca267]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study indicates that individualizing and reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP based on clinical stability criteria is safe, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications or differences in systemic inflammation.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^570afc0e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Until now, most data on the length of antibiotic courses have come from low-income or middle-income countries. The main differences in relation to the high-income countries concern the definition of CAP by the World Health Organization criteria for developing countries, which highlight increased respiratory rate and rates of severe treatment failure > 5%, which are not acceptable in Western countries.

The main strength of our review is the high quality and low risk of bias of the included studies, which increases the validity of our results. Furthermore, we did not have any major protocol deviations. Moreover, the numbers of cases — 1451 for the primary outcome and 1194 for the secondary outcome of antibiotic-related adverse events — allow reliable meta-analysis. The exclusion of studies focusing on treatment of atypical pneumonias increased the consistency of data, since the necessity to treat them remains open.

A minor limitation to our results is the fact that more than half of the patients were from a single study, but this should not cause bias in the estimates, given that the results were similar in all studies. The main limitation of our study is the differing definition of CAP in the included studies, because 2 of them required chest radiographs and 2 did not. The currently available guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of CAP treated at home is clinical, and imaging is needed only in complicated cases. Viral determinations were performed in only one study, but virus identification does not necessarily influence decision making in CAP, since mixed viral-bacterial infections are common and it is recommended that all pediatric CAP cases in children ≥ 6 months of age are treated with antibiotics. Therefore, future studies should focus more on optimal differential recognition of bacterial and viral pneumonia, and a double-blinded placebo design should be used to determine whether antibiotics are needed at all in mild pneumonia. As seen in a previous study from England, antibiotics did not improve outcomes in nonsevere lower respiratory tract infections.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis, including 4 high-level RCTs, showed that short treatment was equally safe and effective as longer treatment of 7–10 days for CAP in outpatient children aged ≥ 6 months in high-income countries. We suggest that this shorter treatment for 3–5 days can now be implemented into clinical practice.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^49eed135]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

'Complete the antibiotic course', a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR. However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental. By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms. This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection. AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma. The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies. In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bd24d22c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Short-course versus prolonged-course antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill adults [^03e5a83b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the most common hospital-acquired infection affecting patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, current national guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are several years old and the diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients (VAP) has been subject to considerable recent attention. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for HAP in the critically ill is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of short versus prolonged-course antibiotics for HAP in critically ill adults, including patients with VAP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1946 to June 2015), MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations (5 June 2015), EMBASE (2010 to June 2015), LILACS (1982 to June 2015) and Web of Science (1955 to June 2015).

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a fixed 'short' duration of antibiotic therapy with a 'prolonged' course for HAP (including patients with VAP) in critically ill adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main Results

We identified six relevant studies involving 1088 participants. This included two new studies published after the date of our previous review (2011). There was substantial variation in participants, in the diagnostic criteria used to define an episode of pneumonia, in the interventions and in the reported outcomes. We found no evidence relating to patients with a high probability of HAP who were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, overall a short seven- or eight-day course of antibiotics compared with a prolonged 10- to 15-day course increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (two studies; N = 431; mean difference (MD) 4.02 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26 to 5.78) and reduced recurrence of VAP due to multi-resistant organisms (one study; N = 110; odds ratio (OR) 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.95), without adversely affecting mortality and other recurrence outcomes. However, for cases of VAP specifically due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), recurrence was greater after short-course therapy (two studies, N = 176; OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.16), though mortality outcomes were not significantly different. One study found that a three-day course of antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected HAP but a low Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) was associated with a significantly lower risk of superinfection or emergence of antimicrobial resistance, compared with standard (prolonged) course therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of a small number of studies and appreciating the lack of uniform definition of pneumonia, we conclude that for patients with VAP not due to NF-GNB a short, fixed course (seven or eight days) of antibiotic therapy appears not to increase the risk of adverse clinical outcomes, and may reduce the emergence of resistant organisms, compared with a prolonged course (10 to 15 days). However, for patients with VAP due to NF-GNB, there appears to be a higher risk of recurrence following short-course therapy. These findings do not differ from those of our previous review and are broadly consistent with current guidelines. There are few data from RCTs comparing durations of therapy in non-ventilated patients with HAP, but on the basis of a single study, short-course (three-day) therapy for HAP appears not to be associated with worse clinical outcome, and may reduce the risk of subsequent infection or the emergence of resistant organisms when there is low probability of pneumonia according to the CPIS.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^ccf53237]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Approach to the patient with unresponsive pneumonia – differential diagnosis

When faced with a non-responding patient with pneumonia, the critical care team must consider three broad possibilities (Fig. 2): 1) their prognostication regarding the expected time to improvement is unrealistic; 2) the antimicrobial treatment is inappropriate due to antimicrobial resistance, the presence of an unexpected infectious agent including a nosocomial pathogen or insufficient source control (e.g. empyema); 3) the patient is suffering from a viral or non-infectious process.

Expected recovery time

Determining the expected recovery time for critically ill patients with pneumonia is not a precise science; nonetheless, it is dependent upon a multitude of factors previously detailed. Delay in initiating appropriate empiric antibiotics or under resuscitation are modifiable risk factors that could result in delayed recovery time or adverse outcomes. While failure of a patient with sCAP to clinically stabilize after 72h of antibiotic therapy has been previously defined as "treatment failure", this time frame may be too long to wait before initiating a re-evaluation of the diagnosis in a critically ill patient. Since appropriate recovery time cannot be accurately estimated, clinicians caring for critically ill patients diagnosed with pneumonia who fail to respond within 72h of antibiotic therapy or who are clinically worsening prior to 72h should reconsider the initial diagnosis and seek both infectious and non-infectious explanations for the patients' unanticipated clinical course (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

### Duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^fa3a15bf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The study Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia was published by Ane Uranga and colleagues in 2016 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the trial question was: what is the role of duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia? In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the population was: 312 patients (116 female, 196 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were HIV infection; chronic immunosuppression; lived in a nursing home; discharge from an acute care hospital, an onsite subacute care unit, or a palliative care unit within the previous 14 days; taken antibiotics in the 30 days before admission. In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the interventions were: n = 162 discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days (protocolized duration of antibiotic treatment for a minimum of 5 days) n = 150 physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation (duration of antibiotic treatment determined by physicians). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in clinical success at day 10 (56.3% vs. 48.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI -0.53 to 2.85). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical success at day 30 (91.9% vs. 88.6%; RR 1.04, 95% CI -1.03 to 3.11) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 5 (27.2 vs. 24.7; AD 2.5, 95% CI -0.48 to 5.48) No significant difference in mean CAP symptom questionnaire scores at day 10 (17.9 points vs. 18.6 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -3.99 to 2.59). In the Duration of antibiotics in community-acquired pneumonia study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, discontinuation of antibiotics after 5 days were noninferior to physician-guided antibiotic discontinuation with respect to clinical success at day 10.

### Short-course versus long-course antibiotic therapy for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 months to 59 months [^fa91d0b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Treatment of pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. Recommended duration of treatment ranges between 7 and 14 days, but this is not based on any empirical evidence. Shorter duration of therapy, if found to be effective, could be particularly important in resource-poor settings where there is a high risk of death, poor access to medicines and health care, and limited budgets for medicines.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy with the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 to 59 months.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (OVID) (January 1966 to September 2007); EMBASE (Embase.com) (1974 to September 2007); and LILACS (1982 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy using the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Three studies (5763 children) were included. Analysis of three days versus five days of treatment with the same antibiotic for non-severe pneumonia in children showed non-significant differences in rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01), treatment failure at the end of treatment (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25) and relapse rate after seven days of clinical cure (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.42). Subgroup analysis evaluating the impact of different antibiotics showed non-significant differences for these outcomes with different durations of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence of this review suggests that a short course (three days) of antibiotic therapy is as effective as a longer treatment (five days) for non-severe pneumonia in children under five years of age. However, there is a need for more well-designed RCTs to support our review findings.

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^f252df94]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^ff4c7b0c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^6ccebd83]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The optimal treatment duration of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children has been controversial in high-income countries. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare short antibiotic treatment (3–5 days) with longer treatment (7–10 days) among children aged ≥ 6 months.

Methods

On 31 January 2022, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published in English from 2003 to 2022. We included randomized controlled trials focusing on antibiotic treatment duration in children with CAP treated as outpatients. We calculated risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals and used the fixed-effect model (low heterogeneity). Our main outcome was treatment failure, defined as need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month. Our secondary outcome was presence of antibiotic-related harms.

Results

A total of 541 studies were screened, and 4 studies with 1541 children were included in the review. Three studies had low risk of bias, and one had some concerns. All 4 studies assessed treatment failures, and the RD was 0.1% (95% confidence interval, −3.0% to 2.0%) with high quality of evidence. Two studies (1194 children) assessed adverse events related to antibiotic treatment, and the RD was 0.0% (−5.0% to 5.0%) with moderate quality of evidence. The diagnostic criteria varied between the included studies.

Conclusions

A short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was equally effective and safe compared with the longer (current) recommendation of 7–10 days in children aged ≥ 6 months with CAP. We suggest that short antibiotic courses can be implemented in treatment of pediatric CAP.

### Duration of pneumonia therapy and the role of biomarkers [^62d14bc4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasing antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide phenomenon that is threatening public health. Lower respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity that contribute to antibiotic consumption and thus the emergence of multidrug-resistant microbial strains. The goal of shortening antibiotic regimens' duration in common bacterial infections has been prioritized by antimicrobial stewardship programs as an action against this problem.

Recent Findings

Data coming from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews support the shortening of antimicrobial regimens in community-acquired, hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Short schedules have been proven at least as effective as long ones in terms of antimicrobial-free days and clinical cure. Procalcitonin-based algorithms have been validated as well tolerated and cost-effective tools for the duration of pneumonia therapy reduction.

Summary

Shortening the duration of antibiotic regimens in pneumonia seems a reasonable strategy for reducing selective pressure driving antimicrobial resistance and costs provided that clinical cure is guaranteed. Procalcitonin-based protocols have been proven essentially helpful in this direction. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^21d7370e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Similarly, clinicians are advised to follow patients' physiologic trajectories after starting antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia. Clinicians should customize treatment durations to patients' clinical trajectories rather than prospectively specifying fixed courses for all patients. At least 3 randomized trials suggest it is safe to stop antibiotic administration after as few as 3 days if patients' clinical signs are normalizing, even if the signs are not yet completely within reference ranges. Integrating serial procalcitonin monitoring may further facilitate this strategy. Our estimate of potential excess antibiotic days is likely conservative because we only counted excess antibiotic days starting 3 days after all clinical signs had returned to the reference ranges, whereas clinical trials evaluating the safety of shorter treatment courses have permitted stopping antibiotic therapy so long as patients were improving even if some of their signs were still abnormal.

Clinical sign monitoring could potentially be the basis for a new antibiotic stewardship measurement. Rather than comparing hospitals on the average duration of antibiotic treatment prescribed for fixed diagnoses (eg, pneumonia), it might make more sense to compare average duration of antibiotic treatment beyond when clinical signs have normalized. The advantage of this approach is that it accounts for differences in clinical trajectories between patients who differ in comorbidities, infecting pathogens, and extent of infection. A measure of this nature would allow for longer courses for patients who are slow to improve and shorter courses for patients who rapidly improve. The key parameter is simply whether antibiotic therapy was continued for more than 2 days beyond when clinical signs normalized.

### Short-course versus prolonged-course antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill adults [^fa274307]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the most common hospital-acquired infection affecting patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of short versus prolonged-course antibiotic administration for HAP in critically ill adults, including patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to February week 4, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to March 2011), LILACS (1985 to March 2011) and Web of Science (1985 to March 2011).

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed durations of antibiotic therapy, or comparing a protocol intended to limit duration of therapy with standard care, for HAP (including patients with VAP) in critically ill adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors conducted data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

Main Results

Eight studies (1703 patients) were included. Methodology varied considerably and we found little evidence regarding patients with a high probability of HAP who were not mechanically ventilated. For patients with VAP, a short seven to eight-day course of antibiotics compared with a prolonged 10 to 15-day course (three studies, N = 508) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (odds ratio (OR) 4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.26 to 5.78) and reduced recurrence of VAP due to multi-resistant organisms (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.95), without adversely affecting other outcomes. However, for cases of VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NF-GNB), recurrence was greater after short-course therapy (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.14 to 4.16; two studies, N = 176), though other outcome measures did not significantly differ. Discontinuation strategies utilising clinical features (one study; N = 302) or procalcitonin (three studies; N = 323) led to a reduction in duration of therapy and, in the procalcitonin studies, increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference (MD) 2.80; 95% CI 1.39 to 4.21) without negatively affecting other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude that for patients with VAP not due to NF-GNB, a short fixed-course (seven or eight days) antibiotic therapy may be more appropriate than a prolonged course (10 to 15 days). Use of an individualised strategy (incorporating clinical features or serum procalcitonin) appears to safely reduce duration of antibiotic therapy for VAP.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^b6bde9c4]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = 0.63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^51450ee8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Antibiotics for COPD exacerbations: does drug or duration matter? A primary care database analysis [^d18c1062]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are globally the most common infectious cause of morbidity. Despite this prevalence, observed duration of antibiotic treatment for LRTI varies greatly, and there is disagreement between guidelines on the optimal duration. Effective first-line treatment for non-pneumonic LRTI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients ('infective exacerbations') is an area of particular uncertainty.

COPD is a common cause of disability, and estimated to become the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2030. Exacerbations form a large part of the disease burden and can lead to a cough with discoloured phlegm irrespective of causation. Over £250 million is spent on treating COPD exacerbations annually in the UK, and recurrent exacerbations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

Up to half of all COPD exacerbations are thought to be caused by bacteria, the remainder by viruses or environmental irritants. The most common pathogens are Haemophilus influenza e, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial studies suggested that the administration of antibiotics was associated with a lower risk of symptom persistence. However, a Cochrane review concluded that a statistically significant improvement in treatment failure rate was only seen in severe exacerbations, with more adverse events in the antibiotic group. Hence, the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society and international guidelines advise, based on moderate evidence, the prescription of antibiotics for ambulatory patients 'if clinically indicated'. However, our understanding of the success of real-life prescribing practices is limited.

### Duration of therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^a5171bdd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the critical care setting. It incurs great additional cost and the antibiotics prescribed for patients with VAP account for the majority of total antibiotic prescriptions. The increased cost of VAP as well as the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and the potential adverse events because of treatment indicate that the application of shorter antibiotic regimens for the treatment of VAP poses as a one-way choice.

Recent Findings

According to the findings of relevant randomized controlled trials, patients receiving short-course regimens for the treatment of VAP have significantly more antibiotic-free days without any negative impact on mortality. Additionally, no other differences were found regarding other secondary outcomes. However, there were higher relapse rates in patients with VAP because of nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli and there was a lower emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

Summary

The shortening of the duration of treatment for VAP is promising, as long as a holistic approach that combines methods ensuring the adequate sterilization of septic foci, the optimization of antibiotic levels, the multifaceted delivery of antimicrobials in the lung and the usage of biomarkers that allow the monitoring of the disease course and the effectiveness of administered treatment are incorporated in clinical practice.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^2087793e]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes great mortality and morbidity and high costs worldwide. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^37eb851a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Seven-day antibiotic courses have similar efficacy to prolonged courses in severe community-acquired pneumonia – a propensity-adjusted analysis [^7752ca1e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

There are no studies to guide the optimal duration of therapy in severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of this study was to determine whether 7 days of antibiotic treatment is equivalent to longer-course therapy in severe CAP. In this prospective observational study, we included patients with severe CAP (CURB65 score 3–5) admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms consistent with pneumonia. A propensity score, derived through multiple logistic regression, was used to match patients into two groups: treated for 7 days vs. treated for > 7 days. Patients who died, were admitted to the intensive-care unit, developed complicated pneumonia, failed to reach clinical stability or had positive cultures for microorganisms requiring prolonged treatment within the first 7 days were excluded. Patients outside the mutual range of the propensity score were also excluded. The primary outcome of this study was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were subsequent requirement for mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic support and the development of complicated pneumonia or re-admission within 30 days. Four hundred and twelve patients were suitable for derivation of the propensity score. After matching on propensity score, 164 patients treated for 7 days were compared with 164 treated for > 7 days; they were well matched in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, and physiological parameters. The results showed no significant differences in the primary and the secondary outcomes between the two groups. This study therefore suggests that, in the majority of severe CAP patients who have clinically responded, antibiotics can be safely discontinued at 7 days.

### Comparison of 8 vs 15 days of antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults: a randomized trial [^e632a9cd]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

The optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is unknown. Shortening the length of treatment may help to contain the emergence of multiresistant bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Objective

To determine whether 8 days is as effective as 15 days of antibiotic treatment of patients with microbiologically proven VAP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, randomized, double-blind (until day 8) clinical trial conducted in 51 French ICUs. A total of 401 patients diagnosed as having developed VAP by quantitative culture results of bronchoscopic specimens and who had received initial appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy were enrolled between May 1999 and June 2002.

Intervention

A total of 197 patients were randomly assigned to receive 8 days and 204 to receive 15 days of therapy with an antibiotic regimen selected by the treating physician.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome measures-death from any cause, microbiologically documented pulmonary infection recurrence, and antibiotic-free days-were assessed 28 days after VAP onset and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.

Results

Compared with patients treated for 15 days, those treated for 8 days had neither excess mortality (18.8% vs 17.2%; difference, 1.6%; 90% confidence interval [CI] -3.7% to 6.9%) nor more recurrent infections (28.9% vs 26.0%; difference, 2.9%; 90% CI, -3.2% to 9.1%), but they had more mean (SD) antibiotic-free days (13.1 [7.4] vs 8.7 [5.2] days, P < .001). The number of mechanical ventilation-free days, the number of organ failure-free days, the length of ICU stay, and mortality rates on day 60 for the 2 groups did not differ. Although patients with VAP caused by nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, did not have more unfavorable outcomes when antimicrobial therapy lasted only 8 days, they did have a higher pulmonary infection-recurrence rate compared with those receiving 15 days of treatment (40.6% vs 25.4%; difference, 15.2%, 90% CI, 3.9%-26.6%). Among patients who developed recurrent infections, multiresistant pathogens emerged less frequently in those who had received 8 days of antibiotics (42.1% vs 62.0% of pulmonary recurrences, P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Among patients who had received appropriate initial empirical therapy, with the possible exception of those developing nonfermenting gram-negative bacillus infections, comparable clinical effectiveness against VAP was obtained with the 8- and 15-day treatment regimens. The 8-day group had less antibiotic use.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^afc751d4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions

It is hard to convince doctors not to prescribe antibiotics at all when they are in doubt or in the face of patient expectations. The limited to moderate impact in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care observed in antimicrobial stewardship programmes necessitates the exploration of new strategies. We need to change the message to healthcare professionals, policymakers, and educators regarding the idea of always completing a full course of antibiotics. Several systematic reviews show that shorter antibiotic courses are as effective as standard durations for most RTIs. Studies focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and on tailoring antibiotic therapy, dose, and length of therapy to patients' needs, present a promising strategy in primary care. This can be encouraged based on randomised clinical trials indicating that patients most often recover within three days. In the end, we are not treating RTIs, we are treating patients with RTIs.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^a6c99b0c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 5.6 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occur annually in the US, resulting in 600 000 to 800 000 hospitalizations, with the highest incidence rate in older patients. Community-acquired pneumonia is a heterogeneous disease that ranges from a mild, self-limiting disease to a severe infection that causes respiratory failure, shock, and death. Treatment failure is the most serious complication. Failure significantly increases the risk of complications, length of hospital stay, and death, especially in patients with severe CAP. The incidence of clinical failure in patients with CAP ranges from 6% to 24%, and can reach up to 31% in patients with severe CAP. Several risk factors for treatment failure have been identified in the literature, such as age, smoking, malnutrition, previous CAP episodes, and comorbidities (chronic pulmonary disease, asthma, and immunosuppression). Reaching clinical stability is associated with a high rate of favorable outcomes. The Pneumonia Short Treatment (PTC) trial was a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that studied antibiotic treatment duration (3 vs 8 days of β-lactam treatment) among 310 patients hospitalized with moderately severe CAP who reached clinical stability at day 3 of treatment. In this secondary analysis, we aim to evaluate the risk factors for treatment failure among this specific population.

### Shorter antibiotic therapy safe for inpatients with pneumonia… [^ae9bfbda]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

For patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, shortening antibiotic therapy by 5 days does not affect cure rates, a trial published in The Lancet found. The shorter course could substantially reduce antibiotic consumption and resistance, adverse events, and costs. The phase 2 noninferiority trial conducted in 16 hospitals in France included 310 adult patients with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia who were clinically stable after 3 days of treatment with β-lactam therapy. The patients were randomly assigned to receive an additional 5 days of β-lactam therapy, consisting of 1 g of oral amoxicillin plus 125 mg of clavulanate 3 times a day, or placebo. Slomski A.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### Short-course antibiotic strategies for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^79b5f8b6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Evidence behind antibiotic duration while treating ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains unclear. There is a need to balance minimizing the development of antimicrobial resistance without compromising clinical outcomes given the high mortality.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have suggested that shorter antibiotic courses, when individualized to clinical response, may be adequate for treating VAP without increasing the incidence of mortality or recurrence, regardless of pathogens. Moreover, shortening duration may reduce the risk of adverse events, including acute kidney injury.

Summary

Shortening the duration of antibiotic treatment for VAP, in the setting of appropriate clinical response, is a reasonable strategy to reduce costs and selective pressure driving antimicrobial resistance. This was demonstrated in the latest REGARD-VAP study, even among VAP patients with nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli or carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Given the challenges in diagnosing VAP, such pragmatic approaches would be essential as part of overall antibiotic stewardship programmes. Further refinement to the criteria for antibiotic cessation may be possible.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^fa4eb4cd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The main result of this meta-analysis on the duration of antibiotic courses in children treated for CAP as outpatients was that a short antibiotic course of 3–5 days was not inferior to a long course of 7–10 days (the recommendation in the currently available guidelines). The analysis included 4 RCTs from high-income countries with a total of 1451 children aged ≥ 6 months. Treatment failure was defined as the need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month, and the rates were surprisingly similar: 7.9% and 8.0%, respectively. The RD between the arms was 0.1%, and the 95% CI was very narrow, confirming that the result for the primary outcome was reliable. In addition, there was no substantial heterogeneity between the 4 studies for reporting retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month after starting of primary antibiotics.

Adverse events, which was the secondary outcome of the analyses, were reported in 2 studies and they did not differ between the short-course and long-course treatment arms. Adverse events rates were 62.1% and 61.8%, respectively. These adverse events, such as diarrhea and rash, were mild and were often seen in children during antibiotic treatment. Two studies reported severe adverse events, and such events were seen in 0.3% of the cases, which means that the short-course antibiotic therapy was safe. A previous meta-analysis stated that each additional day of antibiotic treatment increases the rates of antibiotic-related adverse effects. Two of the included studies also analyzed the effects of treatment duration on antibiotic resistance and found the shorter course to be more beneficial, but we did not include this as an outcome in the meta-analysis.

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^02ead562]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been performed on the comparison of short versus long antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. The aim of this umbrella review is to assess the soundness of the current evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

Methods

A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was performed on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from inpatient and outpatient settings were included; reviews in paediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest were clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, risk of bias of all included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1), and overall quality of evidence according to GRADE.

Findings

We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; they were generally of a low to critically low quality. 21 reviews conducted a meta-analysis. For CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU; 14 reviews, of which eight did a meta-analysis) and AECOPD (eight reviews, of which five did a meta-analysis), there was sufficient evidence supporting a treatment duration of 5 days; evidence for shorter durations is scarce. Evidence on non-ventilator-associated HAP is absent, despite identifying three reviews (of which one did a meta-analysis), since no trials were conducted exclusively in this population. For sinusitis the evidence appears to support a shorter regimen, but more evidence is needed in the population who actually require antibiotic treatment. For pharyngotonsillitis (eight reviews, of which six did a meta-analysis), sufficient evidence exists to support short-course cephalosporin but not short-course penicillin when dosed three times a day.

Interpretation

The available evidence for non-ICU CAP and AECOPD supports a short-course treatment duration of 5 days in patients who have clinically improved. Efforts of the scientific community should be directed at implementing this evidence in daily practice. High-quality RCTs are needed to underpin even shorter treatment durations for CAP and AECOPD, to establish the optimal treatment duration of HAP and acute sinusitis, and to evaluate shorter duration using an optimal penicillin dosing schedule in patients with pharyngotonsillitis.

### Short-vs long-duration antibiotic regimens for ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ae784265]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of short- vs long-duration antibiotic regimens for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (7–8 days) with long (10–15 days) regimens were identified. Primary outcomes included mortality, antibiotic-free days, and clinical and microbiologic relapses. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay.

Results

All RCTs included mortality data, whereas data on relapse and antibiotic-free days were provided in three and two out of four RCTs, respectively. No difference in mortality was found between the compared arms (fixed effect model [FEM]: OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84–1.72; P = 0.32). There was an increase in antibiotic-free days in favor of the short-course treatment with a pooled weighted mean difference of 3.40 days (random effects model: 95% CI, 1.43–5.37; P < .001). There was no difference in relapses between the compared arms, although a strong trend to lower relapses in the long-course treatment was observed (FEM: OR = 1.67; 95% CI, 0.99–2.83; P = 0.06). No difference was found between the two arms regarding the remaining outcomes. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Short-course treatment of VAP was associated with more antibiotic-free days. No difference was found regarding mortality and relapses; however, a strong trend for fewer relapses was observed in favor of the long-course treatment, being mostly driven by one study in which the observed relapses were probably more microbiologic than clinical. Additional research is required to elucidate the issue.

### The association of antibiotic duration with successful treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children [^a693fcf6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

National guidelines recommend 10 days of antibiotics for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acknowledging that the outcomes of children hospitalized with CAP who receive shorter durations of therapy have not been evaluated.

Methods

We conducted a comparative effectiveness study of children aged ≥ 6 months hospitalized at The Johns Hopkins Hospital who received short-course (5–7 days) vs prolonged-course (8–14 days) antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated CAP between 2012 and 2018 using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Inclusion was limited to children with clinical and radiographic criteria consistent with CAP, as adjudicated by 2 infectious diseases physicians. Children with tracheostomies; healthcare-associated, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated pneumonia; loculated or moderate to large pleural effusion or pulmonary abscess; intensive care unit stay > 48 hours; cystic fibrosis/bronchiectasis; severe immunosuppression; or unusual pathogens were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite of unanticipated emergency department visits, outpatient visits, hospital readmissions, or death (all determined to be likely attributable to bacterial pneumonia) within 30 days after completing antibiotic therapy.

Results

Four hundred and thirty-nine patients met eligibility criteria; 168 (38%) patients received short-course therapy (median, 6 days) and 271 (62%) received prolonged-course therapy (median, 10 days). Four percent of children experienced treatment failure, with no differences observed between patients who received short-course vs prolonged-course antibiotic therapy (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .18–1.30).

Conclusions

A short course of antibiotic therapy (approximately 5 days) does not increase the odds of 30-day treatment failure compared with longer courses for hospitalized children with uncomplicated CAP.

### The new antibiotic mantra-"Shorter is better"… [^69c0b717]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In ad 321, Roman Emperor Constantine the Great codified that there would be 7 days in a week. Even in the modern era of evidence-based-medicine, this 1695-year-old decree remains a primary reference for duration of antibiotic therapy: it leads physicians to treat infections in intervals of 7 days. Thus, it is gratifying when clinical trials challenge the standard antibiotic duration of 7 to 14 days. In the past, community-acquired pneumonia was treated with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics. However, clinical trials in the early 2000s demonstrated that 3 or 5 days of protocol-specified antibiotics are as efficacious as longer courses of therapy for patients with mild to moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia. 1, 2 To this body of literature is now added a new randomized trial, in this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, by Uranga et al, 3 comparing short-course vs longer courses of therapy for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

The trial used a pragmatic design in that treating physicians were allowed to select their preferred antibiotic for the first 5 days of therapy. Patients were randomized such that on day 5 those in the control group continued the therapy selected by their treating physicians and those in the experimental group had their antibiotics stopped if they were afebrile for 48 hours and had no more than 1 sign of clinical instability. These criteria for stopping the antibiotic applied to 70. 1% of patients in the experimental arm. Although patients admitted to the intensive care unit were excluded from the trial, a substantial number of patients in both arms had Pneumonia Severity Index scores of IV to V, indicative of severe illness. In contrast, prior studies of short-course antibiotic therapy have focused primarily on patients with mild to moderate illness. Spellberg B. The New Antibiotic Mantra — "Shorter Is Better".

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America CAP guideline — clinical questions addressed lists priority PICO questions for adults with CAP, including whether to test a respiratory sample for influenza at diagnosis; whether serum procalcitonin plus clinical judgment versus clinical judgment alone should be used to withhold initiation of antibiotics; whether clinical prediction rules plus clinical judgment versus judgment alone should determine inpatient versus outpatient location and higher levels of inpatient treatment intensity (ICU, step-down, or telemetry unit); which antibiotics are recommended for empiric outpatient treatment; which inpatient regimens are recommended for adults without risk factors for MRSA and P. aeruginosa; whether suspected aspiration pneumonia warrants additional anaerobic coverage beyond standard empiric treatment; whether adults with risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa should receive extended-spectrum therapy instead of standard CAP regimens; whether inpatients with CAP should be treated with corticosteroids; whether influenza-positive adults should receive antiviral and/or antibacterial therapy; the appropriate duration of antibiotics for improving adults; and whether follow-up chest imaging should be obtained.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b411b928]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^5360f9c5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — duration of therapy: For patients with VAP, we recommend a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy rather than a longer duration (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Remarks: There exist situations in which a shorter or longer duration of antibiotics may be indicated, depending on the rate of improvement of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory parameters. One systematic review included 6 randomized trials that enrolled 508 patients with HAP/VAP; short courses of antibiotics (ie, 7–8 days) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.02 days; 95% CI, 2.26–5.78 days) and reduced recurrent VAP due to MDR pathogens (42.1% vs 62.3%; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, .25–.95) compared with long courses (ie, 10–15 days), with no differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, treatment failure, hospital length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. In the subgroup with a non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacillus including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (33% of patients), short courses were associated with recurrent infection (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16), but no other differences. Another systematic review enrolled 835 patients with VAP and similarly found short-course regimens increased antibiotic-free days without differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of ICU stay.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^c78aefc1]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The larger number of recommendations in the BTS Guideline compared with the NICE Pneumonia Guideline is partly due to differences in the scope of these two guidelines. Some of the areas covered in the BTS Guideline that were not evaluated for the NICE Guideline include the management of specific pathogens commonly associated with CAP, failure to improve and complications related to CAP.

Where the two guidelines overlap, there is considerable harmony. No major differences are evident in relation to the main pillars supporting the management of CAP. The NICE Guideline accordingly updates and strengthens the importance of these aspects of care. The BTS CAP Guideline remains valid with respect to these recommendations as does the BTS CAP Care Bundle, which contains these key elements.

For the five BTS recommendations where major differences with the NICE Pneumonia Guideline exist, adherence to the NICE Pneumonia Guideline is recommended in preference to the BTS Guideline. With respect to the duration of antibiotic therapy for low severity CAP, in the UK many local hospital antibiotic guidelines currently already advocate a 5-day course as opposed to a 7-day course. This is in keeping with the broader objective of avoiding antibiotic overuse. The NICE Guideline adds valuable evidence-based support for this action.

The topic of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in patients with respiratory failure due to CAP was evaluated for the NICE Guideline and a NICE research recommendation was made but no practice recommendation. This stance from NICE is similar to the tone of the BTS Guidelines which recommends that 'Neither non-invasive ventilation (NIV) nor continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) support is routinely indicated in the management of patients with respiratory failure due to CAP', and 'If a trial of non-invasive support is considered indicated in CAP, it must only be conducted in a critical care area where immediate expertise is available to enable a rapid transition to invasive ventilation'.

Many recommendations included in the BTS CAP Guideline covered topic areas that were not evaluated for the NICE Guideline. A review of the evidence base related to these recommendations is desirable in order to bring these recommendations up to date. In the meantime, these recommendations remain valid.

To help users clearly identify areas of overlap between the two guidelines, an annotated version of the BTS CAP Guideline has been produced and is available on the BTS website:

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^2046e0a7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Penicillin treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Denmark: a retrospective cohort study [^57de9523]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, the median duration of treatment with antibiotics was 10 days and 70% of patients received more than the maximum 8 days which is recommended by European guidelines for responding patients. Similarly, Reissig et al and the REACH study reported 11 and 10 days respectively. Duration of 10–11 days, however, exceeds recommendations in European and Danish guidelines. Danish guidelines recommend duration of 10–14 days only for patients with CURB-65 ≥ 3, which can explain extended treatment duration for a smaller fraction of the study population. Due to the retrospective nature, the unsystematic microbiological sampling, and the low proportion of positive microbiological findings, we cannot draw firm conclusion on significant risk factors for prolonged treatment duration.

Recent studies have shown that antibiotic treatment for 3–5 days for mild to moderate CAP does not impair effectiveness or safety. There is a need to focus on assessing alternative strategies to reduce antibiotic use in order to minimize the risk of adverse events and antibiotic resistance associated with extended duration of antibiotic therapy.

Comparing patients in the CAP-North cohort with other European CAP cohorts some differences were apparent. Compared with patients from the CAPNETZ cohort, our patients were older (mean age 72 versus 66), more frequently women (60% versus 47%), presented with more severe CAP (18% CURB-65 > 2 versus 4% CRB-65 > 2), and had a higher 30 days mortality (11% versus 4.3%). The differences could be due to our inclusion exclusively of hospitalized patients, as well as inclusion of all patients with severe CAP who are often challenging to include in a prospective study.

The major strength of this study is that we were able to identify all patients hospitalized and diagnosed with pneumonia in our region, due to our complete regional dataset. Our design did however not allow us to account for patients with CAP who were given an inaccurate ICD-10 code. We ensured that only patients with CAP were included by reviewing every patient-file for symptoms on admission, hospitalization within the last 28 days, and chest-x-ray for infiltrates. Moreover, the three hospitals cover both urban and rural areas of the capital region in Denmark and thus we believe our cohort to be representative of patients hospitalized with CAP in developed countries. Thus, our cohort represents a "real-life" population of patients hospitalized with CAP.

### Clinical efficacy of 3 days versus 5 days of oral amoxicillin for treatment of childhood pneumonia: a multicentre double-blind trial [^efb4f27c]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

For most infections, especially acute respiratory infections (ARIs), the recommended duration of therapy is not based on strong scientific or clinical criteria. Shorter courses of antibiotics for non-severe pneumonia would result in lower costs, enhance patient compliance, and might help to contain antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of 3-day and 5-day courses of amoxicillin in children with non-severe pneumonia.

Methods

We recruited 2000 children, aged 2–59 months, with non-severe pneumonia (WHO criteria) diagnosed in the outpatient departments of seven hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 days or 5 days of treatment with oral amoxicillin. The primary outcome was treatment failure. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Findings

We allocated 1000 children to 3 days of treatment and 1000 to 5 days. Treatment failed in 209 (21%) patients in the 3-day group, and in 202 (20%) in the 5-day group (difference 0.7%; 95% CI -1.8 to 3.2). In 12 (1%) children in the 3-day group and in 13 (1%) in the 5-day group the disease relapsed (difference 0.1%; -0.6 to 0.8). Treatment was more likely to fail in children who did not adhere to treatment (p < 0.0001), in those younger than 12 months (p < 0.0001), in those whose illness lasted for 3 days or longer (p = 0.004), in those whose respiratory rate was more than 10 breaths/min above the age-specific cut-off (p = 0.004), and in those with vomiting (p = 0.009). Non-adherence was also associated with failure of treatment in the 5-day group (p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Treatment with oral amoxicillin for 3-days was equally as effective as treatment for 5 days in children with non-severe pneumonia. The most important risk factor for treatment failure was non-compliance, which was also associated with longer duration of therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1388daf3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) empiric therapy — adults: we recommend that combination therapy with a β-lactam plus a macrolide or a β-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone should be the treatment of choice for patients with severe CAP, and both fluoroquinolone monotherapy and the combination of β-lactam plus doxycycline are not recommended as empiric therapy for adults with severe CAP.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c1275f1d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although bacteremia caused by intravascular catheters is often cited as the commonest cause of BSI in the critical care setting, we were unable to identify any prospective, randomized investigations examining the duration of antibiotic therapy for CRBSI. Recommendations for length of treatment from the current IDSA guidelines are based only on expert opinion and retrospective case series and call for 5 to 7 days for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 to 14 days for Enterococci and Gram-negative organisms, and 2 to 6 weeks for S. aureus. Trials are urgently needed, as this may be the syndrome most appropriate for shorter-course therapy given that the focus of infection is removable and thereby leaves no persisting infectious nidus for most patients.

The available trials randomly assigning patients with intra-abdominal infections to shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy were conducted in non-ICU settings and populations and explicitly excluded those with generalized secondary peritonitis or nosocomial infections. Equivalent outcomes for shorter- versus longer-duration therapy for SBP and localized intra-abdominal infection are in keeping with similar findings in a retrospective analysis of 929 patients with intra-abdominal infections, in which less than 7 days of therapy was not associated with higher complications or mortality. We have not uncovered evidence, though, of whether the effectiveness of short-duration therapy extends to patients with severe infections complicated by bacteremia or in those for whom source control cannot readily be achieved.

Several narrative reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of treating mild to moderate CAP with short-duration antibiotic therapy (5 to 7 days). The 13 studies of pneumonia identified for this review included 5 studies of CAP that provided the prevalence of bacteremia; in total, 80 patients with bacteremia were randomly assigned in equal numbers to short (3 to 7 days) and long (7 to 10 days) durations of therapy. Only three studies provided outcome data for bacteremic subgroups, and clinical cure was reported in 19 out of 21 patients (89.4%) receiving short-duration therapy (5 to 7 days) and in 17 out of 19 patients (90.4%) receiving extended therapy (7 to 10 days). These results provide a modicum of support for the growing consensus that CAP may be safely treated with shorter durations of therapy irrespective of the presence of bacteremia. Although a large VAP trial documented equivalent survival with shorter (8 days) versus longer (15 days) treatment, very few of these patients were bacteremic, and it is unclear whether shorter-duration treatment can be extended to this subgroup.

### Excess antibiotic treatment duration and adverse events in patients hospitalized with pneumonia: a multihospital cohort study [^4eaef665]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials demonstrate no benefit from antibiotic treatment exceeding the shortest effective duration.

Objective

To examine predictors and outcomes associated with excess duration of antibiotic treatment.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

43 hospitals in the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium.

Patients

6481 general care medical patients with pneumonia.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the rate of excess antibiotic treatment duration (excess days per 30-day period). Excess days were calculated by subtracting each patient's shortest effective (expected) treatment duration (based on time to clinical stability, pathogen, and pneumonia classification [community-acquired vs. health care-associated]) from the actual duration. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to calculate rate ratios to assess predictors of 30-day rates of excess duration. Patient outcomes, assessed at 30 days via the medical record and telephone calls, were evaluated using logit GEEs that adjusted for patient characteristics and probability of treatment.

Results

Two thirds (67.8% [4391 of 6481]) of patients received excess antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics prescribed at discharge accounted for 93.2% of excess duration. Patients who had respiratory cultures or nonculture diagnostic testing, had a longer stay, received a high-risk antibiotic in the prior 90 days, had community-acquired pneumonia, or did not have a total antibiotic treatment duration documented at discharge were more likely to receive excess treatment. Excess treatment was not associated with lower rates of any adverse outcomes, including death, readmission, emergency department visit, or Clostridioides difficile infection. Each excess day of treatment was associated with a 5% increase in the odds of antibiotic-associated adverse events reported by patients after discharge.

Limitation

Retrospective design; not all patients could be contacted to report 30-day outcomes.

Conclusion

Patients hospitalized with pneumonia often receive excess antibiotic therapy. Excess antibiotic treatment was associated with patient-reported adverse events. Future interventions should focus on whether reducing excess treatment and improving documentation at discharge improves outcomes.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^5a4450bd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

VAP duration of therapy — summary of evidence indicates that short courses of antibiotics (7–8 days) increased 28-day antibiotic-free days (mean difference, 4.0 days; 95% CI, 2.26–5.78 days) and reduced recurrent VAP due to MDR pathogens (42.1% vs 62.3%; OR, 0.44; 95% CI, .21–.95) compared with long courses (10–15 days), with no differences in mortality, recurrent pneumonia, treatment failure, hospital length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. In patients with VAP due to non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter (33% of patients), short courses were associated with recurrence (41.8% vs 24.7%; OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.14–4.16) but no mortality or other clinical differences, and a more recent and larger body of evidence comparing short-course vs long-course treatment found no differences in these outcomes.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^1605bed7]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Routine blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinary antigen testing are not beneficial in patients with nonsevere CAP.
- The Pneumonia Severity Index is recommended to determine the need for hospitalization, whereas the ATS/IDSA criteria for severe CAP are recommended to predict the need for intensive care.
- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or if he or she is being empirically treated for these pathogens; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days.

Lower respiratory tract samples from intubated patients with severe CAP should be sent for Gram stain and culture soon after intubation because of the higher risk of MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, and because endotracheal aspirates have a higher yield than sputum samples. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days. The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia.

Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes. Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^5cd42207]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^596f0b89]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the USA. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

### Systematic review on antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age [^664a104d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a force to reckon with, as it accounts for 1.1 million of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age globally, with disproportionately higher mortality occurring in the low and middle income-countries (LMICs) of Southeast Asia and Africa. Existing strategies to curb pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality have not effectively translated into meaningful control of pneumonia-related burden. In the present systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials conducted in LMICs to determine the most suitable antibiotic therapy for treating pneumonia (very severe, severe and non-severe). While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2–59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2–59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.

### Treatment of severe hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review of inclusion and judgment criteria used in randomized controlled trials [^9250e0c0]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) are often selected for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) aiming at new drug approval. Guidelines for the design of such RCTs have been repeatedly updated by regulatory agencies. We hypothesized that large variability in the enrolled populations, the endpoints assessed and the HAP/VAP definition criteria may impact the results of these studies, and addressed this through a systematic review of HAP/VAP RCTs.

Methods

A search (Pubmed-Embase-ICAAC-ECCMID) of all RCTs published between 1994 and 2016 comparing antimicrobial treatment for HAP/VAP in the intensive care unit was conducted. The populations enrolled, inclusion/exclusion criteria, statistical design and endpoints assessed were recorded. All unpublished RCTs recorded on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were also screened.

Results

From the 93 abstracts reviewed, 39 potentially relevant studies were inspected, leading to 27 studies being included. As expected, illness severity or the proportion with VAP (27–100%) differed greatly among the enrolled populations. The HAP/VAP definition used various clinical and biological criteria, and only 55% of studies required a microbiological sample. The mandatory duration of prior hospital stay was variable; the mechanical ventilation duration was an inclusion criterion in only 41% of VAP studies. Nine studies had non-inferiority design, but nine studies (33%) did not have a pre-specified statistical hypothesis. Clinical cure was the primary endpoint in 24 studies, but was recorded in several populations or as the co-primary endpoint in 13 studies. The definition of clinical cure and the timing of its assessment greatly differed. This variability slightly improved over time but remained significant in the 13 registered but currently unpublished RCTs that we screened.

Conclusion

Our study provides a description of populations and endpoints of RCTs evaluating antimicrobials for treatment of HAP/VAP in the ICU. There was significant heterogeneity in enrollment criteria, endpoints and statistical design, which may influence the ability of studies to demonstrate differences between studied drugs.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^8afb1417]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, the use of certain biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT) has been shown to be useful in reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment. Moreover, there is strong evidence that support the idea that biomarkers at admission, such as proadrenomedullin, can predict worse outcome not only al early, but also at late follow-up. Recently, our working group published the positive results of a clinical trial designed to validate the IDSA / ATS criteria on the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients admitted for CAP. The median number of days with antibiotic in the control group was 10 as opposed to 5 in the intervention group, while the short-term clinical cure rate was similar for both groups. However, the impact that such a reduction may have on the long-term prognosis of these patients, as well as its effect on systemic inflammation, remains unknown.

The goal of the present study is to assess the impact in the long term of a reduction of antibiotic treatment in patients admitted for CAP. The method was to evaluate complications that occurred up to 1 year later in patients that had been included in a clinical trial for the validation of the IDSA / ATS criteria for the duration of antibiotic treatment.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^4c721eae]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Multicentre cohort study which evaluated complications after 1 year follow-up in patients who had previously been included in a randomized clinical trial on the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients admitted for CAP. In the clinical trial intervention group, antibiotic treatment was prescribed for a minimum of 5 days and was suspended if for 48 h the temperature was ≤ 37.8 °C and there was no more than 1 sign of clinical instability as defined by Halm's clinical stability criteria. If stability was not reached by day 5, antibiotic was stopped whenever all criteria were met, as Halm criteria were assessed every day. In the control group, the doctor decided on the duration of the antibiotic treatment. In both, control and intervention groups, antibiotic type was chosen empirically by physicians according to local clinical guidelines. The follow-up period of the original clinical trial patients was 30 days, while the present study extended the follow-up period from 30 days to 1 year.

All patients were informed about the study and asked to give their informed consent. The project was approved by the Basque Country Ethics Committee (2011–001067–51).

Study patients

All adult patients (≥ 18 years) admitted for CAP and included in the clinical trial were included. Pneumonia was defined as a pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray not known to be old, and with symptoms indicative of pneumonia, such as cough, dyspnea, fever, and / or pleural pain. All patients previously excluded from the clinical trial due to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus were excluded, as well as the immunosuppressed (those with organ transplants or with splenectomy, those treated with 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for more than 30 days or with other immunosuppressive agents, neutropenic patients), those hospitalized in the previous 14 days, patients who received prior antibiotic treatment in the previous 30 days and institutionalized patients.

The study also excluded cases of pneumonia caused by infrequent agents (eg P.aeruginosa, S. aureus), infectious processes that required prolonged treatment with antibiotics (i.e. bacterial endocarditis, abscesses), pneumonia with pleural effusion that required drainage, those who died or who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit before randomization and those who did not give their informed consent.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^4a4a6ea2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on long-term prognosis in patients hospitalized with CAP.

Methods

This was a multicenter study assessing complications developed during 1 year of patients previously hospitalized with CAP who had been included in a randomized clinical trial concerning the duration of antibiotic treatment. Mortality at 90days, at 180days and at 1year was analyzed, as well as new admissions and cardiovascular complications. A subanalysis was carried out in one of the hospitals by measuring C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and proadrenomedullin (proADM) at admission, at day 5 and at day 30.

Results

A total of 312 patients were included, 150 in the control group and 162 in the intervention group. Ninetyday, 180day and 1-year mortality in the per-protocol analysis were 8 (2.57%), 10 (3.22%) and 14 (4.50%), respectively. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of 1-year mortality (p = 0.94), new admissions (p = 0.84) or cardiovascular events (p = 0.33). No differences were observed between biomarker level differences from day 5 to day 30 (CRP p = 0.29; PCT p = 0.44; proADM p = 0.52).

Conclusions

Reducing antibiotic treatment in hospitalized patients with CAP based on clinical stability criteria is safe, without leading to a greater number of long-term complications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^2f918f33]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Guideline-based clinical assessment versus procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in pneumonia: a pragmatic randomized trial [^00a2855a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Efforts to reduce unnecessary and unnecessarily long antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia have been attempted through use of procalcitonin and through guidelines based on serial clinical assessment. Our aim is to compare guideline-based clinical assessment- and procalcitonin algorithm-guided antibiotic use among patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

We performed a pragmatic, randomized, multicenter trial from November 2012 to April 2015 at 12 French hospitals. We included emergency department (ED) patients older than 18 years with community-acquired pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the procalcitonin-guided or clinical assessment group. In accordance with past studies, we hypothesized that serial clinical assessment would be superior to procalcitonin-guided care. The primary outcome was antibiotic duration, and secondary outcomes included rates of antibiotic duration less than or equal to 5 days, and clinical success and combined serious adverse outcomes at 30 days in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Of 370 eligible patients, 285 (77%) were randomly assigned to either clinical assessment- (n = 143) or procalcitonin-guided care (n = 142). Median age was 67 years (range 18 to 93 years) and 40% of patients were deemed to have Pneumonia Severity Index class IV or V. Procalcitonin algorithm adherence was 76%. Antibiotic duration was not significantly different between clinical assessment- and procalcitonin-guided groups (median 9 versus 10 days, respectively). Clinical success rate was 92% in each group and serious adverse outcome rates were similar (15% versus 20%, respectively).

Conclusion

Guideline-based serial clinical assessment did not reduce antibiotic exposure compared with procalcitonin-guided care among ED patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The strategies were similar in terms of duration of antibiotic use and clinical outcomes.

### Penicillin treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Denmark: a retrospective cohort study [^a088c19a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a severe infection, with high mortality. Antibiotic strategies for CAP differ across Europe.

The objective of the study was to describe the epidemiology of CAP in Denmark and evaluate the prognosis of patients empirically treated with penicillin-G/V monotherapy.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study including hospitalized patients with x-ray confirmed CAP. We calculated the population-based incidence, reviewed types of empiric antibiotics and duration of antibiotic treatment. We evaluated the association between mortality and treatment with empiric penicillin-G/V using logistic regression analysis.

Results

We included 1320 patients. The incidence of hospitalized CAP was 3.1/1000 inhabitants. Median age was 71 years (IQR; 58–81) and in-hospital mortality was 8%. Median duration of antibiotic treatment was 10 days (IQR; 8–12). In total 45% were treated with penicillin-G/V as empiric monotherapy and they did not have a higher mortality compared to patients treated with broader-spectrum antibiotics (OR 0.92, CI 95% 0.55–1.53).

Conclusion

The duration of treatment exceeded recommendations in European guidelines. Empiric monotherapy with penicillin-G/V was commonly used and not associated with increased mortality in patients with mild to moderate pneumonia. Our results are in agreement with current conservative antibiotic strategy as outlined in the Danish guidelines.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^6662c42d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship

Ideally, antibiotic stewardship in ICUs should include the rapid identification of bacterial etiology, optimization of treatment based on PK/PD characteristics of the antibiotic(s), avoidance of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics, shortening of treatment duration, and reduction in the number of patients receiving antibiotic therapy for non-infectious syndromes. To achieve this, ICUs should continuously collect data and adjust prescribing of beta-lactam backbone antibiotics according to their local resistance patterns. Delayed appropriate therapy is consistently associated with worse outcomes. In contrast, early and appropriate empiric broad-spectrum therapy, followed by de-escalation, is generally associated with improved clinical outcomes for pneumonia. To achieve adequate therapy, it is necessary to select the correct antibiotic(s), an optimal dose, and the correct route of administration (oral, IV, or aerosol) to ensure antibiotic penetration to the site of infection.

Guidelines advise that de-escalation of antibiotics be considered once information is available on the results of lower respiratory tract cultures and the patient's clinical response. A meta-analysis that included three studies in patients with VAP showed that, in some patients, the use of short-course (2- to 3-day) therapy as a de-escalation approach (compared with prolonged-course therapy) was not associated with an increase in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or hospital stay, particularly in those not infected with non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. While the optimal length of antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli remains an unsolved issue, clinicians should strive to stop therapy as soon as possible.

De-escalation of therapy may be guided by scores such as the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 81 patients with a CPIS of less than 6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (at discretion of physician) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy, with re-evaluation at day 3; ciprofloxacin was discontinued if CPIS remained less than 6 at day 3. Mortality, length of ICU stay, and development of resistance did not differ significantly between treatments, actually favoring the ciprofloxacin monotherapy arm.

Biomarkers offer an alternative method to shorten duration of therapy. Several large randomized trials in critically ill patients of antibiotic duration based on falling procalcitonin levels have demonstrated that this approach can safely shorten duration without adverse consequences. HAP/VAP were common types of infection in these studies.

### What can we learn from the time course of untreated and partially treated community-onset Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia? A clinical perspective on superiority and noninferiority trial designs for mild community-acquired pneumonia [^512da182]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

There are no well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trials in the recent era that precisely define the magnitude of the drug effect of antimicrobial therapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, there is evidence that ineffective therapies, selected on the basis of the ratio of 24-h area under the concentration curve to minimum inhibitory concentration, associated with a discordant (nonsusceptible in vitro) specific agent (or no therapy) for mild CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased risk of progression to serious CAP. The relatively high rate of clinical success associated with appropriate antimicrobial treatment of mild CAP renders a standard outcome measure of clinical success an unlikely way to differentiate new agents. However, there may be an advantage in composite outcome assessments for mild CAP. Composite-outcomes end points that include time to resolution of morbidity, the use of patient reported-outcomes instruments, and biomarkers are recommended for future studies. Because the composite rate of success in recent randomized clinical trials exceeds 90%, it would seem that a noninferiority margin of 10% is reasonable for trials for mild CAP.

### How should we dose antibiotics for pneumonia in the ICU? [^f243f74e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia continues to be a common reason for, or complication of, ICU admission. Associated morbidity and mortality remain high, with an increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, both in terms of spectrum of cover and dose, remains the cornerstone of effective management.

Recent Findings

Critically ill patients will frequently manifest significantly altered end-organ function, as compared with an ambulatory or ward-based setting. Such changes can have profound effects on antibiotic drug handling, promoting subtherapeutic concentrations, treatment failure or the selection of resistant organisms. Standard antibiotic regimens typically fail to consider such issues, with recent literature highlighting the need for improved dosing to achieve sufficient intrapulmonary concentrations, particularly in the setting of augmented elimination. Although recent clinical trials utilizing strategies that optimize drug exposure (either through the use of agents with improved penetration, or continuous infusions) demonstrate superior surrogate outcomes, a mortality benefit is still uncertain.

Summary

Antibiotic dosing strategies that are adapted to a critical care environment are urgently needed, both to improve clinical outcomes and ensure therapeutic longevity. Similarly, study protocols investigating emerging antibiotics must also be designed accordingly, to prevent potential setbacks in drug availability.

### Implementation of an evidence-based guideline to reduce duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^a593a6d0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with pneumonia often remain hospitalized after they are stable clinically, and the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is a rate-limiting step for discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether implementation of an evidence-based guideline would reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with pneumonia.

Methods

In a seven-site, cluster randomized clinical trial, we enrolled 325 control and 283 intervention patients who were admitted by one of 116 physician groups. Within site, physician groups were assigned randomly to receive a practice guideline alone (control arm) or a practice guideline that was implemented using a multifaceted strategy (intervention arm). The effectiveness of guideline implementation was measured by the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay; differences in the rates of discontinuation and hospital discharge were assessed with proportional hazards models. Medical outcomes were assessed at 30 days.

Results

Intravenous antibiotic therapy was discontinued somewhat more quickly in the intervention group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.52; P = 0.06) than in the control group. Intervention patients were discharged more quickly, but the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.38; P = 0.11). Fewer intervention (55% [157/283]) than control (63% [206/325]) patients had medical complications during the index hospitalization (P = 0.04), with no differences in other medical outcomes, including mortality, rehospitalization, and return to usual activities, between treatment arms.

Conclusions

The multifaceted guideline implementation strategy resulted in a slight reduction in the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and a nonsignificant reduction in length of stay, without affecting patient outcomes.

### New biomarkers for respiratory infections [^9804feba]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although pneumonia, either community or hospital-acquired, is the most frequent severe respiratory infection, it is an infection difficult to diagnose. At present, the diagnosis of pneumonia relies on a combination of clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic criteria. However, these criteria are far from perfect leading to uncertainty in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and choice of antibiotic therapy. Biomarkers have been used to bring additional information in this setting.

Recent Findings

The aim of this review is to provide a clear overview of the current evidence for biomarkers to distinguish between patients in several clinical scenarios: to exclude pneumonia in order to withhold antibiotics, to identify the causative pathogen to target antimicrobial treatment, to identify phenotypes of inflammatory response to facilitate adjunctive treatments, to stratify the risk of severe pneumonia and provide the adequate level of care, and to monitor treatment response and de-escalate antibiotic therapy.

Summary

In recent years the number of new biomarkers increased markedly in different areas like pathogen identification or host response. Although far from the ideal, there are several promising areas that could represent true evolutions in the management of pneumonia, in the near future.

### Do we need new trials of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy? A response [^8bed6242]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment needs to be short, appropriate (focused on the right pathogen), and adequate (at the right dosage). And still, many physicians treat patients for too long. A recent meta-analysis on procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic treatment in acute respiratory infections showed that antibiotics could be shortened form 8.1 to 5.7 days. The key question is, why do physicians treat for so long? The answer may be fear! Fear of undertreatment.

We read with great interest the commentary by Lisboa and colleagues in Critical Care in which they question the clinical utility of this meta-analysis. They concluded that populations in previous trials were not receiving best care, had less adherence to PCT algorithms, and lacked information on specific conditions and populations. As authors of the largest study included in this meta-analysis, the Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin guidance Study (SAPS), we want to respond. SAPS was a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands with 1546 adult ICU patients with antibiotics for a presumed infection. We demonstrated a highly significant reduction in initial antibiotic duration (5.0 vs 7.0 days). The median duration of antibiotic treatment (DOT) in the control group of the total population was 7 days (interquartile range (IQR) 4–11 days). Of these patients, 65% had a presumed pulmonary infection. Dutch national guidelines recommend an antibiotic duration for moderate-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of 5 days. No such advice exists for severe pneumonia admitted to the ICU. The median DOT in the control group in CAP was 7 days (IQR 4–10 days), 6 days (IQR 4–10 days) in hospital-acquired pneumonia and 7 days (IQR 5–11 days) in ventilator-associated pneumonia. The wide IQR suggests that physicians are reluctant to trust guidelines and prefer to prolong antibiotic treatment if they believe it is necessary. Moreover, physicians may perform even better in clinical trials, because they know they are being watched, commonly referred to as the "Hawthorne effect". In SAPS the patients were already on antibiotics. When a PCT-stopping criterion was reached antibiotics were stopped in 53% of the patients within 48 h. It was a stopping advice. Sensitivity and specificity are not high enough to withhold antibiotics on PCT alone. And indeed, PCT is no holy grail. Like other biomarkers, there are numerous non-infectious inflammatory processes, i.e. trauma, surgery, and acute kidney injury, in which PCT can be elevated. But such conditions were well balanced between both groups.
