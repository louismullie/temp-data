## Question

Fibromyalgia management guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fibromyalgia management guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and how it shapes management. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide care. Next, I will examine nonpharmacologic first-line strategies, followed by pharmacologic options and how to sequence them. After that, I need to check special populations and follow-up cadence. Finally, I will integrate emerging evidence and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with explicit citations and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation because management hinges on it. Fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis of chronic widespread pain for at least 3 months with associated symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive complaints, and it is not a diagnosis of exclusion; limited labs (CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, CK) can screen for mimics, but routine imaging is not indicated unless new red flags arise, and the 2010/2016 ACR criteria are commonly used to standardize diagnosis and severity scoring [^24fd937c] [^6f1f9d96] [^419b5505] [^ffd1a966].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before establishing principles. I need to ensure the plan aligns with core guidance: prioritize improving health-related quality of life via a multidisciplinary, individualized approach; start with nonpharmacologic therapies; escalate to pharmacotherapy based on symptom severity and patient preference; and use shared decision-making with explicit goals and metrics for response, reassessing risk–benefit at each step [^358b5f11] [^64ad4357] [^0bc6acc6] [^8fb8ae8f].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic first-line strategies and verify the strength of evidence. Education that validates the diagnosis, explains central sensitization, and sets realistic expectations is foundational; aerobic exercise (land or aquatic) and strength/flexibility training improve pain, function, and quality of life; cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction help pain, mood, and coping; and multicomponent programs combining exercise with psychological strategies are reasonable when available, with tai chi showing durable benefits in RCTs and EULAR endorsing several complementary modalities for select patients [^395490ed] [^d30a075a] [^9a770153] [^5d641db7] [^96c8bd59].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic hierarchy so I don't overstate benefits. For pain, duloxetine and milnacipran (SNRIs) have the most consistent evidence and are FDA-approved; pregabalin has moderate benefit and is FDA-approved; low-dose tricyclics such as amitriptyline can help pain and sleep but have more adverse effects and require caution in older adults; tramadol may be considered short term for severe flares if no contraindications; strong opioids are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and substantial harms; NSAIDs are not effective for fibromyalgia pain and should be avoided for this indication; and combination therapy can be used judiciously, targeting the most bothersome symptoms with attention to interactions [^3d32367e] [^048967bf] [^3877e4cd] [^b0bd1934] [^37f16a23] [^9a0e7f50] [^c680a3ec].

> I should double-check sleep-specific management because it is a frequent driver of distress. Amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and pregabalin can improve sleep in fibromyalgia, and recent network meta-analyses suggest land-based aerobic exercise combined with flexibility or aquatic exercise may also improve sleep quality; CBT-I is reasonable when insomnia persists, though evidence in fibromyalgia is evolving and not as robust as in primary insomnia populations [^7671c059] [^51865282] [^100c5332].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overgeneralize. Primary care is the appropriate hub for most patients, with rheumatology or pain referrals for diagnostic uncertainty or refractory cases; in pediatrics, emphasize reassurance, school participation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation with exercise and CBT; in older adults, avoid tricyclics with anticholinergic burden and fall risk, and start low and go slow with any new medication; in veterans or those with chronic multisymptom illness, VA/DoD guidance supports exercise, SNRIs, pregabalin, CBT, and mindfulness, while advising against NSAIDs and recommending acupuncture or tai chi as adjuncts [^25c16c39] [^b059e3f4] [^4ed74a62] [^e9530eca] [^077a3d08].

> I need to ensure follow-up is structured and measurable. Early visits should be more frequent to stabilize symptoms and reinforce self-management; track patient-defined goals and functional outcomes using simple tools like the Brief Pain Inventory or Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; and reassess the risk–benefit of medications regularly, discontinuing ineffective agents and avoiding therapeutic inertia; encourage work participation and address occupational barriers when present [^2669bfa4] [^90b20995] [^23ef486a] [^aed1227c].

> But wait, what about emerging evidence that might shift practice. Recent data suggest pain-sensitizing IgG autoantibodies may contribute in a subset, prompting research priorities for targeted immunotherapies, though no clinical autoantibody test or immunotherapy is ready for routine care; gut microbiome hypotheses are intriguing but preliminary; and updated sleep-focused meta-analyses reinforce exercise and selected pharmacologics for sleep, while highlighting the need for higher-quality, longer-duration trials [^fc66d902] [^9fa8699f] [^a47c817f] [^51865282] [^100c5332].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check each step against guidelines. Start with education and confirmation of diagnosis, screen for comorbid mood, sleep, and overlapping pain conditions, and set measurable goals; initiate nonpharmacologic therapy with exercise, CBT or mindfulness, and sleep hygiene; if inadequate response after a 6–12 week trial, add one pharmacologic agent matched to the dominant symptom (duloxetine or milnacipran for pain/mood, pregabalin for pain/sleep, low-dose amitriptyline for sleep/pain with caution); reassess at 6–12 weeks and switch or combine if partial response; reserve tramadol for short-term severe flares and avoid strong opioids; throughout, maintain multidisciplinary coordination, address psychosocial contributors, and taper ineffective treatments to minimize polypharmacy [^358b5f11] [^395490ed] [^3d32367e] [^37f16a23].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways so the clinician can act confidently. Nonpharmacologic therapies are first-line and should be sustained; pharmacotherapy offers modest average benefits and must be individualized to the most bothersome symptoms; strong opioids and routine NSAIDs are not indicated for fibromyalgia; and iterative reassessment with shared decision-making is essential to sustain function and quality of life over time [^64ad4357] [^3d32367e] [^37f16a23] [^9a0e7f50] [^358b5f11].

---

Fibromyalgia management should be **multidisciplinary and individualized**, with **nonpharmacologic care first-line** (education, exercise, CBT, mindfulness) and pharmacotherapy reserved for persistent symptoms [^358b5f11] [^64ad4357]. Duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and low-dose tricyclics are **first-line drugs** for pain, sleep, or mood symptoms; avoid strong opioids and routine NSAIDs [^3d32367e] [^b0bd1934] [^37f16a23] [^9a0e7f50]. Set patient-centered goals, monitor function and quality of life, and adjust therapy based on response and tolerability [^8fb8ae8f] [^90b20995].

---

## General principles of management

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Combine nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies tailored to symptoms, function, and patient preferences [^358b5f11] [^395490ed].
- **Patient-centered care**: Use shared decision-making and set individualized goals for function and quality of life [^8fb8ae8f] [^90b20995].
- **Graduated treatment**: Start with nonpharmacologic therapies and add medications only if symptoms persist or are severe [^0bc6acc6] [^64ad4357].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

Nonpharmacologic therapies are **strongly recommended** as first-line management:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Patient education | High | Strongly recommended |
| Aerobic exercise | High | Strongly recommended |
| Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) | High | Strongly recommended |
| Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) | Moderate | Strongly recommended |
| Multicomponent therapy (e.g. exercise + CBT) | Moderate | Strongly recommended |
| Acupuncture, hydrotherapy, tai chi, qigong | Moderate | Conditionally recommended |

---

## Pharmacologic interventions (second-line)

Pharmacotherapy is **reserved for persistent symptoms** despite nonpharmacologic care:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) | - Duloxetine <br/> - Milnacipran | Pain, mood, fatigue | High |
| Gabapentinoids | - Pregabalin <br/> - Gabapentin | Pain, sleep | High |
| Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) | - Amitriptyline <br/> - Cyclobenzaprine | Pain, sleep | Moderate |
| Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) | - Fluoxetine <br/> - Paroxetine | Mood, pain | Moderate |

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

- **Strong opioids**: Not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant risks [^37f16a23] [^4ed74a62].
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Not recommended for fibromyalgia-specific pain [^9a0e7f50].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Avoid due to dependence and cognitive effects.
- **Glucocorticoids**: Not recommended.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should **assess pain, function, mood, sleep, and patient goals** [^bc56f509] [^90b20995]. Adjust therapy based on response, tolerability, and patient preferences [^358b5f11] [^8fb8ae8f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Comorbidities**: Address depression, anxiety, and other chronic pain conditions [^383ad52c] [^7a5350c1].
- **Pregnancy**: Prefer nonpharmacologic therapies; avoid teratogenic medications.
- **Elderly**: Use caution with TCAs and gabapentinoids due to sedation and fall risk [^4ed74a62].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging areas include **gut microbiome modulation**, personalized medicine, and novel neuromodulatory approaches, though evidence remains preliminary [^a47c817f] [^fc66d902].

---

Fibromyalgia management should be **multidisciplinary**, with nonpharmacologic therapies first-line and pharmacotherapy added selectively. Regular reassessment and shared decision-making are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Canadian Pain Society and Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^8f162cf1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Methods

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient followup were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and following review were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

Results

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with a pivotal symptom of body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and not requiring specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigation may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should be reduction of symptoms, but also improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested, and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. Outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern and any culture of disablement should be discouraged.

Conclusion

These guidelines should provide the health community with reassurance for the global care of patients with FM with the aim of improving patient outcome by reducing symptoms and maintaining function.

### Management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^d091cdd4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The optimal management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is unclear and comprehensive evidence-based guidelines have not been reported.

Objective

To provide up-to-date evidence-based guidelines for the optimal treatment of FMS. DATA SOURCES, SELECTION, AND EXTRACTION: A search of all human trials (randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials) of FMS was made using Cochrane Collaboration Reviews (1993–2004), MEDLINE (1966–2004), CINAHL (1982–2004), EMBASE (1988–2004), PubMed (1966–2004), Healthstar (1975–2000), Current Contents (2000–2004), Web of Science (1980–2004), PsychInfo (1887–2004), and Science Citation Indexes (1996–2004). The literature review was performed by an interdisciplinary panel, composed of 13 experts in various pain management disciplines, selected by the American Pain Society (APS), and supplemented by selected literature reviews by APS staff members and the Utah Drug Information Service. A total of 505 articles were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

There are major limitations to the FMS literature, with many treatment trials compromised by short duration and lack of masking. There are no medical therapies that have been specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for management of FMS. Nonetheless, current evidence suggests efficacy of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and patient education. A number of other commonly used FMS therapies, such as trigger point injections, have not been adequately evaluated.

Conclusions

Despite the chronicity and complexity of FMS, there are pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions available that have clinical benefit. Based on current evidence, a stepwise program emphasizing education, certain medications, exercise, cognitive therapy, or all 4 should be recommended.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^11aafc7c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia 18 years ago, there have been an ever-increasing number of research articles and reviews. From the National Library of Medicine alone there are more than 10,000 articles related to fibromyalgia. The major clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia have not changed, but their prevalence, associations, relative importance to the patient, and scientific underpinnings are increasingly better understood. This article provides an update on fibromyalgia symptomatology and looks at issues that need to be considered in the development of updated diagnostic guidelines. There is still no gold standard for making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but there is an increasing consensus for the development of new guidelines for diagnosis that modifies the currently proscribed tender point evaluation.

### A symptom-based approach to pharmacologic management of fibromyalgia [^1b500e9a]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by widespread pain along with numerous other symptoms, including fatigue, poor sleep, mood disorders, and stiffness. Previous guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia recommended an approach that integrates pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies selected according to the symptoms experienced by individual patients. However, they offered no recommendations for a system of patient assessment that would provide a basis for individualized treatment selection. We present a simple, rapid and easily remembered system for symptom quantitation and pharmacologic management of fibromyalgia that combines visual analogue scale symptom scores from a modified form of the disease-neutral Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, with a review of medications that can be used to treat the individual symptoms. This symptom-based approach is amenable to caring for patients with fibromyalgia in a busy clinical practice.

### Fibromyalgia: a clinical review [^a708fb08]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Fibromyalgia is present in as much as 2% to 8% of the population, is characterized by widespread pain, and is often accompanied by fatigue, memory problems, and sleep disturbances.

Objective

To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia.

Evidence Review

The medical literature on fibromyalgia was reviewed from 1955 to March 2014 via MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, with an emphasis on meta-analyses and contemporary evidence-based treatment guidelines. Treatment recommendations are based on the most recent evidence-based guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society and graded from 1 to 5 based on the level of available evidence.

Findings

Numerous treatments are available for managing fibromyalgia that are supported by high-quality evidence. These include nonpharmacological therapies (education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological therapies (tricyclics, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids).

Conclusions and Relevance

Fibromyalgia and other "centralized" pain states are much better understood now than ever before. Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances. Effective treatment for fibromyalgia is now possible.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management for the primary healthcare provider [^0136f7bf]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain affecting 2% of the general population, with an increased frequency in women. Clinical diagnosis relies on history and research-supported tender point criteria. As in other chronic pain syndromes, a multidimensional approach optimizes treatment response. Empirical data and consensus support the use of nonpharmacological modalities, such as education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy, in the management of fibromyalgia. Evidence-supported pharmacological interventions include tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alpha-2-delta ligands, and other serotonergic-noradrenergic analgesic agents, such as tramadol. This paper offers the primary healthcare provider a systematic approach to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and management strategies based on available evidence, consensus, and empirical data.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^51865282]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fibromyalgia is a complex, heterogeneous conditionthat affects 2% to 3% of the global population. In the absence of a cure, a range of treatments are offered to alleviate symptoms. Most people with fibromyalgia complain about sleep problems. Fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems are poorly managed, and after an initial diagnosis, people continue to seek help to improve their sleep for many years.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

This systematic review and network meta‐analysis provides a comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis of randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems.
A wide range of interventions, especially nonpharmacologic interventions, have been tested in fibromyalgia trials with very low‐to‐moderate certainty regarding effectiveness.
Our results indicate that engaging in some forms of exercise — such as land‐based aerobic exercise training in combination with flexibility training and aquatic‐based aerobic exercise training — may improve sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia.
Certain pharmacologic interventions may also be effective in improving sleep but not without side effects.

The 2015 European guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia considered sleep as a key outcome of interest. Although general recommendations were made for interventions to manage sleep, these were graded as "weak" due to a paucity of published evidence at that time. Additionally, sleep was not the primary focus of the guidelines. Previously published evidence reviews informed the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) draft guidelines for the management of chronic pain; however, these cluster a wide range of conditions (including osteoarthritis, mechanical back pain, and fibromyalgia) and do not have a specific focus on sleep. Given the number of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field since 2015, the objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive evidence synthesis and network meta‐analysis (NMA) to assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for the management of fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^fb92e116]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Comprehensive search of the professional literature — systematic review currency and scope decisions are specified as follows: IOM (2011a) standards require the use of one or more systematic reviews for guideline development, and the panel aimed to use reviews that are at most 3 years old so that the reviews are not more than 5 years old at the time of approval and publication, given that a systematic review is considered outdated after 5 years. For the current guideline, the panel used a systematic review of noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic noncancer pain, then, after reviewing public comments and identified systematic reviews, it decided to exclude headaches and also excluded fibromyalgia as outside the scope of the guideline. Due to gaps in comparisons, approaches, and outcomes in the first review, two more reviews were identified and used, and the panel followed best practices of using reviews current within the past 5 years.

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^da57b47c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach should be individualized for each patient, depending on the severity of the patient's pain, the presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and the degree of functional impairment. The management of fibromyalgia includes the identification and treatment of all pain sources that may be present in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g., comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g., comorbid irritable bowel syndrome). It is also important to address other symptoms or disorders that commonly occur in patients with fibromyalgia, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, the treatment should strive to improve the patient's function and global health status. In most cases, the management of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized, controlled trials for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^127d2f83]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is estimated to affect one in five adults worldwide. It is associated with considerable disability and a significant impact on daily activities and quality of life. Fibromyalgia, a primary chronic pain disorder, is diagnosed on the basis of a history of widespread pain and severity of somatic symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, cognitive symptoms, headaches, depression and pain or cramps in the lower abdomen. The prevalence of fibromyalgia has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5.0%, with females being nine times more likely to develop the syndrome than males.

Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, and has been estimated to be associated with $7.2 billion in annual direct costs in Canada. Fibromyalgia also has a substantial economic impact, accounting for $C2298–$C3804 per patient in annual direct costs and weeks worth of annual employment and household productivity losses. The annual healthcare costs of patients with fibromyalgia have been estimated to be $C493 higher than age, sex and geographically matched controls.

The most recent 2012 Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Fibromyalgia Syndrome recommend that the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia be concentrated in the primary care setting. Although a majority of primary care providers (PCPs) (63%) manage patients with fibromyalgia after diagnosis, 37% of PCPs refer patients with fibromyalgia to a specialist, typically a rheumatologist, for diagnosis.

Rheumatologists are central to the treatment and management of inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune conditions. However, the number of patients with inflammatory arthritis has doubled between 1996 and 2010, and is expected to double again over the next 30 years, with no proportional increase in the number of practising rheumatologists. In addition, delayed access to rheumatologists has been extensively recognised as a barrier to providing adequate care for rheumatological diseases, particularly with inflammatory arthritis in which early intervention improves clinical outcomes. With the rising population-based disease burden, identified shortage of rheumatologists in Canada and wait times exceeding target benchmarks, there is an urgent need for a strategic approach to the planning and delivery of rheumatology care.

Scope of this Guideline — evidence base and applicability — states that this CPG is based on published clinical evidence and related information available through April 7, 2020, and is not intended to serve as a standard of care (SOC). In developing this CPG, the Work Group reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and systematic reviews (SRs). Given the limited number of studies on CMI alone, the Work Group considered evidence-based treatments for CMI and CMI-like conditions (fibromyalgia (FMS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS]); effective treatments for CMI-like conditions may help some patients with CMI; however, the extent to which treatments for CMI-like conditions are generalizable to CMI remains unclear. The guideline may have some relevance to conditions with multiple chronic symptoms and functional limitations, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the recommendations may apply to such patients and are likely to be a helpful adjunct to current guidelines for the management of mTBI, PTSD, and major depressive disorder (MDD), especially when patients report multiple chronic symptoms not readily explained by these or other health conditions.

### Treatments for enhancing sleep quality in fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7671c059]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia is a debilitating chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain accompanied by sleep difficulties, cognitive impairment, mood disturbance and fatigue. Sleep disturbance is central to fibromyalgia, and the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership emphasizes the importance of improving management of sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia. However, current clinical guidance for the management of sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia lacks clear consensus. The most recent EULAR guidance recommends meditative movement, amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine and pregabalin to improve sleep in the context of fibromyalgia. However, apart from amitriptyline, none of these therapies were recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2021 guidelines for the management of chronic pain (NG193), and further research on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) was encouraged.

CBT-based approaches have a substantial evidence base to support their effectiveness in improving quality of life, physical and mental health for people living with a range of physical and psychological health problems, but its effectiveness at improving sleep in fibromyalgia is less certain.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the current evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological and CBT therapies in improving sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia.

Subsequent PtC focus on pharmacological management. A limited evidence base was available for the EULAR defined D2T-RA population specifically. Nevertheless, where third/fourth line targeted disease modifying pharmacotherapy is indicated, tocilizumab and emergent data on Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) have been shown to be more effective than placebo. This contrasts with other bDMARDs (TNFi, abatacept and rituximab) that lack such evidence. A specific PtC also advises on the benefits of selecting higher dose drug (where such dose choice is an option and not precluded by comorbidity and safety concerns). This applies currently only to intravenous tocilizumab and baricitinib (with higher dose tofacitinib not an approved dose).

The other key factor that influences treatment decision in RA generally and this group in particular, is co-morbidity and specific safety concerns around certain therapeutics. While the PtC emphasise the limited evidence base, they highlight clinical scenarios where we have existing guidelines to inform drug selection — such as hepatitis B and C, and pregnancy. In line with the EULAR RA management guidelines, caution of tsDMARD JAKi use and risk of VTE was emphasised. The draft 2022 update of the EULAR Recommendations on the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis advise evaluation of pertinent risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease when conisdering JAKi in individual treatment decision.

Finally, non-pharmacological management strategies are included, particularly for patients where an absence of inflammation, residual pain and secondary fibromyalgia are key drivers. Education, self-management and psychological interventions are advised to enable (1) better shared decision making between the patient and rheumatologist on the appropriate target of treatment, thus minimising risk of 'mismatch' in expectations (2) improved patient symptom profile and (3) effective coping strategies.

The PtC, therefore, advise a systematic approach to diagnose and assess D2T-RA more accurately before cycling and intensifying DMARD.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^7a5350c1]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia have muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination; laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders. Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Multidisciplinary care and stepwise treatment for fibromyalgia [^fa2d7977]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and common comorbidity with psychiatric and medical disorders. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms. The development of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary disease management strategy is a difficult but essential challenge facing clinicians treating patients with fibromyalgia.

### Self-management interventions for chronic widespread pain including fibromyalgia: a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis [^8941297f]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is diagnosed when persistent pain is reported over multiple body sites. It is a key feature of conditions, such as fibromyalgia, where it is accompanied by other symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, and cognitive issues. The reported prevalence of CWP in the general population falls between 9.6% and 15%. Fibromyalgia, at the more severe end of the CWP spectrum, has a prevalence around 2% to 4%, with the highest prevalence in those aged between 40 and 60 years. In addition to pain, fatigue, disrupted sleep, difficulties with concentration, anxiety, and depression are also characteristics of fibromyalgia. The aetiology and pathogenesis of CWP remains unclear; however, a genetic influence has been demonstrated, and central sensitisation, which refers to an abnormal amplification of neural signalling within the central nervous system, may be a primary mechanism. In addition, there is an association between chronic pain and life traumas, especially childhood trauma.

Increasing emphasis is being placed on the need to support people with CWP to effectively engage with psychosocial and behavioural self-management: guidelines recommend a limited range of pharmacotherapies to treat severe symptoms, with a primary focus now placed on nonpharmacological interventions as first-line care. Self-management is a complex construct and has been defined as a patient-directed approach with the overarching aim of enhancing participants' health status or quality of life. Self-management approaches seek to bolster participants' skills and knowledge, enabling them to apply these enhanced abilities in various aspects of their lives beyond the intervention itself. These interventions often include multiple components, such as exercise and psychological elements, and are designed to improve outcomes directly.

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of self-management for CWP including fibromyalgia demonstrated small to moderate beneficial effects of self-management interventions on physical function and pain when compared with usual care in both the short and long term. Another systematic review showed similar findings of multicomponent interventions, including psychological and physical activities with short-term effects in people with fibromyalgia. However, there was considerable variability in the outcomes reported. To determine how this variance could be reduced and to improve the overall effectiveness of self-management approaches, there is a need for greater understanding of intervention processes and mechanisms that may drive or hinder benefit from these interventions.

### Is the gut microbiome of importance in fibromyalgia? A critical review of emerging evidence [^a47c817f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a multifaceted chronic pain syndrome, predominantly affecting women, and characterised by a constellation of symptoms including diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment and poor sleep quality. Its complex pathophysiology likely involves genetic, environmental and psychosocial factors. Recent studies have raised the possibility that the gut microbiome may influence FM symptoms via the gut-brain axis, although this hypothesis remains unconfirmed. This review aims to explore potential associations between gut microbiome alterations, nutrition, and FM, with particular attention to the limitations of current evidence. While certain studies have reported differences in the gut microbiota composition of patients with FM, these findings are preliminary and often derive from small, heterogeneous cohorts. Likewise, faecal microbiota transplantation studies in animals and limited human trials suggest a possible link to pain sensitivity, but further validation is needed. Nutritional interventions, including prebiotics, probiotics and specific dietary strategies, have shown early promise in modulating gut microbiota and alleviating FM symptoms. Nutrients such as magnesium, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as antioxidant compounds, may influence pain and inflammation pathways, but definitive clinical recommendations are lacking. Given the emerging nature of this field, larger and better-controlled studies are required to clarify the role of the gut microbiome and nutrition in FM. A multidisciplinary management strategy, integrating nutritional approaches cautiously and based on individual profiles, may offer benefits, although no standard therapeutic guidelines currently exist.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^23ef486a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Perform a biopsychosocial assessment and address expectations

Where there is an identifiable cause of chronic pain (eg, diabetes, fibromyalgia), management should proceed as per the current available treatment guidelines with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. However, after appropriate investigations, in patients in whom the cause of chronic pain cannot be determined, repeated radiological and other special investigations are rarely helpful and should be avoided.

Management is guided by careful assessment for the presence of risk factors for chronic pain, psychosocial history, assessment of pain severity and the degree of functional impairment. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is recommended as a simple tool to measure pain intensity and physical and psychosocial components of pain.

Psychosocial and behavioral factors (Box 2) may complicate diagnosis, management and the course of chronic pain, and it is necessary to conduct a careful assessment for these using simple questions (Box 4) and/or self-rating scales (eg, Beck's Depression Inventory). Detailed assessment tools are time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It is important to point out that many of these psychosocial factors are normal psychological processes and/or responses to adversity. However, in some patients they can influence the subjective experience of pain and directly modulate pain pathways leading to maladaptive coping and persistent pain that is apparently non-responsive to treatment. Management in the primary care setting is often sufficient, but if necessary patients should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional.

Box 4
Helpful brief screening questions to identify risk factors for chronic pain, disability and delayed return to work

It is important to explain to patients and their family/caregivers that chronic pain is multifactorial and does not necessarily indicate harm, and also to set realistic expectations in terms of goals of treatment. In chronic pain, complete pain relief is rarely achieved and aims of therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and return to work and physical activity. A clinically meaningful improvement is at least a 30% reduction in pain (or ≥ 2 points on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) and/or 30% improvement in function. Other important outcomes include improvement in sleep and mood, reduced analgesic consumption and reduced health care consultations.

Work absenteeism is associated with low self-esteem, depression, loss of skills, delayed recovery, and in some patients, personal re-identification as a "disabled person". Because the likelihood of returning to work diminishes with increasing duration of absence, it is important to encourage patients who are still working to continue to do so. Those who are off work should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.

### Are the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia better than the 1990 criteria? [^4d0b3687]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is difficult to diagnose and manage chronic pain condition whose symptoms have no clear pathophysiological cause, although it is thought that patient hypersensitivity to a range of stimuli may give rise to mechanical hyperalgesia as a result of altered central nociceptive processing. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, which have been widely used in clinical practice, require the existence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) for > 3months, and the presence of at least 11 out of 18 specified tender points upon digital palpation, although this latter criterion has long been criticised. The newer 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria state that FM can be defined as CWP associated with somatic symptoms, and recommend the use of a widespread pain index and a scale to rate symptom severity. A modified version of the 2010 criteria removed the physician assessment of the extent of somatic symptoms and replaced it by a summary score of three self-reported symptoms, thus making it easier to use while maintaining its sensitivity. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of all of these criteria.

### Research recommendations following the discovery of pain sensitizing IgG autoantibodies in fibromyalgia syndrome [^fc66d902]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is the most common chronic widespread pain condition in rheumatology. Until recently, no clear pathophysiological mechanism for fibromyalgia had been established, resulting in management challenges. Recent research has indicated that serum immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) may play a role in FMS. We undertook a research prioritisation exercise to identify the most pertinent research approaches that may lead to clinically implementable outputs.

Methods

Research priority setting was conducted in five phases: situation analysis; design; expert group consultation; interim recommendations; consultation and revision. A dialogue model was used, and an international multi-stakeholder expert group was invited. Clinical, patient, industry, funder, and scientific expertise was represented throughout. Recommendation-consensus was determined via a voluntary closed eSurvey. Reporting guideline for priority setting of health research were employed to support implementation and maximise impact.

Results

Arising from the expert group consultation (n = 29 participants), 39 interim recommendations were defined. A response rate of 81.5% was achieved in the consensus survey. Six recommendations were identified as high priority- and 15 as medium level priority. The recommendations range from aspects of fibromyalgia features that should be considered in future autoantibody research, to specific immunological investigations, suggestions for trial design in FMS, and therapeutic interventions that should be assessed in trials.

Conclusions

By applying the principles of strategic priority setting we directed research towards that which is implementable, thereby expediating the benefit to the FMS patient population. These recommendations are intended for patients, international professionals and grant-giving bodies concerned with research into causes and management of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.

### Comorbidity management in spondyloarthritis [^9fe16b6b]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of fibromyalgia

The EULAR revised recommendations for the management of FM published in 2017 should be used in these patients. The overarching principles of these recommendations are, first, to comprehensively assess pain, function and psychosocial context; and, second, the objective of the management of FM is to improve health-related quality of life using a multidisciplinary approach that combines pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities. The first step is the use of exercise, given its effect on pain, physical function and well-being (without distinction between aerobic or anaerobic exercise). Meditative movement therapies or mindfulness-based stress reduction are also strongly recommended, since they improve sleep and quality of life, as well as physical therapies (acupuncture or hydrotherapy). Hypnotherapy, massage and other alternative therapies are not recommended because of a lack of effectiveness. In the case of a lack of effect of the above non-pharmaceutical treatments, pharmacological therapies should be considered, especially for patients with severe pain (duloxetine, pregabalin, tramadol) or sleep disturbance (amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, pregabalin). NSAIDs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and strong opioids are not recommended because of a lack of efficacy and the risk of side effects.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management [^f7055a7e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered processing of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more frequently in women and occurs globally, affecting 2% of people in the United States. Patients with fibromyalgia have diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions, such as functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present. The Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful screening method for patients with diffuse chronic pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary testing. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education, exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective medications for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.

### Fibromyalgia treatment update [^191e931c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistently effective treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature from April 2005 through September 2006 involving treatment options.

Recent Findings

Prior evidence suggests that medication and self-management approaches to care can improve symptoms, function and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors — duloxetine and milnacipran — and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential component of any treatment plan for the patient with fibromyalgia. Three studies added to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added to the knowledge needed for clinicians to have substantive conversations with patients.

Summary

Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal approach to treatment involving individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include the improvement of symptoms, primarily pain and sleep, and the promotion of positive health behaviors with the aim of improving physical function and emotional well-being.

Algorithm

Based on the recommendations that were developed, the experts proposed an algorithm for the management of pain by pharmacotherapy in patients with IA (Fig. 1). The therapeutic algorithm is predicated on the assumption that the clinician's first goal is to optimally control inflammation with DMARDs according to current practice (including the use of biologic DMARDs and glucocorticoids), although it is recognized that response to DMARDs is often delayed, may vary over time, and that complete suppression of inflammation is not always achievable.

F. 1
Algorithm for pain management by pharmacotherapy in IA. The central column of the algorithm contains recommendations for the choice of medications for individuals with IA who experience pain despite optimal management of inflammation. It is recommended that clinicians first select an option from the top row, and move sequentially to lower rows when the options in each row are either ineffective or contraindicated. Adjuvant options may be introduced at any point in the algorithm, where appropriate. Each decision within the algorithm should be made with regard to the individual patient, including the points to consider in the left column. Level of evidence: 5. Grade of recommendation: D. Agreement 8.4/10.

The use of NSAIDs, paracetamol and weak opioids in the algorithm reflects the recommendations above. Due to concerns regarding the risk–benefit profile of strong opioids, these drugs do not form part of the main algorithm, but may be used with caution under exceptional circumstances, as described in Recommendation 5.

As discussed in Recommendation 4, TCAs and neuromodulators are not recommended as analgesic options in isolation, but may be considered as adjuvants in a comprehensive analgesic strategy, at any point in the proposed algorithm. Evidence exists for the use of TCAs only in this population. The experts recognized that data now exist regarding the efficacy of newer anti-depressants (such as duloxetine and milnacipran) and the neuromodulators (pregabalin and gabapentin) in FMS, and that while there are no data regarding the use of these drugs in IA, some clinicians may choose to trial them as adjuvants where central sensitization is thought to be contributing to persistent pain.

Research in fibromyalgia has increased understanding of the possible genetic and environmental factors that could be involved in the etiology of fibromyalgia. There is now substantial evidence for augmentation of central pain processing in fibromyalgia. Because the clinical presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, treatment recommendations must be individualized for each patient. The rapid growth of trials in fibromyalgia in recent years has resulted in new evidence-based approaches to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.

Fibromyalgia (FMS) antidepressant trials — efficacy and harms: Fluoxetine provided benefit over placebo, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) improved quality of life (QoL) and pain but not fatigue. Across 10 randomized placebo-controlled trials with a median duration of 12 weeks enrolling 644 patients, dropout rates were not significantly different between SSRI arms and placebo, and an adequate antidepressant trial can be as long as 6 to 12 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) showed no difference for mirtazapine versus control or placebo in 606 participants over 7 to 13 weeks and no difference in serious AEs for paroxetine versus placebo in two studies (n = 84). In a Cochrane review (n = 318), amitriptyline provided more pain relief than placebo (number needed to treat [NNT] 4.1) but was associated with more AEs than placebo (number needed to harm [NNH] 3.3; 78% with amitriptyline versus 48% with placebo).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^81cfd7ed]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Detailed recommendations on diagnosis are provided in other guidelines. Evaluation should include a focused history, including history and characteristics of pain and potential contributing factors (e.g. function, work history and current work demands, psychosocial stressors, and sleep), and physical examination, with imaging or other diagnostic testing only if indicated (e.g. if severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or if serious underlying conditions are suspected). For complex pain syndromes, consultation with a pain specialist can be considered to assist with diagnosis and management.

Diagnosis can help identify disease-specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g. improving glucose control to prevent progression of diabetic neuropathy; immune-modulating agents for rheumatoid arthritis; physical or occupational therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve severe mechanical or compressive pain). The underlying mechanism for most pain syndromes has traditionally been categorized as neuropathic (e.g. diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia) or nociceptive (e.g. osteoarthritis and muscular back pain). More recently, nociplastic pain has been suggested as a third, distinct category of pain with augmented central nervous system pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation as experienced in conditions such as fibromyalgia. The diagnosis and pathophysiologic mechanism of pain have implications for symptomatic pain treatment with medication. For example, evidence is limited for improved pain or function, or evidence exists of worse outcomes, with long-term use of opioids for several chronic pain conditions for which opioids are commonly prescribed, such as osteoarthritis, nonspecific low back pain, headache, and fibromyalgia. For moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain, a nonopioid strategy starting with acetaminophen or NSAIDs results in improved pain intensity with fewer side effects compared with a strategy starting with opioids. Tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI antidepressants, selected anticonvulsants, or transdermal lidocaine are recommended for neuropathic pain syndromes (e.g. diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia).

### Pharmacological pain management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative literature review [^d137e26f]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite key therapeutic advances in reducing synovitis and disease activity, pain remains a major challenge in RA. Surveys demonstrate that approximately two-thirds of patients have daily pain with most rating pain to be the health area they most want improved, and longitudinal studies show that despite biologic therapies pain is often uncontrolled (with 79% of patients with RA receiving biologics in the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Registry belonging to a "persistent pain" trajectory). Pain has detrimental impacts on the quality of life, function, mental health, and fatigue levels of patients with RA. The mechanisms driving pain in RA are complex, and often involve multiple pain types and pathways, with fibromyalgia particularly common.

Contemporary RA guidelines focus on reducing disease activity using DMARDs, providing few/no pain-specific recommendations. To date, the only RA pain-specific guideline is from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR). Underpinned by an umbrella review of non-pharmacological treatments, it advocates biopsychosocial approaches involving reducing synovitis and non-drug care. In the absence of a pain-specific focus in most RA guidelines, there is increasing evidence that its management involves the substantial prescribing of analgesics (particularly opioids), despite known risks (including overdose, fractures, and myocardial infarction with opioids, upper gastrointestinal complications and cardiovascular events with NSAIDs), emerging data about other potential harms (such as fractures with gabapentinoids), and limited trial evidence for efficacy. Our narrative review summarises evidence for (a) the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for pain in RA and (b) how they are being prescribed/used, outlining potential future research directions to reduce evidence-to-practice gaps. It provides complementary but distinct information to recent RA therapeutic reviews describing the role of immunosuppressive medicines to reduce disease activity.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^acf8c977]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Acute pain is usually self-limiting and serves a protective function, influencing behavior to avoid further tissue damage and limiting movement to support healing. In contrast, in much the same way that a small flame from a match can cause a large forest fire, inadequately treated acute pain causes changes in the peripheral and central nervous systems that maintain persistent pain independent of the initial inciting painful stimulus.–

Chronic pain is defined as pain that persists beyond the normal time expected for tissue healing (usually accepted as 3 months) and without apparent benefit. Treatment can be complex and difficult. While there are guidelines to direct management of chronic pain associated with specific disorders such as cancer, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia–or neuropathic pain,–often there is no obvious cause for pain that persists despite treatment. Under these circumstances, uncertainty and frustration on the part of both practitioner and patient can lead to inappropriate polypharmacy and escalating doses of medications, exposing patients to unnecessary treatments and associated side effects.

For most patients with chronic pain, the general practitioner remains the most appropriate health care professional to treat and, where necessary, coordinate multidisciplinary management. However, to do so requires an understanding of why pain becomes chronic, the multitude of factors that may complicate ongoing pain, and management of chronic pain needs to be differentiated from management of acute exacerbations. It requires careful establishment of realistic expectations and formulation of an individualized, tiered, multimodal plan that can successfully bring pain relief and improve function.

Recommendation strength definitions and good practice statements are described as follows: A strong recommendation suggests that most informed patients would choose the recommended management. While usually reflecting a higher level of evidence, it may also reflect the severity of a potential negative outcome. A conditional recommendation suggests that choice will vary with individual values and preferences. Conditional recommendations generally reflect a lack of data, limited data, or conflicting data that lead to uncertainty. Finally, good practice statements are those for which indirect evidence is sufficiently compelling that a formal vote is unnecessary. They are presented as "suggestions" rather than formal recommendations.

Treatment

The primary goal in the treatment of JPFS is to enhance quality of life through pain relief and improved function. A multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioral and exercise-based modalities is currently the standard of care for JPFS. Treatment should begin with non-pharmacologic modalities, most importantly exercise. Other non-pharmacologic modalities include movement and meditative treatments, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Reassurance is very important, including acknowledging that the patient's pain is real, and emphasizing that it is not dangerous. Caregivers should communicate that although the pain may last for an unknown period and no immediate cure exists, there are therapeutic options that may reduce the pain over time. Setting goals of leading a full life, stressing the importance of lifestyle factors and treating emotional symptoms are critical.

Multidisciplinary programs may be implemented in a hospital or outpatient setting. In a study comparing an intensive day-hospital rehabilitation program of physical, occupational and psychological therapies to outpatient treatment for children with significant pain-related disability, those enrolled in the day-hospital rehabilitation had significantly larger improvements in functional disability, pain-related fear, and readiness to change. Intensive, multidisciplinary outpatient programs have also reported improved pain, function, and quality of life in children with JPFS.

A recent article suggested that the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation associated with FM, and the modest results, on average, for any therapy, call for a more individualized management strategy. For example, The European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend a tailored approach directed by key FM symptoms of pain, sleep disorders, fatigue, functional disability.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This systematic review and NMA was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

Search strategy

Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist with input from our expert advisers to identify RCTs in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PyscINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

Study selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel‐group, cross‐over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention. Studies that compared two or more regimens of the same treatment (eg, varying doses of the same drug) were excluded if a placebo or another intervention group was not considered. Two reviewers (MI and CR) independently screened a sample of 100 titles and abstracts at the beginning of the study selection process and compared results to ensure consistency. The remaining citations were divided into two sets and allocated to the same two reviewers. All potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full and assessed by one reviewer for inclusion with a second reviewer checking all articles that were labeled unclear and 10% of the excluded articles. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: practical strategies for improving diagnosis and patient outcomes [^a093e5e8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia must be applied in clinical practice to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Current evidence indicates that fibromyalgia is a hyperalgesic state, resulting from a generalized problem with augmented pain processing that likely results from the way the spinal cord and the brain process pain and other sensory information. The descending pain pathway involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as opposed to the descending opioid pain pathway, appears to be selectively attenuated. Newer treatment options targeted at the pain mechanisms include the alpha(2)-delta pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons, and the serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise, and strength and flexibility training are important components of care. An individualized treatment plan should be developed with consideration of each patient's unique combination of fibromyalgia symptoms, functional level, and the presence of the comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions that are common in patients with fibromyalgia. This educational activity provides clinicians with the tools necessary to differentiate fibromyalgia syndrome from other chronic pain conditions through a review of recent clinical data and an application of an advanced understanding of pain pathways. Strategies to manage patients with comorbid conditions are explored, with an emphasis on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

Progression from acute to chronic pain

Acute and chronic pain cannot be segregated into two distinct types; chronic pain is rather an extension of acute pain, resulting from poorly managed acute pain. The metamorphosis of acute to chronic pain is believed to proceed through one of the following processes: central sensitization, modulation or modification of nociceptors, and altered neuroplasticity. Under normal circumstances, as a healing process begins, the noxious stimuli reduce and pain diminishes. However, in cases of persistent pain, peripheral and central sensitization most frequently transcends to hyperalgesia (increased response to less-painful stimuli) and allodynia (pain response to normally nonpainful stimuli). Altered spinal neuroplasticity as a result of glial cells modifying the neuronal cytoarchitecture is another important aspect of chronic pain and may be a consequence of repetitive nociceptive firing in the central neurons (reversible) or nerve damage due to neuropathy (irreversible). Studies have reported substantial loss of gray matter in the brain and changes in the structure, sensitivity and activity of neurons as well as internal rewiring in certain chronic pain conditions. These changes may be clinically manifested in the form of fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndrome. There is also a significant decline in neurotransmitter receptors and their function, which may explain the lack of efficacy with central opioid agonists in neuropathic pain. While management of acute pain symptoms might seem to be the most rational approach from a clinician's perspective, it is essential to evaluate the risk factors associated with pain chronification. Increased pain intensity, loss of functionality and affected psychosocial ability are a few predictive factors for development of chronic pain. Studies have shown that assessment of functional and psychosocial outcomes is a highly favorable measure in predicting the risk of chronic pain.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^3877e4cd]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain (ie, present for at least 3 months) is highly prevalent, affecting 1 in 5 US adults, and can be debilitating. Treatment includes a comprehensive, patient-centered biopsychosocial approach that identifies pain type, focuses on improving function and quality of life, sets reasonable expectations around pain control, promotes self-management strategies, addresses mental health comorbidities, and includes pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacotherapy options. For osteoarthritis, topical and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide significant pain relief; limited evidence suggests benefit from serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and gabapentinoids. For chronic low back pain, no pharmacotherapy offers significant pain or functional benefit; evidence is limited to short-term outcomes. Oral and topical NSAIDs and SNRIs appear to improve pain slightly in the short term. For neuropathic pain, duloxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and high-concentration (8%) topical capsaicin provide moderate pain benefit. For fibromyalgia, pregabalin has the best evidence for moderate pain benefit, followed by the SNRIs duloxetine and milnacipran. Opioids should be considered only after other strategies have been tried and after risk-benefit assessment.

### The rational management of fibromyalgia patients [^8ca4a4af]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The exponential increase in pain research over the last 10 years has established fibromyalgia (FM) as a common chronic pain syndrome with similar neurophysiologic aberrations to other chronic pain states. As such, the pathogenesis is considered to involve an interaction of augmented sensory processing (central sensitization) and peripheral pain generators. The notion, that FM symptomatology results from an amplification of incoming sensory impulses, has revolutionized the contemporary understanding of this enigmatic problem and provided a more rational approach to treatment. To date, the management of FM has been mainly palliative, with the aims of reducing pain, improving sleep, maintaining function, treating psychologic distress and diminishing the impact of associated syndromes. The rapidly evolving neurophysiologic, psychophysiologic and molecular biologic basis for chronic pain states has already opened up new avenues for management which should be applicable to this difficult group of patients. Indeed, it is now possible to think about a "rational" approach to managing FM patients that was unthinkable just a few years ago.

Implementation Considerations

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis.
Clinicians should recommend appropriate noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to help manage chronic pain, such as exercise (e.g. aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g. yoga, tai chi, or qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache.
Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.
Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness.
Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.
When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g. knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered.
NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding.
When patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications.
Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
In patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g. amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g. duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g. topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e. pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8).
Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.
Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful.
Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals.
For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥ 30 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5).
Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions.
Clinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance.
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

### Fibromyalgia [^f2401572]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common illness characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep problems (including unrefreshing sleep), physical exhaustion and cognitive difficulties. The definition, pathogenesis and treatment are controversial, and some even contest the existence of this disorder. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) defined classification criteria that required multiple tender points (areas of tenderness occurring in muscles and muscle-tendon junctions) and chronic widespread pain. In 2010, the ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties. Fibromyalgia occurs in all populations worldwide, and symptom prevalence ranges between 2% and 4% in the general population. The prevalence of people who are actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia ('administrative prevalence') is much lower. A model of fibromyalgia pathogenesis has been suggested in which biological and psychosocial variables interact to influence the predisposition, triggering and aggravation of a chronic disease, but the details are unclear. Diagnosis requires the history of a typical cluster of symptoms and the exclusion of a somatic disease that sufficiently explains the symptoms by medical examination. Current evidence-based guidelines emphasize the value of multimodal treatments, which encompass both non-pharmacological and selected pharmacological treatments tailored to individual symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep problems and mood problems.

### Pain management in fibromyalgia [^2a25be57]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pain is the primary presenting symptom in the vast majority of inflammatory and noninflammatory rheumatic diseases. Patients tell us that improved pain relief is a principal concern. Many pain complaints respond incompletely to the treatment of the primary rheumatic disorder and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia do not respond to traditional analgesic medications. Therefore, proper management requires consideration of additional medications for symptomatic relief. This review addresses newer strategies for the treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia that may be also useful in patients with other rheumatic diseases.

Recent Findings

New medications have been developed with a better understanding of chronic pain mechanisms that principally address pain neurobiology at the levels of the spinal cord and the brain. Clinical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin) and the norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and milnacipran) in fibromyalgia.

Summary

Patients with chronic pain, best classified as fibromyalgia, either primary or in association with other rheumatic disorders, may experience benefit from new therapies targeting central pain mechanisms.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^5e53c3a5]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Chronic Multisymptom Illness — behavioral health and complementary and integrative health for chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) with symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: We suggest offering cognitive behavioral therapy for CMI and symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. We suggest offering mindfulness-based therapies for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of biofeedback modalities in patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of manual musculoskeletal therapies for patients with CMI and symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

Nonopioid pharmacological therapies for chronic pain in SCD with no identifiable cause beyond SCD — gabapentinoids: For adults, the panel suggests gabapentinoids (eg, pregabalin) as options for pain management (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯). This is based largely on indirect evidence from fibromyalgia, and due to a significant lack of pediatric data for gabapentinoids, no recommendation could be supported for that age group.
