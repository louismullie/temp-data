## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which immediate treatment should be given to a 66-year-old patient with acute ischemic stroke symptoms for 3 hours, after a CT scan has ruled out hemorrhage, while the patient is being transferred to a more advanced hospital. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the time window and whether IV thrombolysis is indicated. Then, I should verify eligibility criteria and exclusions, including blood pressure thresholds and glucose requirements. Next, I will review what to do about the elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia. After that, I need to consider the role of early antiplatelet therapy and whether it should be given now or delayed. Finally, I will confirm the transfer logistics and why the other options are not appropriate, anchoring to guideline-based care pathways.

> Let me first confirm the time window and core indication. At 3 hours from symptom onset with CT excluding hemorrhage, IV alteplase is indicated if the patient is otherwise eligible, because benefit is time-dependent and declines with delay. Treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible within the 0–3 hour window, and door-in–door-out delays for transfer should be minimized to preserve eligibility and outcomes [^116UWU8K] [^114CWjBg] [^112zuxmN].

> Wait, let me verify the blood pressure requirement before thrombolysis. I initially thought the cutoff was 185/110 mmHg, but hold on, I should double-check the post-treatment target. The pre-thrombolysis target is to lower blood pressure so that systolic is less than 185 mmHg and diastolic is less than 110 mmHg; after alteplase, blood pressure must be maintained below 180/105 mmHg for the first 24 hours, so I need to ensure aggressive but safe antihypertensive management now to meet the pre-treatment threshold [^114riAF2] [^116Hcn7S].

> I need to check the glucose requirement. Only blood glucose must be verified before alteplase, and treatment should not be delayed for routine labs if there is no reason to suspect coagulopathy; hypoglycemia should be corrected, and persistent hyperglycemia worsens outcomes, so a reasonable inpatient target is 140–180 mg/dL with close monitoring to avoid hypoglycemia; here, 11.6 mmol/L is about 209 mg/dL, so I should initiate insulin while proceeding with thrombolysis if otherwise eligible [^111FuV7C] [^111KTQkh].

> Let me consider the clinical severity. Facial droop and inability to move an arm suggest at least moderate stroke severity and raise concern for large-vessel occlusion; in parallel with IV alteplase, the patient should be evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy and transferred expeditiously to a thrombectomy-capable center, as combined reperfusion strategies and rapid transfer improve outcomes in appropriate candidates [^117DXAby] [^115mep3d] [^114MshkU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antiplatelet therapy timing. Aspirin is recommended within 24–48 hours after onset, but if IV alteplase is given, aspirin should generally be delayed until 24 hours after thrombolysis unless there is a compelling indication; giving 325 mg aspirin STAT now would be premature and could increase bleeding risk post-tPA, so I should defer aspirin until after the 24-hour post-alteplase window and a follow-up CT excludes hemorrhage [^1118kyvh] [^113M56Gx].

> I should confirm why the other options are inappropriate. LMWH or unfractionated heparin are not indicated acutely for ischemic stroke in the absence of a specific indication like venous thromboembolism or dissection, and using them now could increase bleeding risk and delay or complicate thrombolysis; similarly, giving aspirin immediately would contradict the post-tPA 24-hour antiplatelet hold unless a compelling indication exists, which is not described here [^1118kyvh] [^115V4CJj].

> Next, I should review transfer logistics to protect eligibility and outcomes. Prehospital and interfacility notification, standardized handoff protocols, and minimizing door-in–door-out times are critical. Current data show median transfer times around 174 minutes, exceeding the 120-minute goal, so proactive coordination and prenotification can meaningfully shorten delays and preserve the window for both IV thrombolysis and thrombectomy [^115mep3d] [^112zuxmN] [^112mysnv].

> Putting this together, I should act now: treat the blood pressure aggressively to achieve SBP less than 185 mmHg and DBP less than 110 mmHg, start an insulin infusion to target glucose 140–180 mg/dL, and administer IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg) with 10% bolus over 1 minute and the remainder over 60 minutes without delay, while concurrently activating transfer to a thrombectomy-capable center and notifying the receiving team. Aspirin should be delayed until 24 hours after alteplase and a follow-up CT confirms no hemorrhage [^116UWU8K] [^114riAF2] [^111KTQkh] [^1118kyvh] [^115mep3d].

> Final answer: d. alteplase, administered immediately once blood pressure is controlled and glucose is being addressed, with transfer expedited in parallel for thrombectomy evaluation [^116UWU8K] [^114riAF2] [^111KTQkh] [^115mep3d].

---

The correct answer is **d. alteplase**. The patient is within the 3-hour window for IV thrombolysis [^116UWU8K], and CT has excluded hemorrhage [^notfound]; therefore, alteplase should be administered immediately [^114CWjBg] while arranging transfer. Blood pressure must be lowered to **< 185/110 mmHg** [^114riAF2] before alteplase, and glucose should be managed per protocol [^111KTQkh]. ASA, LMWH, and UFH are not indicated acutely in this scenario [^1118kyvh] [^117W562r].

---

## Clinical scenario analysis

- **Patient profile**: 66-year-old male with acute ischemic stroke symptoms (facial droop, arm weakness) presenting within 3 hours of onset.
- **Initial evaluation**: Non-contrast CT has excluded hemorrhage [^notfound].
- **Vital signs**: Blood pressure 180/110 mmHg, blood glucose 11.6 mmol/L (209 mg/dL).
- **Medical history**: Smoker, alcohol use, BMI 28, heart failure, on ramipril.
- **Transfer**: Patient is being transferred to a more advanced hospital 3 hours away.

---

## Recommended treatment during transfer

### Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase

- **Indication**: IV alteplase is the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset, provided hemorrhage is excluded on imaging [^116UWU8K] [^113rFhqB].
- **Dosing**: 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10% given as a bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes [^116UWU8K].
- **Blood pressure management**: BP must be reduced to < 185/110 mmHg before initiating alteplase [^114riAF2].
- **Glucose management**: Hyperglycemia should be treated to a target range of 140–180 mg/dL [^111KTQkh].

---

### Rationale for alteplase administration

Alteplase **improves neurological outcomes** and reduces disability when administered within 3 hours of stroke onset [^114AwBmu]. Delaying treatment increases the risk of irreversible brain injury and worsens outcomes [^114MshkU]. Even in rural settings, administering alteplase before transfer improves outcomes by enabling earlier reperfusion [^notfound].

---

### Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **intracranial hemorrhage**, active bleeding, recent major surgery, or severe uncontrolled hypertension [^notfound]. Precautions include careful monitoring of blood pressure, neurological status, and bleeding during and after administration [^116Hcn7S].

---

## Alternative options analysis

### Aspirin (ASA) 325 mg STAT

Aspirin is recommended within **24–48 hours after stroke onset** for secondary prevention, but not as initial therapy in the hyperacute phase [^1118kyvh]. Early aspirin use may increase bleeding risk if thrombolysis is planned or administered [^notfound].

---

### Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

LMWH is not indicated in the **acute phase of ischemic stroke** unless there is a specific indication, such as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [^notfound]. Its use may increase bleeding risk and is not recommended before or immediately after thrombolysis [^117W562r].

---

### Unfractionated heparin (UFH)

UFH is not indicated in the **acute phase of ischemic stroke** unless there is a specific indication, such as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis or treatment of documented thromboembolism. Its use may increase bleeding risk and is not recommended before or immediately after thrombolysis [^115V4CJj].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Alteplase | Strongly recommended | - Standard of care within 3 hours <br/> - Improves outcomes [^116UWU8K] [^114CWjBg] |
| Aspirin | Not recommended initially | - Use after 24–48 hours <br/> - Risk of bleeding if given early [^1118kyvh] [^113M56Gx] |
| LMWH | Not recommended | - Not indicated acutely <br/> - Increases bleeding risk [^notfound] |
| UFH | Not recommended | - Not indicated acutely <br/> - Increases bleeding risk [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The recommended treatment during transfer is **intravenous alteplase** [^117DXAby], administered as soon as blood pressure is controlled to < 185/110 mmHg and glucose is managed appropriately [^114riAF2] [^111KTQkh]. This approach aligns with current guidelines and maximizes the likelihood of favorable neurological outcomes [^114CWjBg].

### Door-in-door-out times for interhospital transfer of patients with stroke [^112zuxmN]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Treatments for time-sensitive acute stroke are not available at every hospital, often requiring interhospital transfer. Current guidelines recommend hospitals achieve a door-in-door-out time of no more than 120 minutes at the transferring emergency department (ED).

Objective

To evaluate door-in-door-out times for acute stroke transfers in the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry and to identify patient and hospital factors associated with door-in-door-out times.

Design, Setting, and Participants

US registry-based, retrospective study of patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke from January 2019 through December 2021 who were transferred from the ED at registry-affiliated hospitals to other acute care hospitals.

Exposure

Patient- and hospital-level characteristics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the door-in-door-out time (time of transfer out minus time of arrival to the transferring ED) as a continuous variable and a categorical variable (≤ 120 minutes, > 120 minutes). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models were used to identify patient and hospital-level characteristics associated with door-in-door-out time overall and in subgroups of patients with hemorrhagic stroke, acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular therapy, and acute ischemic stroke transferred for reasons other than endovascular therapy.

Results

Among 108 913 patients (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [15.2] years; 71.7% non-Hispanic White; 50.6% male) transferred from 1925 hospitals, 67 235 had acute ischemic stroke and 41 678 had hemorrhagic stroke. Overall, the median door-in-door-out time was 174 minutes (IQR, 116–276 minutes): 29 741 patients (27.3%) had a door-in-door-out time of 120 minutes or less. The factors significantly associated with longer median times were age 80 years or older (vs 18–59 years; 14.9 minutes, 95% CI, 12.3 to 17.5 minutes), female sex (5.2 minutes; 95% CI, 3.6 to 6.9 minutes), non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White (8.2 minutes, 95% CI, 5.7 to 10.8 minutes), and Hispanic ethnicity vs non-Hispanic White (5.4 minutes, 95% CI, 1.8 to 9.0 minutes). The following were significantly associated with shorter median door-in-door-out time: emergency medical services prenotification (-20.1 minutes; 95% CI, -22.1 to -18.1 minutes), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score exceeding 12 vs a score of 0 to 1 (-66.7 minutes; 95% CI, -68.7 to -64.7 minutes), and patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular therapy vs the hemorrhagic stroke subgroup (-16.8 minutes; 95% CI, -21.0 to -12.7 minutes). Among patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular therapy, female sex, Black race, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with a significantly higher door-in-door-out time, whereas emergency medical services prenotification, intravenous thrombolysis, and a higher NIHSS score were associated with significantly lower door-in-door-out times.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this US registry-based study of interhospital transfer for acute stroke, the median door-in-door-out time was 174 minutes, which is longer than current recommendations for acute stroke transfer. Disparities and modifiable health system factors associated with longer door-in-door-out times are suitable targets for quality improvement initiatives.

### Rates, characteristics, and outcomes of patients transferred to specialized stroke centers for advanced care [^111rq7bH]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background While many patients are transferred to specialized stroke centers for advanced acute ischemic stroke (AIS) care, few studies have characterized these patients. We sought to determine variation in the rates and differences in the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between AIS cases presenting directly to stroke centers' front door versus Transfer-Ins from another hospital. Methods and Results We analyzed 970 390 AIS cases in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry from January 2010 to March 2014 to compare hospitals with high Transfer-In rates (≥ 15%) versus those with low Transfer-In rates (< 5%) and to compare the front-door versus Transfer-In patients admitted to those hospitals with high Transfer-In rates (high Transfer-In hospitals). Of 970 390 patients discharged from 1646 hospitals, 87% initially presented via the emergency department versus 13% were a Transfer-In from another hospital. High Transfer-In hospitals had a median 31% Transfer-In rate among all stroke discharges, were larger, had higher annual AIS volume and intravenous tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) rates, and were more often Midwest teaching hospitals and stroke centers. Compared with front-door, Transfer-In patients were younger, more often white, had higher median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores, less often hypertension and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, and higher in-hospital mortality (7.9% versus 4.9%; standardized difference, 12.4%). After multivariable adjustment, Transfer-In patients had higher in-hospital mortality and discharge modified Rankin scale. Conclusions There is significant regional variability in the transfer of patients with AIS. Because Transfer-In patients seem to have worse short-term outcomes, these patients have the potential to negatively influence institutional mortality rates and should be accounted for explicitly in hospital risk-profiling measures.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Brain swelling in AIS — general recommendations: Patients with large territorial cerebral and cerebellar infarctions are at high risk for developing brain swelling and herniation, and discussion of care options and possible outcomes should take place quickly with patients (if possible) and family or next of kin, with patient-centered preferences included in shared decision-making. Measures to lessen the risk of swelling and close monitoring of the patient for signs of neurological worsening during the first days after stroke are recommended, and early transfer of patients at risk for malignant brain swelling to an institution with appropriate neurosurgical expertise should be considered.

### Recent endovascular stroke trials and their impact on stroke systems of care [^1153GC2J]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Five recently published randomized trials of endovascular therapy versus medical management, including intravenous thrombolysis, demonstrated strong positive data in support of intra-arterial thrombectomy procedures. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association released a focused update of the 2013 guidelines on the early management of acute ischemic strokes to specifically incorporate the findings of the 5 "positive" trials. In this review, we examine the key results of those trials and the principal changes in the updated guidelines. We discuss the ongoing and future changes in stroke systems of care, with an emphasis on the role of pre-hospital stroke triage, interhospital transfer, and the 2 main levels of stroke center certification (primary and comprehensive).

### Endovascular thrombectomy treatment effect in direct vs transferred patients with large ischemic strokes: a prespecified analysis of the SELECT2 trial [^1148xApq]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with large ischemic core stroke have poor clinical outcomes and are frequently not considered for interfacility transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).

Objective

To assess EVT treatment effects in transferred vs directly presenting patients and to evaluate the association between transfer times and neuroimaging changes with EVT clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prespecified secondary analysis of the SELECT2 trial, which evaluated EVT vs medical management (MM) in patients with large ischemic stroke, evaluated adults aged 18 to 85 years with acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) as well as an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 3 to 5, core of 50 mL or greater on imaging, or both. Patients were enrolled between October 2019 and September 2022 from 31 EVT-capable centers in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Data were analyzed from August 2023 to January 2024.

Interventions

EVT vs MM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days with blinded adjudication.

Results

A total of 958 patients were screened and 606 patients were excluded. Of 352 enrolled patients, 145 (41.2%) were female, and the median (IQR) age was 66.5 (58–75) years. A total of 211 patients (59.9%) were transfers, while 141 (40.1%) presented directly. The median (IQR) transfer time was 178 (136–230) minutes. The median (IQR) ASPECTS decreased from the referring hospital (5 [4–7]) to an EVT-capable center (4 [3–5]). Thrombectomy treatment effect was observed in both directly presenting patients (adjusted generalized odds ratio [OR], 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42–2.86) and transferred patients (adjusted generalized OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.11–2.03) without heterogeneity (P for interaction = .14). Treatment effect point estimates favored EVT among 82 transferred patients with a referral hospital ASPECTS of 5 or less (44 received EVT; adjusted generalized OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.89–2.58). ASPECTS loss was associated with numerically worse EVT outcomes (adjusted generalized OR per 1-ASPECTS point loss, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77–1.02). EVT treatment effect estimates were lower in patients with transfer times of 3 hours or more (adjusted generalized OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73–1.80).

Conclusions and Relevance

Both directly presenting and transferred patients with large ischemic stroke in the SELECT2 trial benefited from EVT, including those with low ASPECTS at referring hospitals. However, the association of EVT with better functional outcomes was numerically better in patients presenting directly to EVT-capable centers. Prolonged transfer times and evolution of ischemic change were associated with worse EVT outcomes. These findings emphasize the need for rapid identification of patients suitable for transfer and expedited transport.

Hospital stroke systems — It is recommended that stroke systems of care be developed so that fibrinolytic‑eligible patients and mechanical thrombectomy–eligible patients receive treatment in the fastest achievable onset‑to‑treatment time. Supporting data note IV tissue‑type plasminogen activator may be given up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset, and in alteplase‑treated cohorts, treatment started more rapidly was associated with reduced in‑hospital mortality, reduced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, increased independent ambulation at discharge, and increased discharge to home. For endovascular therapy, pooled trials found the odds of improved disability outcomes declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture, and to ensure access for those presenting in the 6‑ to 24‑hour window, evaluation and treatment should be as rapid as possible.

### Higher volume endovascular stroke centers have faster times to treatment, higher reperfusion rates and higher rates of good clinical outcomes [^111rT9jj]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Technological advances have helped to improve the efficiency of treating patients with large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, the sequence of events prior to reperfusion may lead to significant treatment delays. This study sought to determine if high-volume (HV) centers were efficient at delivery of endovascular treatment approaches.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of nine centers to assess a series of time points from obtaining a CT scan to the end of the endovascular procedure. Demographic, radiographic and angiographic variables were assessed by multivariate analysis to determine if HV centers were more efficient at delivery of care.

Results

A total of 442 consecutive patients of mean age 66 ± 14 years and median NIH Stroke Scale score of 18 were studied. HV centers were more likely to treat patients after intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator and those transferred from outside hospitals. After adjusting for appropriate variables, HV centers had significantly lower times from CT acquisition to groin puncture (OR 0.991, 95% CI 0.989 to 0.997, p = 0.001) and total procedure times (OR 0.991, 95% CI 0.986 to 0.996, p = 0.001). Additionally, patients treated at HV centers were more likely to have a good clinical outcome (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.10, p < 0.018) and successful reperfusion (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.86, p < 0.008).

Conclusions

Significant delays occur in treating patients with endovascular therapy in acute ischemic stroke, offering opportunities for improvements in systems of care. Ongoing prospective clinical trials can help to assess if HV centers are achieving better clinical outcomes and higher reperfusion rates.

### Can non-contrast head CT and stroke severity be used for stroke triage? A population-based study [^1142psa3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients may benefit from endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) up to 24 h since last known normal (LKN). Advanced imaging is required for patient selection. Small or rural hospitals may not have sufficient CT technician and radiology support to rapidly acquire and interpret images. We estimated transfer rates using non-contrast head CT and stroke severity to select patients to be transferred to larger centers for evaluation.

Methods

We identified all AIS among residents of the study region in 2010. Only cases age ≥ 18 with baseline mRS 0–2 that presented to an ED were included. Among cases that presented between 6 and 24 h from LKN, those without evidence of acute infarct on head CT and with initial NIHSS ≥ 6 or ≥ 10 were identified.

Results

Of 1359 AIS cases, 448 (33.0%) presented between 6 and 24 h, of which 383 (85.5%) showed no evidence of acute infarct on CT. Of cases with no acute infarct on CT, 89/383 (23.2%) had NIHSS ≥ 6, of which 66 (74.2%) initially presented to a hospital without thrombectomy capabilities; and 51/383 (13.3%) had NIHSS ≥ 10, of which 40 (78.4%) presented to a non-thrombectomy hospital.

Conclusions

In our population, 40–66 AIS patients annually (0.8–1.3/week, or 3–5 patients/100,000 persons/year) may present to non-thrombectomy hospitals and need to be transferred using non-contrast CT and stroke severity as screening tools. Such an approach may sufficiently mitigate the impact of delays in treatment on outcomes, without overburdening the referring nor accepting hospitals.

### Why are eligible thrombolysis candidates left untreated? [^114bYiih]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Despite proven efficacy, thrombolytics are used in a minority of eligible candidates. Because some of the exclusion criteria are vague, relying on documented contraindications could disguise biases in usage. This study sought to identify barriers to tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment among eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

The study prospectively identified all patients with an initial diagnosis of ischemic stroke arriving within 2.5 hours of symptom onset at 11 hospitals participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sponsored California Acute Stroke Prototype Registry during two 3-month periods in 2002 and 2003. Potential risk factors for nontreatment with thrombolytics among patients categorized as eligible were examined, based on directly documented contraindications. Analyses were repeated after reclassification of eligibility based on record review.

Results

Of 625 patients with ischemic stroke, 126 (20%) arrived at the emergency department within 2.5 hours of symptom onset. Based on direct documentation, 72 (11.5% of all patients; 57% of in-time arrivals) were eligible for thrombolysis; 32 (44% of eligible patients) who received tPA within the 3-hour time window and 40 who did not receive thrombolytic medications despite having no documented contraindication to treatment. Factors predictive of nontreatment were older age (p = 0.0005), later arrival (p = 0.004), and admittance to a non-academic hospital (p = 0.03). After record review, slightly fewer patients (n = 61) were deemed eligible, with a tPA treatment rate of 52% among those eligible. Older age (p = 0.002) and later arrival (p = 0.002) continued to be predictive of nontreatment with thrombolytics after reclassification.

Conclusions

Even when more-comprehensive eligibility standards are applied, older age and later hospital arrival are associated with nontreatment with thrombolytics.

Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations in a single document for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. The intended audiences are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines supersede the 2013 Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Guidelines and are an update of the 2018 AIS Guidelines. Methods- Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. An update of the 2013 AIS Guidelines was originally published in January 2018. This guideline was approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and the AHA Executive Committee. In April 2018, a revision to these guidelines, deleting some recommendations, was published online by the AHA. The writing group was asked review the original document and revise if appropriate. In June 2018, the writing group submitted a document with minor changes and with inclusion of important newly published randomized controlled trials with > 100 participants and clinical outcomes at least 90 days after AIS. The document was sent to 14 peer reviewers. The writing group evaluated the peer reviewers' comments and revised when appropriate. The current final document was approved by all members of the writing group except when relationships with industry precluded members from voting and by the governing bodies of the AHA. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations and Level of Evidence and the new AHA guidelines format. Results- These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the prehospital and hospital settings. Conclusions- These guidelines provide general recommendations based on the currently available evidence to guide clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke. In many instances, however, only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^111UqQPL]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability in developed countries and one of the top causes of mortality worldwide. The past decade has seen substantial advances in the diagnostic and treatment options available to minimize the impact of acute ischemic stroke. The key first step in stroke care is early identification of patients with stroke and triage to centers capable of delivering the appropriate treatment, as fast as possible. Here, we review the data supporting pre-hospital and emergency stroke care, including use of emergency medical services protocols for identification of patients with stroke, intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke including updates to recommended patient eligibility criteria and treatment time windows, and advanced imaging techniques with automated interpretation to identify patients with large areas of brain at risk but without large completed infarcts who are likely to benefit from endovascular thrombectomy in extended time windows from symptom onset. We also review protocols for management of patient physiologic parameters to minimize infarct volumes and recent updates in secondary prevention recommendations including short term use of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke in the high risk period immediately after stroke. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies and questions for future research.

### Characteristics and outcomes among patients transferred to a regional comprehensive stroke center for tertiary care [^117CLa46]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Many patients are transferred to comprehensive stroke centers for advanced acute ischemic stroke care, especially after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. We sought to determine differences in the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting directly to our academic stroke center's front door versus transfers-in from another acute care hospital.

Methods

Using our institutional Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke registry, we analyzed all 3660 consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke (January 2005-June 2012). Univariate and multivariable models explored differences in front door versus transfer-in patients.

Results

Fifty percent of all patients with acute ischemic stroke were transfer-in. Compared with front door patients, transfer-in were younger (67 ± 16 versus 71 ± 15 years; P < 0.001), had worse median initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (7.0 versus 4.0; P < 0.001), more often had limb weakness (35% versus 27%; P < 0.001) or aphasia (16% versus 11%; P < 0.001), and received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (29% versus 13%; P < 0.001). Despite a trend toward higher in-hospital mortality in transfer-in patients, the difference was not statistically significant (13% versus 11%; P = 0.08) between the 2 groups. Transfer-in patients had a longer hospital length of stay (5 versus 4 days; P < 0.001) and were more often discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (48% versus 34%; P < 0.001). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were increasing age (odds ratio [OR], 1.38 per decade [1.23–1.55]; P < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.47 [1.12–1.93]; P = 0.006), coronary artery disease (OR, 2.02 [1.53–2.67]; P < 0.001), and initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (OR, 1.20 per point [1.18–1.23]; P < 0.001). Transfer status was not independently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.99 [0.76–1.29]; P = 0.928).

Conclusions

Despite having more severe strokes on arrival at our hospital, transfer-in patients had similar in-hospital mortality versus front door patients and were more likely to be discharged to rehabilitation. These outcomes lend support to the concept of regionalized stroke care and concentrating patients who are more disabled at more advanced stroke care centers.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Organization and integration of stroke systems of care — All hospitals caring for patients within a stroke system of care should develop, adopt, and adhere to care protocols that reflect current care guidelines as established by national and international professional organizations and state and federal agencies and laws. Different services within a hospital that may be transferring patients through a continuum of care, as well as different hospitals that may be transferring patients to other facilities, should establish hand-off and transfer protocols and procedures that ensure safe and efficient patient care within and between facilities, and protocols for interhospital transfer of patients should be established and approved beforehand so that efficient patient transfers can be accomplished at all hours of the day and night. Mechanical thrombectomy requires the patient to be at an experienced stroke center with rapid access to cerebral angiography, qualified neurointerventionalists, and a comprehensive periprocedural care team, and systems should be designed, executed, and monitored to emphasize expeditious assessment and treatment and outcomes for all patients should be tracked with facilities encouraged to consider preestablished criteria for credentialing. It may be useful for primary stroke centers and other healthcare facilities that provide initial emergency care, including administration of IV alteplase, to develop the capability of performing emergency noninvasive intracranial vascular imaging to most appropriately select patients for transfer for mechanical thrombectomy and to reduce the time to mechanical thrombectomy.

### Successful endovascular stroke therapy in a 103-year-old woman [^111qE7mM]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

People older than 80 years of age constitute the most rapidly growing age group in the world. Several trials confirming superior efficacy of endovascular therapy did not have an upper age limit and showed favorable treatment effects, regardless of age. Current American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines do not restrict treatment based on age as long as other eligibility criteria are met. A 103-year-old woman presented 2 h after stroke onset secondary to a left internal carotid artery terminus (ICA-T) occlusion. Admission National Institutes of Health Stoke Scale (NIHSS) score was 38, with no early ischemic changes on imaging, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale score was 0, and she lived independently with minimal help. After initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, the patient underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy with Thombosis in Cerebral Infaction-3 recanalization. She showed remarkable recovery (NIHSS score of 1 at 48h). Stroke onset to recanalization was 3h 40min. Our objective in documenting the oldest patient to successfully undergo stroke intervention is to corroborate that with the current evidence, appropriate patients undergoing rapid treatment may allow us to advance the limits of endovascular therapy.

### Endovascular stent thrombectomy: the new standard of care for large vessel ischaemic stroke [^1114HqMQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Results of initial randomised trials of endovascular treatment for ischaemic stroke, published in 2013, were neutral but limited by the selection criteria used, early-generation devices with modest efficacy, non-consecutive enrollment, and treatment delays.

Recent Developments

In the past year, six positive trials of endovascular thrombectomy for ischaemic stroke have provided level 1 evidence for improved patient outcome compared with standard care. In most patients, thrombectomy was performed in addition to thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase, but benefits were also reported in patients ineligible for alteplase treatment. Despite differences in the details of eligibility requirements, all these trials required proof of major vessel occlusion on non-invasive imaging and most used some imaging technique to exclude patients with a large area of irreversibly injured brain tissue. The results indicate that modern thrombectomy devices achieve faster and more complete reperfusion than do older devices, leading to improved clinical outcomes compared with intravenous alteplase alone. The number needed to treat to achieve one additional patient with independent functional outcome was in the range of 3.2–7.1 and, in most patients, was in addition to the substantial efficacy of intravenous alteplase. No major safety concerns were noted, with low rates of procedural complications and no increase in symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. WHERE NEXT? Thrombectomy benefits patients across a range of ages and levels of clinical severity. A planned meta-analysis of individual patient data might clarify effects in under-represented subgroups, such as those with mild initial stroke severity or elderly patients. Imaging-based selection, used in some of the recent trials to exclude patients with large areas of irreversible brain injury, probably contributed to the proportion of patients with favourable outcomes. The challenge is how best to implement imaging in clinical practice to maximise benefit for the entire population and to avoid exclusion of patients with smaller yet clinically important potential to benefit. Although favourable imaging identifies patients who might benefit despite long delays from symptom onset to treatment, the proportion of patients with favourable imaging decreases with time. Health systems therefore need to be reorganised to deliver treatment as quickly as possible to maximise benefits. On the basis of available trial data, intravenous alteplase remains the initial treatment for all eligible patients within 4.5 h of stroke symptom onset. Those patients with major vessel occlusion should, in parallel, proceed to endovascular thrombectomy immediately rather than waiting for an assessment of response to alteplase, because minimising time to reperfusion is the ultimate aim of treatment.

### Physician transfer versus patient transfer for mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ac428]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the study by Hubert et al, the decision to pursue MT was identical in both groups and consisted of a combination of radiographic confirmation and clinical examination. The significant time saving in these models came from parallelization of processes. During the transfer time in physician transfer, the patients were already being prepared in the local angiographic suite. In patient transfer, the patients cannot be prepared until arrival to the CSC angiographic suite following transfer from initial hospital. The transfer time is also shorter for transferring physicians (and neurointerventional team) compared with a patient with ischemic stroke who requires monitoring, intravenous infusions, and cardiorespiratory support. The possibility of transferring the neurointerventional team to the initial hospital for a potential patient undergoing MT who may not eventually require MT should be considered. In the study by Hubert et al, MT was not performed after physician transfer or patient transfer because of clinical improvement or spontaneous recanalization (13% and 16%). Interestingly, an additional 14% of the patients in the patient transfer group did not receive MT due to lack of salvageable brain tissue or technical challenges. Only an additional 4% of the patients in the physician transfer did not receive MT due to technical challenges.

Another potential benefit of physician transfer is to create a more favorable ratio between the number of neurointerventionalists and procedural volume for each neurointerventionalist. Currently, hospitals with small procedural volume of MT may not transfer patients to CSCs and hire their own neurointerventionalist as evident by over a quarter of MTs performed at hospitals without advanced capability accreditation. Such an arrangement requires a much larger number of neurointerventionalists but with low procedural volume. An analysis of national inpatient Medicare data reported that 13 335 patients aged ≥ 65 years were treated by 2754 interventionalists at 641 hospitals from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. There was considerable variation in procedural volume among interventionalists with reduction in inpatient death (4% lower odds for every 10 additional MTs performed per year) and increase in discharge home or inpatient rehabilitation (3% greater adjusted odds for every 10 additional MTs performed per year). Physician transfer will allow a smaller number of neurointerventionalists to provide MT at multiple hospitals while maintaining procedural volumes that ensure favorable outcomes.

Clinical Perspective

Regional customization of stroke systems of care is required to address differences in resources, hospital certifications, geography, and population density, which is important to maximize treatment opportunities for patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). One aspect of stroke systems of care is to evaluate various approaches to delivering MT so that the access to this treatment could be maximized among eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke. There are 2 potential methods of providing MT to patients with acute ischemic stroke: transferring the neurointerventionalist to the hospital at which the patient presents with acute ischemic stroke (physician transfer) or transferring the patient from the initial hospital to a hospital that performs MT (patient transfer). A few studies with small sample sizes have suggested that physician transfer can reduce the time from emergency department arrival to initiation of MT, and increase the rates of functional independence after the procedure. Due to the small number of patients in individual studies, we performed a meta‐analysis to systematically assess the existing literature and pool together the studies to estimate the effect of physician transfer compared with patient transfer.

Acute ischemic stroke — eligibility for IV alteplase includes time windows, dosing, age and clinical criteria, and physiologic/imaging thresholds. Within 3 h, IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg over 60 min with initial 10% of dose given as bolus over 1 min) is recommended for selected patients; among otherwise medically eligible patients ≥ 18 y of age, administration within 3 h is equally recommended for patients ≤ 80 and > 80 y of age; for severe stroke, IV alteplase is indicated within 3 h; and for otherwise eligible patients with mild but disabling symptoms, IV alteplase is recommended if they can be treated within 3 h of symptom onset or last known well/baseline state. Between 3 and 4.5 h, the same dosing is recommended for selected patients, and in this window treatment is recommended for those ≤ 80 y of age, without a history of both diabetes mellitus and prior stroke, NIHSS score ≤ 25, not taking any OACs, and without imaging evidence of ischemic injury involving more than one-third of the MCA territory. Treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible within these time frames. IV alteplase is recommended in patients with BP < 185/110 mm Hg or when BP can be lowered safely to this level, in otherwise eligible patients with initial glucose levels > 50 mg/dL, and when noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) shows early ischemic changes of mild to moderate extent other than frank hypodensity.

### In-hospital cardiac arrest: a review [^115qj6qW]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In-hospital cardiac arrest is common and associated with a high mortality rate. Despite this, in-hospital cardiac arrest has received little attention compared with other high-risk cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Observations

In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in over 290 000 adults each year in the United States. Cohort data from the United States indicate that the mean age of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is 66 years, 58% are men, and the presenting rhythm is most often (81%) nonshockable (ie, asystole or pulseless electrical activity). The cause of the cardiac arrest is most often cardiac (50%-60%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (15%-40%). Efforts to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest require both a system for identifying deteriorating patients and an appropriate interventional response (eg, rapid response teams). The key elements of treatment during cardiac arrest include chest compressions, ventilation, early defibrillation, when applicable, and immediate attention to potentially reversible causes, such as hyperkalemia or hypoxia. There is limited evidence to support more advanced treatments. Post-cardiac arrest care is focused on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, hemodynamic and respiratory support, and potentially employing neuroprotective strategies (eg, targeted temperature management). Although multiple individual factors are associated with outcomes (eg, age, initial rhythm, duration of the cardiac arrest), a multifaceted approach considering both potential for neurological recovery and ongoing multiorgan failure is warranted for prognostication and clinical decision-making in the post-cardiac arrest period. Withdrawal of care in the absence of definite prognostic signs both during and after cardiac arrest should be avoided. Hospitals are encouraged to participate in national quality-improvement initiatives.

Conclusions and Relevance

An estimated 290 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States. However, there is limited evidence to support clinical decision making. An increased awareness with regard to optimizing clinical care and new research might improve outcomes.

IV alteplase pretreatment deliberation and timing — The potential risks should be discussed during thrombolysis eligibility deliberation and weighed against the anticipated benefits during decision making. It is reasonable that urgent IV alteplase treatment not be delayed while waiting for hematologic or coagulation testing if there is no reason to suspect an abnormal test. Treating clinicians should be aware that hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may mimic acute stroke presentations and determine blood glucose levels before IV alteplase initiation. IV alteplase is not indicated for nonvascular conditions. Because time from onset of symptoms to treatment has such a powerful impact on outcomes, treatment with IV alteplase should not be delayed to monitor for further improvement.

### Clinical course of a 66-year-old man with an acute ischaemic stroke in the setting of a COVID-19 infection [^116etYMt]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Having said this, the management of these patients is dependent on the likelihood of a positive outcome from the COVID-19 infection. Establishing the ceiling of care is crucial, as it prevents incredibly unwell or unfit patients' from going through futile treatments, ensuring respect and dignity in death, if this is the likely outcome. It also allows for the provision of limited or intensive resources, such as intensive care beds or endotracheal intubation during the COVID-19 pandemic, to those who are assessed by the multidisciplinary team to benefit the most from their use. The way to establish this ceiling of care is through an early multidisciplinary discussion. In this case, the patient did not convey his wishes regarding his care to the medical team or his family; therefore it was decided among intensive care specialists, respiratory physicians, stroke physicians and the patients' relatives. The patient was discussed with the intensive care team, who decided that as the patient sustained two acute life-threatening illnesses simultaneously and had rapidly deteriorated, ward-based care with a view to palliate if the further deterioration was in the patients' best interests. These decisions were not easy to make, especially as it was on the first day of presentation. This decision was made in the context of the patients' comorbidities, including COPD, the patients' age, and the availability of intensive care beds during the steep rise in intensive care admissions, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic (figure 1). Furthermore, the patients' rapid and permanent decline in GCS, entwined with the severe stroke on CT imaging of the brain made it more unlikely that significant and permanent recovery could be achieved from mechanical intubation, especially as the damage caused by the stroke could not be significantly reversed. As hospitals manage patients with COVID-19 in many parts of the world, there may be tension between the need to provide higher levels of care for an individual patient and the need to preserve finite resources to maximise the benefits for most patients. This patient presented during a steep rise in intensive care admissions, which may have influenced the early decision not to treat the patient in an intensive care setting. Retrospective studies from Wuhan investigating mortality in patients with multiple organ failure, in the setting of COVID-19, requiring intubation have demonstrated mortality can be up to 61.5%. The mortality risk is even higher in those over 65 years of age with respiratory comorbidities, indicating why this patient was unlikely to survive an admission to the intensive care unit.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — glucose management specifies that hypoglycemia should be treated and provides a reasonable target range for hyperglycemia treatment. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 60 mg/dL) should be treated in patients with AIS, and evidence indicates that persistent in-hospital hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours after AIS is associated with worse outcomes than normoglycemia; thus, it is reasonable to treat hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL and to closely monitor to prevent hypoglycemia.

Patients with a perioperative stroke should be strongly considered for evaluation for mechanical embolectomy and intravenous thrombolysis because both interventions have been shown to be safe in select patients". "Obtaining more advanced imaging initially, including CT angiography and perfusion studies, should be considered for patients with more severe stroke symptoms (NIHSS score ≥ 6 or cortical deficits) to determine eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy".

### Advanced imaging in acute ischemic stroke: an updated guide to the hub-and-spoke hospitals [^114FzmAJ]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of the hub-and-spoke system in acute stroke care, highlight the role of advanced imaging and discuss emerging concepts and trials relevant to the hub-and-spoke model.

Recent Findings

The advent of advanced stroke multimodal imaging has provided increased treatment options for patients, particularly in rural and regional areas. When used in the hub-and-spoke model, advanced imaging can help facilitate and triage transfers, appropriately select patients for acute therapy and treat patients who may otherwise be ineligible based on traditional time metrics. Recent, ongoing trials in this area may lead to an even greater range of patients being eligible for acute reperfusion therapy, including mild strokes and patients with large core infarct volumes.

Summary

Integration of advanced imaging into a hub-and-spoke system, when complemented with other systems including telemedicine, improves access to acute stroke care for patients in regional and rural areas.

### Identifying best practices to improve evaluation and management of in-hospital stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111DFH2i]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

This scientific statement describes a path to optimizing care for patients who experience an in-hospital stroke. Although these patients are in a monitored environment, their evaluation and treatment are often delayed compared with patients presenting to the emergency department, contributing to higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Reducing delays and optimizing treatment for patients with in-hospital stroke could improve outcomes. This scientific statement calls for the development of hospital systems of care and targeted quality improvement for in-hospital stroke. We propose 5 core elements to optimize in-hospital stroke care: 1. Deliver stroke training to all hospital staff, including how to activate in-hospital stroke alerts. 2. Create rapid response teams with dedicated stroke training and immediate access to neurological expertise. 3. Standardize the evaluation of patients with potential in-hospital stroke with physical assessment and imaging. 4. Address barriers to treatment potentially, including interfacility transfer to advanced stroke treatment. 5. Establish an in-hospital stroke quality oversight program delivering data-driven performance feedback and driving targeted quality improvement efforts. Additional research is needed to better understand how to reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of in-hospital stroke.

### Interfacility transfer for thrombectomy: a promising therapeutic window [^1127iiKv]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, most acute ischemic stroke patients presenting with a large vessel occlusion are first evaluated at a nonthrombectomy-capable center before transfer to a comprehensive stroke center that performs thrombectomy. Interfacility transfer is a complex process that requires extensive coordination between the referring, transporting, and receiving facilities. As a result, long delays are common, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the accumulating literature about the clinical as well as radiological-infarct growth, collateral change, arterial recanalization, and hemorrhagic transformation-changes during interfacility transfer for thrombectomy. Recent evidence shows that clinical/radiological changes during transfer are heterogeneous across patients and impact long-term functional outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to optimize care during this time window. We review some of the most promising therapeutic strategies-for example, penumbral protection to reduce infarct growth-that may improve clinical outcome in patients being transferred to thrombectomy-capable centers. Finally, we discuss key methodological considerations for designing clinical trials aimed at reducing infarct growth during transfer.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion: JACC focus seminar [^115Ty7Mt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke is a severe and life-threatening disease, particularly when caused by a large-vessel occlusion. The only available 2 treatment options are intravenous alteplase and endovascular therapy (mechanical clot removal), both of which are highly time-dependent. Thus, rapid patient transfer, diagnosis, and treatment are crucial, and time-consuming imaging methods and overly selective treatment selection criteria should be avoided. A combined endovascular therapy approach using stent-retrievers and aspiration is the most effective way to achieve fast first-pass complete reperfusion and should thus be used. To diagnose and treat patients as fast as possible, the organization of existing systems of care, and particularly pre-hospital transfer systems, have to be changed. Several different transport models are currently in use because the optimal patient transfer paradigm is highly dependent on local geography and hospital efficiency.
