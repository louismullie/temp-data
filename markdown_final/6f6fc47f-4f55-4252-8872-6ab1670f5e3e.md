## Question

would pancreatitis be found on abdominal ct

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pancreatitis can be detected on an abdominal CT scan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic criteria and whether CT findings can fulfill them. Then, I should verify optimal CT technique and timing. Next, I will examine what CT can and cannot detect, followed by when CT is indicated versus avoided. After that, I should review specific clinical scenarios that warrant CT, consider alternative modalities, address special populations, and finally synthesize a practical decision pathway before concluding, making sure I cross-check each claim against guideline-grade sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed when at least two of three are present: characteristic abdominal pain, serum amylase/lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, or characteristic findings on abdominal imaging such as CT or MRI, so CT can indeed be one of the diagnostic criteria when imaging features are present [^111wfzKF] [^113p99NM]. Hold on, I should verify the role of CT beyond diagnosis: major guidelines emphasize CT's value in staging severity and detecting complications rather than routine confirmation at presentation, which aligns with its highest yield later in the course rather than immediately at admission [^1179qkLn].

> Now, I need to check the optimal CT protocol and timing. At first glance, one might think a very early CT would capture the full picture, but wait, I should verify this — necrosis evolves over days, and early scans can miss it. Contrast-enhanced CT is preferred to assess perfusion and necrosis, with optimal initial imaging at about 72–96 hours after symptom onset, particularly in severe disease, because sensitivity for necrosis approaches near 100% after day 4, whereas early CT (< 48 hours) can underestimate severity and rarely alters management in uncomplicated cases [^1138wSCP] [^112DRa2E] [^111f2vmT]. I need to ensure safety considerations are addressed: MRI is preferred in iodinated contrast allergy or renal impairment, and non-contrast CT has limited utility for characterizing necrosis or perfusion deficits [^112DRa2E].

> Next, I will examine what CT can actually detect. Let me think through the core morphologic hallmarks: pancreatic enlargement, peripancreatic inflammatory stranding, and zones of non-enhancement indicating necrosis are well characterized on contrast CT, along with peripancreatic fluid collections and retroperitoneal complications, and CT can quantify severity using the Balthazar-based CT Severity Index, which correlates with morbidity and mortality risk [^112DRa2E] [^116dVuXp]. I should double-check that this extends to complications like hemorrhage, thrombosis, and infected collections — the guideline literature confirms CT's strength for these, especially once necrosis is established later in week one and beyond [^112DRa2E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering CT for everyone with pancreatitis. I need to confirm guideline indications and specifically when to avoid it. The ACG 2024 guideline advises against routine CT at admission for severity assessment and recommends reserving CT for diagnostic uncertainty or lack of improvement by 48–72 hours, while WSES cautions that early CT often does not change management in the first week and may not show necrosis yet [^1157XcBk] [^112DRa2E]. Let me verify real-world impact: studies show early ED CT in straightforward, afebrile first episodes rarely uncovers unexpected pathology and seldom changes management, with change rates around 0–14%, reinforcing a selective rather than routine approach early on [^112juomJ] [^1134oknu] [^113C9tHW].

> I will now specify the clinical scenarios where CT is warranted. I need to ensure I capture the key triggers: diagnostic uncertainty when enzymes and symptoms are equivocal, suspicion of alternative diagnoses such as perforation or mesenteric ischemia, severe acute pancreatitis requiring staging at 72–96 hours, failure to improve by 48–72 hours, or suspicion of local complications like necrosis, infection, hemorrhage, or thrombosis where management would change based on imaging findings [^1157XcBk] [^1166F3zp] [^111f2vmT] [^112DRa2E]. But wait, what if trauma is in the differential? For suspected pancreatic trauma, CT is first-line, and if suspicion persists with equivocal initial imaging, repeat CT within 12–24 hours is recommended; new symptoms during follow-up similarly warrant repeat CT as first-line imaging in adults [^1136bcKD] [^112DRa2E].

> Next, I should review alternatives when CT is deferred or contraindicated. Ultrasound on admission is first-line to evaluate a biliary etiology, and if the initial ultrasound is negative yet suspicion remains, repeat ultrasound or advanced biliary imaging with MRCP or EUS is appropriate; MRI is preferable when contrast risks are present or when ductal detail is needed, and is a viable alternative to CT for severe pancreatitis staging in appropriate patients [^111Cgi61] [^113UkjmJ] [^112CnJQd] [^111f2vmT] [^112DRa2E]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with idiopathic pancreatitis workups, where MRCP and EUS play pivotal roles to uncover occult etiologies, which it does per ACG 2024 [^112CnJQd].

> Let me consider special populations before I synthesize. In pediatrics, I need to ensure radiation stewardship: CT or MRI is recommended to assess suspected complications and to characterize collections prior to intervention, but unnecessary CT should be avoided given documented overuse without clear indications in a sizable minority of cases; MRI may be favored when available to limit radiation, and CT remains important when complications are suspected or intervention is planned [^114TDhmu] [^1134tXdT]. For chronic pancreatitis, I should verify first-line imaging: CT or MRI are guideline-supported starting points for diagnosis and for planning interventions, with selection tailored to clinical context and local expertise [^1133Bmqa] [^116mY9CP].

> I should now synthesize a practical decision pathway and double-check that it tracks with the evidence. Initial diagnosis relies on clinical pain plus enzymes without routine CT; focus on early resuscitation and supportive care, obtain ultrasound to evaluate for biliary cause, and reserve CT for uncertainty or if the patient fails to improve within 48–72 hours; in severe disease or when complications are suspected, obtain contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) optimally at 72–96 hours to stage necrosis and guide interventions; use follow-up CT selectively for new symptoms or pre-procedural planning that would alter management [^111wfzKF] [^1157XcBk] [^113UkjmJ] [^1138wSCP] [^111f2vmT]. Hmm, wait a minute — should early CT ever be done in unequivocal, mild cases? The data say it rarely changes management and can be deferred unless atypical features or diagnostic doubts arise, which aligns with these steps [^112juomJ] [^1134oknu].

> In conclusion, pancreatitis can be found on abdominal CT, particularly with contrast-enhanced studies obtained after 72–96 hours, which are most informative for staging and complications; however, routine early CT in uncomplicated, clinically clear cases is not recommended because it seldom changes management, may miss evolving necrosis, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation, so CT should be targeted to diagnostic ambiguity, severe disease, suspected complications, failure to improve, trauma, or when results will change care [^112DRa2E] [^1157XcBk] [^1134oknu].

Yes, pancreatitis is **detectable on abdominal CT** — especially with contrast-enhanced CT (CECT), which can show pancreatic enlargement, peripancreatic fat stranding, fluid collections, and necrosis [^112DRa2E]. However, **early CT (< 48–72 h) may miss necrosis** and is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient deteriorates [^112DRa2E] [^1157XcBk]. CT is most useful after 72–96 hours to assess severity and complications, and is preferred when the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected [^112DRa2E] [^1138wSCP].

---

## CT findings in acute pancreatitis

CT provides **characteristic findings** that help confirm acute pancreatitis:

- **Pancreatic enlargement**: Diffuse or focal swelling of the pancreas.

- **Peripancreatic fat stranding**: Inflammation of the surrounding fat tissue.

- **Fluid collections**: Presence of peripancreatic fluid collections or pseudocysts.

- **Pancreatic necrosis**: Non-enhancing areas within the pancreas indicating necrosis.

- **Extrapancreatic inflammation**: Inflammation extending beyond the pancreas, which can be quantified using the EPIC score [^1152et87].

---

## Timing of CT imaging

The timing of CT is critical for diagnosing and assessing pancreatitis severity. Early CT (< 48–72 hours) may not detect **pancreatic necrosis or complications** because these findings typically evolve over several days [^1128STCb] [^112juomJ]; therefore, routine early CT is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient is deteriorating clinically [^1157XcBk]. Optimal timing (**72–96 hours**) after symptom onset provides the most accurate assessment of necrosis and complications, with sensitivity approaching 100% for detecting necrosis [^1138wSCP].

---

## Clinical guidelines for CT imaging in pancreatitis

Several **clinical guidelines** provide clear recommendations on the use of CT in pancreatitis:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2024 | - Avoid routine early CT imaging <br/> - Reserve CT for unclear diagnosis or clinical deterioration [^1157XcBk] |
| World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) 2019 | - Obtain CT when diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected <br/> - Optimal timing is 72–96 hours after symptom onset [^1128STCb] [^1138wSCP] |
| Canadian Journal of Surgery (BPIGS) 2016 | Obtain CT when the differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis or when local complications are suspected [^116X1AVn] |

---

## Limitations and pitfalls of CT imaging

While CT is highly effective in diagnosing pancreatitis, certain pitfalls remain. Early CT can miss pancreatic necrosis or complications, resulting in false-negative studies [^1128STCb]. Radiation exposure is inherent to CT and is a particular concern in younger patients or when multiple scans are needed. Iodinated contrast carries risks for patients with renal impairment or contrast allergies.

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

In certain clinical scenarios, **alternative imaging modalities** may be preferred:

- **Ultrasound**: Recommended as the initial imaging modality to evaluate biliary etiology, particularly in suspected gallstone pancreatitis [^1127rDRD] [^113UkjmJ].

- **MRI**: Preferred in patients with contrast allergies, renal impairment, or when detailed evaluation of the pancreatic duct is required [^1155SZET].

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: Useful in detecting microlithiasis or small gallstones not visible on CT or standard ultrasound [^1155SZET].

---

## Role of CT in chronic pancreatitis

CT also plays a significant role in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis, characterized by pancreatic atrophy, calcifications, and irregularities or strictures of the pancreatic duct. CT or MRI is recommended as **first-line imaging** for chronic pancreatitis [^1133Bmqa].

---

## Clinical scenarios where CT is particularly useful

CT is **particularly useful** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Severe acute pancreatitis**: To assess the extent of pancreatic necrosis and guide management [^1138wSCP].

- **Suspected complications**: Such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or vascular complications.

- **Unclear diagnosis**: When the clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis is uncertain [^1128STCb].

---

## Conclusion

Pancreatitis can be **detected on abdominal CT**, especially with contrast-enhanced CT. CT is most accurate when performed 72–96 hours after symptom onset and is particularly useful for assessing severity and complications. Early CT is not recommended unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient is deteriorating clinically. Alternative imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and MRI, may be preferred in specific clinical scenarios.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, specifically concerning abdominal imaging like CT/MRI, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding routine CT scans at admission to determine the severity of acute pancreatitis. Instead, it should be reserved for patients with an unclear diagnosis or those who are not showing clinical improvement within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112DRa2E]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

An early CT scan will not show necrotic or ischemic areas and will not modify the clinical management during the first week of the illness. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain, CT should be considered, especially to rule out secondary perforation peritonitis or mesenteric ischemia. It also shows active hemorrhage and thrombosis associated with pancreatitis.

CECT has been shown to yield an early overall detection rate of 90% with close to 100% sensitivity after 4 days for pancreatic necrosis. Balthazar et al. established a CT severity index that graded pancreatitis based on the degree of inflammation, presence of fluid collections, and extent of necrosis; a higher score is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

- **CT severity index (Modified from: Balthazar EJ, Robinson DL, Megibow AJ, Ranson JH. Acute pancreatitis: value of CT in establishing prognosis. Radiology. 1990; 174:331–6)**: CT severity index = grade score (0–4) + necrosis score (0–6).

CECT is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis, staging, and detection of complications of acute pancreatitis, and it has major roles in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected AP. These roles include: (i) diagnosis, (ii) staging of the severity, and (iii) detection of complications, particularly the identification and quantification of (peri)pancreatic necrosis. However, frequent repeat CT scans increase the total radiation dose and have limited effect in subsequent decision-making.

MRI is preferable to CECT in patients with allergy to iodinated contrast, and in patients with renal impairment or insufficiency.

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis through collaboration with a panel of experts. They contain 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements, such as severity grading, imaging, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and most aspects of management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, the evidence is quite weak and requires further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

### Pancreatic CT perfusion: Quantitative meta-analysis of disease discrimination, protocol development, and effect of CT parameters [^113dnS3m]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

We explored the PubMed library, searching the database for published studies using the key terms 'pancreas' or 'pancreatic', 'dynamic' or 'perfusion', and 'computed tomography' or 'CT'. All CT perfusion research studies published and indexed before July 3, 2020, were collected. A total of 491 research articles published from 1982 to 2020 were obtained from the search.

In the first step, these research articles were scanned manually based on their titles and abstracts for inclusion/exclusion. In the second step, all suitable studies were then read and assessed by two authors independently (N.V. and S.S.). Disagreements regarding study inclusion/exclusion were resolved by consensus-based discussions in two cases.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: We included studies that (1) reported original data, (2) included original human data, (3) included at least five or more datasets, (4) included measurements of the pancreas or pancreatic pathologies, and (5) reported quantitative perfusion parameters from perfusion CT. All study designs (prospective and retrospective) were included. Studies that had a cohort overlapping with previously published studies were not considered original data and were excluded. Articles reporting different perfusion measurements for the same patient collective were counted as one study since patient data were acquired only once. Reviews, animal studies, or case reports (less than five patients) were excluded. To distinguish perfusion CT from conventional contrast-enhanced CT studies, only studies that reported quantitative perfusion parameters were included.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children is increasing, but causes and diagnostic and therapeutic methods vary across different centers. This study aimed to investigate the common causes and routine diagnostic and therapeutic methods of acute pancreatitis in children at a pediatric gastrointestinal referral center and their accordance with existing guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 60 children diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were examined.

- **Results**: The most common causes of acute pancreatitis were systemic and metabolic diseases and medications. CT scans were performed on 36% of patients; however, 31% of these did not have a clear indication for a CT scan. Only half of the patients received fluid 1.5 times their maintenance in the first 24 hours. Antibiotic therapy was administered to 48% of patients, but medical indications for antibiotic treatment were identified in only 34% of cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative incidence of acute pancreatitis increased.

- **Conclusions**: In children with systemic and metabolic diseases and those using anticonvulsant drugs, it is important to consider the incidence of this disease. Clinical education should emphasize the risks of radiation due to unnecessary CT scans and the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. More research should explore the association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^117NqHXs]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Computed tomography was performed using different types of CT scanners in the participating centers, ranging from 4- to 16-slice or more CT machines. All patients received intravenous contrast medium; no oral or rectal contrast agents were administered. In 16 patients (1.6%), an unenhanced CT was conducted due to known renal failure (n = 14) or previous reactions to contrast agents (n = 2).

- **Image evaluation**:
	- The CT scans were evaluated using the same standardized approach as the ultrasound examinations. The assessments included general image findings and specific radiological features such as image quality, fat infiltration, free fluid, abscess, free intraperitoneal air, and fistulas. Detailed image evaluation was performed for each organ, including the gallbladder, bile duct, liver, pancreas, appendix, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, vascular system, kidneys, and, when applicable, female genitalia. If no abnormalities were detected, further specification was not required. However, when abnormalities were observed, further specification was necessary, and a CT diagnosis was recorded. Similar to ultrasound, no predefined set of criteria per diagnosis was provided to assist observers in their diagnostic assignments.

- **Reference standard**:
	- A final diagnosis was determined after six months by an independent expert panel consisting of two experienced gastrointestinal surgeons and an experienced abdominal radiologist.

### Multi-detector computed tomography of acute abdomen [^116w2ht4]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common causes for referrals to the emergency department. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain characterizing the "acute abdomen" requires rapid and accurate identification of a potentially life-threatening abdominal pathology to provide a timely referral to the appropriate physician. While the physical examination and laboratory investigations are often non-specific, computed tomography (CT) has evolved as the first-line imaging modality in patients with an acute abdomen. Because the new multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner generations provide increased speed, greater volume coverage, and thinner slices, the acceptance of CT for abdominal imaging has increased rapidly. The goal of this article is to discuss the role of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of acute abdominal pain.

### Does early ED CT scanning of afebrile patients with first episodes of acute pancreatitis ever change management [^112juomJ]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Rising utilization of computed tomography (CT) imaging early in the course of acute pancreatitis (AP) has been recently reported. However, radiographic demonstration of the degree of necrosis or the presence of complications is not fully apparent within the first days of an acute attack. The objective of this study was to examine if CT scanning early in the course of disease (< 48 h of symptoms) in afebrile patients with an emergency department (ED) diagnosis of the first episode of AP revealed any unanticipated pathology that altered clinical management.

A retrospective chart review of all adult patients with a first episode of AP without fever admitted to the medical ward through the ED of our community hospital from January 1, 2011, to May 31, 2012, was performed. In cases in which CT scans were performed, the record was reviewed to determine if any unexpected findings were uncovered or if patient care was altered by the CT report. Two hundred forty-eight patients were admitted with an ED diagnosis of AP; 26.2% (n = 65) met inclusion criteria; 70.8% (n = 46) received a CT scan within 48 hours of symptom onset. No patient who underwent CT scanning had an unexpected finding (95% CI, 0.923–1.0). Our results demonstrate that afebrile patients with first episodes of AP do not benefit from early abdominal CT imaging. These results support the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommendation that CT is not indicated in the first 48 hours after symptom onset in unequivocal cases of AP.

### Evaluation of unusual causes of pancreatitis: Role of cross-sectional imaging [^116FyHWf]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

There are widely diverse causes of pancreatitis. Gallstones and alcohol have been recognized as the most common causes of pancreatitis, accounting for 90% of cases. However, acute and chronic pancreatitis may also result from a variety of uncommon causes. The determination of the etiology is important for patient management and prevention of recurrence. Sludge is the most common cause of idiopathic or recurrent acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasonography is considered the most accurate diagnostic test for this abnormality. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have only a limited role in the diagnosis of sludge. However, papillitis observed on contrast-enhanced CT and MR may provide clues to the detection of pancreatitis secondary to sludge, a small stone, or a recently passed stone. Radiological studies, clinical presentation, and laboratory data can be helpful in determining the etiology of unusual causes of pancreatitis, such as anatomic anomalies, autoimmune pancreatitis, groove pancreatitis, and traumatic pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis: Value of CT in establishing prognosis [^116dVuXp]. Radiology (1990). High credibility.

The CT Severity Index (CTSI) for acute pancreatitis is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis in patients. It is based on computed tomography (CT) findings and is used to predict the clinical outcome of the disease. The CTSI is particularly useful in stratifying patients into different risk categories, which can guide management and treatment decisions. It takes into account factors such as the presence and extent of pancreatic inflammation, pancreatic necrosis, and extrapancreatic complications. The score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that the CTSI is most useful in the setting of acute pancreatitis and may not be as relevant in chronic pancreatitis or other pancreatic diseases.

The CT severity index for acute pancreatitis is a tool used to assess the condition's severity by examining two key inputs: the findings on a CT scan and the extent of pancreatic necrosis. These factors are each assigned specific scores that contribute to an overall severity score.

- **CT findings evaluations and scores**:
	- **Normal pancreas**: 0 points
	- **Focal or diffuse pancreatic enlargement**: 1 point
	- **Pancreatic inflammation and/or peripancreatic fat**: 2 points
	- **Single peripancreatic fluid collection**: 3 points
	- **Two or more fluid collections and/or presence of retroperitoneal air**: 4 points

The extent of necrosis is assessed…

### Approach to patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis: a comprehensive review [^1176W8zV]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) represents a significant health care burden in the United States. Diagnosing it early and accurately is important for the efficient management of these patients. However, the early diagnosis of CP, when structural and functional pancreatic changes are subtle, remains difficult. Complicating this is the large cohort of patients with nonspecific abdominal pain who are often suspected of having early CP and who utilize significant health care resources in attempts at diagnosis and management. We present a review of the diagnostic tests available for making an early diagnosis of CP. We further report our approach to patients suspected of having CP based on the available literature.

### Imaging of acute pancreatitis [^115NTfGV]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is defined as an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas with variable involvement of peripancreatic tissues or remote organ systems. This article reports on the classification, definition and terminology, epidemiology and etiology, pathogenesis and pathological findings, clinical and laboratory findings, and imaging findings of acute pancreatitis with emphasis on cross-sectional imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^111f2vmT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statements on imaging**: On admission, ultrasound (US) should be performed to determine the etiology of acute pancreatitis, specifically biliary causes. When doubt exists, computed tomography (CT) provides good evidence of the presence or absence of pancreatitis. All patients with severe acute pancreatitis need to be assessed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The optimal timing for the first CE-CT assessment is 72–96 hours after the onset of symptoms. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound should be considered to screen for occult common bile duct stones in patients with unknown etiology.

- **Discussion**: On admission, determining the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is crucial to project the need for definitive treatment, such as cholecystectomy for gallstone disease, and to avoid recurrence by addressing factors like alcohol intake or hypertriglyceridemia. The treatment and follow-up depend on the etiology of the AP. A transabdominal ultrasound should be performed on admission when appropriate. Almost all AP guidelines worldwide, based on revisions and meta-analyses, recommend performing an ultrasound on admission or within the first 48 hours.

	- In the majority of patients with AP, CT is not required. The extension of the (peri)pancreatic necrosis may be detected with a contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) after 72 hours from the onset of AP. Concerns have been raised over post-contrast acute kidney injury (AKI). A recent meta-analysis with 28 observational studies and over 100,000 participants found no evidence to support the association of CE-CT with AKI.

### Imaging of blunt pancreatic trauma [^115KucWH]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Blunt pancreatic trauma is an exceedingly rare but life-threatening injury with significant mortality. Computed tomography (CT) is commonly employed as the initial imaging modality in blunt trauma patients and affords a timely diagnosis of pancreatic trauma. The CT findings of pancreatic trauma can be broadly categorized:

- **Direct signs**: Including pancreatic laceration, which tends to be specific but lacks sensitivity.
- **Indirect signs**: Such as peripancreatic fluid, which are sensitive but lack specificity.

In patients with equivocal CT findings or ongoing clinical suspicion of pancreatic trauma, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be employed for further evaluation. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is of crucial importance, and though injury of the duct may be strongly suggested upon initial CT, MRCP provides clear delineation of the duct and any potential injuries. This article aims to review and illustrate the CT and magnetic resonance imaging findings of blunt pancreatic trauma and delineate the integration of these modalities into the appropriate imaging triage of severely injured blunt trauma patients.

### A study of radiological scoring system evaluating extrapancreatic inflammation with conventional radiological and clinical scores in predicting outcomes in acute pancreatitis [^113KnawB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastroenterological emergency with varying severity. Predicting the severity and outcome in AP can guide appropriate triage of the patients and direct specialist care for those likely to have severe AP. A number of parameters have been assessed for the prediction of severity in AP. These include single parameters such as the presence of pleural effusion, obesity, age, serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hematocrit, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, as well as multi-parameter scores like Ranson's score, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Bedside Index of Severity in AP (BISAP), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II score. BISAP is a 5-parameter score that includes blood urea nitrogen, impaired mental status, presence of SIRS, age, and pleural effusion.

The role of computed tomographic (CT) examination for the prediction of severe AP has also been evaluated, and many scores such as Balthazar grade, CT severity index (CTSI), modified CTSI (MCTSI), extrapancreatic inflammation on CT (EPIC) score, and renal rim sign have also been evaluated. The comparative data on clinical scoring systems and radiological scores is limited. Moreover, the data on the comparison of CT scores with BISAP is scarce, and it is not clear if CT is needed for prognostication in AP when an assessment with BISAP has been made on admission.

The prognostic significance of scoring systems like the EPIC score and renal rim grade, which evaluate extrapancreatic inflammation, is also not clear.

### Clinical course for pancreatic necrosis and pancreatic pseudocysts due to severe acute or chronic pancreatitis [^114NQTaX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis is a potentially serious inflammatory disease that can lead to multiple organ failure. It is divided into acute and chronic forms. Acute pancreatitis (AP) can be classified into three distinct categories: mild, moderate, and severe forms. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pathologic fibro-inflammatory syndrome of the pancreas that develops persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. Common features of established and advanced CP include pancreatic atrophy, fibrosis, pain syndromes, duct distortion and strictures, calcifications, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, pancreatic endocrine dysfunction, and dysplasia. AP is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders requiring acute hospitalization worldwide, with a reported increasing annual incidence of 13–45 cases per 100,000 persons, whereas CP ranges from 5 to 12 cases per 100,000 persons. Local complications include peripancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis (sometimes infected), and formation of pseudocysts and walled-off necrosis (WON).

AP is diagnosed when at least two of the following three criteria are met: (i) upper abdominal pain, typically radiating belt-like to both sides and excluding pain from other conditions; (ii) an increased level of serum lipase exceeding three-fold the upper limit of normal; (iii) typical findings in sectional image studies, such as transabdominal sonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggestive of AP. Definitive CP can be diagnosed by imaging criteria (CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasound).

### Acute pancreatitis: International classification and nomenclature [^117EmX1n]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing, posing a significant healthcare concern. New insights into pathophysiology, improved imaging techniques, and novel treatment options for complicated AP have prompted an update to the 1992 Atlanta Classification. Updated nomenclature for pancreatic collections based on imaging criteria is proposed. Adoption of the newly Revised Classification of Acute Pancreatitis 2012 by radiologists is essential for standardizing reports and facilitating the accurate conveyance of relevant findings to referring physicians involved in the care of patients with AP. This review aims to clarify the nomenclature of pancreatic collections in the setting of AP.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^116RRvWR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal X-rays are neither sensitive nor specific for acute pathology in older adults in the ED. In contrast to ultrasound and CT scan use patterns, over the 2007–2019 time period, X-ray administration decreased for all age groups. Despite this decline, use remains high, particularly in the older adult population, where 13% of abdominal pain visits received an X-ray as the sole diagnostic imaging modality in 2019. While NHAMCS does not indicate the anatomical target of X-ray imaging, in this population who presented with abdominal pain, the majority of X-rays likely are abdominal plain films. Abdominal X-ray is an appropriate imaging modality for confirming gastric tube placement or identifying kidney stones, but we did not find evidence that these uses contributed meaningfully to utilization of this imaging technique. We also did not find evidence that EGS diagnoses where X-ray without CT is an appropriate means of diagnosis (e.g. gastrostomy tube confirmation) accounted for relatively high rates of plain film use. This suggests that dissemination of knowledge about this potentially ineffective, and relatively high radiation dose abdominal imaging modality may reduce overuse and improve outcomes.

Female patients comprise 55% of overall ED visits nationally, but 67% of abdominal pain visits. This difference was primarily driven by visits from reproductive-age women, for whom there is additional diagnostic complexity due to chronic, painful conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, due to pregnancy, and due to acute conditions that can present with pain such as ovarian issues.

### Integrating CT-based radiomics and clinical features to better predict the prognosis of acute pancreatitis [^116A7eLU]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

This study received approval from the local institutional ethics committee, and the requirement for written informed consent has been waived due to its retrospective nature. Acute pancreatitis (AP) patients were retrospectively screened from August 2015 to March 2022. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows:

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	1. Patients were diagnosed with AP according to the revised Atlanta classification and definitions (2012 version) and underwent an upper abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan within 72 hours of symptom onset.
	2. All patients were treated with fasting, acid and enzyme suppression, fluid infusion, and laboratory tests obtained during hospitalization.
	3. Patients underwent a subsequent abdominal follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan at 7–10 days after the initial CT scan according to the revised Atlanta classification and definitions (2012 version).

The exclusion criteria consisted of:

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	1. Patients diagnosed with concomitant tumors or chronic wasting disease.
	2. Patients with a history of chronic pancreatitis were excluded due to the potential assessment bias induced by chronic interstitial changes, excluding acute onset of chronic pancreatitis.
	3. Patients with incomplete clinical data.
	4. CT images of poor quality.
	5. Patients younger than 18 years.

The various clinical characteristics of patients, such as gender, age, etiology, history of diabetes, severity of AP, Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), were collected.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^115m3FZ4]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing in incidence across the world and in all age groups. Major changes in management have occurred in the last decade. Avoiding total parenteral nutrition and prophylactic antibiotics, avoiding overly aggressive fluid resuscitation, initiating early feeding, avoiding endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of concomitant cholangitis, same-admission cholecystectomy, and minimally invasive approaches to infected necrosis should now be standard care.

There is an increasing recognition of the risk of recurrence of AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis, along with the unexpectedly high risk of diabetes and exocrine insufficiency after AP. These are the subjects of large ongoing studies. In this review, we provide an update on important changes in management for this increasingly common disease.

### Abdominal free fluid in acute pancreatitis predicts necrotizing pancreatitis and organ failure [^111XB4Qu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

This study is a single-center retrospective clinical investigation designed to assess whether free abdominal fluid in acute pancreatitis can predict subsequent outcomes, including pancreatic necrosis, organ failure, and mortality.

Data were extracted from electronic medical records at the University of California San Diego Medical Center (La Jolla, CA). Patients receiving medical care between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2019, were considered. The study included patients at least 18 years of age, diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, and who had at least two cross-sectional imaging studies within three months of diagnosis. A diagnosis of acute pancreatitis required the presence of two of the following: lipase elevation greater than three times the upper limit of normal, imaging evidence of pancreatitis, or characteristic abdominal pain. Subjects were required to have an initial contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging study (CT or MRI) without pancreatic necrosis and a follow-up imaging study within three months to reassess for pancreatic necrosis development. The subsequent imaging study could be pancreatitis-related, biliary-related, or for an unrelated indication.

Patients with pancreatic necrosis evident on the initial imaging study, pre-existing ascites, or risk factors for ascites (such as cirrhosis, prior cardiac ascites, peritoneal dialysis, recent abdominal surgery) were excluded from the study.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^113Ts4aJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

In cases of idiopathic pancreatitis, a biliary etiology should be ruled out using two ultrasound examinations. If necessary, MRCP and/or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be conducted to prevent re-pancreatitis (2B).

Idiopathic acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as pancreatitis with no etiology established after initial laboratory and imaging tests. For patients with idiopathic AP, at least two ultrasound (US) examinations should be performed to exclude biliary causes. Afterwards, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) and EUS, performed after the acute phase, are necessary steps to assess microlithiasis, neoplasm, or chronic pancreatitis. If EUS results are negative, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be utilized to identify morphological abnormalities. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to prevent recurrent idiopathic acute pancreatitis, there is insufficient evidence currently to support its routine use.

There is no "gold standard" prognostic score for predicting the severity of acute pancreatitis. The Bedside Index of Severity of Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) is probably one of the most accurate and applicable scoring systems in everyday clinical practice due to its simplicity and capability to predict severity, mortality, and organ failure. It is comparable to the very complex APACHE-II and other existing scores (1B).

Numerous scoring systems have been developed to predict severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), but evidence on their predictive performance varies. Presently, no systematic review has assessed the accuracy of different clinical scoring systems used to predict severity and mortality in individuals with acute pancreatitis.

### Can early endoscopic ultrasound predict pancreatic necrosis in acute pancreatitis [^117HCbVF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complex acute inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and surrounding tissues that is usually mild in the majority of patients. However, the clinical course of this disease is highly variable and, in up to 20% of patients, the attack may be severe, leading to a variety of local and systemic complications, a prolonged hospital stay, and significant morbidity and mortality. The factors that determine the severity of AP have not been completely understood; hence, it is difficult to predict the clinical course of patients with AP.

Pancreatic necrosis (PN) develops in up to 15% of patients with AP, and patients with PN have markedly increased morbidity and mortality compared to those with non-necrotizing interstitial pancreatitis. The majority of patients who develop organ failure and life-threatening complications of AP have necrotizing pancreatitis. The increased morbidity and mortality in this subgroup of patients can be reduced by detecting the PN accurately and early in the disease course so that appropriate preventative measures, such as fluid resuscitation and intensive care monitoring, can be timely instituted. PN is currently detected by the loss of vascular enhancement on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. However, on cross-sectional imaging, the signs of PN evolve over several days, and therefore its full extent may not be completely apparent on a contrast-enhanced CT for up to three days after the disease onset. Thus, an early CT may not be able to detect PN.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^116cenKo]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

For a diagnostic study to impact clinical practice, results should be obtained in a representative population and setting. This multicenter study closely mimicked daily practice. A large number of residents and radiological observers with varying levels of experience participated. The multicenter setting included university and teaching hospitals. We believe that our results reflect the performance of imaging strategies in daily practice and are relevant to physicians managing patients with acute abdominal pain.

Use of imaging has been widely investigated for the two most common causes of acute abdominal pain: acute appendicitis and diverticulitis. In patients with suspected diverticulitis, imaging is helpful in detecting complications to assist in therapeutic decisions. For suspected acute appendicitis, extensive use of CT has been shown to reduce rates of negative appendectomy and lower overall hospital costs by preventing unnecessary admissions and surgical explorations. Although imaging generally showed a positive effect on patient outcomes in acute appendicitis, the ideal diagnostic strategy remains a matter of debate, as imaging might not be necessary for certain presentations.

In unselected patients with acute abdominal pain, studies have shown that the use of diagnostic imaging positively affects clinical diagnosis and influences management decisions. Diagnostic laparoscopy has also been shown to be an accurate investigation in patients with acute abdominal pain.

### Classification of acute pancreatitis — 2012: Revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions by international consensus [^111wfLbS]. Gut (2013). High credibility.

The Revised Atlanta Classification for Acute Pancreatitis is a clinical scoring system used to classify the severity of acute pancreatitis. This classification system is applicable to patients who present with symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood.

The Revised Atlanta Classification provides a standardized approach to stratify patients into different severity levels based on clinical and imaging findings. It categorizes acute pancreatitis into two phases: early (first week) and late (after the first week), and further classifies the disease into mild, moderately severe, and severe. This classification helps in predicting the clinical course, management, and prognosis of the disease.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to guide clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate level of care, potential need for interventions, and to predict patient outcomes. It also aids in communication between healthcare providers and in research settings.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Revised Atlanta Classification. However, it should be noted that it is not designed to diagnose acute pancreatitis, but rather to classify the severity of the disease in patients in whom a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis has already been established based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^111DcXgA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the management of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Over the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. The diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically.

Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation, and resuscitative measures should begin as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12–24 hours and may have little benefit beyond this timeframe.

Patients with AP and concomitant acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 hours of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or post-procedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate the necrosis should be administered.

### Acute pancreatitis in 60 Iranian children: Do pediatricians follow the new guidelines in diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis [^111ufVxZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis in children is increasing, but the causes and diagnostic and therapeutic methods vary across different centers. The aim of this study was to investigate the common causes and routine diagnostic and therapeutic methods of acute pancreatitis in children at a pediatric gastrointestinal referral center and their accordance with existing guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 60 children with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were studied.

- **Results**: The most common causes of acute pancreatitis were systemic and metabolic diseases and medications. A CT scan was performed for 36% of patients, but 31% of these patients had no clear indication for the CT scan. Only half of the patients received fluid 1.5 times their maintenance in the first 24 hours. Antibiotic therapy was administered to 48% of patients, but medical indications for antibiotic treatment were found in only 34% of cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the relative incidence of acute pancreatitis increased.

- **Conclusions**: In children with systemic and metabolic diseases and those using anticonvulsant drugs, it is important to consider the incidence of this disease. In clinical education, the risks of radiation due to unnecessary CT scans and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics need to be emphasized. More research should be conducted to study the association between COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2016). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis" for acute pancreatitis and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^116vydwn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in this patient is straightforward, as he presents with characteristic abdominal pain and a markedly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not necessary in this case; it will neither assist in diagnosis nor be useful in predicting severity, especially since most patients (80%) will improve. CT should be reserved for patients with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of amylase/lipase that could be nonspecific.

The etiology of AP in this patient is unclear. Identifying the etiology is important for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol are the most common causes of AP. While an ultrasound (US) is indicated as an initial evaluation for AP, a negative examination does not rule out a biliary etiology. A gallbladder stone may have passed into the common bile duct and been missed by the US, regardless of whether it has passed to the duodenum. Although initial US may be negative, given the prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the examination should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found.

Alcohol is a common cause of AP but requires relatively large amounts of alcohol (50 g) consumption over multiple years to result in pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? It is unlikely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride level is below 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor.

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^1155SZET]. Pancreas (2023). Low credibility.

- **Clinical strategies**: Currently, there are no validated models to predict acute pancreatitis (AP) severity early on, and therapeutic options are limited to supportive care. However, several diagnostic tools exist that attempt to classify patients into subgroups to determine whether admission into the intensive care unit (ICU) is probable.

- **Diagnostic tools**: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the preferred imaging technique for determining the extent of pancreatic inflammation and identifying complications such as (peri)pancreatic necrosis stemming from AP. However, the risk associated with repeated radiation exposure limits contrast-enhanced computed tomography as a monitoring tool for AP patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred when minimal radioactive exposure or better evaluation of the pancreatic duct is required. Although imaging evidence of pancreatitis is only one of the three criteria for the diagnosis of AP, these modalities are also helpful in identifying potential complications. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is also used to identify gallstones as a potential AP etiology. Endoscopic ultrasound can be performed to screen for microlithiasis or choledocholithiasis when clinical suspicion is high, but right upper quadrant ultrasound is negative. Disease severity is determined using either the Revised Atlanta Classification or the Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity. Each of these classification systems was published in the same year, with similar categories for patients based on organ failure. Both classification systems have been compared.

### A systematic review of the predictive factors for the recurrence of acute pancreatitis [^111MXoBq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas, with variable involvement of other regional tissues or remote organ systems. It is considered the most common pancreatic disease, with an incidence of 34 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide, totaling 2.8 million new cases per year. Higher occurrences are reported in nations such as Japan, the United States, and Taiwan. Recent studies indicate an incidence of 40 cases per 100,000 in Europe, with an overall increasing trend.

AP has a mortality rate of 2% in Western countries and up to 7.5% in Asia. According to the Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC), a diagnosis of AP can be established by identifying at least two of the following three characteristics: abdominal pain compatible with AP; serum lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or transabdominal ultrasonography (US).

The etiology of AP is most commonly alcoholic (AAP) or biliary (BAP), with variations based on geographical region or age group of the affected population.

- **Disease classification**: According to the RAC, AP is classified into three categories by disease severity:
	- **Mild AP**: Defined by the lack of organ failure, typically with a short, self-resolving course.
	- **Moderately severe AP**: Characterized by transient organ failure (present for less than 48 hours) and/or local complications.
	- **Severe AP**: Defined by persistent organ failure (present for more than 48 hours).

### Acute pancreatitis: a comparison of intervention rates precipitated by early vs guideline CT scan timing [^112ePo47]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess whether computed tomography (CT) examination earlier in acute pancreatitis (AP) precipitates any surgical or radiological intervention.

- **Materials and methods**: A single-centre retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing intervention rates in AP precipitated by early (less than 6 days of admission, n = 100) and UK guideline (6 or more days of admission, n = 103) CT examinations.

- **Results**: Performing CT before the sixth day of admission in AP did not precipitate any interventions. A statistically significant larger number of interventions were precipitated when CT was conducted on the sixth day or later (p < 0.05). It is noteworthy that this study used the day of admission, rather than the day of symptom onset. Six patients underwent repeat CT examinations during the same admission after an early CT examination.

- **Conclusion**: Conducting CT before the sixth day of admission does not lead to earlier intervention. Such early examinations waste resources and may offer false reassurance to clinicians.

### CT of blunt pancreatic trauma: a pictorial essay [^11166fDc]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Blunt trauma to the pancreas is uncommon, and clinical features are often non-specific and unreliable, leading to possible delays in diagnosis and increased morbidity. CT has been established as the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of abdominal solid-organ injury in blunt trauma patients. The introduction of multidetector-row CT allows for high-resolution scans and multiplanar reformations, which improve diagnosis. Detection of pancreatic injuries on CT requires knowledge of the subtle changes produced by pancreatic injury. The CT appearance of pancreatic injury ranges from a normal initial appearance of the pancreas to active pancreatic bleeding. Knowledge of CT signs of pancreatic trauma and a high index of suspicion are required in diagnosing pancreatic injury.

### Imaging of acute pancreatitis and its complications [^116Y8dGT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis may present with either mild or severe disease, with the latter comprising a minority of cases but accounting for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with the condition. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the mainstay of imaging for patients with acute pancreatitis and is widely used in both community and academic settings. It effectively depicts a variety of retroperitoneal morphologic changes, and the correct assessment of these abnormalities is imperative for management. This review aims to describe the imaging evaluation of patients with acute pancreatitis, utilizing the 1992 Atlanta Symposium classification and definitions to describe local complications depicted on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Correlation with the proposed revision of Atlanta Symposium definitions set forth by the Acute Pancreatitis Working Group will also be discussed.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^1134oknu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

There are roughly 300,000 hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis annually in the United States. Many of the affected patients at our institution undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unnecessarily early during their admissions. We hypothesize that cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of admission in patients meeting the criteria for acute, mild pancreatitis is over-utilized and does not change management.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis from our tertiary care institution from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were a lipase level more than three times the upper limit of normal and clinical suspicion of pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, chronic pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis, and ultrasound findings being the reason for imaging.

- **Results**: Of the 166 patients who met the criteria for analysis, 105 (63.3%) underwent cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of presentation (CT: 104, MRI: 1). Of the examined CTs, 27 (26.0%) showed no abnormality and 55 (52.9%) revealed uncomplicated pancreatitis. The remaining 22 (21.2%) demonstrated at least one of the following: local complications, biliary ductal dilation, or other findings. On thorough chart review, only two patients received a beneficial change in management as a result of the early imaging.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis supports guidelines that early cross-sectional abdominal imaging for acute mild pancreatitis does not significantly alter patient management.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: Management of acute pancreatitis [^116acdrS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), defined as acute inflammation of the pancreas, is one of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract leading to hospital admission in the United States. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that AP is heterogeneous, progressing differently among patients, and is often unpredictable. While most patients experience symptoms lasting a few days, almost one-fifth of patients will go on to experience complications, including pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, at times requiring prolonged hospitalization, intensive care, and radiologic, surgical, and/or endoscopic intervention. Early management is essential to identify and treat patients with AP to prevent complications.

Patients with biliary pancreatitis typically will require surgery to prevent recurrence and may need early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography if the disease is complicated by cholangitis. Nutrition plays an important role in treating patients with AP. The safety of early refeeding and its importance in preventing complications from AP are addressed. This guideline provides an evidence-based practical approach to the management of patients with AP.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^113jvDyY]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Formerly, these patients were thought to have an acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, do not all undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity may still require an operation.

Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are both frequently used alongside clinical and laboratory evaluations. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium in patients with acute abdominal pain. Conversely, others prefer ultrasound as the primary imaging technique mainly because it is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionising radiation. Ionising radiation exposure at CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer. This is a drawback of CT, especially as it is increasingly being used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies in addition to CT, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, diagnoses should not be missed or delayed, and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be used.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favored a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound first.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the emergency department (ED), all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, often when only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To ensure a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, so all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist. Contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours.

To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1,000–5,000).

### Extrapancreatic inflammation on abdominal computed tomography as an early predictor of disease severity in acute pancreatitis: Evaluation of a new scoring system [^1152et87]. Pancreas (2007). Low credibility.

To introduce a new scoring system based on signs of systemic inflammation on computed tomography (CT), known as the ExtraPancreatic Inflammation on CT (EPIC) score, this study evaluates its effectiveness as an early prognostic tool.

Forty patients with acute pancreatitis who received an abdominal CT within 24 hours after admission were included in the study. The Balthazar score, CT Severity Index, and EPIC score — based on the presence of pleural effusion, ascites, and retroperitoneal fluid collections — were calculated for all patients. The end points were the occurrence of severe acute pancreatitis, defined as local complication or the presence of organ failure for more than 48 hours, and in-hospital mortality. This score was evaluated by calculating receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve.

The mean age of the patients was 50 years (± 17.7 years), and the Ranson score was 3.3. Fourteen patients (35%) developed severe disease, and in-hospital mortality was recorded at 15% (6/40). The mean EPIC score was 3.6 (± 2.0). The area under the ROC curve for predicting severe disease and mortality was 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.99) and 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.99) respectively. An EPIC score of 4 or more demonstrated a 100% sensitivity and 70.8% specificity for predicting severe pancreatitis. The EPIC score was superior to the Balthazar score and CT Severity Index in predicting outcomes.

In conclusion, for patients with acute pancreatitis, extrapancreatic inflammation assessed by abdominal CT scan and quantified with the EPIC score allows accurate estimation of disease severity.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^116ZM9Bw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

There are roughly 300,000 hospitalizations for acute pancreatitis annually in the United States. Many of the affected patients at our institution undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unnecessarily early during their admissions. We hypothesize that cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of admission in patients meeting the criteria for acute, mild pancreatitis is over-utilized and does not change management.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis from our tertiary care institution from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were a lipase level more than three times the upper limit of normal and clinical suspicion of pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were an etiology of pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, chronic pancreatitis, severe pancreatitis, and ultrasound findings being the reason for imaging.

- **Results**: Of the 166 patients who met the criteria for analysis, 105 (63.3%) underwent cross-sectional imaging within 48 hours of presentation (CT: 104, MRI: 1). Of the examined CTs, 27 (26.0%) showed no abnormality and 55 (52.9%) revealed uncomplicated pancreatitis. The remaining 22 (21.2%) demonstrated at least one of the following: local complications, biliary ductal dilatation, or other findings. On thorough chart review, only two patients received a beneficial change in management as a result of the early imaging.

- **Conclusions**: This analysis supports guidelines that early cross-sectional abdominal imaging is not often beneficial in changing the management of patients with acute mild pancreatitis.

### Diagnostic performance of imaging modalities in chronic pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146cYp3]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disabling inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by severe or continuous abdominal pain and considerable impact on the quality of life. Patients with CP usually develop endocrine and exocrine insufficiency during the course of the disease as a result of the progressive loss of pancreatic parenchyma.

There is a lack of international consensus regarding the initial diagnosis of CP, particularly at its early stages. The diagnosis is often made by a combination of clinical symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, malabsorption, diabetes mellitus), pancreatic function tests (e.g. fecal elastase-1), and morphological abnormalities seen on imaging (e.g. calcifications, ductal lesions, pseudocysts). Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with CP. The most frequently used imaging modalities for CP are endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography (US).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the initial diagnostic assessment of CP.

### Severe acute pancreatitis: Advances and insights in assessment of severity and management [^1155hkvj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis are at risk of developing various complications due to ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Notably, there is often no correlation between the degree of structural damage to the pancreas and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The effectiveness of any treatment is contingent upon the accurate prediction of severity; however, no ideal predictive system or biochemical marker currently exists. Severity assessment is crucial in selecting the appropriate initial treatment for managing acute pancreatitis.

Use of multiparametric criteria and the evaluation of severity index enable the identification of high-risk patients. Additionally, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning and contrast-enhanced MRI play significant roles in assessing severity. The implementation of multiparametric criteria, coupled with morphological evaluation, allows for the formulation of a moderately reliable prognosis regarding the disease's progression a few days from onset.

### The utility of early cross-sectional imaging to evaluate suspected acute mild pancreatitis [^112vR1JD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The size of the patient cohort is a strength of this study. Our inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded a population that has not been explicitly evaluated in prior literature on this topic. Weaknesses of this study include its retrospective nature and the fact that follow-up was not examined for these patients. It is also difficult to know for certain if these patients actually did have a prior episode of pancreatitis not reported to the treating physician. Associated medical comorbidities and their effects were not recorded, though our mortality rate was similar to that in other populations. It is important to note that our population was largely African-American, and that our study took place in a teaching center.

- **What is already known**: Acute pancreatitis is a significant contributor to healthcare utilization. Currently accepted guidelines recommend cross-sectional imaging only in certain situations for patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **What the new findings are**: For patients with mild acute pancreatitis, many decisions to obtain cross-sectional imaging do not follow guidelines. Cross-sectional imaging performed against the recommendations of guidelines rarely contributes useful information. Renewed emphasis on guideline-based care for those with mild acute pancreatitis may reduce costs and the harmful effects of excess imaging.

This single-center trial demonstrates that early and repeated cross-sectional imaging is frequently performed in patients who present with acute, mild pancreatitis, but very rarely does this strategy lead to information that would…

### The role of emergency department computed tomography in early acute pancreatitis [^113C9tHW]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is often ordered for patients in whom the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) has already been established via elevated lipase levels and typical abdominal pain. We investigated whether early CT imaging performed in the ED altered the diagnosis or management.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting to a large, academic ED between the years 2013–2015 with AP who received CT imaging. Relevant history, laboratory, imaging data, and hospital course were abstracted from the medical record and analyzed by three independent reviewers, with 100% agreement among reviewers on 30 randomly selected cases. The primary outcome was whether the CT led to a change in diagnosis or management above and beyond the ultrasound. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine association between predictor variables and outcomes.

- **Results**: The electronic health record query yielded 458 patients. Of those, 174 met the American College of Gastroenterology criteria for AP and were included in the study. Of these, 145 patients (83%) had abdominal CT during their hospital course, and 125 (86%) of these were performed in the ED. Of these 145 patients, 57 (39%) had imaging evidence of AP. 107 patients had abdominal ultrasound (US) during their hospital course. Of 84 patients who had both CT and US, 31 (37%) patients were diagnosed with gallstones by US versus 19 (23%) by CT. Biliary dilation/obstruction was diagnosed by US in 5 (6%) patients versus 4 (5%) by CT. CT led to the correct diagnosis or change in management in 21 (14%).

### Autoimmune pancreatitis: An update on diagnosis and management [^1145Ne81]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autoimmune pancreatitis:

- **Definition**: AIP is an IgG4 systemic disease characterized by obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain, and acute pancreatitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of AIP is unknown; however, an autoimmune cause, with an association with the HLA haplotype, is postulated.

- **Disease course**: The Th1 type of immune response is predominantly involved in the development of AIP, which presents as type 1 and type 2 subtypes with symptoms of obstructive jaundice, acute pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and IBD. Manifestations of other organ involvement include biliary disease, symptoms of Sjogren's disease (due to salivary gland involvement), lung nodules, interstitial nephritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of mortality increased with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.07 (p = 0.02; 95% CI 1.07–3.55) in type 1 AIP.

### American pancreatic association practice guidelines in chronic pancreatitis: Evidence-based report on diagnostic guidelines [^116i1idb]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis remains challenging in the early stages of the disease. This report defines the diagnostic criteria useful in the assessment of patients with suspected and established chronic pancreatitis. All diagnostic procedures are reviewed, and evidence-based statements are provided about their utility and limitations. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pancreatitis are classified as definitive, probable, or insufficient evidence. A diagnostic algorithm, incorporating a STEP-wise approach — survey, tomography, endoscopy, and pancreas function testing — is proposed, progressing from noninvasive to more invasive methods. This algorithm maximizes specificity (low false-positive rate) in subjects with chronic abdominal pain and equivocal imaging changes.

Furthermore, a nomenclature is suggested to further characterize patients with established chronic pancreatitis based on TIGAR-O (toxic, idiopathic, genetic, autoimmune, recurrent, and obstructive) etiology, gland morphology (Cambridge criteria), and physiologic state (exocrine, endocrine function) to ensure uniformity across future multicenter research collaborations. This guideline will serve as a baseline manuscript that will be modified as new evidence becomes available and our knowledge of chronic pancreatitis improves.

### Acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic impact of immediate CT scanning [^113uX89N]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common diagnostic problem. This study aimed to evaluate the routine use of contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scanning early in the diagnostic process.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted on 2,222 patients with acute abdominal pain who underwent contrast-enhanced CT scanning within 24 hours after admission. The diagnoses obtained were compared with the final diagnoses after one month.

- **Results**: After CT scanning, the following diagnoses were suggested as the primary cause of the abdominal pain: nonspecific abdominal pain (44.3%), appendicitis (15.9%), bowel obstruction (8.6%), diverticulitis (8.2%), gastrointestinal perforation (2.3%), gallstone disease (2.9%), pancreatitis (3.2%), inflammatory bowel disease (0.6%), intra-abdominal malignancy (1.5%), vascular disease, including one completely cured patient with paradoxical embolization in the superior mesenteric artery (1.5%), urological issues (5.9%), gynecological issues (2.4%), and miscellaneous (1.4%). In 28 cases, a conclusive CT examination could not be carried out. The suggested diagnoses were correct in 96.8% of cases. In 0.7% of cases, an incorrect diagnosis was reported, leading to seven unnecessary laparotomies. False-negative reports were obtained in 1.2% of cases. After CT examination, 500 patients could be discharged immediately.

- **Conclusions**: Contrast-enhanced CT scanning results in superior diagnostic precision in patients with acute abdominal pain. The present work supports the strategy to include this examination early in the routine diagnostic process.

### Acute pancreatitis: The role of imaging and interventional radiology [^113RfjuX]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis can manifest as a benign condition with minimal abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia or can have a fulminant course, which can be life-threatening, usually due to the development of infected pancreatic necrosis and multisystem organ failure. Fortunately, 70–80% of patients with acute pancreatitis experience a benign, self-limiting course. The initial 24–48 hours after diagnosis usually determine the course of the illness. For many of the 20–30% of patients who develop a fulminant course, this becomes apparent within this time frame.

Regarding long-term outcomes following acute pancreatitis, most cases recover without long-term sequelae, with only a minority progressing to chronic pancreatitis. In the initial management of acute pancreatitis, the assessment of metabolic disturbances and systemic organ dysfunction is critical. However, the advent and continued refinement of cross-sectional imaging modalities over the past two decades have led to a prominent role for diagnostic imaging in assessing acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, these cross-sectional imaging modalities have enabled the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventional techniques in the hands of radiologists.

This article reviews the diagnostic features of acute pancreatitis, the clinical staging systems, complications, and the role of imaging. The role of interventional radiology techniques in the management of acute pancreatitis will be discussed, along with potential complications associated with these treatments.
