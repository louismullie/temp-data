## Question

Is Reglan safe to use during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether metoclopramide (Reglan) is safe to use during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's indications and what regulators and labels actually say. Then, I should verify large human pregnancy safety data. Next, I will review guideline positions and any trimester-specific issues. After that, I need to check fetal and neonatal risks, especially around delivery, and the maternal safety profile including extrapyramidal symptoms and dosing limits. I will then examine comparative efficacy with promethazine and ondansetron, consider special situations like breastfeeding and intrapartum use, balance risks and benefits in severe NVP/HG, and finally synthesize a practical, cautious recommendation with dosing, duration, monitoring, and contraindications [^114jQGWc] [^111mdY5w] [^1129yXFc].

> Let me first confirm the indication landscape. Metoclopramide is a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist approved in the U.S. for diabetic gastroparesis and for certain nausea-vomiting contexts such as postoperative and chemotherapy-induced emesis, and to facilitate GI procedures; it has also been used off-label for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum, which I need to be explicit about to avoid over-claiming approval status [^114jQGWc] [^113jNHLd] [^111vpNWB]. Wait, I initially thought "nausea/vomiting in pregnancy" might be an FDA-approved indication, but that is off-label in the U.S.; usage for NVP/HG is guideline-supported rather than label-approved, which I should clearly state for accuracy [^1129yXFc].

> Next, I should review what the FDA labeling and related regulatory summaries say about pregnancy outcomes. The U.S. label states that published retrospective cohorts, national registries, and meta-analyses do not demonstrate an increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes with metoclopramide exposure in pregnancy, and animal data at 6–12 times the MRHD did not show developmental toxicity, which is reassuring but not definitive because labels also note background risks and observational limitations [^111mdY5w] [^112DHKRX]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; label summaries are supportive, but I still need to anchor on large, well-conducted human datasets before finalizing the risk assessment [^111mdY5w].

> I will now examine large-scale human evidence. The 2013 JAMA Danish registry cohort of 1.22 million pregnancies, including 28,486 first-trimester exposures, found no increased risk of overall major congenital malformations, no signal across 20 specific malformation subtypes, and no elevation in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, which substantially reduces concern about teratogenicity from first-trimester exposure [^1115cvFq]. Let me also consider smaller prospective datasets; a multicenter 2002 cohort showed no increase in malformations but suggested a higher rate of prematurity, a finding not corroborated by the larger JAMA analysis, so the weight of evidence favors no major congenital risk signal while recognizing residual confounding in observational designs [^114kRg5n] [^1115cvFq].

> I need to check professional guidance. ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 189 supports metoclopramide as generally acceptable for short-term use in pregnancy and cites its Australian Category A classification, reflecting extensive human experience without increased malformations; importantly, this is a guideline endorsement rather than an FDA indication, so clinical use should still be individualized and cautious [^1129yXFc] [^1154mJQX]. Let me verify sequencing; ACOG and related guidance typically prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and doxylamine–pyridoxine as first-line, with dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide as subsequent options, which aligns with evidence-based stepwise care for NVP/HG [^1129yXFc] [^111zxTHH].

> But wait, what about fetal and neonatal effects beyond malformations? I should confirm placental transfer and peripartum risks. The FDA labeling emphasizes that metoclopramide crosses the placenta and, when administered during labor/delivery, may cause neonatal extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia; therefore, avoid intrapartum use if possible and monitor exposed neonates for EPS or methemoglobinemia, particularly with higher doses or overdose scenarios [^111mdY5w] [^111QDmxW] [^112DHKRX]. I should double-check severity; case and overdose data in neonates show methemoglobinemia reversible with methylene blue, though G6PD deficiency complicates management, underscoring the need to avoid high exposure near delivery [^111QDmxW].

> I will now review maternal safety considerations. Extrapyramidal symptoms, acute dystonia, parkinsonism, motor restlessness, and tardive dyskinesia are core risks, with higher incidence at doses around 30–40 mg/day and in younger adults; early-onset EPS can occur within 24–48 hours, and symptoms usually resolve with discontinuation and anticholinergic treatment when needed [^113KSCUJ]. Hold on, I should verify duration limits used to mitigate EPS and TD risks; while U.S. labeling stresses avoiding chronic exposure due to tardive dyskinesia risk, the EMA specifically recommended restricting metoclopramide to 10 mg up to three times daily for no more than five days, a pragmatic cap that many adopt in pregnancy to reduce EPS risk, although this is an EMA policy rather than a U.S. label directive [^111CfjQZ]. I need to ensure contraindications are remembered: prior dystonia or TD, pheochromocytoma, seizure disorders, GI obstruction or perforation, and caution with depression, hypertension, heart failure, and drug interactions that raise EPS or NMS risk, all of which are relevant in pregnant patients as well [^114sqRwA] [^113oojGe].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy and tolerability. Randomized trials in hyperemesis gravidarum show metoclopramide provides similar antiemetic efficacy to promethazine but with less sedation, dizziness, and dystonia, supporting its clinical utility when antihistamine side effects are limiting [^117LzwvR]. In head-to-head trials versus ondansetron, short-term efficacy appears similar, with fewer reports of sedation and xerostomia on ondansetron but comparable antiemetic benefit; selection often hinges on side-effect profiles, cardiac risks, and availability [^111a18Xw]. Let me reconsider generalizations; these RCTs are short and inpatient-focused, so outpatient duration and cumulative exposure risks must still guide metoclopramide limits in pregnancy [^111a18Xw] [^117LzwvR].

> I should consider special circumstances. For breastfeeding, metoclopramide is present in variable small amounts in milk and has been used off-label as a galactagogue, but high-quality network meta-analyses indicate domperidone increases milk volume in mothers of preterm infants while metoclopramide does not consistently outperform placebo; moreover, maternal and neonatal adverse events were not significantly increased in these short trials, yet infant monitoring for EPS and GI effects remains prudent if maternal therapy is necessary [^1125VWQU] [^117JLwwn] [^111v3hee]. Regarding intrapartum and peri-cesarean use, while meta-analyses suggest antiemetic efficacy for neuraxial anesthesia–related nausea, the neonatal EPS/methemoglobinemia cautions argue against routine intrapartum use when alternatives exist, especially near delivery [^114YuJTu] [^111mdY5w].

> Now, I need to weigh risks versus the risks of undertreated disease. Severe NVP and hyperemesis gravidarum can lead to dehydration, electrolyte derangements, weight loss, hospitalization, and even consideration of pregnancy termination in refractory cases; early, effective treatment reduces morbidity and healthcare utilization, so a medication with no teratogenic signal and manageable maternal side effects can be justified when first-line therapy fails [^116Nq5bv] [^1129yXFc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should ensure not to overstate causality from observational cohorts; still, converging registry and guideline data support metoclopramide's role as a reasonable second-line option with careful monitoring and short duration in pregnancy [^1115cvFq] [^1129yXFc].

> I will now translate this into practical prescribing parameters. Use the lowest effective dose, typically 10 mg orally or IV every 6–8 hours, for the shortest duration possible, ideally not exceeding five days in alignment with EMA restrictions to mitigate EPS risk; avoid use during labor and delivery when feasible to reduce neonatal EPS/methemoglobinemia risk, and reassess frequently for efficacy and adverse effects [^111CfjQZ] [^111mdY5w]. I should double-check dose adjustments; in renal impairment, reduce maintenance dosing because clearance falls with lower creatinine clearance, and consider hepatic or heart failure cautions due to fluid retention and blood pressure effects; counsel regarding depression risk, and avoid in Parkinson's disease or with other EPS-inducing agents [^113gZSpS] [^113oojGe] [^113KSCUJ]. For sequencing, reserve metoclopramide after nonpharmacologic measures and doxylamine–pyridoxine have been attempted, consistent with guideline-based care pathways [^1129yXFc] [^111zxTHH].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and patient counseling. Monitor for acute dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, mood changes or depression, blood pressure changes, and signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; stop the drug if EPS emerge and treat with anticholinergics when needed, and advise immediate evaluation for any involuntary movements or airway symptoms suggestive of laryngospasm; if exposure occurs near delivery, ensure neonatal observation for EPS and methemoglobinemia [^113KSCUJ] [^113oojGe] [^111mdY5w]. Let me also confirm contraindications again to prevent serious harms, including prior TD or dystonia, pheochromocytoma, seizure disorders, GI obstruction or perforation, and hypersensitivity, which are critical exclusions in pregnant patients too [^114sqRwA].

> In summary, after reviewing regulatory labels, large human data, guidelines, and comparative trials, metoclopramide is generally considered a reasonable short-term second-line option for significant nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum when first-line therapy fails, with no demonstrated increase in major congenital malformations and manageable maternal risks when dosed conservatively; strict attention to duration limits, contraindications, and monitoring is essential, and intrapartum use should be avoided when possible due to neonatal EPS and methemoglobinemia concerns [^1115cvFq] [^1129yXFc] [^111mdY5w]. I need to ensure shared decision-making emphasizes the balance of benefits in preventing maternal-fetal complications of uncontrolled vomiting against the low absolute risk of maternal EPS with short courses, tailoring therapy to patient-specific risk factors and response [^116Nq5bv] [^117LzwvR] [^111a18Xw].

Yes, Reglan (metoclopramide) is considered **safe for pregnant patients when used short-term** [^1129yXFc] and at recommended doses, with no increased risk of major congenital malformations [^1115cvFq] or fetal death [^111mdY5w]. It is **generally acceptable** for short-term use in all trimesters [^1154mJQX], but should be avoided in patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia, epilepsy, or pheochromocytoma [^114sqRwA]. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms [^113KSCUJ] and neonatal effects if used near delivery [^111mdY5w] [^112DHKRX].

### Reglan [^111mdY5w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Published studies, including retrospective cohort studies, national registry studies, and meta-analyses, do not report an increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes with the use of metoclopramide during pregnancy. There are potential risks to the neonate following exposure in utero to metoclopramide during delivery [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of metoclopramide to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures about 6 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: Metoclopramide crosses the placental barrier and may cause extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia in neonates with maternal administration during delivery. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal signs [see Warnings and precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in specific populations (8.4)].

- **Data**:

	- **Animal data**: Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of oral metoclopramide during organogenesis in pregnant rats at about 6 times the MRHD calculated on body surface area and in pregnant rabbits at about 12 times the MRHD.

### Reglan [^114sqRwA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Reglan is contraindicated in several specific conditions:

- **History of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide**: Use is contraindicated in patients with a history of TD or prior dystonic reactions to metoclopramide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

- **Dangerous stimulation of gastrointestinal motility**: Avoid Reglan where stimulation of gastrointestinal motility could be harmful, such as in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.

- **Pheochromocytoma or catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas**: Reglan may precipitate a hypertensive or pheochromocytoma crisis due to catecholamine release from the tumor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Epilepsy**: Use in patients with epilepsy may increase the frequency and severity of seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Hypersensitivity to metoclopramide**: Reactions can include laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Metoclopramide in pregnancy and risk of major congenital malformations and fetal death [^1115cvFq]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

Metoclopramide, a drug frequently used for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, is thought to be safe, but information on the risk of specific malformations and fetal death is lacking. The objective of the study was to investigate the safety of metoclopramide use in pregnancy through a register-based cohort study conducted in Denmark from 1997 to 2011. From a cohort of 1,222,503 pregnancies, metoclopramide-exposed and unexposed women were matched in a 1:4 ratio based on age, calendar year, and propensity scores.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The study was a register-based cohort study in Denmark, encompassing the years 1997 to 2011. A total of 1,222,503 pregnancies were part of this cohort. Women exposed to metoclopramide and those unexposed were matched on factors such as age, calendar year, and propensity scores at a 1:4 ratio.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes included major congenital malformations overall, 20 individual malformation categories (selected according to power criteria), spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. In matched analyses, logistic regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios of malformations, and Cox regression was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of spontaneous abortion.

- **Results**: Among 28,486 women exposed to metoclopramide in the first trimester, 721 had an infant with a major congenital malformation (25.3 [95% CI, 23.5–27.1] cases per 1000 births), compared with 3024 among 113,698 unexposed women (26.6 [95% CI, 25.7–27.5] per 1000 births). There were no significant associations between metoclopramide use and malformations overall (prevalence odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86–1.02]) or any of the 20 individual malformation categories, such as neural tube defects, transposition of great vessels, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, cleft lip, cleft palate, and anorectal atresia/stenosis.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting prophylaxis during and after Caesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YuJTu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting commonly occur during and after Caesarean delivery (CD) performed under neuraxial anaesthesia. Metoclopramide, a prokinetic agent, is reported to be safe for parturients. This meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of metoclopramide for prophylaxis against intra- and postoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV and PONV) in parturients undergoing CD under neuraxial anaesthesia. We performed a literature search of MEDLINE (1966–2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1947–2011), Google Scholar, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials comparing metoclopramide with placebo in women having CD under neuraxial anaesthesia. Eleven studies including 702 patients were analyzed.

- **Administration of metoclopramide**: Administering 10 mg of metoclopramide resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of ION and IOV when given before block placement [relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = 0.27 (0.16, 0.45) and 0.14 (0.03, 0.56), respectively] or after delivery [RR (95% CI) = 0.38 (0.20, 0.75) and 0.34 (0.18, 0.66), respectively]. The incidence of early (0–3 or 0–4 h) PON and POV [RR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.26, 0.87) and 0.45 (0.21, 0.93), respectively] and overall (0–24 or 3–24 h) PON (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52, 0.92) were also reduced with metoclopramide.

No extra-pyramidal side effects were reported in any patient. In conclusion, this review suggests that metoclopramide is effective and safe for IONV and PONV prophylaxis in this patient population. Given the quality of the studies and the infrequent use of neuraxial opioids, these results should be interpreted with caution.

### Metoclopramide effect on breastfeeding the preterm infant: A randomized trial [^114X8V9q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of metoclopramide on breast milk volume and duration of breastfeeding in women delivering preterm. Women who planned to breastfeed and delivered between 23 and 34 weeks of gestation were eligible to participate in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of metoclopramide or placebo three times a day for 10 days, starting within 96 hours of birth. Breastfeeding education was standardized for all women, and mothers recorded the volume of breast milk expressed at each pumping for 17 days. The duration of breastfeeding was measured by monthly follow-up phone calls.

Sixty-nine women were enrolled, and 57 (82%) completed the study: 28 in the metoclopramide group and 29 in the placebo group. The groups were similar in age, education, ethnicity, gestational age, and marital status. There was no significant difference between breast milk volumes in the metoclopramide and placebo groups over the 17-day study period (P = 0.26 to .98; test for mean metoclopramide effect P = 0.80). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the duration of breastfeeding between the groups. The median duration was 8.8 weeks with an interquartile range of 3.4 to 12.0 weeks for the metoclopramide group, and a median of 8.6 weeks with an interquartile range of 5.6 to 16.9 weeks for the placebo group (P = 0.09).

The conclusion drawn from this study is that metoclopramide did not improve breast milk volume or the duration of breastfeeding in this population of women.

### Treatment of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with subcutaneous medications [^111NUnrp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We examined treatment outcomes in women with severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) receiving outpatient nursing support and either subcutaneous metoclopramide or subcutaneous ondansetron via a microinfusion pump. Among women receiving outpatient nursing services, we identified those diagnosed with severe NVP, having a Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score of greater than 12 at enrollment, and prescribed either metoclopramide (N = 355) or ondansetron (N = 521) by their physician. Maternal characteristics, response to treatment, and start versus stop values were compared between the medication groups. Allocation to groups was based on an intention-to-treat protocol.

Maternal characteristics were similar between the groups. Days to reduction in PUQE score levels were similar (median 2 days for metoclopramide, 3 days for ondansetron; P = 0.206). Alteration from metoclopramide to ondansetron (31.8%) was more frequent than alteration from ondansetron to metoclopramide (4.4%; P < 0.001). Improvement of NVP symptoms and reduced need for hospitalization were noted with both medications. Treatment with either metoclopramide or ondansetron resulted in significant improvement of NVP symptoms, with half of the women showing a reduction from severe symptoms to moderate or mild symptoms within 3 days of treatment initiation. Alteration in treatment was significantly greater in patients initially prescribed metoclopramide.

### Metoclopramide [^111QDmxW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdosage symptoms can include drowsiness, disorientation, and extrapyramidal reactions. Anticholinergic or antiparkinson drugs, or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties, may help control these reactions. These symptoms are generally self-limiting and dissipate within 24 hours. Hemodialysis removes relatively little metoclopramide owing to the drug's low presence in blood compared to tissues. Likewise, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis does not significantly remove the drug. Therefore, dosage adjustments due to dialysis losses are unlikely to be necessary, and dialysis is not considered an effective method for metoclopramide removal during overdoses.

Unintentional overdoses in infants and children have occurred due to the misadministration of metoclopramide syrup. Although there is no consistent pattern in these reports, events have included seizures, extrapyramidal reactions, and lethargy. Methemoglobinemia has been reported in both premature and full-term neonates given overdoses of metoclopramide (1 to 4 mg/kg/day orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously for 1 to 3 or more days). This condition can be reversed with intravenous methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which could be fatal (see precautions – other special populations).

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116iFjAJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Results

- **Baseline of involved studies**: 410 potentially relevant publications were retrieved from five databases. After screening and reading the full-text articles, 17 RCTs were included in our final analyses. The first trial was carried out in 1983, and the latest one was in 2021. All trials were conducted in Asia (India, Indonesia, Iran, Singapore, and Thailand), Australia, Europe (Belgium, Finland, Italy, and the United Kingdom), and North America (Canada and USA). Sixteen studies were two-arm: nine trials compared domperidone with placebo; six trials compared metoclopramide with placebo; and one trial compared domperidone with metoclopramide. One study was a three-arm study where domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo were all used. In total, 787 postpartum mothers participated: 226 mothers received domperidone, 210 received metoclopramide, and 351 received placebo. The eligibility criteria, number of participants, gestational age, intervention details, and outcomes are detailed in Table 1 and Supplemental Table S2. Bias risk assessment is available in Supplemental Figures S1 & S2.

- **Efficacy of galactagogues**: Sixteen RCTs reported an increase in breast milk volume (in mL/day). Before subgroup analysis, it was observed that mothers who took domperidone experienced a greater increase in breast milk volume compared to those who took metoclopramide.

### Gimoti [^112DHKRX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy**

- **Risk summary**: Published studies, including retrospective cohort studies, national registry studies, and meta-analyses, do not report a consistent pattern or a consistently increased risk of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes with oral use of metoclopramide during pregnancy. However, available data from a case report of Gimoti use in pregnancy is insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are potential risks to the neonate following exposure in utero to metoclopramide during delivery [see Clinical Considerations].

In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of metoclopramide to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures about 6 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**

- **Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions**: Metoclopramide crosses the placental barrier and may cause extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia in neonates with maternal administration during delivery. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal signs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

- **Data**: In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of metoclopramide to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures about 6 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).

### Molindone hydrochloride [^114aCUAe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Studies in pregnant patients have not been conducted. Reproduction studies have been performed in animals:

- **Pregnant rats oral dose**: No adverse effects were observed at 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day over 10 days.

- **Pregnant mice oral dose**: A slight increase in resorptions was noted at 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day over 10 days.

- **Pregnant rabbits oral dose**: No adverse effects were observed at 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, and 20 mg/kg/day over 12 days.

Animal reproductive studies have not demonstrated teratogenic potential. The anticipated benefits of using molindone hydrochloride in pregnant patients must be weighed against unknown fetal risks.

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Reported symptoms include agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Severity of these symptoms varies; some cases resolve spontaneously, while others require intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Molindone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefits justify potential risks to the fetus.

Data on the content of molindone hydrochloride in the milk of nursing mothers is not available.

Use of molindone hydrochloride in pediatric patients below the age of twelve years is not recommended.

### Demonstration of early efficacy results of the delayed-release combination of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111zxTHH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affect up to 80% of expecting mothers, and for many women, pharmacotherapy is necessary to control their symptoms. The delayed-release combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been extensively studied with numerous publications in the peer-reviewed medical literature corroborating the safe and effective use of this agent.

The delayed-release characteristic of this combination allows for an initial dose of two tablets at bedtime to be effective five to seven hours later, during the morning hours when NVP symptoms are most prevalent. In 2013, the FDA approved the sale of Diclegis®, based, in part, on results from a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In this trial, pregnant women between 7 and 14 weeks' gestation received the study drug, Diclegis® or placebo, for 14 days. The NVP-specific and validated Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score was collected daily; however, the a priori primary effectiveness endpoint was determined to be the change in NVP symptoms as measured by the PUQE score from baseline to Day 15. This period of study drug dosing for two weeks is substantially longer than in other therapeutic studies of NVP, which rarely continue beyond five days. For ethical reasons, denying women suffering from NVP a safe and effective treatment and randomizing them to placebo should be for as limited a duration as possible. As such, the present secondary analysis was conducted to determine whether shorter drug dosing days would yield similar efficacy results.

### Promethazine compared with metoclopramide for hyperemesis gravidarum: A randomized controlled trial [^117LzwvR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). High credibility.

To compare the effects of promethazine with those of metoclopramide for hyperemesis gravidarum, women at their first hospitalization for this condition were approached when intravenous antiemetic therapy was needed. They were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of promethazine or 10 mg of metoclopramide every 8 hours for 24 hours in a double-blind study. The primary outcomes were measured by the number of vomiting episodes recorded in a diary and the well-being visual numerical rating scale score (on a 10-point scale) during the 24-hour main study period. Participants also completed an adverse-effects questionnaire at 24 hours and a nausea visual numerical rating scale score at recruitment and at 8, 16, and 24 hours.

A total of 73 women were randomized to metoclopramide and 76 women to promethazine. Median vomiting episodes for metoclopramide were one (range 0–26), compared with two (range 0–26) for promethazine (P = 0.81). The well-being visual numerical rating scale scores were 8 (range 1–10) for metoclopramide versus 7 (range 2–10) for promethazine (P = 0.24). Repeat-measures analysis of variance of the nausea visual numerical rating scale scores showed no significant difference between the study drugs (F score = 0.842, P = 0.47). Reported adverse effects such as drowsiness (58.6% for metoclopramide compared with 83.6% for promethazine, P = 0.001, number needed to treat to benefit [NNTb] 5), dizziness (34.3% compared with 71.2%, p < 0.001, NNTb 3), dystonia (5.7% compared with 19.2%, P = 0.02, NNTb 8), and therapy curtailment due to adverse events (0 of 73 [0%] compared with 7 of 76 [9.2%], P = 0.014) were encountered less frequently with metoclopramide.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^117D81ZM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

- **Antiemetics**: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) constitute important adverse effects of treatment, and the probability of its occurrence corresponds directly to the intrinsic emetogenicity of the agents used. To guide the choice of antiemesis agents or combinations thereof, the various regimens are classified into high (> 90%), moderate (30–90%), low (10–30%), and minimal emetic risk (< 10%) categories. The timing of the onset of nausea and vomiting is of clinical importance, as drugs may differ in their ability to prevent bouts, whether emesis is acute, delayed, or anticipatory.

Although there is a wide variety of agents with antiemetic properties, the set used in patients receiving chemotherapy is rather specific. It consists of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (such as ondansetron and palonosetron), neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (such as aprepitant and fosaprepitant), glucocorticoids, and olanzapine. Dopaminergic antagonists like prochlorperazine and metoclopramide have also been used in the past; however, they are now reserved as rescue therapy due to their relatively limited efficacy and the adverse effects from dopaminergic blockade associated with prolonged administration.

### SPL drug information for methadone hydrochloride [^114cd6HX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of methadone hydrochloride PO (also known as Methadose) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monitor for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can result in physical dependence in the neonate; women should be advised of the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.

Due to pharmacokinetic differences during pregnancy, such as significantly lower trough plasma concentrations and a shorter half-life than after delivery, the methadone dose may need to be increased or the dosing interval decreased to achieve therapeutic effectiveness. This drug should not be used during and immediately prior to labor when short-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate.

Reports indicate that pregnant patients involved in methadone maintenance programs have improved prenatal care, leading to a reduced incidence of obstetric and fetal complications, as well as neonatal morbidity and mortality, compared to those using illicit drugs. Several factors, including maternal drug use, nutrition, infection, and psychosocial circumstances, complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children exposed to methadone during pregnancy. Information regarding the dose and duration of methadone use during pregnancy is limited, and most maternal exposure in these studies appears to occur after the first trimester of pregnancy.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy [^115RpoPr]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride PO (also known as Hemangeol) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor for fetal bradycardia, and monitor neonates for hypoglycemia and respiratory depression. Those managed for hypertension may continue treatment in pregnancy unless contraindications exist. Propranolol can be used for maternal arrhythmias in pregnancy and is acceptable for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.

The drug propranolol hydrochloride PO (also known as Hemangeol) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Ondansetron compared with metoclopramide for hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^111a18Xw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare ondansetron with metoclopramide in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 160 women with hyperemesis gravidarum in a double-blind randomized trial. Participants were randomized to receive intravenous 4 mg ondansetron or 10 mg metoclopramide every 8 hours for 24 hours. They kept an emesis diary for 24 hours. At 24 hours, participants expressed their well-being using a 10-point visual numeric rating scale and completed an adverse effects questionnaire. Nausea intensity was evaluated using a 10-point visual numeric rating scale at enrollment and at 8, 16, and 24 hours. The primary analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

- **Results**: Eighty women were randomized to each group, ondansetron or metoclopramide. The median well-being visual numeric rating scale scores were 9 (range, 5–10) compared with 9 (range, 4–10) (P = 0.33), and vomiting episodes in the first 24 hours were 1 (range, 0–9) compared with 2 (range, 0–23) (P = 0.38) for ondansetron compared with metoclopramide, respectively. Repeat-measures analysis of variance of nausea visual numeric rating scale showed no difference between study drugs (P = 0.22). Reported rates of drowsiness (12.5% compared with 30%; p = 0.01; number needed to treat to benefit, 6), xerostomia (10.0% compared with 23.8%; p < 0.01; number needed to treat to benefit, 8), and persistent ketonuria at 24 hours (12.5% compared with 30%; p = 0.01; number needed to treat to benefit, 6) were less frequent with ondansetron. The length of hospital stay was similar.

- **Conclusion**: Ondansetron and metoclopramide demonstrated similar antiemetic and antinauseant effects.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113yFYce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

This study reviewed the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues in postpartum mothers through network analysis. Our paper involved 17 trials and nearly 800 women, significantly surpassing previous meta-analyses. We also compared the efficacy and safety between domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues, which was analyzed and published in a meta-analysis for the first time.

In this first comprehensive network meta-analysis, we found that domperidone was more efficacious than metoclopramide and placebo in improving breast milk insufficiency. This benefit was only revealed in mothers with preterm infants. Orally administered domperidone at 30 mg/day for seven days (cumulative doses = 210 mg) had maximal efficacy based on available data for improving breast milk insufficiency. Meanwhile, domperidone did not increase maternal drug-related adverse outcomes compared with metoclopramide and placebo.

### Pharmacogenetic predictors of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy severity and response to antiemetic therapy: a pilot study [^114jJncF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affect up to 80% of all pregnant women. Although NVP is most common during the first trimester of pregnancy, as many as 20% of pregnant women are affected beyond 12 weeks of gestation and throughout the day (as opposed to isolated morning occurrences). Among the affected women, 1 to 3% experience a severe form of NVP known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), which includes symptoms such as weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. In mild cases, NVP causes discomfort and inconvenience; however, HG can pose significant risks to the health of the pregnant woman and the fetus, often necessitating hospitalization. Even milder cases of NVP can significantly impact a woman's quality of life and contribute to increased health care costs and time lost from work. There have been reports of the termination of otherwise wanted pregnancies due to severe, prolonged NVP. Because NVP is rarely life-threatening, the primary goal of pharmacologic treatment is typically to improve the quality of life for affected pregnant women.

- **Pharmacologic treatment**: Several dopamine antagonist antiemetics commonly used in pregnancy also act as weak serotonin receptor antagonists. These include promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide. Additionally, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is frequently used as an antiemetic during pregnancy. These antiemetics have been studied extensively and appear to be safe for use in pregnancy. However, the response to these medications in the treatment of NVP is highly variable.

### SPL drug information for ketamine hydrochloride [^111j6Nfq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of ketamine hydrochloride IV (also known as Ketalar) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Since safe use in pregnancy, including obstetrics (either vaginal or abdominal delivery), has not been established, such use is not recommended. Ketamine hydrochloride IV is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus being observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Metoclopramide [^115SECxX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

An Ames mutagenicity test performed on metoclopramide was negative.

- **Pregnancy**: Reproduction studies performed in rats, mice, and rabbits by the intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC), and oral routes at maximum levels ranging from 12 to 250 times the human dose have demonstrated no impairment of fertility or significant harm to the fetus due to metoclopramide. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

- **Nursing mothers**: Metoclopramide is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when metoclopramide is administered to a nursing mother.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established except as stated to facilitate small bowel intubation (see OVERDOSAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Care should be exercised in administering metoclopramide to neonates since prolonged clearance may produce excessive serum concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Pharmacokinetics). In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase which, in combination with the aforementioned pharmacokinetic factors, make neonates more susceptible to methemoglobinemia (see OVERDOSAGE). The safety profile of metoclopramide in adults cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients. Dystonias and other extrapyramidal reactions associated with metoclopramide are more common in the pediatric population than in adults (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS – Extrapyramidal Reactions).

### Metoclopramide [^113Pcppy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment require special consideration when using metoclopramide. Since it is principally excreted through the kidneys, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage for patients with creatinine clearance below 40 mL/min. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on clinical efficacy and safety considerations. For information regarding dialysis, see the overdosage section.

Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, primarily through simple conjugation. It has been verified as safe for patients with advanced liver disease and normal renal function.

Note: It is essential to inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration where solution and container permit.

- **Admixture compatibilities**: Metoclopramide Injection, USP is compatible for mixing and injection with certain dosage forms:

### Reglan [^113KSCUJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

In addition to tardive dyskinesia (TD), metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and discontinue Reglan.

Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as acute dystonic reactions, occurred in patients treated with metoclopramide dosages of 30 mg to 40 mg daily. Such reactions occurred more frequently in adults less than 30 years of age and at higher than recommended dosages. EPS occurred more frequently in pediatric patients compared to adults (Reglan is not approved for use in pediatric patients). Symptoms can occur in the first 24 to 48 hours after starting metoclopramide. Symptoms included involuntary movements of limbs and facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, rhythmic protrusion of the tongue, bulbar type of speech, trismus, or dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Rarely, dystonic reactions were present as stridor and dyspnea, possibly due to laryngospasm. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate may be used to treat these adverse reactions. Avoid Reglan in patients receiving other drugs that can cause EPS (e.g. antipsychotics).

Parkinsonian symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, cogwheel rigidity, and mask-like facies, have occurred after starting metoclopramide, more commonly within the first 6 months, but also after longer periods. Symptoms generally have subsided within 2 to 3 months after discontinuation of Reglan. Avoid Reglan in patients with Parkinson's disease and other patients being treated with medications that can exacerbate parkinsonian symptoms.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: A cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^111CfjQZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamines and metoclopramide were the most commonly used conventional medicines against nausea in the vast majority of countries. The exceptions were the United States, Croatia, Russia, Serbia, and Slovenia, where ondansetron (USA) and antacids (Croatia, Russia, Serbia, and Slovenia) were the most commonly used medicines against nausea. This aligns with findings from a study on hyperemesis gravidarum treatments that detected inter-country variations in the frequency of different treatments. In the United States, serotonin inhibitors were most frequently used, antihistamines in Canada, whereas Australia reported the highest use of promotility agents such as metoclopramide.

Meta-analyses and epidemiological studies have not found a higher risk of malformations associated with antihistamines and metoclopramide. Antihistamines are regarded as a first-line treatment according to guidelines in both North America and Europe. Recently, the safety of metoclopramide and ondansetron has been questioned. In July 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended changing the use of metoclopramide to 10 mg three times a day for up to 5 days to reduce the risk of extrapyramidal side effects. As this duration is seldom long enough to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), this change will limit the medicine's usefulness for the pregnant population. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns over cardiovascular safety, suggesting that ondansetron could cause a prolonged QT interval, which can lead to Torsade de Pointes, warranting electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in patients with electrolyte abnormalities.

### Metoclopramide [^1117LDgi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Who should not receive metoclopramide**: Do not receive metoclopramide if you have stomach or intestine problems that could worsen with metoclopramide, such as bleeding, blockage, or a tear in your stomach or bowel wall; have an adrenal gland tumor called pheochromocytoma; are allergic to metoclopramide or any of its ingredients (see the end of this medication guide for a list of ingredients in metoclopramide); take medicines that can cause uncontrolled movements, such as medicines for mental illness; or have seizures.

- **What should I tell my doctor before receiving metoclopramide**: Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you have depression, Parkinson's disease, high blood pressure, kidney problems (your doctor may start with a lower dose), liver problems or heart failure (metoclopramide may cause your body to retain fluids), diabetes (your dose of insulin may need to be changed), breast cancer, or if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant as it is not known if metoclopramide will harm your unborn child. Additionally, inform your doctor if you are breastfeeding since metoclopramide is passed into human milk and may harm your baby. Talk with your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take metoclopramide.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Metoclopramide and some other medicines can affect each other and may not work as well or cause possible side effects. Do not start any new medicines while receiving metoclopramide until you talk with your doctor.

### SPL drug information for metoclopramide hydrochloride [^113oojGe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of metoclopramide hydrochloride (also known as Reglan, Gimoti):

- **Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment**: Use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

- **Depression, suicidal ideation**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide has been associated with depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide in patients with or without a history of depression. Avoid metoclopramide in patients with a history of depression.

- **Fluid retention**: Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure or cirrhosis, as metoclopramide causes a transient increase in plasma aldosterone.

- **Hypertension**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. Avoid metoclopramide in patients with hypertension or in patients taking MAOIs.

- **Increased serum prolactin**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels, which can cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome when overdosed or given with another drug associated with the condition. Avoid metoclopramide in patients receiving other drugs associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.

- **Parkinsonism**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms, in addition to tardive dyskinesia, including parkinsonism and motor restlessness.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111v3hee]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

We stratified the analysis by different cumulative doses used during the trials. A cumulative dose of 210 mg (30 mg/day × 7 days) was used as a boundary for grouping, resulting in four groups: "domperidone > 210 mg" (5 trials), "domperidone 210 mg" (6 trials), "metoclopramide > 210 mg" (4 trials), and "metoclopramide 210 mg" (3 trials).

After analysis, we found that both "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume. The results showed "domperidone > 210 mg" versus placebo: MD = 150.80, 95% CI: 80.55–216.73; "domperidone 210 mg" versus placebo: MD = 74.42, 95% CI: 21.47–129.06. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" (MD = 76.54, 95% CI: -13.39–160.33). Additionally, no difference was observed among "metoclopramide > 210 mg", "metoclopramide 210 mg", and placebo.

- **Safety of galactagogues**: There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo. Four trials investigated the neonatal adverse effects; three trials revealed no drug-related adverse events, and one trial found no difference in the frequency of neonatal adverse events between domperidone and placebo.

- **Inconsistency, ranking, certainty of evidence, and publication bias**: No inconsistency was revealed during analyses (all P > 0.05).

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: A retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^116Nq5bv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common pregnancy complaints, affecting nearly 70% of pregnant women to some degree, ranging from mild to severe. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is the most severe form of pregnancy sickness, which inhibits normal fluid and/or food intake and strongly limits activities of daily living. A global meta-analysis and a large UK population study found a prevalence of HG of 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively.

Secondary to persisting nausea and vomiting, HG can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, weight loss, and metabolic disturbances, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. In addition to the maternal risk of anemia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and preeclampsia, HG is associated with low fetal birth weight and preterm birth. HG sufferers report symptoms that can be nearly unbearable, as illustrated by the findings that half of the HG patients in a large UK survey considered terminating the pregnancy, and one in four experienced occasional suicidal ideation. Additionally, there is a considerable risk of recurrent HG in future pregnancies, and many who have had HG are reluctant to become pregnant again.

First-line antiemetics for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP)/HG have traditionally included antihistamines (meclizine, promethazine, and cyclizine) and dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine), as these have reassuring evidence of safety in pregnancy. None of these has been demonstrated as significantly better in reducing NVP. If moderate NVP symptoms persist despite complementary treatment, guidelines generally recommend these options.

### Interventions for treating hyperemesis gravidarum [^1158rPHw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, affecting 0.3% to 1.0% of pregnancies. It is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization during pregnancy. A previous Cochrane review examined interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, but no review has specifically addressed the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of all interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy up to 20 weeks' gestation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (as of 20 December 2015), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of any intervention for hyperemesis gravidarum were included. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using a crossover design were not eligible. Trials focusing on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy without specifically studying the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Data accuracy was verified.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five trials (involving 2052 women) met the inclusion criteria. However, the majority of the 18 different comparisons described in the review included data from single studies with small numbers of participants. The comparisons covered a range of interventions, including acupressure/acupuncture and outpatient care.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^116r1AgY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Our findings illustrate that after the general metoclopramide recommendations from EMA and the Norwegian Health authorities, along with corresponding changes in the Norwegian hyperemesis guidelines, the provision of antiemetics for women suffering from HG was altered. Although in-patient use of metoclopramide was already declining, this dropped further in 2014, a trend that persisted throughout the study period. In contrast, we found a substantial, but non-persisting, drop in pre-hospital use of metoclopramide. A similar, temporary decline in metoclopramide prescription fills during pregnancy was seen from 2014 in the NorPD-study. Our results suggest that the EMA warnings in the HG treatment guidelines were implemented in clinical practice more extensively at the hospital compared to primary care.

Surprisingly, we found no compensatory increase in the use of other antiemetics when pre-hospital use of metoclopramide dropped, indicating that general practitioners (GPs) lacked treatment options to replace metoclopramide. This interpretation is supported by a study showing that GPs in the UK often lack confidence in prescribing recommended antiemetics in pregnancy, and Norwegian GPs have reported being wary of prescribing medicines for NVP due to the teratogenic potential, referring to the thalidomide tragedy. The recovery in the use of metoclopramide to the pre-intervention level may suggest that GPs, in lack of alternatives, assess the benefit of metoclopramide to outweigh the potential risk of adverse effects in severe NVP/HG.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: a retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^1149MobN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

By reviewing the patient files of women with hyperemesis gravidarum in nearly 10% of the pregnant population in Norway between 2002 and 2019, we found an overall increase in the use of antiemetics both prior to, during, and after hospitalization. Following the EMA warning in 2013, which restricted the use of metoclopramide, we observed a dramatic but temporary drop in the proportion of HG patients provided antiemetics pre-hospitally, most notably for metoclopramide. During hospitalization, metoclopramide was persistently replaced by prochlorperazine. In timely association with the restrictions on the use of metoclopramide, we observed a shift of hospitalization earlier in pregnancy and a worrying indication of an increased proportion of HG patients terminating their pregnancy.

Despite an increasing trend in the use of antiemetics prior to hospitalization, 4 out of 10 women hospitalized with HG in 2019 had not used antiemetics before the condition required in-patient treatment. Among pregnant women in the UK from 1998 to 2014, higher rates of antiemetic use were registered in women exclusively treated in primary care compared to patients hospitalized for HG, implying that pre-hospital antiemetic treatment prevents hospitalization. HG treatment guidelines from the US and Canada advocate early treatment initiation to reduce the need for hospital inpatient treatment and healthcare visits, thereby alleviating the disease burden for affected women. In line with European HG treatment guidelines, we found that dopamine antagonists and antihistamines constituted nearly the entire scope of use.

### Gimoti [^1125VWQU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The risk summary for lactation involves several key points. There are no data on the presence of metoclopramide in human milk following nasal administration; however, published data report the presence of metoclopramide in human milk in variable amounts following oral administration [see Data]. Systemic exposure following nasal administration of Gimoti 15 mg is expected to be similar to oral administration of metoclopramide 10 mg [see Clinical pharmacology (12.3)]. Breastfed infants exposed to metoclopramide have experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including intestinal discomfort and increased intestinal gas formation [see Clinical considerations]. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels [see Warnings and precautions (5.7)]; however, the published data are not adequate to support drug effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Gimoti and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Gimoti or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Clinical considerations**: Monitor breastfeeding neonates because metoclopramide may cause extrapyramidal signs (dystonias) and methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in specific populations (8.4)].

- **Data**: In published clinical studies, the estimated amount of metoclopramide received by the breastfed infant was less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted oral dose. In one study, the estimated daily amount of metoclopramide received by infants from breast milk ranged from 6 to 24 mcg/kg/day in early puerperium (3 to 9 days).

### Use of an antiemetic to shorten the length of labor in nulliparous women, exploring a potential role of an old drug: A randomized controlled trial [^114nRD1F]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). High credibility.

To assess whether metoclopramide is effective in shortening the duration of the first stage of labor in primiparous women, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at King Faisal Hospital, Saudi Arabia, between July 30, 2013, and September 1, 2016. Researchers sequentially recruited young nulliparous women admitted in spontaneous active labor with or without ruptured membranes. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive a slow intravenous injection of either metoclopramide or placebo. They were consistently managed according to the local institutional intrapartum protocol and received identical monitoring and supportive care. The primary outcome was the cervical dilatation rate.

Fifty-nine women were included in the metoclopramide group and 52 in the placebo group. The first stage of labor was significantly shorter in the metoclopramide group (203 minutes vs. 230 minutes in the placebo group, P = 0.019), with a faster cervical dilatation rate (2.4 ± 0.4 cm/h vs. 1.9 ± 0.5 cm/h in the placebo group, P < 0.001) and a shorter interval from treatment administration until full cervical dilatation. There was a significantly higher probability of faster delivery among women who were treated with metoclopramide (log-rank test, χ² = 5.997, P = 0.014).

Metoclopramide safely reduced the duration of the first stage of labor and was not associated with major maternal or neonatal adverse outcomes.

### Galactorrhea with metoclopramide use in the neonatal unit [^115NQcMN]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a 3½-month-old infant with trisomy 21 presenting with galactorrhea in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Endocrine work-up showed a high prolactin level (64.4 ng/ml; normal: 0.5 to 30 ng/ml). Cessation of therapy with metoclopramide (0.2 mg/kg per dose q 6 h) resulted in the resolution of galactorrhea with a decrease in serum prolactin level (20.1 ng/ml). We present this case to highlight this uncommon side effect of a commonly used medication in the NICU.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111RthR4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

The selection process, data extraction, and quality assessment involved several steps. Individual studies were initially screened based on titles and abstracts. If clarity was not achieved through these, a full-text review was conducted. Two investigators, S.S. and G.Z., independently performed the screening and data extraction. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with senior reviewers, such as J.L.

For each eligible study, two independent investigators, S.S. and G.S., extracted data that included the first author, published year, country, eligibility criteria, number of participants in each group, gestational age, details of interventions — such as startup time, dose, and duration — and outcomes.

The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was utilized to evaluate each trial before proceeding with data statistics. The studies' quality was independently assessed by S.S. and G.S. Any disagreements were discussed or addressed through consultation with the senior reviewer, J.L. The quality evaluation charts were generated using the "robvis" package of the R software.

- **Statistical analysis**: The mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) reflected changes in the volume of human milk production in postpartum mothers among the different intervention groups. Odds ratios (ORs) were employed to report the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events. Random-effects and consistency models were applied. Inconsistencies were assessed using the node-splitting method, and the results were documented accordingly.

### SPL drug information for mexiletine hydrochloride [^116erCT5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of mexiletine hydrochloride PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it is recommended to use only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies to assess the safety of mexiletine use in pregnant women. In reproduction studies involving rats, mice, and rabbits, an increase in fetal absorption was observed at doses up to four times the maximum human oral dose; however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity or impaired fertility.

The safe use of mexiletine during pregnancy has not been established. **The drug classification**: Mexiletine hydrochloride PO is classified under Category B1 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JLwwn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

- **Stratified by gestational week (preterm/term subgroup analysis)**: Twelve RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with preterm infants. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62; Fig. 4A and Supplemental Table S4). There was no difference between metoclopramide and placebo (MD = 3.95, 95% CI: -22.52–46.59; Fig. 4A). Five RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with term infants. There was no difference among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo (Fig. 4A and Supplemental Table S5).

- **Subgroup analysis of efficacy**:
	- (A) Stratified by gestational week (preterm or term)
	- (B) Stratified by different daily doses
	- (C) Stratified by different cumulative doses during trials

- **Stratified by different daily doses**: According to different daily doses, all trials receiving domperidone have been divided into two groups: "domperidone 30 mg/day" (nine trials) and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" (two trials). All doses of metoclopramide taken were 30 mg per day. Results revealed both "domperidone 30 mg/day" and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume ("domperidone 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 100.52, 95% CI: 50.49–150.31; "domperidone > 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 120.35, 95% CI: 3.01–240.43; Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, "domperidone 30 mg/day" was more efficacious than "metoclopramide 30 mg/day".

### Metoclopramide and diphenhydramine: A randomized controlled trial of a treatment for headache in pregnancy when acetaminophen alone is ineffective (MAD Headache Study) [^112ooYfH]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). High credibility.

We investigated whether metoclopramide administered with diphenhydramine (MAD) relieves headache in pregnant women when acetaminophen alone is ineffective, using codeine for comparison.

- **Study design**: Normotensive pregnant women in the second or third trimester were randomized to MAD intravenously (10 mg and 25 mg, respectively) or codeine orally (30 mg) for headache after 650 to 1,000 mg of acetaminophen failed to relieve their headaches. Headache severity (pain score 0–10) was noted at intervals over 24 hours. The primary outcome was a reduction in pain score 6 hours after medication administration. A sample size calculation of 35 patients per group was based on an estimated reduction in headache pain score by at least two points, with an α of 0.05 and a power of 80%.

- **Results**: No difference was seen in the primary outcome. MAD pain scores were lower at 30 minutes (3 ± 2.8 versus 5.8 ± 2.3; p < 0.001), 1 hour (2.2 ± 2.3 vs. 4.1 ± 3; p < 0.01), and 12 hours (1.3 ± 2.5 vs. 2.7 ± 3; p < 0.05), but not at 6 hours. The time to perceived headache relief was shorter for MAD than for codeine (20.2 ± 13.4 vs. 62.4 ± 62.2 minutes; p < 0.001). More patients in the MAD group reported full headache relief within 24 hours (76.5% vs. 37.5%; p < 0.01).

In conclusion, MAD effectively relieves headaches in pregnant women when acetaminophen fails.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112U9yjE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). High credibility.

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed. The use of domperidone for breast milk stimulation must be prescribed by a physician, and potential side effects should be considered. Women should receive appropriate guidance on ways to enhance breast milk production in the hospital and in the 30 days following hospital discharge before considering medication to increase milk production.

### Metoclopramide [^113gZSpS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Renal impairment affects the clearance of metoclopramide. In a study involving patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, reduced creatinine clearance was correlated with reductions in plasma clearance, renal clearance, non-renal clearance, and an increase in elimination half-life. However, the kinetics of metoclopramide remained linear in the presence of renal impairment. The observation of reduced clearance due to renal impairment suggests that the maintenance dosage should be adjusted downward to prevent drug accumulation.

In pediatric patients, the pharmacodynamics of metoclopramide following oral and intravenous administration are highly variable, and a concentration-effect relationship has not been established. There are insufficient reliable data to conclude whether the pharmacokinetics of metoclopramide in adults and pediatric populations are similar. Although there is a lack of sufficient data to support the efficacy of metoclopramide in pediatric patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or cancer chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, its pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in these patient groups.

In an open-label study, six pediatric patients (age range, 3.5 weeks to 5.4 months) with GER were administered metoclopramide 0.15 mg/kg oral solution every 6 hours for 10 doses. The mean peak plasma concentration of metoclopramide after the tenth dose was twofold (56.8 mcg/L) higher compared to that observed after the first dose (29 mcg/L), indicating drug accumulation with repeated dosing.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: A prospective multicenter international study [^114kRg5n]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are very common during pregnancy, mainly throughout the first trimester. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor-blocking drug that is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the effect on the fetus of intrauterine exposure to metoclopramide.

One hundred and seventy-five women who received metoclopramide and consulted six teratogen information centers in Israel, Italy, Brazil, and Canada were studied. Women exposed to metoclopramide were paired for age, smoking, and alcohol consumption habits with women exposed to nonteratogens. Women in the metoclopramide group had a significantly higher rate of premature births (8.1%) compared to the control group (2.4%) [p = 0.02, relative risk = 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.12–10.12]. Rates of major malformations in the metoclopramide group (4.4%) did not differ from controls (4.8%) [p = 0.84, relative risk = 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.34–2.45].

According to our findings, metoclopramide use during the first trimester of pregnancy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of malformations, spontaneous abortions, or decreased birth weight. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these observations.

### SPL drug information for methamphetamine hydrochloride [^116f5ysq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of methamphetamine hydrochloride PO (also known as Desoxyn) in pregnant patients across all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Evidence indicates fetal harm in animal studies. Neonates should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms. Animal studies have revealed teratogenic and embryocidal effects when this drug was administered. Data on the long-term potential for fertility impairment is not available. There is no controlled data in human pregnancy. Infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight; these infants may experience withdrawal symptoms, demonstrated by dysphoria, including agitation and significant lassitude.

### Antiemetic treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum in 1,064 Norwegian women and the impact of European warning on metoclopramide: A retrospective cohort study 2002–2019 [^117RZvcC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). High credibility.

Eliminating the most frequently used treatment option in primary care could be expected to increase the number of women requiring hospital treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), but no increase in hospitalization rate was observed in our cohort. This might be due to a lack of power despite the relatively large cohort. However, we observed a decrease in gestational age at first admission, reflecting earlier hospital referrals for HG from 2014. This change was persistent despite the recovery of the pre-hospital antiemetic provision.

A possible explanation is that while the use of metoclopramide pre-hospital apparently recovered after the initial drop, women were only offered five days of treatment and hospitalized if further treatment was required. In the NorPD study, treatment duration exceeding 5 days was registered for virtually all metoclopramide prescriptions from 2015 to 2017. However, the median treatment duration reported corresponds to the smallest package size available in Norway (20 tablets; 6.7 days), and therefore gives no indication of whether administration complied with the five-day limit. Indication of less weight loss at hospitalization in 2014, albeit not reaching statistical significance when adjusting for multiple testing, supports the interpretation that women were admitted earlier due to reduced treatment provision.

We observed a doubling in the rate of termination of pregnancy in timely association with a temporary decline in pre-hospital use of antiemetics. This suggests that delayed treatment initiation might increase the risk of termination.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^115bi2QP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The most commonly used conventional medicines against nausea in the total population were antihistamines, used by 613 respondents (6.7%). Metoclopramide was the second most commonly used medicine, with 268 respondents (2.9%). Antacids (ATC-group A02), ondansetron, and domperidone were used by 176 (2.6%), 54 (0.6%), and 48 (0.5%) respondents, respectively. Conventional medicines were most commonly used against nausea in Canada, France, Switzerland, and Sweden.

The type of conventional medicine most commonly used among women with nausea differed by region and country, but in the majority of countries, it was either antihistamines or metoclopramide. An exception was ondansetron, which was the most commonly used medicine in the United States, closely followed by antihistamines. In Croatia, Russia, Serbia, and Slovenia, the most common medicines were antacids, despite heartburn and reflux problems being less prevalent in these countries (60.5%, 59.6%, 52.7%, and 57.7%, respectively) compared to the total population (66.0%). Eastern European countries had a low frequency of conventional medicine use, with only one respondent from Slovenia reporting use. Interestingly, metopimazine was reported to be used against nausea by 29 respondents, all in France. In Canada, 54 respondents had used Diclectin®, a combination of the antihistamine doxylamine and pyridoxine.

### Compro [^115qtgzc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Usage in pregnancy**: Safety for the use of prochlorperazine during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, prochlorperazine is not recommended for use in pregnant patients except in cases of severe nausea and vomiting that are so serious and intractable that, in the judgment of the physician, drug intervention is required and potential benefits outweigh possible hazards.

There have been reported instances of prolonged jaundice, extrapyramidal signs, hyperreflexia, or hyporeflexia in newborn infants whose mothers received phenothiazines.

- **Nursing mothers**: There is evidence that phenothiazines are excreted in the breast milk of nursing mothers.

### Gastroparesis in pregnancy [^111WNgMk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Gastroparesis is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that more commonly affects women, with most cases being diagnosed during childbearing age. However, there is a paucity of data and guidelines specifically highlighting the epidemiology, disease course, maternal and fetal impact, and the management of existing gastroparesis during pregnancy. Apart from metoclopramide, there is no approved therapy specifically indicated for gastroparesis. More importantly, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic agents in the management of gastroparesis, posing a real challenge to healthcare providers in counseling and managing patients with the condition.

In this systematic review, we summarize the available literature and the knowledge gaps in the impact of pregnancy on gastroparesis and vice versa. We also highlight the efficacy and safety profiles of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies in the management of patients with gastroparesis, with emphasis on judicious use of dietary approaches that are deemed relatively safe during pregnancy.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: What does the gastroenterologist need to know [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 liters of water or drinks containing glucose, salt, and potassium is recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine, and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al. evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery, or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially in association with ondansetron.
