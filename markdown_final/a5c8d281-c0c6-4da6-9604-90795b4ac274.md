## Question

thrombopletis obliterans management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about management of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnosis and severity stratification. Then, I should confirm the universal foundation of therapy, which is smoking and cannabis cessation. Next, I will consider medical management for rest pain and ulcers, followed by interventional options for critical limb-threatening ischemia. After that, I should review supportive care and adjuncts, and finally, I will examine special populations, prognosis, and evidence gaps to guide individualized decisions and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation and staging because management hinges on correctly identifying TAO and classifying disease severity; Papa's criteria remain the clinical standard and require exclusion of atherosclerosis, embolic sources, hypercoagulable states, diabetes, and autoimmune disease, with characteristic distal segmental arterial occlusions on angiography and age of onset under 45–50 years in smokers, noting that I should double-check for coexisting limb infection at baseline because it independently predicts amputation risk [^113VMMZA] [^111tojNP].

> I need to ensure the severity framework aligns with current standards; although historically framed as CLI, I should use CLTI nomenclature to capture ischemic rest pain, nonhealing ulcers, and gangrene while remembering that global CLTI guidelines exclude nonatherosclerotic vasculitides like TAO from CLTI trial frameworks, which constrains the strength of comparative evidence in TAO but still allows severity grading to guide therapy intensity [^116ZsJiu] [^111MroYf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before any advanced therapy, complete smoking and cannabis cessation is the cornerstone and is more effective than any drug or procedure for preventing amputation; I should confirm abstinence with urine nicotine, cotinine, and toxicology screens at each visit because self-report alone is unreliable and underestimates relapse, and I should remember that amputation risk plummets after verified cessation while those who continue smoking have dramatically higher amputation rates over time [^115Vt1Ci] [^111kun8k] [^116vNzLo].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options for rest pain and ulcer healing; intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) has moderate-certainty evidence for improving ulcer healing and eradicating rest pain at 28 days compared with aspirin, though amputation rates at 6 months are similar, whereas oral iloprost is not superior to placebo and is generally not recommended, so I should reserve IV prostacyclin for active ischemic pain and ulcerative disease rather than expect limb-salvage effects beyond symptom control [^116PVXBc] [^113XLV6C].

> Wait, let me verify alternatives; alprostadil has been compared to prostacyclin analogues and shows similar ulcer healing and pain relief in low-to-very-low certainty studies, and small case series suggest potential benefit from endothelin receptor antagonism with bosentan or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with sildenafil for vasodilation, but the evidence base is limited and these should be considered adjuncts in expert hands rather than replacements for iloprost or cessation therapy [^116PVXBc] [^111mpoS7] [^112cY8Nn].

> I should confirm the role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy; routine antiplatelet therapy has not shown clear benefit in TAO-specific trials and is not disease-modifying, though general vascular risk modification principles may support aspirin in select patients with concomitant atherosclerotic risk, and systemic anticoagulation is not standard unless there is a separate venous thromboembolism indication, in which case standard VTE pathways apply with attention to bleeding risk [^113VMMZA].

> For patients with CLTI and anatomy unsuitable for bypass, I will now examine endovascular therapy as a limb-salvage strategy; contemporary series report high technical success and acceptable limb salvage and amputation-free survival with endovascular recanalization, and smoking cessation before intervention improves technical success and recanalization rates, which strengthens the case for combining cessation optimization with endovascular therapy when feasible [^1115XPq8] [^114UrQBR].

> But wait, what if bypass is an option; in carefully selected patients with suitable distal targets, surgical revascularization remains reasonable, and while TAO historically had high failure due to distal disease, emerging data suggest comparable amputation-free survival between endovascular and surgical approaches in some series, so a multidisciplinary team should individualize the choice based on anatomy, infection, and patient factors rather than apply a one-size-fits-all rule [^114kmMmX] [^111kfHvu].

> I need to check supportive and adjunctive care that meaningfully impact outcomes; meticulous wound care, infection control, and pressure offloading are essential because limb infection at diagnosis increases amputation risk more than tenfold, vacuum-assisted closure can expedite ulcer healing in select cases, and pain control should be optimized, with neuromodulation such as spinal cord stimulation considered for refractory ischemic pain when conventional measures fail [^111tojNP] [^1159hjam] [^1164bVKi].

> Let me consider special populations; in pregnancy, the hypercoagulable state may worsen TAO, and case-based experience supports prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin with close maternal-fetal surveillance, while in adolescents and very young adults, the same principles of cessation and infection control apply, and I should maintain a high index of suspicion for TAO in any young smoker with distal ischemia or migratory thrombophlebitis [^111CQB7p] [^113VMMZA].

> I should double-check prognostic factors to guide intensity; limb infection at diagnosis is the strongest predictor of amputation, nonwhite ethnicity has been associated with higher vascular event rates in Western cohorts, and importantly, ex-smokers have dramatically lower amputation risk than persistent smokers, reinforcing the need for aggressive cessation support and early recognition of infection to mitigate catastrophic outcomes [^111tojNP] [^115Vt1Ci].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence gaps so I do not overstate certainty; high-quality randomized data are sparse, most pharmacologic evidence is very low to moderate quality, and CLTI guidelines explicitly exclude TAO from core CLTI frameworks, so shared decision-making and center-level expertise are crucial, and patients should be counseled that while cessation is the most effective intervention, some advanced therapies may help symptoms and limb salvage but remain investigational in many respects [^116PVXBc] [^111MroYf] [^114mHonm].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency; confirm TAO with Papa's criteria and stage CLTI severity, mandate verified smoking and cannabis cessation with biochemical confirmation, initiate local wound care and infection control, treat rest pain and ulcers with IV iloprost when indicated, refer early to a vascular specialist for endovascular or surgical limb salvage evaluation, and arrange long-term surveillance for recurrence and complications, adjusting intensity based on infection status, severity, and patient preferences [^113VMMZA] [^116NMoMr] [^116PVXBc] [^116vNzLo].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and endpoints; given the chronic inflammatory vasculopathy and risk of relapse, structured follow-up every 3–6 months with clinical examination, smoking status verification, wound assessment, and selective imaging is reasonable, and when designing outcomes assessment, amputation-free survival, wound healing trajectory, and patient-reported pain and function are appropriate endpoints while acknowledging that durable benefits may require longer follow-up than typical 6–12 month windows [^111tojNP] [^113ApND6].

The cornerstone of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) management is **complete smoking cessation** [^111kun8k], which halts disease progression [^113VMMZA] and reduces amputation risk [^115Vt1Ci]. For acute ischemia, **intravenous iloprost** [^116PVXBc] improves ulcer healing and relieves rest pain, but oral vasodilators are ineffective. Endovascular therapy is reserved for **severe cases** [^1115XPq8] when medical therapy fails, with modest limb salvage and high reintervention rates [^notfound]. Anticoagulation is not routine [^notfound] unless there is venous thromboembolism or other indication [^113i9gxH]. Supportive care includes wound management, infection control, and pain control; amputation is considered only for non-salvageable limbs. Emerging options such as stem cell therapy [^112aXYa9] and bosentan [^111mpoS7] are investigational and not standard care.

---

## Smoking cessation

- **Cornerstone of therapy**: Complete abstinence from tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, and e-cigarettes) and cannabis is essential [^111kfHvu] [^113VMMZA].
- **Impact on prognosis**: Smoking cessation significantly reduces amputation risk and disease progression [^115Vt1Ci] [^111kun8k].
- **Supportive measures**: Behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and pharmacologic aids (e.g. varenicline, bupropion) are recommended [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Vasodilators and antiplatelet agents

- **Intravenous iloprost**: A prostacyclin analogue that improves ulcer healing and relieves rest pain; the most effective pharmacologic therapy for acute ischemia [^116PVXBc].
- **Oral vasodilators**: Pentoxifylline, cilostazol, and naftidrofuryl have limited efficacy and are not routinely recommended [^notfound].
- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin or clopidogrel may be considered for symptomatic relief, but evidence is limited [^notfound].

---

### Anticoagulation

Routine anticoagulation is **not recommended** unless there is concurrent venous thromboembolism or other indications [^notfound].

---

## Endovascular and surgical interventions

Endovascular interventions (angioplasty, stenting) are reserved for **severe cases** with critical limb ischemia [^1115XPq8] when medical therapy fails; they offer modest limb salvage but have high reintervention rates [^1115XPq8]. Surgical bypass is generally avoided due to **poor patency and high complication rates** in TAO [^notfound].

---

## Supportive care

- **Wound care**: Regular debridement, infection control, and appropriate dressings are essential [^notfound].
- **Pain management**: Analgesics, including opioids, may be required for severe ischemic pain [^1164bVKi].
- **Infection control**: Prompt treatment of infections to prevent progression and amputation [^115Vt1Ci].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Stem cell therapy**: Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells show promise in improving ulcer healing and pain-free walking distance, but evidence is limited and not yet standard care [^112aXYa9] [^114QEm3e].
- **Bosentan**: An endothelin receptor antagonist, may improve symptoms in refractory cases, but data are limited [^111mpoS7].

---

## Indications for amputation

Amputation is considered for **non-salvageable limbs** with extensive gangrene, uncontrolled infection, or intractable pain despite maximal medical therapy.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should monitor **disease progression**, **smoking cessation adherence**, and **complications** [^116C75ps]. Surveillance imaging with duplex ultrasound or angiography may be used to assess vascular status.

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Severity** | **First-line therapy** | **Second-line therapy** | **Supportive care** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild | Smoking cessation | Oral vasodilators (limited efficacy) | Wound care, pain control |
| Moderate | Smoking cessation, IV iloprost | Endovascular therapy (if refractory) | Wound care, infection control |
| Severe | Smoking cessation, IV iloprost | Endovascular therapy, amputation (if non-salvageable) | Wound care, infection control, pain control |

---

The management of TAO centers on **smoking cessation**, with intravenous iloprost for acute ischemia and endovascular therapy reserved for refractory cases. Supportive care and selective amputation are essential, while emerging therapies remain investigational.

### How to treat a patient with thromboangiitis obliterans: a systematic review [^114mHonm]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

To date, there is still no treatment protocol for patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) who are also afflicted with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Smoking cessation on its own cannot be considered a treatment for the purposes of salvaging a limb of a TAO patient with CLI. The aim of this review was to evaluate different studies of various treatment protocols for avoiding amputation in TAO patients. A systematic search for relevant studies dating from 1990 to the end of 2016 was performed on the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Science Direct databases. Only 24 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which only one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The remaining studies were quasi-experimental with various treatments and follow-up durations. Therefore, meta-analysis was not performed. Judging from the major amputation rates after the suggested treatments were performed, no treatment was particularly effective. This review demonstrated that more standard RCTs are needed to resolve this treatment issue involved in TAO. In addition, because health insurance coverage for TAO patients differs by country, regional cost-benefit and cost-efficacy studies of the suggested treatments for TAO are highly recommended.

### Chronic management of pulmonary embolism in thromboangiitis obliterans [^113i9gxH]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger's disease, is a rare small vessel vasculitis that is associated with an increased risk of arterial occlusion. Although venous thromboembolism has been described, the risk of its recurrence and the best long-term anticoagulation management is not known. Considering this, we would like to share our experience with two patients admitted to our hospital with recurrent pulmonary embolism and previous diagnosis of TAO, aiming to discuss the indication for indefinite anticoagulation in this population.

### Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) [^1155727M]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic vasculitis that is triggered by substantial exposure to tobacco. This disease usually affects small- and medium-sized arteries in the upper and lower extremities. All clinicians who take care of patients with peripheral arterial disease should know the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of Buerger disease. In this article, we review the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for Buerger disease. We describe the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having Buerger disease and discuss the typical findings on noninvasive arterial studies and angiography. Lastly, we review the management of these patients, including medical therapy, with an emphasis on smoking cessation, as well as the potential role of revascularization, both surgical and endovascular.

### Stem cell therapy for treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease) [^112aXYa9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small- and medium-sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Stem cell therapy is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischemic ulcers or rest pain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of stem cell therapy in individuals with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 17 October 2017. The review authors searched the European grey literature OpenGrey Database, screened reference lists of relevant studies and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of stem cell therapy in thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors (DC, DM, FN) independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis.

Main Results

We only included one RCT (18 participants with thromboangiitis obliterans) comparing the implantation of stem cell derived from bone marrow with placebo and standard wound dressing care in this review. We identified no studies that compared stem cell therapy (bone marrow source) versus stem cell therapy (umbilical cord source), stem cell therapy (any source) versus pharmacological treatment and stem cell therapy (any source) versus sympathectomy. Ulcer healing was assessed in the form of ulcer size. The mean ulcer area decreased more in the stem cell implantation group: from 5.04 cm² (standard deviation (SD) 0.70) to 1.48 cm² (SD 0.56) compared with the control group: mean ulcer size area decreased from 4.68 cm² (SD 0.62) to 3.59 cm² (SD 0.14); mean difference (MD) -2.11 cm², 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.49 to -1.73; 1 study, 18 participants; very low-quality evidence. Pain-free walking distance showed more of an improvement in the stem cell implantation group: from mean of 38.33 meters (SD 17.68) to 284.44 meters (SD 212.12) compared with the control group: mean walking distance increased from 35.66 meters (SD 19.79) to 78.22 meters (SD 35.35); MD 206.22 meters, 95% CI 65.73 to 346.71; 1 study; 18 participants; very low-quality evidence. Outcomes such as rate of amputation, pain, amputation-free survival and adverse effects were not assessed. The quality of evidence was classified as very low, with only one study, small numbers of participants, high risk of bias in many domains and missing information regarding tobacco exposure status.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low-quality evidence suggests there may be an effect of the use of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the healing of ulcers and improvement in the pain-free walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. High-quality trials assessing the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) are needed.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans or Buerger's disease: challenges for the rheumatologist [^111SgibC]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) — a type of vasculitis in young, mostly male subjects — remains strangely linked to smoking, which determines its occurrence, progression and prognosis by currently unknown mechanisms. It affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the limbs. Despite the usual absence of systemic signs and symptoms, initially intermittent arthritis, even if not observed in all cases, confer on this disease the status of a systemic vasculitis. Diagnosis requires the elimination of many other diseases. The severity of the disease lies in the need for amputation in more than a quarter of all patients. Complete cessation of smoking remains the cornerstone of therapy. Local care is the second essential element of treatment. Prostacycline analogues can be used to help the patient through critical ischaemia. Blockade with antagonists of cannabinoid or endothelin receptors and the use of gene- or cell-based therapy to induce therapeutic angiogenesis have opened up new possibilities for treatment.

### Acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular thrombus in a young male with thromboangiitis obliterans: a case report and literature review [^112JpLj9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger's disease, is a segmental, non-atherosclerotic inflammatory condition that predominantly affects the small and medium-sized arteries, veins, and nerves of the limbs. Reports of TAO involving the coronary arteries are exceedingly rare, and there is currently no consensus on the optimal revascularization strategies or specific antithrombotic regimens for these patients. Herein, we present a case of a patient with established TAO who developed acute anterior myocardial infarction accompanied by a left ventricular thrombus. This case report also provides a comprehensive review of the literature on coronary involvement in TAO and compares it with systemic vasculitis, aiming to summarize current knowledge in this field. We call upon cardiovascular specialists to focus research efforts on this unique patient population, addressing both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including interventional and pharmacological strategies.

### Knowledge mapping of global status and trends for thromboangiitis obliterans: a bibliometrics and visual analysis [^115R7xrx]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We present the global status and trends of TAO-related publications from 1999 to 2022. Although the number of TAO publications has fluctuated over the past 20 years, it has generally shown a steady upward trend. Japan has the leading global position not only in the number of publications, but also total citations, average citations and H-index. Institution with the major contribution to TAO research is Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, and Nagoya University. Annals of Vascular Surgery, Angiology, Journal of Vascular Surgery are the main publication channel for articles related to TAO. Fazeli, B. Iwai, T. and Kihara, Y. are major contributors in this field. In addition, etiology and treatment research on TAO will become a hot spot in the future. Specifically, trail, therapy, outcome, management, stem cells, angioplasty, and activation have received much attention from researchers in recent years.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^111kfHvu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Since the landmark article by Leo Buerger in 1908, there has been little progress in the understanding of the cause, pathophysiology, and optimum treatment of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). 1 There are ≈40 to 50 articles published on TAO every year, and for the most part, they comprise case reports, small series, and review articles. There has been only incremental new information published since the articles published from the 1960s to the present time. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

TAO is a nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory vascular disease that affects the small‐ and medium‐size arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities. The pathological hallmark of this disease is the presence of a highly inflammatory thrombus in the affected arteries and veins. 2, 7 There is a strong association with the use of tobacco products as well as cannabis. 8, 10, 11 There has never been a well‐documented case of Buerger's disease published in a patient proven not to be using tobacco or cannabis in some form (ie, confirmation of smoking cessation by measuring urine nicotine or cotinine levels and toxicology screen). The prevalence of TAO is much higher in the Middle East and Asia as compared with North America and Western Europe. It appears that the prevalence of TAO is declining in North America and Western Europe because of a decline in the rate of smoking and the use of stricter criteria in the diagnosis of TAO. 10, 12, 13 There has been no significant change in the way patients with Buerger's disease are medically treated over the past 20 years. 3, 14 The most effective way to "treat" these patients is to convince them that complete abstinence of tobacco and cannabis use will substantially lessen the likelihood of amputation. 8, 13, 14 However, there have been significant advances in endovascular therapy over the past decade. In 2 recent reports, it was shown that in addition to discontinuing smoking, endovascular therapy may be an effective way to preserve the limb and speed the healing of ischemic ulcers in selected patients with TAO. 15, 16 While the sample size in each of these studies was small (35 and 44 patients, respectively), the technical results and immediate and late clinical outcomes resulted in amputation‐free survival rates similar to those of patients undergoing surgical bypass procedures, and the healing of ischemic ulcers occurs much sooner than with discontinuation of smoking alone.

### Pharmacological treatment for Buerger's disease [^116PVXBc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The aetiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularisation to improve the condition. Pharmacological treatment is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischaemic ulcers or rest pain. This is an update of the review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any pharmacological agent (intravenous or oral) compared with placebo or any other pharmacological agent in patients with Buerger's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 15 October 2019. The review authors searched LILACS, ISRCTN, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, EU Clinical Trials Register, clincialtrials.gov and the OpenGrey Database to 5 January 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pharmacological agents used in the treatment of Buerger's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this update. Five randomised controlled trials (total 602 participants) compared prostacyclin analogue with placebo, aspirin, or a prostaglandin analogue, and folic acid with placebo. No studies assessed other pharmacological agents such as cilostazol, clopidogrel and pentoxifylline or compared oral versus intravenous prostanoid. Compared with aspirin, intravenous prostacyclin analogue iloprost improved ulcer healing (risk ratio (RR) 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 6.11; 98 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and helped to eradicate rest pain after 28 days (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.52; 133 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), although amputation rates were similar six months after treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.15; 95 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). When comparing prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) with prostaglandin (alprostadil) analogues, ulcer healing was similar (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.69; 89 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence), as was the eradication of rest pain after 28 days (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.44; 38 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), while amputation rates were not measured. Compared with placebo, the effects of oral prostacyclin analogue iloprost were similar for: healing ischaemic ulcers (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.29; 133 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.93; 135 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), eradication of rest pain after eight weeks (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63; 207 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.59; 201 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), and amputation rates after six months (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56; 209 participants; 1 study, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.31; 213 participants; 1 study). When comparing folic acid with placebo in patients with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia, pain scores were similar, there were no new cases of amputation in either group, and ulcer healing was not assessed (very low-certainty evidence). Treatment side effects such as headaches, flushing or nausea were not associated with treatment interruptions or more serious consequences. Outcomes such as amputation-free survival, walking distance or pain-free walking distance, and ankle brachial index were not assessed by any study. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to moderate, with few studies, small numbers of participants, variation in severity of disease of participants between studies and missing information (for example regarding baseline tobacco exposure).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) is more effective than aspirin for eradicating rest pain and healing ischaemic ulcers in Buerger's disease, but oral iloprost is not more effective than placebo. Very low and low-certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference between prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) and the prostaglandin analogue alprostadil for healing ulcers and relieving pain respectively in severe Buerger's disease. Very low-certainty evidence suggests there is no clear difference in pain scores and amputation rates between folic acid and placebo, in people with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia. Further well designed RCTs assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents (intravenous or oral) in people with Buerger's disease are needed.

### Treatment options for buerger disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes [^114kmMmX]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uncertainties exist regarding the optimal management strategy for patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAOs). The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of common interventions used for treating patients with TAO.

Methods

Endovascular treatment, revascularization, sympathectomy, stem cell therapy (SCT), and nonsurgical interventions were selected for inclusion in the study. Changes in mean visual analogue scale score and ankle brachial index (ABI) values were evaluated. In addition, the rate of ulcer healing, postintervention amputation, and overall complication rates were compared across interventions.

Results

A total of 1262 TAO patients (1159 males, 84 females), with a mean age of 38.4 ± 7.8 ys, were included in this systematic review. With an amputation rate of 16.6%, the endovascular treatment group showed statistically significant improvements in mean ABI and visual analogue scale scores (P < 0.05). There was a greater increase in ABI postoperatively with endovascular treatment compared to SCT (P < 0.05), and also a greater increase in ABI postoperatively with revascularization compared to SCT (P < 0.05). Meta-regression showed that both endovascular treatment and open surgical revascularization were superior to stem cell treatment for postoperative mean ABI improvement (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the rate of postoperative amputation was lower in the SCT group compared with the other two interventions.

Conclusions

Our results indicated that all three interventions may be a reasonable therapeutic option for TAO. Endovascular intervention and open revascularization demonstrated superior outcomes.

### Acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular thrombus in a young male with thromboangiitis obliterans: a case report and literature review [^115SP5pd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is an inflammatory vascular disease that primarily affects the small- and medium-sized arteries of the extremities. Coronary artery involvement in TAO is rarely reported, and we present the first case of TAO involving the coronary arteries with concomitant left ventricular thrombus. In addition, our case report includes a literature review on coronary artery involvement in TAO and draws comparisons with systemic vasculitis with coronary artery involvement. The case report and literature review aims to offer physicians valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment of TAO with coronary arteries involvement, while also advocating for increased research efforts to explore therapeutic strategies for this rare condition, including both pharmacological treatment and interventional therapy.

### TTP presenting as refractory hypoglycemia in a patient with thromboangiitis obliterans [^116buTGh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a challenging diagnosis to make in the emergency department. We present a case of TTP initially presenting with refractory hypoglycemia in a woman with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). To our knowledge, this is the first description of the association of hypoglycemia and thromboangiitis obliterans with TTP. We briefly review key aspects of the acute diagnosis and management of hypoglycemia and TTP pertinent to the emergency physician.

### Pharmacological treatment for Buerger's disease [^113XLV6C]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic, segmental inflammatory pathology that most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves in the upper and lower extremities. The etiology is unknown, but involves hereditary susceptibility, tobacco exposure, immune and coagulation responses. In many cases, there is no possibility of revascularization to improve the condition. Pharmacological treatment is an option for patients with severe complications, such as ischaemic ulcers or rest pain.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of any pharmacological agent (intravenous or oral) compared with placebo or any other pharmacological agent in patients with Buerger's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched their Specialised Register (last searched in April 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (Issue 3, 2015). The review authors searched trial registers and the European grey literature; screened reference lists of relevant studies, and contacted study authors and major pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pharmacological agents used in the treatment of Buerger's disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors, independently assessed the studies, extracted data and performed data analysis.

Main Results

Five randomised controlled trials (total 602 participants) compared prostacyclin analogue with placebo, aspirin, or a prostaglandin analogue, and folic acid with placebo. No studies assessed other pharmacological agents such as cilostazol, clopidogrel and pentoxifylline or compared oral versus intravenous prostanoid. Compared with aspirin, intravenous prostacyclin analogue iloprost improved ulcer healing (risk ratio (RR) 2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 6.11; 98 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), and helped to eradicate rest pain after 28 days (RR 2.28; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.52; 133 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), although amputation rates were similar six months after treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.15; 95 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence). When comparing prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) with prostaglandin (alprostadil) analogues, ulcer healing was similar (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.69; 89 participants; two studies; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), as was the eradication of rest pain after 28 days (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.72 to 3.44; 38 participants; one study; low quality evidence), while amputation rates were not measured. Compared with placebo, the effects of oral prostacyclin analogue iloprost were similar for: healing ischaemic ulcers (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.54 to 2.29; 133 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.93; 135 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), eradication of rest pain after eight weeks (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.63; 207 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.59; 201 participants; one study; moderate quality evidence), and amputation rates after six months (iloprost 200 mcg: RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56; 209 participants; one study, and iloprost 400 mcg: RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.31; 213 participants; one study). When comparing folic acid with placebo in patients with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia, pain scores were similar, there were no new cases of amputation in either group, and ulcer healing was not assessed (very low quality evidence). Treatment side effects such as headaches, flushing or nausea were not associated with treatment interruptions or more serious consequences. Outcomes such as amputation-free survival, walking distance or pain-free walking distance, and ankle brachial index were not assessed by any study. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low to moderate, with few studies, small numbers of participants, variation in severity of disease of participants between studies and missing information regarding for example baseline tobacco exposure.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence suggests that intravenous iloprost (prostacyclin analogue) is more effective than aspirin for eradicating rest pain and healing ischaemic ulcers in Buerger's disease, but oral iloprost is not more effective than placebo. Verylow and low quality evidence suggests there is no difference between prostacyclin (iloprost and clinprost) and the prostaglandin analogue alprostadil for healing ulcers and relieving pain respectively in severe Buerger's disease. Very-low quality evidence suggests there is no difference in pain scores and amputation rates between folic acid and placebo, in people with Buerger's disease and hyperhomocysteinaemia. High quality trials assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological agents (intravenous or oral) in people with Buerger's disease are needed.

### Knowledge mapping of global status and trends for thromboangiitis obliterans: a bibliometrics and visual analysis [^113v3KJi]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a segmental nonatherosclerotic inflammatory vascular disease characterized by recurrent progressive inflammatory reactions and thrombosis in the small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the extremities. However, there are few bibliometric studies on TAO. Therefore, this study was employed to generalize the research status, hotspots and development trends of TAO-related research.

Methods

The data from 1999 to 2022 were collected from the Web of Science core collection database, and analyzed through bibliometrics software. VOSviewer was utilized to carry out academic collaboration between different countries/regions, institutions, and authors, visualization map of co-cited authors, journals, reference, and co-occurring keywords. CiteSpace was used to analyze the dual-map of journals, keyword bursts, and timeline of keywords. Bar and pie charts in this study were statistically analyzed and graphed through Microsoft Excel 2021. Scimago Graphica was applied to map the academic collaboration between different countries/regions.

Results

A total of 553 literatures were involved in this study. Japan at the leading global position not only in the number of publications, but also total citations, average citations and H-index. Institution with the major contribution to TAO research is Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, and Nagoya University. Annals of Vascular Surgery, Angiology, Journal of Vascular Surgery are the main publication channel for articles related to TAO. Fazeli, B. Iwai, T. and Kihara, Y. are major contributors in this field. The studies on TAO keywords could be grouped into four clusters: Etiology, Mechanism, Cell therapy and Clinical therapy.

Conclusion

Although the number of TAO publications has fluctuated over the past 20 years, it has generally shown a steady upward trend. Etiology and treatment research on TAO and some keywords such as trail, therapy, outcome, management, stem cells, angioplasty, and activation will become a hot spot in the future.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease) [^115HzqwP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thromboangiitis obliterans is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease that affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the upper and lower extremities. This review will help to familiarize physicians with this vasculitis that is completely different from every other type of vasculitis encountered.

Recent Findings

While tobacco is central to the initiation and continuance of Buerger's disease activity, two interesting pathophysiologic observations have been made. There is endothelial dysfunction in arteries not yet clinically or angiographically involved in thromboangiitis obliterans. There are elevated levels of anti-endothelial cell antibodies and measurement of these antibody titers may be useful in following disease activity in Buerger's disease patients. The only therapy clearly shown to prevent amputation is the complete abstinence of tobacco. There is exciting work under way on the use of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists to help patients stop smoking. In addition, preliminary results on use of therapeutic angiogenesis in patients with Buerger's disease has demonstrated excellent collateral blood vessels formation and clinical improvement.

Summary

The difficulty in studying rare diseases such as thromboangiitis obliterans is that there are no significant research dollars available and even the most active centers only see a few patients per year. Therefore, there has been little progress in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. There are new therapeutic modalities that help patients with this disease, however, and patients can be assured that if they are able to discontinue tobacco use completely, amputation will not occur if critical limb ischemia is not already present.

### Management of Buerger's disease during pregnancy [^111CQB7p]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Buerger's disease (BD), also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a non-atherosclerotic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology that affects small-sized and medium-sized vessels of the extremities. It is usually observed in middle-aged adults, especially those who smoke or use tobacco products. This condition is more frequently observed in men, although recent findings indicate an increasing prevalence among women, potentially due to increased cigarette use. The association between pregnancy and BD is rare, with only a few published cases. Previous reports have indicated that BD may worsen during gestation due to the characteristic hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. In addition, it seems to be associated with intrauterine growth restriction secondary to infarction of placental vessels. Careful obstetric management of maternal and fetal status is mandatory in pregnancies complicated with BD. We report a successful case of a pregnancy in a patient with BD treated with low-molecular-weight heparin.

### Buerger's disease [^112MY63Y]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease of small- and medium-sized arteries of the distal extremities of predominantly young male tobacco users. Early symptoms may include episodic pain and coldness in fingers, and late findings may present as intermittent claudication, skin ulcers, or gangrene requiring eventual amputation. Tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of treatment. Other modalities of reducing pain or avoiding amputation have not been as successful. This review summarizes in tabular form the types of treatment that have been used, including therapeutic angiogenesis.

The Top 10 Cited Articles

Keywords stand for the essence and core of a paper, which reflect the research hotspots in the field. The top 5 keywords ranked in this study and their frequencies are thromboangiitis obliterans (177), thromboangiitis-obliterans (151), buerger's disease (150), buergers-disease (115), critical limb ischemia (60). By clustering the keywords with frequency more than or equal to 10, a total of 71 qualified keywords were obtained and grouped into four clusters (Figure 8A). Green clusters represent "Cell therapy study", mainly about endothelial progenitor cell; blue clusters represent "Mechanism study", mainly about inflammation; red clusters represent "Etiology study", mainly about smoking; yellow clusters represent studies on "Clinical therapy study", mainly about sympathectomy. Figure 8B shows the map of co-occurring keywords over time. In this figure, different colors indicate the relevant year of publication. Yellow keywords came later than blue keywords. In addition, a burst keyword means the word that occur frequently within a specific time period. It shows the evolution of research hotspots over time, which indicates the research trends recently and foreshadow future trends (Figure 9). The burst keyword with highest strength is endothelial progenitor cells. However, trial, therapy, outcome, and management have received much attention in recent years. Timeline of keywords on TAO (Figure 10) forms 10 clusters over time: #0 (thromboangiitis obliterans), #1 (buergers disease), #2 (peripheral arterial disease), #3 (c-reactive protein), #4 (adhesion molecules), #5 (critical limb ischemia), #6 (endovascular procedure), #7 (diabetes mellitus), #8 (peripheral artery disease), #9 (paracrine action).

### Vacuum-assisted wound closure for the management of a foot ulcer due to Buerger's disease [^1159hjam]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Thromboangiitis obliterans is a segmental inflammatory disease of the small- and medium-sized vessels mainly affecting the extremities. Although there are numerous reports concerning the treatment of these debilitating, chronic ulcers, such as skin grafting, local flaps, and free flaps, this report is the first published case of a patient with Buerger's disease, successfully managed with vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) application. This therapy decreases the period of hospital stay and increases patient comfort between dressings. Further clinical studies are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of VAC therapy in treatment of ulcers due to different kinds of vasculitis.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^111m9Yn3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the difficulties in doing research on rare diseases, Le Joncour and colleagues have added to the knowledge base regarding outcomes in patients with Buerger's disease. As they noted, this is the largest study of patients with TAO from Western Europe and the United States. It is important to recognize that it took 46 years to accumulate a sample size of 224 patients and longitudinal follow‐up is very difficult in patients with TAO. Thus, there are gaps in our understanding of the natural history in patients with Buerger's disease. The authors confirmed that cessation of tobacco use leads to a better prognosis. They also showed us that milder signs and symptoms at presentation leads to better outcomes and fewer amputations. Thus, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms pointing to Buerger's disease so that it can be diagnosed earlier, with a goal of preventing major and minor amputations. Those who have advanced disease are more likely to have limb infection, which leads to a high likelihood of needing an amputation.

### Systematic review of pharmacological therapies for the management of ischaemic pain in patients with non-reconstructable critical limb ischaemia [^111kLYN8]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Definition

The Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) defines critical limb ischaemia (CLI) as the following: any patient with chronic ischaemic rest pain, ulcers or gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease.CLI is a chronic condition, distinct from acute limb ischaemia.

CLI is a severe stage of peripheral arterial disease. Patients with CLI can be classified in the grades of the Fontaine classification (stages III–IV) or the Rutherford classification (grades 4–6). Not all patients progress through the predefined stages from claudication to CLI. Progression to CLI is often variable and unpredictable.

Epidemiology

CLI will develop in 500–1000 patients annually in a Western population of 1 million people. It is associated with surgery, hospitalisation and death. Patients with CLI have cardiovascular event rates higher than those in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Thomas et al found that in patients with conservatively treated severe CLI, all-cause mortality was 58% with a 2-year survivability rate of 55%. The 5-year mortality exceeds that of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, stroke, acute myocardial infarction and prostate cancer.

Pathophysiology of CLI and ischaemic pain

Most commonly, CLI is caused by atherosclerosis. Other causes include vasculitis, thromboembolic disease, arterial embolic disease, in situ thrombosis, cystic adventitial disease, thromboangiitis obliterans or trauma. Irrespective of the underlying cause, the pathophysiology of CLI is complex. There are three main mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology: haemodynamic abnormalities, oxidative stress and alterations in skeletal muscle metabolism. All compensatory mechanisms to retain skin perfusion become ineffective.

Chronic ischaemic pain has a significant neuropathic component. This is proposed to be secondary to a distal axonopathy affecting nerve fibres of all sizes. Blood flow in the lower limbs of patients with CLI correlates with neurological symptom scores and electrophysiological testing.

Ischaemic pain and impact on quality of life

CLI is primarily characterised by pedal rest pain. It is typically worse at night (when the limb is no longer in a dependent position), often waking patients from their sleep. Pain from ulceration also occurs. Multiple studies have shown that chronic ischaemic pain negatively impacts on multiple dimensions of quality of life.

### Acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular thrombus in a young male with thromboangiitis obliterans: a case report and literature review [^1175fNo5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombus formation in TAO is primarily driven by endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, immune responses, and oxidative stress. Persistent inflammation damages endothelial cells, exposing collagen and tissue factor, which promote platelet adhesion and activation. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins and TNF-α, exacerbate endothelial injury and recruit leukocytes, while neutrophils release extracellular traps (NETs) that stabilize thrombi. Immune complexes and autoantibodies further inhibit natural anticoagulants, leading to a hypercoagulable state. Oxidative stress, often induced by smoking, generates reactive oxygen species that impair endothelial function and activate the coagulation cascade. Genetic predispositions may also increase thrombosis susceptibility. This complex interplay fosters an environment conducive to thrombus development in TAO, suggesting potential therapeutic targets, including anti-inflammatory agents, antioxidants, and anticoagulants, to mitigate thrombogenesis and enhance patient outcomes.

Indeed, there is a lack of consensus regarding the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with coronary artery involvement in TAO and systemic vasculitis. In the case of STEMI patients, primary PCI is recommended to enhance patient outcomes. On the other hand, it is essential for individuals with different types of coronary artery issues to focus on treating the primary disease because regression of coronary lesions may happen at the same time as alleviating the primary condition. For TAO patients, smoking cessation stands as the foremost treatment strategy, while vasodilators like prostaglandin analogs and phosphodiesterase inhibitors may alleviate symptoms. Similarly, for the majority of systemic vasculitis patients, a treatment regimen involving glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants can ameliorate their condition. Consequently, the coronary artery involvement in many patients may ameliorate with primary disease treatment. Hence, the necessity of immediate intervention therapy during the acute phase remains a topic of debate. Moreover, for patients necessitating delayed revascularization, the decision between PCI and CABG remains uncertain. In this case, after comprehensive discussion among the team, we ultimately opted for a conservative treatment strategy combining smoking cessation with medication, rather than proceeding with PCI or CABG. The favorable outcomes observed during follow-up further underscore the critical importance of smoking cessation as a therapeutic strategy.

### Treatment of thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease) with high-potency vasodilators [^112cY8Nn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) or Buerger's disease is a vascular inflammatory thrombotic occlusive and segmental disease affecting distal small and medium-sized arteries of the limbs. Tobacco is the main trigger factor and avoiding it is the main treatment. Frequently, it is necessary to use high-potency vasodilators, such as iloprost, bosentan, sildenafil, or alprostadil, to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of amputation. Iloprost is the only one that has been shown to be effective in randomized clinical trials. We report the third case of TAO treated with sildenafil and a new case treated with bosentan. This condition can be diagnosed and treated by a dermatologist. We would like to highlight the excellent clinical response despite the fact that patients continued to smoke. This finding may have important therapeutic implications because early treatment may prevent amputation and can be effective even during the process of giving up smoking.

Nonhealing lower-extremity wounds with normal physiological testing — alternative diagnoses and distinguishing features: Alternative diagnoses include venous ulcer, distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy), local injury, medication related, neuropathic, autoimmune injury, infection, malignancy, and inflammatory. Venous ulcer typically occurs at the distal leg, especially above the medial malleolus and develops in regions of skin changes due to chronic venous disease and local venous hypertension and is typically wet (i.e., wound drainage) rather than dry lesion. Distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy) involves toes, foot, leg with causes including diabetic microangiopathy, end-stage renal disease, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's), sickle-cell anemia, vasculitides, scleroderma, cryoagglutination, embolic, and thrombotic etiologies. Neuropathic ulcers occur at pressure zones of foot and may show hyperkeratosis surrounds the ulcer with diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy without diabetes mellitus, and leprosy.

OBJECTIVE. Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is an occlusive inflammatory disease affecting small- and medium-sized vessels that causes decrease in life quality and eventually limb loss. The only proven treatment method is smoking cessation, but it may be insufficient for limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia. In this single-center retrospective study, the feasibility and efficiency of endovascular treatment in TAO were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS. After approval of the local institutional review board, 41 patients who underwent endovascular treatment of TAO between January 2014 and June 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Technical success and procedure-related complications were recorded. Decrease in Rutherford classification score, relief of pain, and wound healing were evaluated to determine clinical success. Primary patency, limb salvage rate, and amputation-free survival were also evaluated. RESULTS. A total of 45 limbs were treated during the study period. Technical success was achieved in 82.2% of procedures. Mean follow-up was 29.8 months. Clinical improvement was achieved in 35 limbs. Three patients underwent major amputation and 12 patients underwent minor amputation. Amputation-free survival and limb salvage were both 93.3% at both 1 and 2 years. Reintervention was performed in 14 patients because of occlusion and clinical relapsing of the symptoms. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment of TAO is feasible, has a potential to prevent limb amputation in patients with critical limb ischemia, and has acceptable technical success and limb salvage rates. Because there is no consensus in treatment of TAO, prospective comparative studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of an endovascular approach.

4.2.4. Aortic Diseases

Vascular medicine trainees will need to know the pathophysiology of a wide breadth of aortic diseases, including — but not limited to — acute aortic syndromes, aortic occlusive disease, aortic aneurysms. They should be knowledgeable about disorders associated with aortic aneurysm and dissection, such as inherited connective tissue disorders, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndromes, hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, Turner's syndrome, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and infections. They should know the clinical signs and symptoms in patients presenting with high-risk aortic diseases such as aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and thoracic and abdominal aneurysms. The ability to evaluate and medically manage acute aortic syndromes is necessary for competency. In addition, trainees will be expected to know the strategies necessary for the long-term follow-up of patients with prior acute aortic syndromes. Trainees should be knowledgeable regarding indications, accuracy, and techniques of screening for thoracic, abdominal, and peripheral arterial aneurysms. Once a diagnosis of acute or chronic aortic disease has been made, knowledge of the indications and risks of both surgical and endovascular treatment with expected outcomes are essential to provide appropriate care. Similarly, indications for surgical and endovascular repair of both aortic and peripheral aneurysms will be important for trainees. Trainees should be skilled at the longitudinal evaluation of patients who have undergone aortic aneurysm open and endovascular repair. When the diagnosis of aortic aneurysm is confirmed, trainees should be able to provide counseling and education to patients and their families on the importance of genetic predisposition and screening methods.

4.2.5. Vasculitis, Vasospastic, and Temperature-Related Disorders

Vascular medicine trainees should learn when to consider vasculitis in the differential diagnosis of vascular disease and appropriately evaluate and diagnose small, medium, and large vessel vasculitis. Trainees should learn strategies for the medical management of vasculitis, including surveillance imaging, pharmacotherapy, and appropriate referral to or comanagement with rheumatology during the course of training. In addition, trainees should know when to refer patients for noninvasive and invasive diagnostic testing and revascularization. Similarly, trainees should acquire the knowledge and skills to diagnose, evaluate, and treat thromboangiitis obliterans; atheroembolism; erythromelalgia; and temperature-related disorders, including primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon, acrocyanosis, erythema ab igne, and pernio.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^111kun8k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Data regarding long‐term outcome of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans are lacking and most series come from India and Japan. In this study, we assess long‐term outcome and prognostic factors in a large cohort of thromboangiitis obliterans.

Methods and Results

Retrospective multicenter study of characteristics and outcomes of 224 thromboangiitis obliterans patients fulfilling Papa's criteria were analyzed. Factors associated with vascular events and amputations were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 38.5 (32–46) years, 51 (23.8%) patients were female, and 81.7% were whites. After a mean follow‐up of 5.7 years, vascular events were observed in 58.9%, amputations in 21.4%, and death in 1.4%. The 5‐, 10‐, and 15‐year vascular event‐free survival and amputation‐free survival were 41% and 85%, 23% and 74%, and 19% and 66%, respectively. Ethnic group (nonwhite) (hazard ratio 2.35 [1.30–4.27] P = 0.005) and limb infection at diagnosis (hazard ratio 3.29 [1.02–10.6] P = 0.045) were independent factors of vascular event‐free survival. Factor associated with amputation was limb infection (hazard ratio 12.1 [3.5–42.1], P < 0.001). Patients who stopped their tobacco consumption had lower risk of amputation (P = 0.001) than those who continued.

Conclusions

This nationwide study shows that 34% of thromboangiitis obliterans patients will experience an amputation within 15 years from diagnosis. We identified high‐risk patients for vascular complications and amputations.

### Long-term outcome and prognostic factors of complications in thromboangiitis obliterans (buerger's disease): a multicenter study of 224 patients [^115Vt1Ci]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In the present study, limb infection at diagnosis was associated with a 4‐fold higher risk of amputation. Fazeli et al reported that smoking duration was the only independent factor associated with major amputations. 20 Interestingly, gangrene or ulcers were not associated with a worse prognosis. Limb infection has not been studied in TAO but it has been proposed as an important prognostic factor in atherosclerotic critical leg ischemia, more specifically in diabetic patients. 21 In diabetics, limb infection increased the odds of amputation by 3‐fold. 22 Therefore, TAO patients with a limb infection may be those who should benefit from a more aggressive and careful therapeutic management.

We found that ex‐smokers did not experience an amputation within 4 years of tobacco cessation. In addition, at the time of the first amputation, 90% of patients were still smokers. These data confirm previous observations that tobacco cessation is the cornerstone of TAO management. In Olin's series of 120 patients with TAO, 94% of ex‐smokers avoided amputation, while 43% of smokers required amputation. Ohta et al reported that all 41 ex‐smokers were free from limb amputation, while 13 of 69 smokers underwent amputation. 3, 5, 6 Fazeli et al confirmed that smoking cessation was highly protective for major amputation events. 20 However, Sugimoto et al did not observe a significant difference in the long‐term limb salvage rate between ex‐smokers and smokers at 20 years. 18 In our study, we did not find a negative association between amputation and the duration of smoking exposure nor with the amount of tobacco consumption. Cannabis consumption was not independently associated with a worse prognosis as previously described in a study of 38 patients with TAO. 15 In a review of the literature, the amputation rate in cannabis‐related limb arteritis was 58%, but no comparison could be done. 23

### Clinical outcome after extended endovascular recanalization in Buerger's disease in 20 consecutive cases [^113yGUvN]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

To present our experience of extended endovascular management for thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).

Methods

Between January 2005 and July 2010, a consecutive series of 17 Buerger's disease patients with CLI in 20 limbs were admitted and the diagnosis confirmed. The mean age of the patients was 41.5 years (standard error: ± 1.7). All patients presented with history of smoking, one patient presented with hypertension, and eight patients presented with dyslipidemia. According to Rutherford classification, all patients were found to be between grades 3 and 5. Ultrasonography first, and angiography examination later, confirmed a severe arterial disease involving almost exclusively below-the-knee and foot arteries in all cases. A new approach for revascularization, defined as extended angioplasty of each tibial and foot artery obstruction, was performed to achieve direct perfusion of at least one foot artery.

Results

An extensive endovascular treatment was intended in all patients with success in 19 of 20 limbs, achieving a technical success in 95%. No mortality or complication related to the procedure was observed. During a mean follow-up of 23 months (standard error: ± 4.05), amputation-free survival with no need of major amputation in any case and sustained clinical improvement was achieved in 16 of the 19 limbs (84.2%) successfully treated, resulting in a 100% limb salvage rate (19/19).

Conclusion

In this first experience, in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans, extended endovascular intervention was a feasible and effective revascularization procedure in case of CLI. High technical success, amputation-free survival, and sustained clinical improvement rates were achieved at midterm follow-up was achieved.

### Revisiting cerebral thromboangiitis obliterans [^115Fcg6k]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a 56-year-old patient with progressive cognitive decline in the context of heavy tobacco use and migraine, and imaging evidence of an occlusive terminal cerebral vasculopathy. The results of brain biopsy recapitulated the pathological features described by Lindenberg and Spatz in their classic 1939 treatise on cerebral thromboangiitis obliterans, or cerebral Buerger's disease. Although the condition is associated with heavy smoking, the identification of a hypercoagulable state in our patient suggests a multifactorial pathogenesis. The diagnosis of cerebral thromboangiitis obliterans in life is facilitated by modern neuroimaging and should prompt immediate cessation of smoking and a search for an underlying prothrombotic tendency.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^115F85s1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have evaluated the long‐term outcomes, including rates for major and minor amputations and survival in patients with TAO. 4, 8, 17 Ohta and colleagues reported on 110 patients from 1978 to 2001. Using the Kaplan–Meier life table method, they reported a cumulative survival of 84% with a mean follow‐up of 10.6 years. The total amputation rate was 43% with 12% of patients undergoing a major (above the ankle) amputation. 17 We reported an amputation rate of 27% in 112 patients followed over a mean of 91.6 months. 8 In a study from the Mayo Clinic, 111 patients with TAO were followed for a mean of 15.6 ± 10.1 years. 4 The risk of major amputation was 11% at 5 years, 21% at 10 years, and 23% at 20 years. Minor amputations occurred with a higher frequency. As in virtually every other published study, tobacco abstinence was associated with a favorable prognosis. However, the study by Cooper and associates was the only study that demonstrated reduced life expectancy (average age of death was 52 years) in patients with TAO compared with the remainder of the population in the United States. 4

Vascular Event

The mean follow‐up was 5.7 years, and there were 3 deaths of unknown origin. One hundred thirty‐two patients had at least 1 event other than amputation with a mean of 1.3 events per patient (including events before diagnosis). Thirty of the patients had a claudication worsening, 66 a limb ischemia, and 58 an ischemic ulcer or necrosis. The remaining 21 had a limb infection or superficial thrombosis. Vascular event‐free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 41% and 23%, respectively (Figure 1). In the univariate analysis, nonwhite origin was associated with higher vascular event rate (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.23–3.36: P = 0.006). In multivariable analysis, nonwhite origin (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.30–4.27: P = 0.005) and limb infection (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.02–10.6: P = 0.045) were associated with a higher vascular event rate (Table 2).

Predictive Factors of Vascular Event in Patients With TAO

Because the study spanned 50 years, we assessed whether the year of diagnosis modified the vascular event‐free survival rate. Year of diagnosis (disease diagnosed before versus in/after 2007, being the median year of diagnosis) has no significant effect on vascular event‐free survival (HR = 1.18 [0.72–1.95], P = 0.51). Nevertheless, we conducted a sensitivity analysis stratified on year of diagnosis (variable coded as described above) with no major change in results.

We observed only 3 deaths. TAO is not a life‐threatening disease. Previous series have reported a 6% death rate. 6, 16 However, the functional prognosis is seriously impaired. The 10‐and 15‐year amputation rate was 26% and 34%, respectively, in our study. In other series with a time‐dependent evaluation of amputations, the amputation rate ranged between 20% and 50% at 10 years. 7, 14, 18 The lower rate of amputation in our cohort compared with previous published reports could be explained by the difference of severity of patients across reports. Thirty percent of our TAO patients had ischemic ulcers or necrosis at baseline, whereas it was observed in 45% to 80% of patients in other cohorts. 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 18, 19 The study by Fazeli et al, who reported a similar amputation rate (ie, 30%) as in our cohort, had a similar percentage of ischemic ulcers and gangrene (ie, 20%–23%) at baseline. 20

### Rescue thrombolysis in the treatment of cardiac shock and acute stroke [^117HVajX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction are primarily managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. It is well accepted that rescue PCI should be implemented in case of unsuccessful thrombolysis. However, the reverse, rescue thrombolysis, that is, administering of thrombolytic therapy in a patient in whom primary PCI fails, is not well defined. There are no available data about rescue thrombolysis so far. We represent a 43-year-old male patient with Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) who was admitted to our emergency department for cardiac shock related to inferior and right ventricular ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He was found to have occlusion of both right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery and managed with rescue thrombolysis. It was subsequently recognized that he had concurrent stroke caused by posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion and improved with thrombolysis. It is reported for the first time that rescue thrombolysis has been put into practice and yielded great result after unsuccessful primary PCI.

### Beyond peripheral arteries in Buerger's disease: angiographic considerations in thromboangiitis obliterans [^116fohu6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans is an inflammatory peripheral vascular disease that is strongly associated with smoking. It predominantly affects distal small- and medium-sized blood vessels of both the upper and lower extremities. We present histological evidence of this disease process affecting the internal mammary arteries. This can be of paramount clinical significance for patients with Buerger's disease who present with obstructive coronary artery disease and require coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Internal mammary arteries involved with thromboangiitis obliterans cannot be utilized as arterial conduits during CABG and other alternatives have to be used. Therefore, we recommend preoperative angiography of both internal mammary arteries in patients with Buerger's disease requiring CABG to prevent extensive intraoperative dissection of diseased internal mammary arteries.

### How to use clinical signs and symptoms to estimate the probability of limb ischaemia in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer [^115uWfKG]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of ischaemia and interventions to improve perfusion are key elements in the management of the diabetic foot ulcer to achieve wound healing. This article will review, analyse and interpret the value of clinical information in determining the likelihood of limb ischaemia and thereby the need for referral to a vascular specialist. I conducted an historical review of the genesis of several currently recommended clinical signs and their diagnostic properties in the assessment of limb ischaemia. Changes in limb ischaemia probability based on such results were calculated using Bayes theorem, and the use of such probabilities is discussed in the context of the threshold approach to clinical decision making. Some clinical signs have negligible value in altering probability of limb ischaemia, possibly because they were advocated by Buerger for the diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans, an occlusive vascular disease of a different pathophysiology than atherosclerosis. Pedal pulse palpation, the most widely studied clinical sign, will marginally change a pre-test probability of ischaemia of 50% to 76% if positive (abnormal pulses) and to 36% if negative (normal pulses). Higher or lower pre-test probabilities of ischaemia will change the post-test probabilities such that these are too low or high to rule in or rule out ischaemia, respectively. Individual clinical signs convey little information regarding the presence of limb ischaemia but may have some value in combination or with pre-test probability near 50% in the assessment of ischaemia and the decision to refer for a vascular consultation.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range); categorical variables are presented as count (percent). Fifteen‐year vascular event‐free survival was defined as the time from the date of TAO diagnosis and the date of the first vascular event, amputation, death, or last follow‐up. Fifteen‐year amputation‐free survival was defined as the time from the date of TAO diagnosis and the date of the first amputation. Patients with amputation or vascular event before the diagnosis of TAO were excluded for survival analysis only.

Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan‐Meier product‐limit estimator. Factors associated with overall survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The proportional hazards assumption was checked by examination of Schoenfeld residuals. For the different end points, univariate analyses were first carried out, then a multivariate analysis was used where all factors with P < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were considered. If needed, factors were then sequentially removed from the adjusted model based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) criteria. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

### Knowledge mapping of global status and trends for thromboangiitis obliterans: a bibliometrics and visual analysis [^114QEm3e]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 5 shows the top 10 cited articles, of which the first article is a review, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which detailly describes the cause and pathogenesis, pathological findings, clinical features, and treatment of TAO. Interestingly, this article and the author has the strongest co-citation relationships with others in Figure 7A and C, indicating its insurmountable academic impact worldwide. The second and eighth articles mainly analyze TAO from the pathogenesis aspect, while the remaining 7 articles study TAO from a therapeutic perspective, including implantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, implantation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells, implantation of G-CSF-mobilized CD34(+) cells, implantation of umbilical cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells, and autologous progenitor cell transplantation ect.

Figure 8A shows a visualization map of co-occurring keywords through VOSviewer. The most frequently-used keywords in "Cell therapy study" cluster are stem-cells, endothelial progenitor cell, autologous transplantation, and therapeutic angiogenesis. The most commonly-used terms in "Mechanism study" cluster are activation, anticardiolipin antibodies, oxidative stress, thrombosis, and inflammation. Moreover, prevalence, tobacco, cannabis, smoking are often-used keywords in "Etiology study" cluster. The primary keywords in "Clinical therapy study" cluster are iloprost, bypass, revascularization, sympathectomy. Figure 8B is composed according to the time when the keyword appears. The different colors indicate the relevant year of publication. Yellow keywords came later than blue keywords. By overlapping the results of the two plots, we can see that etiology and treatment research will be the future trend of TAO research. To go into more detail, there is still a lot of room for research into key items such as stem cells, angioplasty, and activation. For example, Cacione D. G. et al conducted a randomized controlled trial demonstrating that bone marrow-derived stem cells may have an effect on ulcer healing and improving painless walking distance in patients with Buerger's disease. A prospective pilot study was conducted by Yang L. et al to prove ideal effect of laser-assisted angioplasty (LA) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) on TAO. In addition to this, the therapy of transverse tibial bone transport can enhance distraction osteogenesis and vascularization to treat TAO, achieve the effect of limb salvage, and improve the pain and numbness symptoms of patients. However, there is a certain recurrence rate after surgery, and patients still need to actively control their tobacco addiction throughout the course of the disease. As for the pathogenesis of TAO, Li M. D. et al concluded that it is related to complex factors such as oxidative stress, immunity, hemodynamic changes, and inflammation. Clinical research and exploration should be carried out, and valuable things in various studies should be synthesized, and further summarized to better clarify the mechanism of its pathogenesis. Figure 9 shows the period of concentrated outbreaks for the top 14 projects and how hot spots changed over time from 1999 to 2022. As you can see, trail, therapy, outcome, and management have continued to explode in recent years. Based on the previous inferences, it can be concluded that the future research directions are: randomized controlled trials, cell therapy, and personalized management. The interrelationships between the keyword clusters and the change of each keyword over time are shown in Figure 10. A total of 10 clusters of keywords have been formed in this study, among which the following are still under study: #0 (thromboangiitis obliterans), #1 (buergers disease), #2 (peripheral arterial disease), #3 (c-reactive protein), #5 (critical limb ischemia). Nevertheless, c-reactive protein (a reliable indicator of inflammation) is widely used in various TAO-related studies. All in all, further global collaborative research is urgently needed for a comprehensive understanding of TAO.

Introduction

Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a nonatherosclerotic inflammatory arteritis that involves small‐to‐medium‐size arteries and veins of extremities. 1, 2 Despite its strong association with tobacco exposure, the general pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown. TAO mainly affects young patients who present ischemic ulcers, rest pain, claudication, coldness of extremities, but also migratory thrombophlebitis and Raynaud phenomenon. Distal arterial occlusions can ultimately lead to limb amputation. 3, 4

Although it is observed worldwide, TAO seems to be more prevalent in the Middle East and Far East. Prevalence rates among in‐hospital‐treated patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were reported to range from 0.5% to 5.6% in Western Europe, 45% to 63% in India, and 16% to 66% in Korea and Japan. 5 Most series of TAO date back to the 1980s. In North America, Olin et al reported 112 patients with TAO from 1970 to 1987 and showed that the clinical spectrum changed over time with an increase in prevalence in women, and that patients who stopped smoking have a lower rate of amputation. 6 Cooper et al reported 111 patients from 1976 to 1999 at the Mayo Clinic and showed a time‐dependent rate of amputation of 48% at 10 years. 7 In Western Europe, Börner et al showed that the disease resulted in termination of working life by either dismissal or premature retirement. 8

TAO is considered to be rare in Western countries where clinical descriptions and long‐term outcomes are lacking, especially those coming from Europe. Although smoking cessation has shown an overwhelming effect for the prevention of limb amputation, 3, 5, 6 data regarding prognostic factors of TAO are scarce.

Our objective was to report the vascular event‐free survival, and the amputation‐free survival rate in 224 patients with TAO. In this French nationwide study, we analyzed the prognostic factors associated with these 2 outcomes using a multivariate model.

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in referral centers from the French TAO network between 1970 and 2016. We identified 224 patients fulfilling Papa's criteria 9 for TAO. This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was waived.

Exclusion criteria were evidence of proximal emboli or atherosclerotic disease, thrombophilia, connective‐tissue disease (ie, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective‐tissue disease), and diabetes mellitus.

Baseline clinical characteristics included age at onset and diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, clinical history, tobacco use (pack‐year), other addictions and drugs exposure, cardiovascular risk factors, associated diseases, main clinical (claudication, limb ischemia defined as rest pain and skin color change, ischemic ulcers or necrosis defined as tissue loss, limb infection, phlebitis, arthralgia, Raynaud phenomenon), biological features (complete blood count, serum creatinine, C‐reactive protein levels), and treatments.

Ethnicity was defined as the country of origin of the patient's parents and grandparents, and subjects were classified into 1 of the following defined ethnic groups: white and nonwhite (ie, North African, sub‐Saharan African, and Middle or Far East. Three patients who originated from Turkey were classified as nonwhite).

Definitions of Study End Points

A vascular event was defined as an acute worsening of the disease course requiring treatment modification (ie, occurrence of a claudication worsening, a limb ischemia, ulcers, necrosis, a superficial vein thrombosis, and/or a limb infection related to ischemia or death).

An amputation was defined as major if it involved the tibiotarsal articulation for lower limbs and if it involved the metacarpo‐phalangeal articulation for upper limbs.

At each visit, criteria for disease activity were assessed based on symptoms assessment, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. Clinical evaluation, duplex‐ultrasound, angio–computed tomography, and/or angiography were performed every 6 months or sooner if there was suspicion of disease flare or disease progression.

Smoking Cessation

Smoking patients at diagnosis who stopped their consumption at 1 year were considered as ex‐smokers. Their smoking status was checked at each visit based on self‐declaration. If they declared that they had resumed their consumption during follow‐up or at the amputation, they were considered as smokers.

### Thromboangiitis obliterans: 110 Years old and little progress made [^116vNzLo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

There are several other points that need to be discussed regarding this study and many of the other publications on TAO 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: (1) Since this was a retrospective study, complete longitudinal data were not obtained in the majority of patients because the patients were only evaluated on an intermittent consultation basis. Thus, accurate natural history and outcomes data are still not known; (2) Cannabis use was not independently associated with a worse prognosis as has been reported elsewhere. 11 In France, patients often mix cannabis with tobacco and hand roll their cigarettes. If this is the case in patients using cannabis in this series, it would be very difficult to assess the role that cannabis played in vascular events and amputations; (3) One of the most important limitations of this study and virtually every other study of TAO is failure to objectively determine that the patient actually did stop using tobacco or cannabis. In this and other reports, smoking status was made by self‐declaration. At first amputation, 5 (10.4%) of 48 patients stated they were not smoking and at the next amputation 8 (23.5%) of 34 patients were not smoking. These are very high amputation rates for patients who have stopped using tobacco or cannabis. In our series, there were 3 (5.5%) amputations among 55 patients who stated they stopped smoking. In all 3 cases, there was gangrene present at the time the patient discontinued smoking. As a general rule, if the patient has stopped smoking or using tobacco in any form (as confirmed by urine testing) and there is no gangrene present, amputations do not occur. 8, 20 In order to be sure the patient is no longer using tobacco or cannabis, urine for nicotine, cotinine (the metabolic breakdown product of nicotine), and cannabis must be obtained at each office visit. In all likelihood, the number of patients who are not using tobacco or cannabis would be much smaller than relying on the self‐declaration of not smoking. There are many questions that remain such as why do only 40% of patients who continue to smoke undergo an amputation? Other than continued tobacco use, what additional factors play a role in determining which patients are protected from amputation and which are more prone to amputation?; (4) It is not clear why nonwhites had a poorer prognosis than whites in this study. While the baseline differences between the 2 groups were not different, we have no information about the different socioeconomic factors between whites and nonwhites. There is the suggestion in some studies that the lower the socioeconomic status, the worse the prognosis in TAO. 17, 21 Thus, it may not be related to race but to other factors such living conditions, income, and overall socioeconomic status; (5) While the amputation rate is lower in this study than in other studies, the authors acknowledge that this may be because of the difference in severity of disease at presentation as compared with other studies. Thirty percent of TAO patients had ischemic ulcers or necrosis at baseline, whereas it was observed in 45% to 80% of patients in other series. On the other hand, Fazeli and associates reported a similar amputation rate as in the current series and had similar rates of ischemic ulceration and gangrene. 14 Thus, it appears that the milder the symptoms and signs at presentation, the lower the amputation rate.

### Pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans: gene polymorphism and immunoregulation of human vascular endothelial cells [^114q9VKY]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a nonatherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory vasculitis, which commonly affects the small- and medium-sized arteries of the upper and lower extremities. Despite its discovery more than a century ago, little progress has been made in its treatment. Unless the pathogenesis is elucidated, therapeutic approaches will be limited. The purpose of this review article is to collate current knowledge of mechanisms for the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans and to propose potential mechanisms from a genetic and immunoreactive point of view for its inception. Therefore, we discuss the possibility that the pathogenesis of this disease is due to a type of gene polymorphism, which leads to an immunological inflammatory vasculitis associated with tobacco abuse, highly linked to T cells, human vascular endothelial cells (HVECs), and the TLR-MyD88-NFκB pathway, distinct from arteriosclerosis obliterans and other vasculitides.

Amputations

Forty‐eight patients had at least 1 amputation (including amputation before the diagnosis) and among them 24 had more than 1 (Table 3). Amputations were more frequent in the lower limb, as 38 of the 48 patients (79%) had an amputation in lower limbs. Amputation remained exclusively minor in 33 of the 48 patients (66%). Amputation‐free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 85%, 74%, and 66%, respectively. Major amputation‐free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 94%, 91%, and 91%, respectively (Figure 2 A). In the univariate analysis, limb infection at diagnosis was associated with 15‐year amputation‐free survival (HR, 9.46; 95% CI, 2.81–31.8: P < 0.001). Cannabis consumption was not associated with a poor prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, limb infection at diagnosis (HR, 12.1; 95% CI, 3.5–42.1: P < 0.001) was associated with a higher amputation rate (limb ischemia, ischemic ulcers/necrosis, limb infection, and arthralgia were the variables used in the multivariable model). Kaplan‐Meier curve of amputation‐free survival in patients with TAO according to symptoms at diagnosis is shown in Figure 2 B.

Because the study spanned 50 years, we assessed whether the year of diagnosis modified the amputation‐free survival rate. Year of diagnosis (disease diagnosed before versus in/after 2007, being the median year of diagnosis) has no significant effect on amputation‐free survival (HR = 0.62 [0.29–1.31], P = 0.21). Nevertheless, we conducted a sensitivity analysis stratified on year of diagnosis (variable coded as described above) with no major changes on results.

### Treatment guidelines in vasculitis [^116edbox]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The vasculitides encompass a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the blood vessels with severe consequences including tissue ischemia, structural abnormalities, such as aneurysms/dissections, and end organ damage. The different forms are commonly classified based on the size of the blood vessel involved as large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitis. The American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation recently published guidelines on the management of several forms of primary systemic vasculitides. In this review, the recommendations for giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are discussed. We highlight the key recommendations, aspects where they diverge from other published guidelines, controversies, and areas of uncertainty.

Patient selection for invasive pts management

In the management of PTS, the appropriate selection of patients for intervention and stent deployment is crucial for successful outcomes. It is important to consider the severity and duration of symptoms. Before considering intervention, patients should have trialed conservative treatments, including compression therapy, exercise, and limb elevation. The severity of symptoms indicates the necessity for intervention to alleviate patients' suffering and prevent further complications. Patients with debilitating symptoms may be more willing to accept the potential risks of the procedure, because the benefits outweigh the adverse outcomes. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's comorbidities is essential in determining the appropriateness of intervention. Factors such as age, overall health status, and coagulation disorders should be considered to ensure that the benefits of intervention outweigh the potential risks. The link between age and the onset of PTS remains ambiguous. Age as a factor in PTS presents a mixed picture. Although a number of studies have not detected any correlation between age and PTS, variations in the upper age limits used for study cohorts complicate direct comparisons. However, this finding is contradicted by research suggesting that older age may actually be associated with a lower risk of developing PTS. Older patients may have a higher risk of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal dysfunction, which could influence the decision-making process for these interventions. Conversely, younger patients may have a longer life expectancy, necessitating careful consideration of the durability and long-term effects of stenting in this group. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of each patient's age, overall health status, and anticipated benefits and risks of venous recanalization and stent placement is crucial for optimal decision-making. The decision to test all patients with PTS for thrombophilia is a matter of debate. Negative testing for thrombophilia may falsely reassure clinicians, leading to the cessation of anticoagulation in patients at high risk for recurrence, while finding a thrombophilia in a patient at high bleeding risk may lead to continued anticoagulation, owing to an overestimation of the risk conferred by the condition. Therefore, the decision to test for thrombophilia in patients with PTS should be based on individual clinical assessment and guided by the potential impact on management, rather than routine testing for all patients. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, particularly those with triple positivity or a history of arterial thrombosis, may benefit from thrombophilia testing to tailor the anticoagulation therapy. Most guidelines currently recommend using warfarin over direct oral anticoagulants in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. It is recommended for patients with unexplained venous thromboembolism at ages of < 40 to 45 years, focusing on detecting common and less well-established causes.

### Ocular manifestations of Buerger's disease – A review of current knowledge [^114xNTUu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, is a disorder of primarily small and medium arteries and veins of the arms and legs. We have failed to find a comprehensive review discussing a possible link between the disease and the eyes. The aim of this study is to review current knowledge on the topic of ocular manifestations in the course of Buerger's disease. The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time or language limit. We have managed to review 13 articles, describing the involvement of the eyes in thromboangiitis obliterans. It appears that patients suffering from Buerger's disease may develop non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), occlusive retinal vasculitis and periphlebitis, papillophlebitis, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), normal tension glaucoma (NTG), uveitis, chorioretinal atrophy, retinitis, papillitis, optic atrophy, changes typical for hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally the abnormalities in electroretinography might be present. The treatment options and the possible outcome depend on the type of ocular manifestations, so it seems impossible to propose a universal therapy. We would like to raise awareness of the possible ocular manifestations in the course of Buerger's disease.

Discussion

This study is the largest reported to date that assessed long‐term outcome of TAO in a Western country. This French nationwide multicenter study provides important data regarding the prognostic factors associated with vascular events and amputations. The most striking conclusions drawn by this study are that (1) nonwhite patients had a 2‐fold higher risk of vascular events than white patients; (2) the 10‐ and 15‐year amputation rates were 26% and 34%, respectively; (3) limb infection at diagnosis was independently associated with the occurrence of vascular events and of amputation; and (4) smoking cessation was strongly associated with a lower incidence of amputation.

Compared with other cohorts, our French TAO cohort was broadly similar in its demographic features with a predominance of males. 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 Lower limb involvement and claudication were the most prevalent symptoms. Ischemic ulcers or necrosis were present in 30% of cases, whereas they are reported in 76% in the United States 6 and in more than 45% of patients in the Far East and Middle East. 10, 13, 14 Limb infection at diagnosis was evidenced in 8.5% of patients. Clinical characteristics of TAO did not differ between white and nonwhite as well as between cannabis users and nonusers, as previously described. 15

We observed a vascular event‐free survival at 10 years of 23%. Limb ischemia and ulcers were the most frequent events. Ohta et al also described that ulcers/gangrene were the most frequent symptoms during the clinical course of the disease. 16 Prognostic factors have not been well studied in TAO. Although the harmful role of tobacco has been widely demonstrated, 4 the impact of ethnicity, other toxics, and/or sex have never been studied. Herein, we demonstrated that limb infection and nonwhite origin were independently associated with vascular events. Ethnic origin had never yet been reported as a prognostic factor in TAO. White and nonwhite did not differ in terms of clinical features, treatments, or smoking status. Thus, the increase in vascular‐event rates might be explained by genetics, socioeconomic, or immunologic factors. 17

Endovascular therapy for acute and chronic lower-extremity deep venous disease seeks to improve patency and flow to ameliorate severe symptoms, prevent the postthrombotic syndrome, and treat existing chronic venous disease. Close postprocedure monitoring in the weeks to months following the intervention with implementation of an anticoagulation and symptom management strategy maximizes the likelihood of a durable result. This article outlines several such strategies based on the presenting pathology, results of the intervention, and biological characteristics of the patient.

Results

Characteristics of the Study Population and Treatment

Main demography, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings of the 224 patients with TAO are presented in Table 1. The median [lower quartile, upper quartile] age at symptom onset and diagnosis was 36 [29–44] and 38.5 [32–46] years, respectively. Fifty‐one patients (22.8%) were women. One hundred eighty‐three patients (81.7%) were classified as white, the other 41 patients (18.3%), classified as nonwhite, originated from North Africa (31 [13.8%]), Sub‐Saharan Africa (6 [2.7%]), and Far East (4 [1.7%]). All but 3 patients declared they were current smokers with a median consumption of 22 [12–30] pack‐year. Fifty‐one (23%) patients were also cannabis users. Demographic characteristics were not different between men and women or between whites and nonwhites.

Table 1
Main Characteristics of Patients With TAO According to Ethnicity

At diagnosis, 114 (52.8%) patients had a claudication, 162 (73.3%) a limb ischemia, 69 (31.5%) ischemic ulcers or necrosis, and 19 (8.8%) a limb infection. Exclusive lower‐limb involvement was more frequent with 119 patients (53.9%), and involvement of both upper and lower limb was present in 21 patients (9.5%). Superficial thrombophlebitis, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthralgia were present in 41 (18.3%), 93 (41.5%), and 17 (7.6%) patients, respectively. Raynaud phenomenon was more frequent in women than in men, 29 (56.9%) versus 64 (37.2%), respectively, P = 0.019. Clinical presentation was not different between white and nonwhite (Table 1), and between patients who consumed cannabis or not.

### Buerger's disease in the 21st century: diagnosis, clinical features, and therapy [^113VMMZA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans or TAO) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the development of segmental thrombotic occlusions of the medium and small arteries of the extremities. It is clinically and pathologically distinguishable from arteriosclerosis and necrotizing arteritis. Afflicted patients are mostly young, male, inveterate tobacco smokers who present with distal extremity ischemia, ischemic ulcers, or frank gangrene of the toes or fingers. Large arteries are typically spared, as are the coronary, cerebral, and visceral circulations. While mortality is not increased, patients with Buerger's disease often suffer from severe ischemic pain and tissue loss culminating in minor and major limb amputation. Clinical diagnostic criteria generally include the following: (1) history of smoking or tobacco abuse; (2) age of onset less than 45 to 50 years; (3) infrapopliteal, segmental arterial occlusions with sparing of the proximal vasculature; (4) frequent distal upper extremity arterial involvement (Raynaud's syndrome or digital ulceration); (5) superficial phlebitis; and (6) exclusion of arteriosclerosis, diabetes, true arteritis, proximal embolic source, and hypercoagulable states. Typical arteriographic patterns have been described that are suggestive, but not pathognomonic. While the cause of Buerger's disease remains unknown, the disease onset and clinical course are inextricably linked to tobacco abuse. Acute Buerger's disease is characterized histopathologically by intensely cellular vessel wall inflammation, giant cell foci, and hypercellular thrombi, but with preservation of the elastic lamina and the overall vascular wall architecture. Most investigators feel that Buerger's disease is an immune-mediated endarteritis; recent immunocytochemical studies have identified the linear deposition of immunoglobulins and complement factors along the elastic lamina. The inciting antigen has not been discovered. Tobacco abstinence generally results in disease quiescence and remains the mainstay of treatment.

### True leukonychia as the presenting sign of early thromboangiitis obliterans [^112YEMMP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leukonychia, white discoloration of nails, has a broad range of etiologies with the diagnosis and management based on monodactylous vs polydactylous presentation and clinical determination of true vs apparent leukonychia. True leukonychia represents an abnormality in the matrix and nail plate with no fading of the white color with pressure. This occurs due to abnormal distal matrix keratinization leading to persistent parakeratosis and keratohyalin granules in the intermediate and ventral nail plates. In contrast, apparent leukonychia represents a nail bed abnormality and fades with pressure due to reduction in nail bed edema and improved visualization of nail bed vasculature. Pseudoleukonychia, which does not fade with pressure, describes white color on the superficial nail plate, most often secondary to damage from nail cosmetics or superficial white onychomycosis. Leukonychia is further categorized as punctate, transverse, longitudinal, or partial/total. Punctate or transverse true leukonychia is frequently due to trauma, but other etiologies should be considered. Partial/total true leukonychia involving all digits can be seen in selenium deficiency, hydroxyurea exposure, or rare genodermatoses. Isolation of partial/total true leukonychia to a few digits should prompt evaluation for neurovascular disorders, such as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. In this report, we describe a case of true leukonychia isolated to the right second and third fingernails as the presenting sign of early thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO).

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and depending on the disorder can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians including interventional radiologists often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

Limb ischemia: case vignette and literature review

A 58-year-old female patient with a complex medical history, including anxiety, arthritis, asthma, depression, hypertension, prior anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), prior lumbar fusion at L5/S1, and thromboangiitis obliterans presented with debilitating pain in her bilateral feet, right leg, and right lower back. She underwent a posterior lumbar interbody fusion in 2008 for chronic L5 radicular pain, which did not relieve her symptoms. Despite negative findings on cervical and thoracic MRI scans, the patient continued to experience severe pain which was unresponsive to NSAIDs, oral steroids, muscle relaxants, neuropathic pain medications, and opioids.

After an extensive workup, the patient was diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans, a condition resulting from a long-standing smoking history, causing inflammation and thrombosis in the small vessels of the hands and feet, leading to ischemic limb pain. In 2022, the patient underwent a spinal cord stimulation (SCS) procedure, initially experiencing good results.

The patient presented with worsening bilateral feet, right leg, and right lower back with reduced benefit from SCS over time. The pain was worse in the morning and was aggravated by standing, changing positions, and lying down. A monopolar review using a combination of electrodes and polarities was performed. Successful stimulation was achieved, providing coverage to the bilateral legs, back, and feet. The patient reported complete pain coverage, endorsing 100 ​% relief with reprogramming.

This case highlights the potential benefits of spinal cord stimulation in managing vascular disease resulting in limb ischemia. Despite unsuccessful prior interventions, the patient achieved significant pain relief through SCS. The ability to adjust the device settings and stimulation parameters allowed for optimal pain management and long-term improved quality of life.

The symptoms of arteriosclerotic occlusive arterial disease include intermittent claudication, ischemic pain and ulceration/gangrene as the disease progresses. For patients in advanced stage (stage IV according to Fontaine) often there is no available reconstructive indications, and there are limited options to avoid limb amputation. Neuromodulation with SCS has been proposed as a therapeutic option in these patients to treat ischemic pain, and it has been shown to increase perfusion to the limb.

### Proper evaluation and management of acute embolic versus thrombotic limb ischemia [^116bUC9m]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia is one of the most potentially devastating but treatable diseases faced by the vascular surgeon. It is crucial to identify the ischemic process early, as the outcomes of early intervention can lead to limb salvage, whereas late recognition places the patient at risk for limb loss and potential mortality. This article emphasizes the importance of properly evaluating the acutely ischemic extremity to ascertain whether the etiology is embolic or thrombotic. Appropriate treatment and management of the limb are determined by the underlying cause of the ischemia. The authors will review the clinical features, angiographic findings, and strategies for management for these similar but distinct etiologies: acute embolic versus thrombotic limb ischemia.

Effect of Smoking Cessation

In order to assess the effect of smoking cessation on the occurrence of amputation, patients who stopped their tobacco consumption at 1 year of follow‐up were considered as ex‐smokers, and patients who did not stop their consumption or who declared resuming smoking during follow‐up or at the amputation were considered as smokers. The next 4‐year amputation‐free survival rate was analyzed. Patients who stopped their tobacco consumption had a lower risk of amputation than those who continued (P = 0.001) (Figure 3 A). At the first amputation, among 48 patients, 5 (10.4%) were ex‐smokers and 43 (89.6%) were current smokers. At next amputation, among 34 patients, 8 (23.5%) were ex‐smokers and 26 (76%) were current smokers (Figure 3 B). Smoking age at onset and amount of tobacco exposure at diagnosis were not associated with amputation rate.

### Long-term outcome of therapeutic neovascularization using peripheral blood mononuclear cells for limb ischemia [^113ojTUt]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells has been reported to promote neovascularization of ischemic tissues effectively. We found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells were as efficient as bone marrow mononuclear cells for the treatment of limb ischemia in animals and showed that this treatment was feasible and safe in no-option patients with limb ischemia. However, the long-term outcome of such therapy has not been investigated.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed the data for 42 patients who were treated between July 2002 and December 2005 by using the log-rank test, the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model. Improvement of ischemic symptoms was observed in 60% to 70% of the patients. The annual rate of major amputation was decreased markedly by treatment. Improvement of ischemic symptoms was less marked in arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) patients on dialysis compared with nonhemodialysis ASO or thromboangiitis obliterans patients. Indeed, the survival rate of these patients was lower than that of nonhemodialysis ASO or thromboangiitis obliterans patients. Major adverse events such as death, major amputation, and cardiovascular events occurred mostly in ASO patients, and most of them were on dialysis. There was no significant difference in the cardiovascular event-free rate between responders and nonresponders. The survival rate of younger responders was better than that of nonresponders.

Conclusions

Although this study was not placebo-controlled and these initial results were from a retrospective analysis, injection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells might be safe and potentially effective for the treatment of limb ischemia, but caution is needed when managing ASO patients on dialysis.

Postthrombotic syndrome is a common sequelae resulting from deep venous thrombosis. The primary interventions are prevention and treatment, both of which many vascular specialists may not always recognize. We review the definition, epidemiology, the basic pathophysiology, and preventative management for postthrombotic syndrome. The current primary medical and interventional treatment modalities to decrease the occurrence of postthrombotic syndrome are also highlighted. Many of these treatments are currently available and simply need to be adhered to, whereas others are a shift in the paradigm, focusing on active thrombus removal.

### The effect of smoking cessation on the technical success of endovascular treatment for thromboangiitis obliterans [^114UrQBR]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To show that smoking cessation improves the technical success of lower extremity endovascular treatment in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger disease.

Materials and Methods

One hundred two patients with TAO who underwent endovascular treatment for chronic limb-threatening ischemia or severe claudication of lower extremities in a tertiary hospital between 2015 and 2022 were included in this retrospective study. Data on serum cotinine levels were available for the last 45 patients, and 38 patients constituted the study population. Per the institution's protocol, patients were instructed to quit smoking 15 days before the intervention. However, cotinine levels showed that some of the patients continued smoking. Technical and recanalization successes were assessed as the primary end points. The secondary end point was the improvement in Rutherford scores at the 1-month follow-up. The McNemar test was used to compare the proportion of recanalized arteries after the intervention.

Results

Thirty-seven men and 1 woman (mean age, 42.9 years ± 10.1) were evaluated. The overall technical success rate was 86.8% in the study group. The technical success rate was significantly higher in the nonsmoker group (n = 24 [96%]) than in the smoker group (n = 8 [61.5%]; p = 0.006). One-month clinical data were available for 100% of the patients. The Rutherford category of the nonsmoker group was significantly lower at the 1-month follow-up. In addition, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed lower Rutherford scores after the intervention in the nonsmoker group. The adverse event rate was 8%. One (2.7%) patient in the smoker group underwent a minor amputation.

Conclusions

Cessation of smoking before endovascular therapy improved technical success and recanalization rates in patients with TAO.

1.4. Scope of Guideline

Lower extremity PAD is a common cardiovascular disease that is estimated to affect approximately 8.5 million Americans above the age of 40 years and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and QoL impairment. It has been estimated that 202 million people worldwide have PAD. The purpose of this document is to provide a contemporary guideline for diagnosis and management of patients with lower extremity PAD. This document supersedes recommendations related to lower extremity PAD in the "ACC/AHA 2005 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease"and the "2011 ACCF/AHA Focused Update of the Guideline for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease". The scope of this guideline is limited to atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremity arteries (PAD) and includes disease of the aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal arterial segments. It does not address nonatherosclerotic causes of lower extremity arterial disease, such as vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, physiological entrapment syndromes, cystic adventitial disease, and other entities. Future guidelines will address aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta and lower extremity arteries and diseases of the renal and mesenteric arteries.

In developing the "2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease", the writing committee reviewed the evidence to support recommendations in the relevant ACC/AHA guidelines noted in Table 2 and affirms the ongoing validity of the related recommendations, thus obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations in the current guideline. Table 2 also contains a list of other statements that may be of interest to the reader. Table 3 includes definitions for PAD key terms used throughout the guideline.

Global vascular guidelines — sample and effect size considerations for CLTI randomized controlled trials (RCTs) warn about optimistic effect estimates and ethical design. CLTI patients in the "nonactive treatment" placebo group often have better-than-expected outcomes compared with similar patients treated outside research, making it harder to show differences in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. As a result, researchers must avoid basing power calculations on an unrealistically large effect size; it is widely agreed it is poor science and unethical to embark on a trial with no realistic prospect of answering the question, and an overpowered trial is also undesirable because it misuses resources and may disadvantage patients by continuing treatment of little or no value or even potentially harmful.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis. (5.1)
Tissue ischemia and necrosis: do not inject intra-arterially. (5.2)
Venous Thrombosis. (5.3)

5.1	Anaphylaxis

Severe allergic reactions have been reported following administration of liquid polidocanol, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Observe patients for at least 10 minutes following injection and be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.

5.2	Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis

Intra-arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene Patients with underlying arterial disease, such as marked peripheral arteriosclerosis or thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease) may be at increased risk for tissue ischemia. If intra-arterial injection of polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately.

5.3 Venous Thrombosis

VARITHENA can cause venous thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Follow administration instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospitalization, or pregnancy are at increased risk for developing thrombosis.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — role and design in CLTI — are described as the optimal means of providing critical confirmatory evidence before widespread adoption of novel interventions; the paucity of such studies in CLTI underscores challenges to completing trials on time and budget, and pragmatic trial design features offer greater flexibility for specific treatment decisions and can yield more universally applicable results, particularly in time‑intensive studies during changing treatment paradigms.

### Appropriateness of care: deep venous procedures [^114pNNvA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In the past decade, technologies to treat venous pathologies have increased dramatically, to the benefit of an often underserved and overlooked population of patients with venous disease. However, given the rapid release of various technologies, including venous-dedicated stents and thrombectomy devices across varied venous pathologies, evidence-based guidelines have been slow to develop. When discussing appropriateness of care, one needs to consider optimal patient selection, technical approach, medical management, and surveillance protocols, to name a few. All of which, in the venous space, are currently widely varied in practice. The future of deep venous work is limitless, but multicenter, randomized controlled trials are needed to optimally treat patients with venous disease.

Postoperative care

Effective postoperative management is a critical component of care for patients who have undergone venous stenting. Follow-up visits typically involve clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and patient-reported outcome measures. Generally, the first follow-up is recommended within the first month after the procedure, followed by subsequent visits at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. These time frames facilitate the early identification of any immediate postoperative issues and the monitoring of stent patency over time.

Oral anticoagulation is generally recommended for patients after stent implantation to prevent in-stent stenosis or stent occlusion. The choice of agent and the duration of therapy should be individualized. Treatment may range from short term (3–6 months for NIVLs)to long term, depending on the patient's risk factors, the complexity of the reconstruction, and the presence of any stent-related issues. It is essential to strike a balance between the prevention of complications and the risk of bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy. The role of antiplatelet therapy is less certain; in our practice, we typically opt for monotherapy, considering the lack of evidence for dual antiplatelet therapy and the heightened bleeding risk. Close collaboration with a hematologist is recommended to tailor antithrombotic treatment strategies on an individual basis.

In conjunction with pharmacotherapy, mechanical adjunctive measures such as intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used perioperatively and afterwards to decrease thrombotic risks. Intermittent pneumatic compression increases venous peak velocity, time-averaged maximum velocity, and volume flowand enables emptying deep veins of the lower limb and preventing stasis.

### Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis: a practical guide to diagnosis and management [^1111EG8x]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous vasculitis may be a cutaneous manifestation of systemic vasculitis, a skin-limited variant of systemic vasculitis, or a type of single-organ vasculitis limited to the skin. Careful evaluation is necessary to distinguish these possibilities, differentiate skin-limited from systemic disease, and identify important underlying conditions, if present. Appropriate management depends on disease type and severity. In the case of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (CSVV), treatment is primarily based on case reports and expert opinion, using a range of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies. This manuscript presents a systematic and stepwise approach to the evaluation of patients presenting with cutaneous vasculitis, as well as the management of those diagnosed with CSVV, using best available evidence. Studies relevant to the classification, evaluation, and management of skin vasculitis are ongoing.

### Management… [^114HDEGQ]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Management Most patients with GBS recover spontaneously. However, because of the unpredictable course and potential for death or significant disability, all patients with the disease should be hospitalized for multidisciplinary supportive care and disease-modifying therapy.
22. SUPPORTIVE CARE Consensus guidelines recommend subcutaneous anticoagulation and graduated compression stockings for patients who are hospitalized to decrease the risk of venous thrombosis. DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPY Specific treatments to hasten recovery and/or ameliorate symptoms target the aberrant immune response in GBS. Removing circulating immune complexes via plasma exchange has been shown to improve the time to recover the ability to walk, the need for artificial ventilation, the duration of ventilation, and measured muscle strength after one year compared with placebo.

30, 31 According to new evidence-based guidelines, plasma exchange is effective and should be used for severe AIDP, and is probably effective and should be considered for mild AIDP. 32 Optimal response is achieved when plasma exchange is performed within seven days of symptom onset, although there is benefit up to 30 days after symptom onset. 30–33 Some evidence suggests that patients with mild GBS benefit from two sessions of plasma exchange, whereas patients with moderate to severe disease appear to require four sessions. 33 The role of plasma exchange in children has not been established. 34, 35 Intravenous immune globulin therapy is easier to manage than plasma exchange and has significantly fewer complications. 31 The initial response does not necessarily predict the outcome because patients may stabilize or continue to decline after the therapy.

Intravenous immune globulin therapy should be started within two weeks of symptom onset, and should be considered for patients who are nonambulatory. The therapy may have a role two to four weeks after symptom onset as well, but the evidence of effectiveness is weaker.
31. The few studies of plasma exchange followed by intravenous immune globulin therapy have not shown benefit over monotherapy. Therefore, sequential therapy is not recommended. 31 Corticosteroids are not recommended for the treatment of GBS. Prognosis Even with treatment, about 3 percent of patients with GBS die. The median hospital stay is seven days, and up to 25 percent of patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The prognosis is worse in older patients, those with severe symptoms, and those with rapid onset of symptoms. Neurologic problems persist in up to 20 percent of patients, one-half of whom are severely disabled.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Initial Management of VTE TREATMENT SETTING Treating VTE at home often produces better outcomes than treating in the hospital. In patients with uncomplicated DVT, treating at home reduces the likelihood of PE development. The risk of a subsequent DVT is also less. Mortality and bleeding rates with DVT are similar between treatment settings. For patients with clinically stable PE, home treatment produces outcomes similar to those with hospital treatment. THROMBOLYSIS In the absence of threat to the limb or high risk of severe postthrombotic syndrome, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended for DVT. Up to one-half of patients with proximal DVT develop postthrombotic syndrome, although only 10% will experience severe symptoms.

Thrombolysis reduces postthrombotic syndrome but increases major bleeding, with similar mortality and subsequent VTE risks. In patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise demonstrated by systolic blood pressure reduction of at least 40 mm Hg from baseline or systolic blood pressure measurement below 90 mm Hg, the guideline strongly recommends thrombolytic therapy to reduce mortality despite a significant risk of major bleeding that includes intracranial bleeding. In PE with right ventricular dysfunction but no hemodynamic compromise, also called submassive PE, the decision is complicated by poor evidence quality. Mortality may slightly improve after thrombolysis, and catheter-directed thrombolysis may be better than systemic thrombolysis, but evidence is insufficient to recommend these treatments and anticoagulation alone is suggested.

Primary VTE Treatment Treatment of initial VTE is most effective for three to six months. Although longer treatment reduces the likelihood of recurrence, this benefit may be offset by increases in bleeding and mortality. After primary treatment, secondary VTE prevention is recommended for patients with a chronic persistent risk factor without a high risk of bleeding complications. There are separate recommendations for patients with cancer. Recommendations from these groups differ somewhat. The ACCP recommends three months of primary treatment for VTE, whereas the American Society of Hematology recommends between three and six months.
