## Question

What should be included in the initial workup for acute kidney injury?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what should be included in the initial workup for suspected acute kidney injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis with standardized criteria and staging. Then, I should verify the immediate bedside assessment to set pretest probabilities. Next, I will review core laboratory tests and how to trend them. After that, I will check when and why to obtain renal imaging. Then I need to systematically sort prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes and review medications. I will then assess risk stratification and prevention, including contrast exposure. Next, I should set monitoring and follow-up cadence. Finally, I will consider when advanced diagnostics, nephrology consultation, or renal replacement therapy come into play, making sure each step is anchored to high-credibility guidelines and that I am not overusing low-yield tests [^112LuMYS] [^117G2kG1] [^112Xhksn].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis using standardized criteria so I do not misclassify chronic kidney disease flare-ups as AKI. By KDIGO 2012, AKI is present with an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline (known or presumed within the prior 7 days), or urine output 0.5 mL/kg/h or less for 6 hours, and severity is staged 1–3 by the magnitude of these changes; I should double-check the baseline, and when outpatient values are unknown, ERBP endorses using the first documented creatinine of the episode as the reference, and to calculate oliguria with ideal rather than actual body weight to avoid error inflation [^112LuMYS] [^112714HR] [^114piCBk] [^116QKB7G] [^112Xhksn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without context. I need to check the bedside history and exam immediately to refine the differential: recent hypotension, sepsis, surgery, contrast, rhabdomyolysis, and nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, and RAAS blockers; then I will examine for intravascular volume status, edema, jugular venous pressure, rashes, purpura, or arthritis that could signal glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, because identifying reversible contributors early can change trajectory and urgency of testing [^1164LfZV] [^113oGj6J] [^111NmB7g].

> Next, I should review core laboratory investigations and their cadence. Wait, let me verify the timing: UKKA recommends repeat creatinine at about 12 and 24 hours after the index value if baseline is uncertain, then as dictated by clinical course; urinalysis with dipstick for blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrites, and glucose should be obtained in all suspected AKI to direct evaluation toward interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis when abnormal; I also need to monitor electrolytes, bicarbonate, and BUN to detect life-threatening hyperkalemia or acidosis and obtain a complete blood count for infection or anemia, while remembering that fractional excretion indices are limited with diuretics and CKD and that many discretionary tests have low diagnostic yield in practice [^113zXqz7] [^111uSGTg] [^114nqdGk] [^113Pcibv].

> I will now examine the need for imaging, because missing obstruction is a common pitfall. Let me first confirm the timing: UKKA advises a renal tract ultrasound in all AKI cases within 24 hours unless the cause is clear and the AKI is rapidly improving, and to expedite within about 6 hours if obstruction or pyonephrosis is suspected based on anuria, flank pain, or known stones; ultrasound also helps with kidney size and echogenicity to infer chronicity, which I should cross-check against the clinical timeline [^117G2kG1].

> But wait, what if the etiology remains murky after initial data? I should structure the differential into prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal categories and explicitly document suspected causes; I need to withhold nephrotoxins and adjust doses for reduced clearance, and if the trend is progressive with hematuria and proteinuria on dipstick without UTI or catheter trauma, I should suspect rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and escalate urgently, because timing affects kidney survival [^1164LfZV] [^115i7BJs] [^116ZuCbu] [^1142Q2NB] [^112PEUde].

> I need to ensure risk stratification and prevention are integrated into the plan, especially around contrast. Hold on, I should verify pre-procedure steps: screen for preexisting kidney impairment and obtain a baseline creatinine before iodinated contrast, then in high-risk patients recheck creatinine 12–72 hours after exposure, and in outpatients at risk after a new exposure, measure creatinine at least 48 hours after the risk window; meanwhile, I should use isotonic crystalloids for volume expansion when appropriate and avoid ineffective preventive therapies such as low-dose dopamine or diuretics for AKI prevention [^113nGy3C] [^113JchVg] [^114c4sGP] [^1148PT1T] [^115se755] [^115eENvs].

> Let me reconsider the monitoring strategy so I do not miss inflection points. I should confirm that serial creatinine and urine output are tracked and that frequency matches AKI stage and clinical course; I also need to plan longitudinal follow-up because AKI transitions to CKD are common, so evaluating at around 2–3 months to document recovery or new CKD is recommended, while avoiding any assumption of chronicity from a single eGFR or albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and when restarting prior culprit drugs, I should check creatinine and potassium 1–2 weeks after reinitiation or dose titration [^111C45S2] [^114nqdGk] [^112SzyRY] [^11462BoV] [^112VYdpK].

> I should double-check when to escalate diagnostics and consult nephrology. If the etiology remains unclear, AKI is severe or nonresolving, or renal replacement therapy is anticipated, early nephrology involvement is sensible; novel tubular injury biomarkers can sometimes support early detection and prognostication but are not mandated for routine care by major guidelines, and decisions to initiate RRT should prioritize the broader clinical context and correctable indications over BUN/creatinine thresholds, while remembering that integrating information from both creatinine and urine output can refine severity assessment and risk [^115jUdPN] [^112VAtge] [^1168NhPD] [^116MYxzV].

> Summary flow, making sure I have not skipped a critical step: confirm AKI with KDIGO criteria and appropriate baseline assignment; immediately contextualize with history and exam to set pretest probabilities; obtain core labs and trend creatinine at 12 and 24 hours if baseline is uncertain while acting on dangerous electrolyte and acid-base derangements; perform renal ultrasound within 24 hours for most AKI and faster if obstruction is suspected; systematically determine prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes with a documented medication review, withholding nephrotoxins and adjusting doses; risk-stratify around contrast and avoid ineffective preventive drugs while ensuring appropriate fluids; set inpatient monitoring and outpatient follow-up at 2–3 months, including targeted labs after restarting agents; and escalate to biomarkers, biopsy, nephrology, or RRT based on severity, uncertainty, or nonrecovery, verifying each decision against guideline anchors to avoid both delays and overtesting [^112LuMYS] [^117G2kG1] [^1164LfZV] [^112Xhksn] [^112SzyRY].

---

The initial workup for AKI should be **prompt and structured** to confirm the diagnosis, stage severity, and identify reversible causes [^115WnXbc]. Apply **KDIGO criteria** (serum creatinine rise ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, ≥ 1.5× baseline within 7 days, or urine output ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours) [^112LuMYS]. Obtain a **focused history** (comorbidities, nephrotoxins, recent procedures), assess volume status, and perform a targeted examination [^1174XRkG]. Order serum creatinine, BUN, electrolytes, CBC, and urinalysis with microscopy [^111uSGTg]; calculate FeNa/FeUrea if oliguria is present [^117E4SRg].

Perform **renal ultrasound within 24 hours** to exclude obstruction [^117G2kG1]. Monitor serum creatinine and urine output closely; avoid nephrotoxins and correct electrolyte or acid-base disturbances [^116ZuCbu]. Early, structured evaluation enables timely intervention and improves outcomes [^115WnXbc].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A **focused history and physical examination** are essential to identify risk factors, comorbidities, and reversible causes of AKI [^1174XRkG] [^117VwbxC]. Key elements include:

- **Comorbidities**: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, malignancy.

- **Recent exposures**: Nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aminoglycosides, contrast media), recent surgeries, infections, hypotensive episodes, trauma [^111NmB7g].

- **Symptoms**: Oliguria/anuria, hematuria, edema, flank pain, systemic symptoms (fever, rash, arthralgia).

- **Physical examination**: Volume status (hypovolemia, hypervolemia), blood pressure, signs of systemic illness (rash, joint swelling), bladder distension [^113cjKzL].

---

## Laboratory investigations

Laboratory testing is critical to confirm **AKI**, stage severity, and identify underlying causes [^112DGnHD]:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Serum creatinine | Confirm AKI diagnosis, stage severity [^112LuMYS] |
| Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) | Assess renal function, differentiate prerenal vs intrinsic AKI [^1174XRkG] |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) | Identify electrolyte disturbances, acid-base disorders [^1174XRkG] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detect anemia, infection, systemic inflammation [^111NmB7g] |
| Urinalysis with microscopy | Identify hematuria, proteinuria, casts, infection [^111uSGTg] |
| Fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) | Differentiate prerenal (< 1%) vs intrinsic (> 2%) AKI [^117E4SRg] |
| Fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) | Useful if diuretics used (prerenal < 35%) [^117E4SRg] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to exclude obstruction and assess renal structure; **renal ultrasound is the first-line modality** to evaluate for obstruction, hydronephrosis, renal size, and echogenicity [^117G2kG1]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or renal stones are suspected, obtain a non-contrast CT [^111NmB7g]; use Doppler ultrasound to assess renal blood flow when vascular causes are suspected [^116MgyqL].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring of **renal function** and urine output is essential; track serum creatinine and urine output regularly to detect progression or recovery [^114nqdGk] [^114JmpxD]. Monitor electrolytes and acid-base status, correct abnormalities promptly, and adjust drug dosing based on changes in renal function [^112BFJec] [^1142Q2NB].

---

## Indications for nephrology consultation

Consult **nephrology** in the following scenarios [^115jUdPN]:

- **Unclear etiology**: AKI without obvious cause or persistent AKI despite initial management [^1164LfZV].

- **Severe AKI**: Rapidly progressive AKI, suspected glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or systemic disease [^112PEUde].

- **Dialysis indications**: Refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, volume overload, uremic symptoms [^1168NhPD].

---

## Initial management principles

Initial management focuses on stabilizing the patient, preventing further **kidney injury**, and addressing reversible causes:

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Optimize volume status, blood pressure, and cardiac output [^115se755].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Discontinue or adjust nephrotoxic medications [^116ZuCbu].

- **Treat underlying causes**: Manage infections, obstruction, or systemic diseases [^117VwbxC].

- **Supportive care**: Correct electrolyte disturbances, acid-base disorders, and provide nutritional support [^1174XRkG].

---

The initial workup for AKI requires a **structured approach** — clinical assessment, laboratory testing, imaging, and monitoring. Early identification and management of **reversible causes** are critical to prevent progression and improve outcomes [^115WnXbc] [^1124N7BV].

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^111rWcXj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of acute kidney injury, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and the performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on acute kidney injury diagnosis or management should be a priority in acute kidney injury research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in acute kidney injury have been largely unsuccessful.

### Ascertainment and epidemiology of acute kidney injury varies with definition interpretation [^115YPi6Y]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Differences in defining acute kidney injury (AKI) may impact incidence ascertainment. We assessed the effects of different AKI definition interpretation methods on epidemiology ascertainment.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: Two groups were studied at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas: 150 critically ill children (prospective) and 254 noncritically ill, hospitalized children receiving aminoglycosides (retrospective). Serum creatinine (SCr) was collected for 14 days in the prospective study and 21 days in the retrospective study. Children with known baseline serum creatinine (bSCr) were classified by the pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Kidney Disease (pRIFLE) AKI definition using SCr change (pRIFLE(DeltaSCr)), estimated creatinine clearance (eCCl) change (pRIFLE(DeltaCCl)), and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition. In subjects without known bSCr, bSCR was estimated as eCCl = 100 (eCCl(100)) and 120 ml/min per 1.73 m² (eCCl(120)), admission SCr (AdmSCr) and lower/upper normative values (NormsMin, NormsMax). The differential impact of each AKI definition interpretation on incidence estimation and severity distribution was evaluated.

- **Results**: pRIFLE(DeltaSCr) and AKIN led to identical AKI distributions. pRIFLE(DeltaCCl) resulted in 14.5% (critically ill) and 11% (noncritical) more patients diagnosed with AKI compared to other methods (P < 0.05). Different bSCr estimates led to differences in AKI incidence, from 12% (AdmSCr) to 87.8% (NormsMin) (P < 0.05) in the critically ill group and from 4.6% (eCCl(100)) to 43.1% (NormsMin).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^11462BoV]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning initial evaluation (assessment of chronicity), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend not assuming chronicity based on a single abnormal level for eGFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as the finding could result from a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease.

### Conceptual advances and evolving terminology in acute kidney disease [^111FpwsK]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, and biomarkers have modified our understanding of acute kidney dysfunction and damage, and their association with subsequent chronic kidney disease. The concept of acute kidney injury (AKI), which has relied on established but nonetheless flawed biomarkers of solute clearance (serum creatinine levels and urinary output), has been challenged by the identification of novel biomarkers of tubular stress and/or damage. The expression of some of these novel biomarkers precedes changes in conventional biomarkers or can increase their predictive power, and might therefore enhance the clinical accuracy of the definition of AKI. In addition, the need to consider AKI recurrence, duration, and progression to chronic kidney disease within the clinical and epidemiological framework of AKI led to the emergence of the concept of acute kidney disease. New definitions of acute syndromes of kidney impairment and injury are needed.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112714HR]. Nephron. Clinical Practice (2012). High credibility.

The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury include a clinical tool known as the "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury", designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). This tool plays a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria focus on changes in serum creatinine and urine output. The criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to at least 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less for 6 hours.

The outcome is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of these conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool evaluates whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury by assessing three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

### Timing of initiation and discontinuation of renal replacement therapy in AKI: Unanswered key questions [^111shZB1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) often require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Currently, there is wide variation worldwide on the indications for and timing of initiation and discontinuation of RRT for AKI. Various parameters for metabolic, solute, and fluid control are generally used to guide the initiation and discontinuation of therapy; however, there are currently no standards in this field. Members of the recently established Acute Kidney Injury Network, representing key societies in critical care and nephrology, along with additional experts in adult and pediatric AKI, participated in a three-day conference in Vancouver in September 2006 to evaluate the available literature on this topic and draft consensus recommendations for research studies in this area. Key questions included the following: what are the indications for RRT, when should acute RRT support be initiated, and when should RRT be stopped? This report summarizes the available evidence and describes in detail the key questions, as well as some of the methods of answering them that will need to be addressed with the goal of standardizing the care of patients with AKI and improving outcomes.

This article is an evidence-based overview of acute kidney injuries in patients seen in the emergency department setting. It outlines the definition of acute kidney injuries and the most common causes of these injuries. Furthermore, it details clinical evaluations important to appreciate and intervene on, such as volume overload, hypertension, life-threatening electrolyte derangements, and the threshold for urgent dialysis. Finally, the article describes special populations that are at higher risk for acute kidney injuries and acute conditions, such as rhabdomyolysis, and discusses the controversy of contrast-induced acute kidney injuries in patients seen in the emergency department.

### The RIFLE and AKIN classifications for acute kidney injury: a critical and comprehensive review [^111m84zK]. Clinical Kidney Journal (2013). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "AKIN diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" is a diagnostic and severity grading system used for patients with suspected acute kidney injury (AKI). This classification is applicable to all patient populations, including those in the intensive care unit, hospitalized patients, and outpatients. It is used to identify and stratify the severity of AKI based on changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output, which aids clinicians in determining appropriate treatment strategies and predicting patient outcomes.

However, the AKIN classification is not suitable for patients with chronic kidney disease or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction, as the changes in serum creatinine levels or urine output may not accurately reflect the acute changes in kidney function in these patients.

- **Diagnostic criteria for AKI**: The AKIN diagnostic criteria tool evaluates the severity of AKI by assessing changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output. Users can select one diagnostic criterion from a list, each reflecting different clinical measures. These criteria include:
	- Serum creatinine increase of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.4 mcmol/L) or 1.5 to 2 times the baseline, with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour lasting over 6 hours.
	- Serum creatinine increase of more than 2 to 3 times from baseline, combined with urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hour over a 12-hour period.

### Evaluation and initial management of acute kidney injury [^116zoaEu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation and initial management of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should include an assessment of the contributing causes of the kidney injury, an assessment of the clinical course including comorbidities, a careful assessment of volume status, and the institution of appropriate therapeutic measures designed to reverse or prevent the worsening of functional or structural kidney abnormalities.

The initial assessment of patients with AKI classically includes the differentiation between prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The differentiation between so-called "prerenal" and "renal" causes is more difficult, especially because renal hypoperfusion may coexist with any stage of AKI.

Using a modified Delphi approach, the multidisciplinary international working group generated a set of testable research questions. Key questions included the following: Is there a difference in prognosis between volume-responsive and volume-unresponsive AKI? Are there biomarkers whose patterns (dynamic changes) predict the severity and recovery of AKI (maximal stage of AKI, need for RRT, renal recovery, mortality) and guide therapy? What is the best biomarker to assess prospectively whether AKI is volume responsive? What is the best biomarker to assess the optimal volume status in AKI patients?

In evaluating the literature and ongoing studies, it was thought that the answers to the questions posed herein would improve the understanding of AKI and ultimately patient outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^114JmpxD]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, specifically in relation to renal function monitoring, the UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining regular urea and electrolyte monitoring in adult patients with newly diagnosed AKI managed in the community. This monitoring should continue until renal function has returned to baseline or has stabilized, to detect AKI or recurrent AKI in a timely fashion.

### A European renal best practice (ERBP) position statement on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines on acute kidney injury: part 1: definitions, conservative management and contrast-induced nephropathy [^116QKB7G]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

In the past, a myriad of definitions for acute renal failure and AKI existed in parallel, making comparison of results difficult. In the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI, the definition and staging of AKI are based on a combination of the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Both criteria rely on GFR and its proxy, serum creatinine, and urinary output as the most useful overall indices of acute changes in kidney function. Changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output are used as surrogates for acute changes in kidney function.

The recommended diagnostic criteria establish a solid ground for standardized AKI assessment and classification in everyday clinical practice as well as in research conditions. As such, ERBP considers them a good starting point towards a more standardized approach to AKI definition, particularly for assessing the predictive power of AKI with respect to overall and renal outcomes (staging of severity). However, ERBP wants to update and fine-tune the classification by specifically underscoring and more extensively clarifying:

- **The need to use the first available serum creatinine**: Use the admission serum creatinine during the episode as the baseline creatinine.
- **Expressing urinary volume**: Urinary volume should be expressed using ideal body weight rather than real body weight when calculating urinary output in mL/min/kg.

ERBP also felt it was necessary to explicitly state that both criteria should be applied to classify patients.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^116mswah]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

The UKKA 2019 guidelines on therapeutic procedures for acute kidney injury, particularly regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT) indications, recommend deferring the initiation of RRT if the underlying clinical condition is improving, there are early signs of renal recovery, and the metabolic and fluid demands of the patient are being met.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^117E4SRg]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by an abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. Diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. A physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction.

Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia, volume overload, intractable acidosis, uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, pleuritis, and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors, such as older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, and liver failure, is important.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to evaluation for etiology, ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend determining the cause of AKI whenever possible. Assess the presence of hypovolemia, post-renal causes, low cardiac output, use of nephrotoxic agents, acute glomerulonephritis, and renal microangiopathy as underlying contributors to AKI.

### Clinical practice guideline acute kidney injury [^113zXqz7]. UKKA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to renal function monitoring, patients at risk for AKI, the UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend confirming the presence of an active episode of AKI occurring in secondary care. This should be based on frequent serum creatinine testing, such as at 12 and 24 hours after the index value, when the true, reference serum creatinine is uncertain.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for acute kidney injury, particularly in relation to renal function monitoring for patients at risk for AKI, the ERBP 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining serial measurements of serum creatinine and urine output. The frequency and duration of these measurements should be based on the patient's risk and clinical course to detect AKI at an early stage in patients at increased risk for AKI.

### Clinical applications of biomarkers for acute kidney injury [^1129pq6k]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Research into novel therapies for acute kidney injury (AKI) has been hampered by reliance on a diagnosis predicated on changes in serum creatinine level. As a marker for changing kidney function rather than frank kidney injury, creatinine level lacks sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AKI and shows significant lag time before increasing after injury. It has been unclear whether the failure to translate promising results from animal studies in AKI into successful human trials has been caused by lack of therapeutic efficacy or inappropriately delayed application of the intervention. Multiple novel biomarkers with the potential to revolutionize the timing and accuracy of the diagnosis of AKI are currently under investigation.

We have chosen to use one of these biomarkers, interleukin 18 (IL-18), to show the ways in which biomarkers at present can supplement the conventional management of AKI. IL-18 is well suited for this analysis because it is both a mediator of and marker for AKI. We describe two cases in which reliance on serum creatinine level for the diagnosis of AKI led to diagnostic and management uncertainty.

In the context of these cases, we discuss how IL-18 and other biomarkers can facilitate earlier detection, enhance the differential diagnosis, and allow more prescient prognosis. Additionally, we describe the potential role for biomarkers in prospective trial design and discuss the utility of biomarkers in facilitating adequate powering of trials through more accurate characterization of cases and controls.

### The pressing need for real-time risk assessment of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury [^1146BEaB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is associated with both short- and long-term outcomes that reflect the severity of the injury. Recent studies have suggested that an 'early' initiation of renal replacement therapy may alter the course of AKI and improve short-term outcomes like inpatient mortality. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition of AKI has been criticized for misclassification bias, lack of sensitivity, and the static manner in which AKI stages are defined. This editorial reviews various approaches to improving the specificity and sensitivity of the KDIGO AKI criteria and concludes that a staging system based on creatinine trajectories would be better suited for developing a prognostic index for real-time, dynamic risk assessment compared to the KDIGO staging criteria.

### Covid-19-associated acute kidney injury: Consensus report of the 25th acute disease quality initiative (ADQI) workgroup [^114VSn9m]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Epidemiology and diagnosis**: The rates of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) can vary significantly between studies. Diagnosing AKI in the context of COVID-19 involves considering multiple factors such as the timing of AKI relative to symptom onset, hospitalization, confirmation of infection, disease severity, and level of care.

- **Recommendations**: It is recommended to characterize the timing of AKI for appropriate clinical management. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) consensus definition should be utilized for diagnosing AKI, involving measurements of serum creatinine (SCr) levels and urine output (evidence level: 1A). It is also suggested to use kidney-specific tests along with kidney function measures to better understand the clinical presentations and outcomes of AKI (evidence level: 2B).

- **Rationale**: The variation in reported AKI rates is particularly noted between countries, with higher rates observed outside China. COVID-19 patients may develop AKI during hospitalization, with a higher incidence among those admitted to the ICU compared to those managed in general hospital wards. A significant gap exists in the literature, as many reports fail to provide definitions, staging of AKI, details on renal recovery, or follow-up data. There is also little discussion of the distinction between de novo AKI and AKI occurring on pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, differences in national and regional healthcare systems, hospitalization policies, and decisions regarding levels of care such as ICU admissions contribute to the complexity of comparing AKI rates across studies.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^116MgyqL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and is associated with grim short- and long-term outcomes. Although the vast majority of AKI cases are multifactorial, with sepsis, shock, and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are also not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit the worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately reduce renal and systemic consequences of AKI.

The ability to recognize conditions associated with specific aetiologies, and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological, and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, knowledge, and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up, along with their limitations.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: Diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^115G3zHo]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Diagnostic criteria**: Common definitions of AKI rely on changes in serum creatinine and absolute urine output to provide an easy-to-interpret, objective, and validated approach useful for epidemiologic studies; however, each component of common AKI metrics has limitations. Notably, urine output is significantly influenced by hypovolemia and diuretics, decreasing specificity, while serum creatinine only begins to increase after 50% of functional nephrons are lost. These changes may not manifest for 48 to 72 hours after injury, leading to low sensitivity in previously healthy kidneys.

Furthermore, serum creatinine can be impacted by nonrenal factors, including age, muscle mass, nutritional status, liver function, and gastrointestinal elimination, further limiting diagnostic accuracy. Not all patients have a recorded baseline serum creatinine. Despite these limitations, serum creatinine remains the standard biomarker for AKI in perioperative practice.

The KDIGO criteria, currently used to define AKI, update two previous consensus definitions: (1) Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and (2) AKI-Network (AKIN), to capture patients with smaller creatinine increases, allowing earlier disease detection.

### Cumulative application of creatinine and urine output staging optimizes the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition and identifies increased mortality risk in hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury [^116MYxzV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury is diagnosed according to creatinine and urine output criteria. Traditionally, both are applied, and a severity stage (1–3) is conferred based on the more severe of the two, while information from the other criteria is discarded. Physiologically, however, rising creatinine and oliguria represent two distinct types of renal dysfunction. We hypothesized that using information from both criteria would more accurately characterize acute kidney injury severity and outcomes.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Multicenter, international collaborative of ICUs.

- **Patients**: Three thousand four hundred twenty-nine children and young adults admitted consecutively to ICUs as part of the Assessment of the Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina and Epidemiology Study.

- **Measurements and main results**: The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes creatinine and urine output acute kidney injury criteria were applied sequentially, and the two stages were summed, generating an Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Score ranging from 1 to 6. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were time until ICU discharge and nonrecovery from acute kidney injury. Models considered associations with the AKI Score, assessing the relationship unadjusted and adjusted for covariates. Twenty-eight-day mortality and nonrecovery from acute kidney injury were modeled using logistic regression. For 28-day ICU discharge, competing risks analysis was performed. Although AKI Scores 1–3 had similar mortality to no acute kidney injury, AKI Scores 4–6 were associated with increased mortality risk and nonrecovery.

In response to the recently released 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury (AKI), the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in adult and pediatric AKI and critical care nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of US clinical practice and concerns. The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States.

The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.

### The impact of biomarkers of acute kidney injury on individual patient care [^112kmnFc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a common clinical syndrome associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there have been several advances in identifying patients at increased risk for AKI through the use of both traditional and newer functional and damage biomarkers. This article specifically focuses on the impact of biomarkers of AKI on individual patient care, emphasizing the markers with the most extensive study in patients and reported literature evidence.

Several studies have demonstrated that close monitoring of widely available biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and urine output, is strongly associated with improved patient outcomes. An integrated approach to these biomarkers, used in context with patient risk factors identifiable through electronic health record monitoring, and tests of renal reserve, may guide the implementation and targeting of care bundles to optimize patient care. Besides traditional functional markers, biochemical injury biomarkers have been increasingly utilized in clinical trials both as a measure of kidney injury and as a trigger to initiate other treatment options, such as care bundles and novel therapies.

As novel measures become globally available, the clinical implementation of hospital-based real-time biomarker measurements involves a multidisciplinary approach. This literature review discusses the data evidence supporting both the strengths and limitations of the clinical implementation of biomarkers, based on the authors' collective clinical experiences.

### Management of patients at risk of acute kidney injury [^115WnXbc]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted syndrome that occurs in different settings. The course of AKI can be variable, from a single hit and complete recovery to multiple hits resulting in end-stage renal disease. No interventions to improve outcomes of established AKI have yet been developed, so prevention and early diagnosis are key.

Awareness campaigns and education for health-care professionals on the diagnosis and management of AKI, with attention to the avoidance of volume depletion, hypotension, and nephrotoxic interventions, coupled with electronic early warning systems where available, can improve outcomes. Biomarker-based strategies have not shown improvements in outcome.

Fluid management should aim for early, rapid restoration of circulatory volume, but should be more limited after the first 24–48 hours to avoid volume overload. The use of balanced crystalloid solutions versus normal saline remains controversial. Renal replacement therapy should only be started on the basis of hard criteria but should not be delayed when criteria are met. Based on recent evidence, the risk of contrast-induced AKI might be overestimated for many conditions.

### Management of acute kidney injury: Core curriculum 2018 [^1174XRkG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous disorder that is common in hospitalized patients and associated with both short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. When AKI is present, a prompt workup of the underlying cause should be pursued, with specific attention to reversible causes. Measures to prevent AKI include optimization of volume status and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. Crystalloids are preferred over colloids for most patients, and hydroxyethyl starches should be avoided.

Volume overload in the setting of AKI is associated with adverse outcomes, so attention should be paid to overall fluid balance. Currently, there are no targeted pharmacotherapies approved for the treatment of AKI. The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients with AKI is unclear, but it is an area of active investigation. Recent studies suggest that AKI is not a "self-limited" process but is strongly linked to increased risk for chronic kidney disease, subsequent AKI, and future mortality.

### Acute kidney injury in the critically ill: An updated review on pathophysiology and management [^112cs4jN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The availability of a consensus definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) has been an important step in establishing AKI epidemiology. AKI affects 30–60% of critically ill patients and is associated with acute morbidity and mortality. Evidence is also accumulating that the burden of AKI extends beyond the acute phase, with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased risk of cardiovascular complications, episodes of AKI, and long-term mortality. Prevention of AKI development and/or progression is currently limited to hemodynamic and fluid status optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins. The search for a specific pharmacologic treatment is hampered by late diagnosis and the complex, incompletely elucidated pathophysiology.

Progress in the management of AKI is anticipated from the recognition that AKI is a very heterogeneous syndrome with variable etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation. In this narrative review, methods for early diagnosis of AKI, clinical phenotypes, pathophysiology, nephrotoxicity, optimal supportive management, as well as the importance of recovery and long-term follow-up are discussed. A discussion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is outside the scope of this review.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^113Pcibv]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The patterns, performance characteristics, and yield of diagnostic tests ordered for the evaluation of acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been rigorously evaluated.

- **Methods**: We characterized the frequency of AKI diagnostic testing for urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests in all adult inpatients who were admitted with or developed AKI (N = 4903 patients with 5731 AKI episodes) during a single calendar year. We assessed the frequency of abnormal test results overall and by AKI stage. We manually reviewed electronic medical records to evaluate the diagnostic yield of selected urine, blood, and radiology tests. The diagnostic yield of urine and blood tests was determined based on whether an abnormal test affected AKI diagnosis or management, whereas the diagnostic yield of radiology tests was based on whether an abnormal test resulted in a procedural intervention. In sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated the appropriateness of testing using prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: The frequency of testing increased with higher AKI stages for nearly all diagnostic tests, whereas the frequency of detecting an abnormal result increased for some, but not all, tests. The frequency of detecting an abnormal result was highly variable across tests, ranging from 0% for anti-glomerular basement membrane testing to 71% for urine protein testing. Many of the tests evaluated had low diagnostic yield. In particular, selected urine and blood tests were unlikely to impact AKI diagnosis or management, whereas radiology tests had greater clinical utility.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with AKI, many of the diagnostic tests conducted were unlikely to affect diagnosis or management, especially urine and blood tests. Radiology tests, however, showed greater clinical utility.

### The assessment, serial evaluation, and subsequent sequelae of acute kidney injury (ASSESS-AKI) study: design and methods [^115qFv1e]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

We recognize the limitations of the most recently proposed definitions for acute kidney injury (AKI), such as the RIFLE criteria and the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. These definitions are based solely on changes in serum creatinine concentration and/or urine output. Despite enthusiasm for potentially more sensitive and specific novel serum and urine biomarkers, at the time of writing, none have been validated as superior measures of AKI prognosis compared to the serum creatinine-based AKI criteria. A major goal of ASSESS-AKI is to provide key insights into the prognostic value of novel AKI biomarkers. Therefore, AKI will be operationalized as follows, which is anticipated to capture a broad spectrum of kidney injury:

- **Adult participants**: AKI will be defined as a ≥ 50% relative increase and/or an absolute increase of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26 μmol/L) in peak inpatient serum creatinine compared with baseline outpatient serum creatinine.
- **Pediatric participants**: AKI will be defined as a ≥ 50% relative increase in peak inpatient serum creatinine compared with baseline serum creatinine.

We did not incorporate urine output criteria from the AKIN classification scheme due to concerns about the systematic availability and quality of data, especially in non-ICU patients who are unlikely to have indwelling urinary catheters. Furthermore, including the urine output criteria might overly enrich our cohort for patients with pre-renal azotemia.

To enhance the likelihood of enrolling an adequate number of adult participants with more severe AKI, we have set an enrollment target of at least…

### The assessment, serial evaluation, and subsequent sequelae of acute kidney injury (ASSESS-AKI) study: design and methods [^114YrTGp]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

- **Renal outcomes**: The primary renal outcome is the change in kidney function during follow-up. Kidney function will be defined before and after an acute kidney injury (AKI) episode (as well as among those without AKI) using outpatient serum creatinine concentration measurements. Given the known limitations of using serum creatinine alone as a measure of kidney function, except for its use in defining an episode of AKI per the criteria described previously, we will use the CKD-EPI equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using an IDMS-traceable serum creatinine assay among all adult study participants. For pediatric participants, we will estimate GFR using the recommended Schwartz formula based on serum creatinine values measured in local laboratories using the same assays for baseline and follow-up measurements within those sites. Urine albuminuria will be measured using a spot albumin-to-creatinine ratio.

- **Incident CKD**: Among participants without pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the index hospitalization, we will examine the time to development of incident CKD with significant loss of renal function. This is defined as experiencing both a minimum 25% reduction in the level of estimated GFR compared with baseline and achieving CKD Stage 3 or worse during follow-up.

- **Progression of CKD**: Among participants with pre-existing CKD at the index hospitalization (defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²), we will examine the time to progression of CKD. This is defined as experiencing at least a 50% reduction in the level of eGFR compared with baseline or progressing to CKD Stage 5.

- **Development of ESRD**: Development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after the 3-month follow-up will be documented.

While the development of biomarkers has shown potential to enhance early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and risk stratification of acute kidney injury (AKI), their widespread clinical application is still evolving. These biomarkers may eventually contribute to personalized care and precise clinical decision-making and may inform the development of future therapies.

### The assessment, serial evaluation, and subsequent sequelae of acute kidney injury (ASSESS-AKI) study: design and methods [^116jVrRE]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the emerging clinical and public health importance of acute kidney injury (AKI), studies at the time of writing have traditionally focused on characterizing its short-term consequences. Recent attempts to extend the focus to longer-term outcomes have primarily involved the retrospective study of administrative databases in different populations and clinical settings. While these studies have reported a link between AKI and increased risk for either advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and all-cause death, there have been several important limitations. Specifically, all published studies were retrospective in nature. Many did not use observed changes in serum creatinine to define AKI or rigorously quantify baseline renal function but rather relied on administrative diagnostic codes for defining "AKI" and determining the presence or absence of baseline CKD and potential confounders. Most studies included only a relatively small number of outcomes. Importantly, none of the studies collected specimens to measure biomarkers both during the AKI admission and after hospital discharge.

The ASSESS-AKI study will address many of these limitations by establishing a prospective, matched parallel cohort of persons (including children) with and without AKI based on serum creatinine-based criteria measured in a standardized fashion. Serial collection of blood and urine will be conducted for the evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic markers in AKI, with systematic follow-up for changes in renal function and multiple clinical and patient-centered outcomes.

### Oliguria: An earlier and accurate biomarker of acute kidney injury [^115YwEaf]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

In the context of the critically ill patient, the onset of consistent oliguria is an ominous sign that requires immediate attention. Without intervention, intermittent oliguria may turn into persistent oliguria or evolve to acute kidney injury (AKI), with severe associated morbidity and mortality. Whether the addition of urine output to the serum creatinine criteria permits earlier and more specific detection of AKI is controversial, but evidence supports its importance in early diagnosis and management.

### Biological markers of acute kidney injury [^117PdxEu]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

An abrupt change in serum creatinine, the most common indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), is strongly linked to poor outcomes across multiple clinical settings. Despite numerous attempts to distill the magnitude and timing of a changing serum creatinine into a standardized metric, focusing solely on this traditional functional marker obligates the characterization of AKI to remain, at best, retrospective and causally noninformative. This inability to meaningfully segregate critical aspects of injury — such as type, onset, propagation, and recovery — from ongoing decrements in renal function has hindered the successful translation of promising therapeutics.

Over the past decade, the emerging field of clinical proteomics has reinvigorated hope for identifying novel plasma and urine biomarkers to characterize the cause and course of kidney injury. Efforts to validate these markers for clinical studies now show early promise but face important obstacles. These include interpretive difficulties when using serum creatinine as a sole comparator for diagnostic performance, the need for better evaluation of the incremental performance of new markers above established clinical and biochemical predictors, a relative lack of power to sufficiently examine hard clinical endpoints, and a potential over-reliance on the use of receiver operating curves for assessing biomarker utility. Here, we discuss efforts to address these barriers and further ascertain the clinical value of new markers.

### Potential interventions in sepsis-related acute kidney injury [^112uwg8G]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Acute kidney injury often complicates sepsis, leading to greater complexity, higher cost of care, and a worsening prognosis. In recent years, a consensus definition of acute kidney injury has been developed, facilitating research into the pathophysiology and epidemiology of this disorder. New and emerging biomarkers to recognize kidney injury before functional abnormalities manifest may allow early recognition and facilitate prevention or treatment. Furthermore, advances in the clinical management of sepsis may have secondary benefits with respect to renal outcomes. Existing and hybrid extracorporeal therapies are being investigated not only as means to replace lost kidney function but also to modulate the immune response to sepsis. For those with more advanced forms of kidney injury, strategies to promote renal recovery are being sought to minimize the long-term consequences of impaired kidney function. This review provides an update on the state of the science and a glimpse toward the future of intervention in sepsis-related acute kidney injury.

### Acute kidney injury: What's the prognosis [^116Mvdoq]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common, especially during critical illness, and is increasing in incidence. It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) classification currently provides a standardized estimate of incidence and outcomes from AKI. Despite advances in understanding the pathogenesis of human AKI, our ability to assess kidney function is limited. Functional impairment poorly correlates with structural injury to the kidneys. However, emerging novel biomarkers are likely to further enhance risk stratification, facilitate early diagnosis, enable early enrollment in therapeutic trials, and assess prognosis.

Sepsis remains the leading cause of AKI among the critically ill. Over the past few years, insights into the pathogenesis of AKI in sepsis are beginning to shift attention from renal blood flow to inflammation-mediated organ injury. Emerging evidence suggests that survivors of AKI incur long-term risks for developing chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease compared to those without AKI. Despite decades of research, no specific therapy for AKI other than supportive care currently exists. Further work is required to better understand the pathogenesis of AKI during critical illness and to develop novel treatments.

### New biomarkers of acute kidney injury [^111cJFe5]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a major clinical problem with rising incidence and high mortality rate. The lack of early biomarkers has resulted in a delay in initiating therapies. Fortunately, the tools of modern science have revealed promising novel biomarkers for AKI, with potentially high sensitivity and specificity. These include a plasma panel (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin C) and a urine panel (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, interleukin 18, and kidney injury molecule-1).

These biomarkers are sequential, likely making the AKI panels useful for timing the initial insult, assessing the duration of AKI, and predicting overall prognosis with respect to dialysis requirement and mortality. The panels may also help distinguish between the various types and pathogeneses of AKI. Future studies must validate the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarker panels in clinical samples from large cohorts and multiple clinical situations.

Such studies will be markedly facilitated by the participation of various specialties such as intensivists, cardiologists, and surgeons in AKI clinical studies and by the availability of commercial tools for the reliable and reproducible measurement of biomarkers across different laboratories.

- **Risk assessment**: We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities, especially pre-existing proteinuria and CKD, and exposures to nephrotoxic medication or interventions. We recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of serum creatinine and urine output to detect AKI at an early stage. Frequency and duration of monitoring should be planned based on patient risk and clinical course. We recommend developing and implementing pathways of care at the broader hospital level, in close collaboration with the other individual specialities, to achieve the above-mentioned targets.

- **Rationale**: Risk for AKI is increased by exposure to factors that cause AKI (e.g. nephrotoxic medication) or the presence of factors that increase susceptibility to AKI (e.g. dehydration, co-morbidities, and also pre-existing proteinuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD)). The interaction between susceptibility and the type and extent of exposure to insults determines the risk of AKI occurrence. Particularly in the hospital setting, the patient's susceptibility should be assessed on a regular basis and some factors modified or even avoided (e.g. administration of potentially nephrotoxic agents). ERBP wants to point out that in patients on dialysis, but with preserved diuresis, it can be important to follow up this parameter after procedures with a risk of deterioration of residual renal function, as unnoticed loss of residual renal function can occur.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^112DoURG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and Other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction.

### Acute kidney injury: Diagnosis and management [^111NmB7g]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. It is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. The severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. The etiologies are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g. older male with prostatic hypertrophy).

- **General management principles**: Determine volume status, perform fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treat volume overload with diuretics, discontinue nephrotoxic medications, and adjust prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control.

- **Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs**: These programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression.

Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is an inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause.

### Subclinical aki — an emerging syndrome with important consequences [^116wMda1]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

According to guidelines published by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) should be managed according to their susceptibilities and exposures. Clinical evaluation of a patient's risk of acute loss of renal function is of undisputed importance. However, such evaluations can be hindered by the complex presentations of critically ill patients and the lack of methods to detect early kidney damage. In this regard, a tool for diagnosis and stratification of patients at risk of AKI would complement clinical assessments and enable improved therapeutic decision-making.

Emerging evidence suggests that 15–20% of patients who do not fulfill serum-creatinine-based consensus criteria for AKI are nevertheless likely to have acute tubular damage, which is associated with adverse outcomes. This evidence supports reassessment of the concept and evolution of the definition of AKI to incorporate biomarkers of tubular damage.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. It would be ideal to have prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements widely available through electronic medical records, but this is not practiced in many parts of the world. Prior serum creatinine or GFR measures may also further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk based on either comorbidity or an intervention.

There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level need to be interpreted with caution because they may result from acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult (e.g. coronary angiography, elective surgery, nephrotoxic drug exposure), serum creatinine level should be measured at an appropriate time, allowing for AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine level should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including onset of CKD at 90 days.

- **Evaluation of urine output**: How urine output should be evaluated is also an area that needs further investigation to avoid variability in reporting of AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should…

### Paradigms of acute kidney injury in the intensive care setting [^117WwW58]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with multiple etiologies, variable pathogenesis, and diverse outcomes. However, these heterogeneities are not reflected in approaches to the diagnosis, and to some degree, treatment of AKI. For example, congestive heart failure and dehydration can produce identical changes in serum creatinine level and urine output, which are parameters used to define AKI; however, they differ vastly in their physiological contexts and require completely opposite treatments. AKI is often considered to be a homogeneous clinical entity, implying a uniform pathogenesis and a well-defined prognosis. Consequently, efforts to find effective AKI treatments have been hampered by a lack of clear clinical classifications for various types of AKI.

Subclassification of AKI into subclinical phenotypes — based on protein biomarkers and other in vitro diagnostics that consider disease etiology and underlying pathogenesis — might be necessary to develop therapeutic approaches that effectively target the diverse pathomechanisms of AKI. This review discusses major subtypes of AKI associated with sepsis, major surgery, renal hypoperfusion, and nephrotoxin exposure, which are situations typically seen in the intensive care setting. We consider differences and similarities in their phenotype, pathogenesis, and outcomes, and how this information might be used to guide treatment.

### The definition of acute kidney injury and its use in practice [^112DGnHD]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome that is independently associated with increased mortality. A standardized definition is important to facilitate clinical care and research. The definition of AKI has evolved rapidly since 2004, with the introduction of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE), AKI Network (AKIN), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. RIFLE was modified for pediatric use (pRIFLE). These classifications were developed using both evidence and consensus.

Small rises in serum creatinine are independently associated with increased mortality and are hence incorporated into the definition of AKI. The recent definition from the international KDIGO guideline merged RIFLE and AKIN. A systematic review has found that these definitions do not differ significantly in their performance. Health-care staff caring for children or adults should use standard criteria for AKI, such as the pRIFLE or KDIGO definitions, respectively. Efforts to standardize the AKI definition are a substantial advance, although areas of uncertainty remain.

The new definitions have enabled the use of electronic alerts to warn clinicians of possible AKI. Novel biomarkers may further refine the definition of AKI, but their use will need to produce tangible improvements in outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Further developments in AKI definitions should be informed by research into their practical application across health-care providers. This review discusses the definition of AKI and its use in practice for clinicians and laboratory scientists.

### Raising awareness of acute kidney injury: A global perspective of a silent killer [^1124N7BV]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes. Over the last few years, collaborative efforts, enabled by a common definition of AKI, have provided a description of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of this disease and improved our understanding of the pathophysiology. There is increased recognition that AKI is encountered in multiple settings and in all age groups, and that its course and outcomes are influenced by the severity and duration of the event. The effect of AKI on an individual patient and the resulting societal burden from the long-term effects of the disease, including the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is attracting increasing scrutiny.

There is evidence of marked variation in the management of AKI, which is, to a large extent, due to a lack of awareness and an absence of standards for prevention, early recognition, and intervention. These emerging data point to an urgent need for a global effort to highlight that AKI is preventable, its course is modifiable, and its treatment can improve outcomes. In this article, we provide a framework of reference and propose specific strategies to raise awareness of AKI globally, with the goal of ultimately improving outcomes from this devastating disease.

### The growth of acute kidney injury: A rising tide or just closer attention to detail [^1174STaV]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Although the usefulness of these newer criteria to clinical practice remains to be defined, their application within research settings has resulted in large increases in the reported incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), driven largely by the inclusion of less severe AKI.

Another important consideration is that creatinine-based definitions of AKI require quantifying acute changes from a so-called 'baseline' value. Ideally, this value would reflect a patient's steady-state kidney function just before the AKI insult. However, information on prehospital kidney function is often lacking, prompting the use of various surrogate estimates. These may include inpatient values, such as admission and nadir, or the imputation of values like back-calculating a baseline creatinine using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m² (eGFR 75) in patients with missing data. This approach can inflate or reduce the reported incidence of AKI and its prognosis.

In one study of 4863 hospitalized adults, the use of the eGFR 75 approach or the minimum inpatient serum creatinine increased the incidence of AKI from 25.5% to 38.3% or 35.9%, respectively, compared with when AKI was measured using a known outpatient baseline value. These increases were likely due, in part, to erroneously identifying patients with stable chronic kidney disease (CKD) as having AKI. The use of minimum inpatient creatinine also appeared to overestimate AKI incidence. Although the reasons are not clear, potential explanations include changes in serum creatinine resulting from volume depletion.
