## Question

The patient has seizures with non-motor onset with emotional change and speech arrest localizing to the right temporal lobe.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and localize seizures characterized by non-motor onset with emotional change and speech arrest, and whether these features localize to the right temporal lobe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the semiology and whether it fits focal seizures with impaired awareness. Then, I should verify the anatomical substrates for emotional change and speech arrest in the right hemisphere. Next, I will review lateralizing and localizing evidence linking these features to the right temporal lobe. After that, I need to consider alternative localizations such as insular or frontal contributions. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline next steps for confirmation and management.

> Let me first confirm the semiologic pattern. Non-motor onset with emotional change and speech arrest suggests focal seizures with impaired awareness, where emotional phenomena reflect limbic activation and speech arrest reflects disruption of language production, even when the dominant hemisphere is left, because arrest can occur with propagation to bilateral frontal or temporal language networks or via network inhibition, and this aligns with ILAE descriptors of nonmotor focal seizures and their cognitive/behavioral components [^a13a76a9].

> Now, I need to check the anatomical substrate for emotional change. The right amygdala and mesial temporal structures are central to emotional processing, and seizures involving the right temporal lobe commonly produce fear or other negative emotional auras; large SEEG series of prefrontal and mesial temporal seizures show high rates of ictal fear and related behaviors, supporting a right temporal limbic source for emotional semiology in this case [^4782e16f] [^ee627df2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about speech arrest. I initially thought speech arrest strictly implies dominant hemisphere involvement, but wait, let me verify that assumption. Speech arrest can be induced by stimulation or seizure spread in nondominant temporal and frontal regions, and case series document ictal speech arrest with right temporal onset, including foreign-language ictal speech automatisms arising from right amygdala with spread to ipsilateral temporal neocortex or frontal operculum, indicating that arrest or altered speech production can occur in nondominant networks via propagation or network effects, not solely from dominant-hemisphere origin [^54ebbffd] [^3cef07d6].

> Next, I should review lateralizing and localizing evidence. Ictal dysprosody has been repeatedly linked to nondominant temporal lobe seizures, with the majority of cases arising from the right temporal lobe, reinforcing that right temporal involvement produces measurable changes in speech production during seizures; additionally, insulo-opercular seizure studies show that behavioral arrest and aphasia can cluster with subjective feelings and autonomic features, consistent with propagation from anterior temporal regions to insular and opercular cortex, which helps explain speech arrest in the context of right temporal onset seizures [^d0baf952] [^ee627df2].

> But wait, what if the seizure onset is not purely temporal? I need to consider alternatives. Insular and frontal contributions can produce behavioral arrest and speech dysfunction via propagation, and cingulate seizures can manifest with emotional components and complex behaviors; however, the combination of early emotional change with speech arrest is most parsimoniously explained by right temporal onset with rapid spread to frontal and opercular regions, rather than a primary insular or cingulate onset, given the stronger temporal-limbic substrate for ictal emotion and the documented spread patterns from amygdala to frontal operculum producing speech alterations [^ee627df2] [^fdeba762] [^54ebbffd].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence before concluding. The convergence of right amygdala involvement in emotional processing, the high prevalence of ictal fear in right temporal seizures, the documentation of ictal speech arrest and dysprosody in nondominant temporal epilepsy, and the mechanistic plausibility of propagation to frontal speech areas collectively support localization to the right temporal lobe for this semiology, while acknowledging that exact boundaries of the seizure onset zone require EEG correlation and, when needed, intracranial recordings to distinguish onset from spread [^4782e16f] [^d0baf952] [^54ebbffd].

> Let me synthesize. The constellation of non-motor onset, emotional change, and speech arrest is anatomically coherent with right temporal lobe seizures, particularly involving the right amygdala and mesial temporal structures with early propagation to frontal opercular and insular regions, explaining both the emotional aura and the transient speech arrest; this pattern is well-described in the literature and aligns with the functional neuroanatomy of emotion and speech networks in the right hemisphere [^4782e16f] [^d0baf952] [^54ebbffd].

> Next, I should review practical implications. I need to ensure we correlate with EEG, ideally video-EEG, to confirm focal right temporal onset, and obtain high-quality brain MRI to identify a lesion or mesial temporal sclerosis that would strengthen localization; if noninvasive data are discordant or surgery is contemplated, SEEG can define the seizure onset zone and map functional language representation, noting that pediatric and adult patients may show atypical language organization, especially with early seizure onset or developmental lesions, which affects surgical planning and risk counseling [^bd364c12] [^493d9865] [^914edba4].

> Finally, I should confirm management considerations. If pharmacoresistant, right temporal lobe epilepsy is among the most surgically remediable syndromes, with excellent seizure-free outcomes after tailored anterior temporal resection when the semiology, EEG, and imaging converge; earlier surgical evaluation is recommended for drug-resistant cases given the mortality benefit and quality-of-life gains associated with seizure freedom after surgery, provided careful functional mapping is performed to mitigate language and memory risks [^74cebdc1] [^310c1a32].

The combination of **non-motor onset**, **emotional change**, and **speech arrest** strongly suggests right temporal lobe involvement, particularly the **right amygdala and anterior temporal neocortex** [^54ebbffd]. Emotional changes reflect limbic activation, while speech arrest arises from spread to the right frontal operculum or insula, consistent with nondominant temporal seizure semiology [^ee627df2]. This pattern is supported by intracranial EEG and stimulation studies, and helps distinguish right temporal seizures from dominant-hemisphere language deficits [^3cef07d6] [^d0baf952].

---

## Anatomical localization within the right temporal lobe

- **Amygdala**: Central to emotional processing; seizures originating here often produce fear, anxiety, or other emotional changes [^4782e16f].

- **Anterior temporal neocortex**: Involved in emotional expression and integration; spread to this region amplifies emotional semiology [^notfound].

- **Right frontal operculum and insula**: Key nodes for speech production; spread from the right temporal lobe can cause speech arrest or dysprosody even when language is left-dominant [^3cef07d6] [^d0baf952].

---

## Electrophysiological evidence

Intracranial EEG studies show that **right amygdala onset** with spread to ipsilateral temporal neocortex or frontal operculum produces emotional changes and speech arrest, confirming this anatomo-clinical correlation [^54ebbffd]. Electrical stimulation mapping demonstrates that **speech arrest** can be induced by stimulation of right frontal and temporal regions, supporting a nondominant network role in speech production disruption [^3cef07d6].

---

## Clinical implications for diagnosis and management

- **Lateralization**: Emotional changes with speech arrest favor nondominant (right) temporal lobe onset, aiding presurgical localization [^d0baf952].

- **Imaging**: MRI may reveal right mesial temporal sclerosis or other lesions; if nonlesional, PET or SPECT can help localize the epileptogenic zone [^310c1a32].

- **Surgical considerations**: Right temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalohippocampectomy can be effective when the seizure onset zone is confirmed, with lower risk of language deficits than dominant-hemisphere surgery [^74cebdc1].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Alternative localizations include **frontal lobe seizures** (hypermotor or behavioral arrest) and **insular seizures** (autonomic and emotional symptoms with speech arrest) [^ee627df2]. However, the combination of **emotional change with speech arrest** is most characteristic of right temporal lobe seizures with frontal opercular spread [^54ebbffd].

---

## Summary of anatomo-clinical correlation

| **Clinical feature** | **Anatomical substrate** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Emotional change | Right amygdala, anterior temporal neocortex | Limbic activation |
| Speech arrest | Right frontal operculum, insula | Spread from temporal lobe disrupting speech production |

---

The triad of non-motor onset, emotional change, and speech arrest localizes to the **right temporal lobe**, typically involving the amygdala and anterior temporal neocortex with spread to the right frontal operculum or insula. This pattern is supported by intracranial EEG and stimulation studies and guides lateralization and surgical planning in nondominant temporal lobe epilepsy [^54ebbffd] [^3cef07d6].

Localization and region of interest analysis

The regional responsivity was assessed by (i) parcelling the entire cortical mantle according to the Lausanne2008 (resolution 60) template, which subdivides the entire brain into 129 different cortical and subcortical structures, (Fig. 1); and (ii) estimating, for each region of the template, the percentage of leads showing a significant effect in the ANOVAs over the total number of investigated leads. The selection of this template was a compromise between different needs, as the more narrow-meshed a parcellation is, the more likely it is that effective connectivity data between two specific areas are missing. Frontal/insular regions showing a significant effect in at least 10% of the overall number of recording leads, evaluated on at least four leads, were selected for the study of the effective connectivity (see later). Results for the occipito-temporal network and parietal regions will not be discussed in depth due to our focus on motor/emotional resonances and because of their extensive treatment in previous human intracranial recordings investigations. Sampling and results relative to these regions are, however, reported in Supplementary Table 1.

High-frequency electrical stimulation

After the recording of spontaneous seizures, HF-ES was performed through the electrodes in many cerebral structures, aimed at both inducing seizures and brain mapping. Bipolar HF-ES of pairs of adjacent leads was carried out by means of biphasic rectangular stimuli of alternating polarity (frequency: 50 Hz; pulse width: 0.5–1 ms; duration: 5 s, current intensity: up to 4 mA). Stimulations were delivered while patients were maintaining the Mingazzini position and speaking aloud, to evaluate upper limbs movements, speech arrest and other behavioural modifications. All the elicited responses were video-recorded and prospectively stored in clinical report documents. Here we collected the available results obtained by HF-ES of the frontal/insular sites showing a significant interaction between emotional (smiling or fearful) and neutral expressions. The aim of this analysis was to better characterize the functional role of the sites modulated by the visual stimulus, and it does not exclude that other responses can be evoked by HF-ES of other frontal/insular regions not activated by the visual task.

Based on our previous work, we characterized the type of clinical response according to the following categories: sensorimotor manifestation, interoceptive sensation, emotional behaviour, language impairments, unspecific subjective responses and unresponsive sites.

### Ictal semiology of epileptic seizures with insulo-opercular genesis [^ee627df2]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The performed cluster analysis revealed that in both patient groups, subjective feelings (including somatosensory sensations but also fear, olfactory, gustatory, auditory, déjà-vu or cephalic sensations) and hyperkinetic features were associated in one cluster, behavioral arrest, aphasia, automatisms, autonomic features, and focal motor features in a second one. Ictal speech characterizes seizures generated in the non-dominant hemisphere, which may contribute to its positive association with reported subjective feelings in both patient groups, as awareness is more frequently preserved and subjective feelings thus experienced during and remembered after the seizure. We did not find obvious relationship between the semiological subclusters and anatomic subregions of the insula. This may reflect epileptogenic lesions extending not limited to a subarea of the insula but rather across the whole insula as well as a role of ictal propagation in the clinical manifestation of the seizures.

The insula is by no means an isolated functional center, as the term "insula" may suggest, rather the wide clinical spectrum of insular seizures reflects that the insula acts as a multimodal hub region with extensive structural and functional connections to other brain regions. On the other hand, the anatomical organization of the insula per se is highly heterogeneous and its disruption by seizures may similarly elicit a wide spectrum of symptoms. While epigastric, olfactory, gustatory and auditory sensations may relate to a primary generation within the insular cortex, behavioral arrest and automatisms likely reflect seizure spread through extensive connections to the temporal lobe; emotional and cognitive auras to the limbic regions; tonic, clonic or hyperkinetic phenomena and speech dysfunction to frontal regions.

The semiological features reported here, as well as the stereotypy of events, imaging and the knowledge that at least focal aware seizures may not be accompanied by scalp EEG correlates will also contribute to a better clinical judgement and differentiation between PNES and seizures of insular origin.

This study has several limitations. Some patients had a lesion which extended beyond the strict borders of the insula, particularly to one of the opercula. This reflects the clinical spectrum of patients presenting with insular seizures and was thus not chosen as an exclusion criterion. An extension of the SOZ beyond the peri-insular circular sulcus may favor the occurrence of motor seizures. Future prospective multicenter assessments in larger groups of patients may provide further insight of the role of adjacent regions for the newly identified semiological clusters, including the temporal sequence of symptoms, and the distinction of IOE to other regions of focal epileptogenesis.

### Semiology-based sub-lobar localization in pediatric frontal lobe epilepsy in a seven-year-old? [^68b9a1a9]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Is sublobar localization possible in pDRE of frontal lobe origin? Bonini et alintroduced new terms for description of seizure semiology (gestural motor behaviors; integrated vs. nonintegrated motor stereotypies) while describing and thereafter classifying sublobar localization of FLE. This was before the ILAE published new terminology for seizure and epilepsy classification in 2017.

Detailed sublobar semiological data in pDRE didn't exist till 2024. In the article that is the subject of this commentary; Thijs van Dalen et alretrospectively identified children with intractable FLE that had undergone surgery and remained seizure-free for at least one year thereafter. Videos of habitual seizures were categorized by 2 independent observers based on the ILAE semiology classification. Additional semiology characteristics of hyperkinetic behavior; integrated and nonintegrated behavioral features were identified and scored per the Bonini paper. Observers were blinded to the precise localization of resected cortical areas on post-operative MRI. Semiological features that occurred during the bilateral convulsive phase of the seizure were not included as these were unlikely to indicate sublobar localization at seizure onset. The mean age at the first video EEG of this cohort of 50 children was about 7 years (84.6 months) (range in months 2.0–195 ± 53.2). Authors carefully itemized and defined reduced responsiveness, postictal confusion, elementary motor signs, complex motor semiology, facial change, emotional expression, presence or absence of aura, and autonomic features. Results were categorized by age (≤ 4 years vs. > 4 years of age) and by MRI localization of resection into the main groups of mesial FLE, lateral FLE, extensive resection (mesial + lateral plus frontal lobe), and lesionectomy.

Expected Findings

Seizures were short in all patients; more frequent and of a shorter duration in the younger group. Elementary motor signs such as myoclonic seizures, were more common at presentation in children < 4 years old. Hypomotor behavior was more common in younger patients and was more likely localized to the lateral frontal region. Behavioral changes with integrated or nonintegrated motor components were enriched in patients older than 4 years of age.

New Findings

Hyperkinetic movements were noted in both age groups but also documented in a 10-month-old. Ipsilateral body-turning and contralateral head-turning were more commonly seen in mesial FLE. Additionally, ictal emotional features were commonly seen in mesial compared to lateral frontal lobe seizures.

### Seizure mimics in children: an age-based approach [^88dc1056]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In order to distinguish seizure mimics from seizures in children it is important to clarify the event duration, frequency, semiology, and any precipitating factors.

Methodology

This review provides a succinct and up-to-date overview aimed at general and subspecialty non-neurologist pediatric and adolescent health care providers to help guide a diagnostic approach when a child presents with paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.

Results

In many cases, seizure mimics are consistently triggered by an event, location, or emotion, and often resolve with distraction or tactile stimulation. Suspicion should be raised for seizures when events occur out of deep sleep, there is a loss of consciousness with the event, movements are not suppressible, and there is a period of fatigue afterword (minutes to hours). Further, a past medical history of developmental delay (e.g. autism), developmental regression, or neurologic injury increases patients' risk for seizures.

Conclusions

Common seizure mimics are highlighted in the age group in which they are most prevalent.

### Ictal coprolalia: a case report and review of ictal speech as a localizing feature in epilepsy [^20c96a66]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recognizing ictal semiology is an essential component to localization of seizure onset, especially in intractable epilepsy where surgical therapies may be beneficial. Ictal speech can be a common component of seizure semiology, but the various forms of ictal speech may have different lateralizing and localizing value. Coprolalia is a very rare form of ictal speech.

Methods

We present a 15 year old with medically intractable seizures characterized by agitation and coprolalia.

Results

The patient underwent surgical evaluation including video EEG, MRI, and functional neuroimaging. These studies indicated onset within the dominant frontal lobe which was further localized using stereo-electroencephalography prior to focal cortical resection.

Conclusions

Ictal coprolalia is a rare presentation of ictal speech. We review the various forms of ictal speech and their value in localizing seizure onset.

### Speech arrest with stimulation may not reliably predict language deficit after epilepsy surgery [^d8461ada]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The authors present a patient in whom electrical cortical stimulation of the posterior temporal cortex induced speech arrest, comprehension deficits, and other language-related impairments. This area was ultimately resected because of persistence of a severe seizure disorder. No postoperative aphasia was observed despite the cortical stimulation results, and the patient is since seizure free. These findings question the well-established principle that corticography directly reflects local cortical functions in all patients.

### Classifying epilepsy pragmatically: past, present, and future [^9dcd28dd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

3.4. Brain age

Brain development stages denoted as "brain age", measured often as brain-predicted age difference (PAD), is probably more relevant than chronological age to epilepsy diagnosis and classification, influencing susceptibility to, presentation, and consequences of seizures. The onset or offset of seizures marks a turning point in brain development, demonstrated by regression of speech with seizure onset in Kleffner-Landau syndrome or resumption of brain maturation with successful seizure control in West syndrome. In epileptic encephalopathies, brain maturation arrests at a given time point and might also regress. Therefore, consideration of how brain age or development is reflected in classification is important.

Developing, aging, or degenerating brains are highly susceptible to seizures. Brain maturation likely influences seizure semiology. Seizures are featureless, denoted as "hypomotor", during infancy, plausibly reflecting limited neuronal connectivity, while automatisms and hypermotor seizures occur in older children with presumably mature brains. Lateralizing signs increase with age in people with temporal epilepsy. Epileptic spasms typically occur during infancy, while absence seizures, myoclonic-astatic, and generalised tonic-clonic seizures occur in later childhood. Lastly, there is evidence for an interaction between age and pharmacoresistance to ASMs, adversely impacting cognitive development and function in children with epilepsy. Cognitive impairments associated with uncontrolled seizures are particularly severe during infancy and decrease thereafter. Individuals with onset of temporal epilepsy in childhood exhibit greater reduction of brain tissue volumes, namely white matter in extratemporal regions, and more marked memory deficits.

While the quest for robust markers for brain age continues, it is conceivable that applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will yield important insights to admit brain age to epilepsy classifications in the future.

### Ictal semiology of epileptic seizures with insulo-opercular genesis [^39d7cd1b]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Semiological features were analyzed at the patient level and classified in accordance with the latest operational classification of seizure types by the International League Against Epilepsy into: somatosensory (including perioral and throat sensations), olfactory, auditory, gustatory, cephalic or epigastric sensation, déjà-vu, fear, autonomic alterations (including feeling of warmth, flush, ictal tachycardia or bradycardia, hypersalivation and nausea), aphasia, ictal speech, hyperkinetic or focal motor activity (including versive, clonic or tonic posturing), automatisms (oral or manual), behavioral arrest, and postictal aphasia. Focal seizures progressing to bilateral tonic–clonic seizures were also documented. Somatosensory sensations, manual automatisms, versive, clonic, and tonic activity were additionally classified into not present, present but non-lateralizing (bilateral or alternating between right and left), ipsi- or contralateral to the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Semiological features were considered initial if they were the earliest feature in at least one seizure of a given patient. In the case that different seizures had more than three different initial semiological signs, the three features most frequently occurring at the start of seizures were used for analysis.

A combined analysis was performed using lateralizing features expected to be contralateral to the SOZ (somatosensory sensations, versive, clonic, and tonic movements). The score was considered ipsilateral if at least one element was lateralized ipsilateral and none contralateral; contralateral, if at least one element was lateralized contralateral and none ipsilateral; and non-lateralizing, if at least one ipsilateral and one contralateral involvement was present, respectively.

Data analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2. Frequencies of semiological features were compared between IOE and MTE patients using Fisher's exact test (2-tailed). Features showing significantly different frequencies (p < 0.05) were included in an initial logistic regression model. As the data showed quasi-complete separation, a bias-reduced general linear model (R-package 'brglm2', version 0.6.2) was used for this purpose. Variables without a significant independent contribution to the initial multivariate model were then excluded by backward elimination.

### Frontal lobe seizures [^f318f3f7]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that clinical characteristics of frontal lobe seizures have been recently described better, differentiating seizures of frontal lobe origin from NES on clinical grounds alone is difficult. The difficulty has been compounded by the fact that both inter-ictal and ictal EEG can be normal or nonspecific, and the same is true of imaging studies. A detailed clinical history as well as video monitoring can be helpful diagnostic tools. A multidisciplinary approach is warranted and is at times essential to improve the diagnosis and care of these difficult patients.

### Differential diagnosis… [^e8a9ca03]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Symptomatic seizures are those that have a recognizable cause, and idiopathic seizures are those for which no abnormality is found. Acute symptomatic seizures are caused by a recent or current event, whereas remote symptomatic seizures are caused by a chronic abnormality such as an old stroke. A provoked seizure is caused by an identifiable transient disturbance such as an electrolyte abnormality. In the year following an acute symptomatic seizure diagnosis, patients have a higher risk of death than those without this diagnosis. Idiopathic seizures are not associated with increased risk of death.
4. Etiology There are multiple causes of seizure, but new-onset epilepsy is the most common cause of a first seizure. 3 One in six patients who present with a single seizure will have an identifiable potential cause such as pre- or perinatal brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, head injury, brain tumor, or alcohol use.
3. 10 Historic features suggestive of seizure include tongue biting, presence of an aura, sensation of epigastric fullness, postictal confusion, and focal neurologic signs. Tongue biting, especially lateral, is highly specific but not sensitive for generalized seizures. 11 Events precipitated by an emotionally stressful event or preceded by light-headedness, sweating, prolonged standing, chest pain, palpitations, or slow heart rate are more likely to be syncopal.
12. Electroencephalography is recommended for all patients with new-onset seizures. 1, 7 Emergent EEG testing is indicated if there is concern about status epilepticus. Nonconvulsive or subtle convulsive status epilepticus may be difficult to diagnose clinically and may be mistaken for a prolonged postictal state.

One fourth of patients with treated status epilepticus who appear to be seizure-free continue to have seizure activity that is only detectable with EEG. Patients who have had a seizure and are in a drug-induced coma or who have received a long-acting paralytic agent also should receive immediate EEG testing.

1. Most other patients with a first seizure can receive EEG testing at a scheduled follow-up visit. Although EEG within 24 to 48 hours of a seizure is more likely to show an abnormality, some early abnormalities, such as postictal slowing, may not be significant. 7.

### Epilepsy surgery for pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy… [^74cebdc1]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context Patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy have increased mortality compared with the general population, but patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy who meet criteria for surgery and who become seizure-free after anterior temporal lobe resection have reduced excess mortality vs those with persistent seizures. Objective To quantify the potential survival benefit of anterior temporal lobe resection for patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy vs continued medical management. To examine the evidence base for surgery for uncontrolled seizures, in 2003 the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology performed a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of anterior temporal lobe resections. 1 Based on 1 randomized trial and 24 observational studies, they found that anterior temporal lobe resection reduced the occurrence of disabling seizures and improved patients' quality of life, with "infrequent morbidity.

" Furthermore, they speculated that the "greater potential for achieving freedom from disabling seizures offered by surgical treatment, as opposed to continuing pharmacotherapy, may reduce the risks of long-term mortality". The model considers patients with refractory partial seizures, that are resistant to at least 2 antiepileptic medications. To determine surgical eligibility, an epileptogenic region in the anterior temporal lobe must be identified through diagnostic evaluation including clinical history, electroencephalogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional tests. Long-term Seizure Outcomes After Temporal Lobe Resection.

Longitudinal studies of patients with anterior temporal lobe resections have shown that the seizure status at 1 year after surgery does not remain stable over subsequent follow-up. Accordingly, a panel of experts systematically reviewed the risks and benefits of anterior temporal lobe resection for pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy and found that surgery resulted in two-thirds of patients becoming free of disabling seizures with improved overall quality of life. Based on these findings, they recommended that patients with disabling seizures who have failed trials of first-line antiepileptic drugs be referred to an epilepsy surgery center and that appropriate patients who accept its risks and benefits be offered surgery.

1. After stratifying patients on their seizure outcome after surgery, both found that after surgery patients who were free from disabling seizures.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation care, management of seizures, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider a therapeutic trial of a nonsedating antiseizure medication in adult patients who do not follow commands after ROSC with EEG patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum.

### Dysprosody during epileptic seizures lateralizes to the nondominant hemisphere [^d0baf952]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

In human speech, the changes in intonation, rhythm, or stress reflect emotions or intentions and are called prosody. Dysprosody is the impairment of prosody and has been described in stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. Reports in epilepsy patients are limited to case reports.

Methods

We assessed prosody qualitatively and quantitatively in 967 focal epilepsy patients. The qualitative assessment was performed by 2 native German speakers, and the quantitative frequency analysis used linguistic software tools. For the quantitative analysis, the formant F0 (a frequency peak, which is an approximation of pitch) and the further spectral frequency peaks of our patients' voices were analyzed.

Results

We found 26 patients with ictal dysprosody through qualitative analysis (2.7% of all focal epilepsies). The qualitative changes affected mostly the pitch and the loss of melody. The seizure patterns at the time of ictal dysprosody were always in the nondominant hemisphere (100%) and were mostly right temporal (n = 22; 84.6%). Quantitative analysis of 15 audio samples (11 patients) showed a change in the frequency of formant F0 of several patients and a reduction of frequency variation during ictal speech, expressed as the SD of formant F0 (ictal 14.1 vs interictal 27.2).

Conclusions

Ictal dysprosody localizes seizure onset or propagation to the nondominant temporal lobe. This information can be used in the evaluation of patients considered for resective epilepsy surgery.

### Reflex seizures, traits, and epilepsies: from physiology to pathology [^7af9f050]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Epileptic seizures are generally unpredictable and arise spontaneously. Patients often report non-specific triggers such as stress or sleep deprivation, but only rarely do seizures occur as a reflex event, in which they are objectively and consistently modulated, precipitated, or inhibited by external sensory stimuli or specific cognitive processes. The seizures triggered by such stimuli and processes in susceptible individuals can have different latencies. Once seizure-suppressing mechanisms fail and a critical mass (the so-called tipping point) of cortical activation is reached, reflex seizures stereotypically manifest with common motor features independent of the physiological network involved. The complexity of stimuli increases from simple sensory to complex cognitive-emotional with increasing age of onset. The topography of physiological networks involved follows the posterior-to-anterior trajectory of brain development, reflecting age-related changes in brain excitability. Reflex seizures and traits probably represent the extremes of a continuum, and understanding of their underlying mechanisms might help to elucidate the transition of normal physiological function to paroxysmal epileptic activity.

First nonfebrile seizure — key history and examination features include documenting health at seizure onset ("febrile, ill, exposed to illness, complaints of not feeling well, sleep deprived") and ictal symptoms such as "Aura: Subjective sensations," "Behavior: Mood or behavioral changes before the seizure," "Preictal symptoms: Described by patient or witnessed," "Vocal: Cry or gasp, slurring of words, garbled speech," "Motor: Head or eye turning, eye deviation, posturing, jerking (rhythmic), stiffening, automatisms (purposeless repetitive movements such as picking at clothing, lip smacking); generalized or focal movements," "Respiration: Change in breathing pattern, cessation of breathing, cyanosis," "Autonomic: Pupillary dilation, drooling, change in respiratory or heart rate, incontinence, pallor, vomiting," and "Loss of consciousness or inability to understand or speak." Symptoms following seizure (postictal) include "Amnesia for events, Confusion, Lethargy, Sleepiness, Headaches and muscle aches, Transient focal weakness (Todd's paresis), Nausea or vomiting."

### Prolonged deficits after focal inhibitory seizures [^7c1f520a]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Seizures are most commonly associated with positive phenomena such as tonic, clonic or myoclonic movements, automatisms, paresthesias and hallucinations. Negative phenomena, however, are not an uncommon manifestation of seizure activity. Examples of negative seizure phenomena include speech arrest, aphasia, amaurosis, amnesia, numbness, deafness, neglect and atonic seizures. Less commonly described in the literature are focal inhibitory motor seizures.

Methods and Results

Two patients presenting with rapidly progressive, prolonged hemiparesis, sensory neglect and hemi-visual field obscuration are described. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not reveal progression of known structural lesions or new lesions. The superficial cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the hemiparesis and sensory neglect enhanced diffusely with gadolinium on T1-weighted MRI images. Electroencephalography demonstrated periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in one patient and lateralized suppression and slowing in the other patient. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed hyperperfusion in the hemisphere contralateral to the hemiparesis and sensory neglect. The changes seen on MRI and SPECT resolved with resolution of the symptoms.

Conclusion

Taken together with the clinical history, the results from these investigations suggest focal inhibitory seizure as the underlying etiology. A review of the literature and investigations helpful in making this difficult diagnosis are provided.

### Poststroke seizure: optimising its management [^27090f7b]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The recognition and diagnosis of PSS, however, have not always been an easy task. In fact, most PSS occurred in patients who already had significant neurological deficits, so the new symptoms originated by seizures may be hidden or ignored. In certain instances, PSS present as only subtle clinical findings, such as focal, intermittent eye deviation or nystagmus, mild facial twitching, or focal sensation changes; other PSS cases may only have worsening of motor deficit, impaired speech or fluctuating stroke recovery. Moreover, patients with PSS may have no focal motor or sensory signs, and only present with altered mental status and behaviour arrest. These cases of subclinical/non-convulsion seizures or SE can only be confirmed by electroencephalogram (EEG). Claassen et al in their study of continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring in intensive care unit (ICU) patients reviewed 570 consecutive patients who underwent cEEG, among them 37% were stroke-related (19% subarachnoid haemorrhage, 7.9% ICH and 9.8% ischaemic stroke). The authors found that seizures were detected in 19% of patients who underwent cEEG monitoring; the seizures were exclusively non-convulsive in 92% of these patients. According to the definition proposed in this study, seizures were considered convulsive if any of the following was described: 'generalized tonic-clonic seizures', 'grand mal seizures', 'convulsions', 'rhythmic jerking', 'rhythmic twitching' or similar descriptions. If none of these was present and cEEG confirmed seizures, the seizures were considered non-convulsive, whether or not subtle movements (eg, subtle facial twitching, eye deviation, nystagmus) were observed. Miyaji et al recently reported 127 patients with PSS, 29% of them were non-convulsive seizures. Among them, 60 patients (47%) developed into SE, including 11 patients (9%) without convulsion.

### The clinical features, underlying immunology, and treatment of autoantibody-mediated movement disorders [^979c6ca5]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Features

Faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) are stereotyped, frequent, and brief dystonic movements consistently associated with LGI1 antbodies (see Supporting Information Video). They predominantly involve the arm and the ipsilateral face, and less commonly the leg or the trunk. 20, 21, 49 As the attacks are rarely associated with disturbance of consciousness or ictal EEG changes, they may be considered to lie in a borderland between movement disorders and seizures. 50 However, and consistent with seizures, FBDS can be preceded by sensory auras and automatisms, and both agitation and speech arrest are described during or after the episodes. 20, 49 Nevertheless, the semiology of FBDS is very different to that of more typical frontal and temporal lobe epilepsies. The attacks show a limited response to antiepileptic drugs, and multimodal radiological involvement of the basal ganglia is frequently observed in patients with FBDS (Fig. 3 A). 20, 49, 51, 52 Therefore, the origin of FBDS, and their preferred classification as a movement disorder or an epilepsy, is still debated, but pragmatically FBDS certainly continue to present to movement disorder neurologists, amongst others. Importantly, although FBDS were originally observed in the context of marked cognitive impairment (as part of an "encephalitis"), several patients present with FBDS alone. Furthermore, the relatively dramatic response of FBDS to immunotherapies, and their onset preceding the development of cognitive impairment, led to the hypothesis that their effective cessation may prevent the occurrence of cognitive impairment associated with limbic encephalitis. 20, 49 Indeed, in a recent cohort of 103 patients with FBDS, this appeared to be the case, with cognitive impairment appearing frequently, and almost exclusively, in patients with ongoing FBDS. 21 This may also be true of other seizure semiologies in patients with LGI1‐antibodies, which are well‐recognised and also very frequent. 53, 54, 55 Moreover, as generalized chorea can sometimes precede the onset of LGI1‐antibody encephalitis, perhaps a similar paradigm also operates in this clinical scenario. 56, 57

### The impact of COVID-19 on epilepsy care: a survey of the American Epilepsy Society membership [^224de0b4]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Impact on Patient Care

Seizures and COVID-19

About a third (30%) of the survey respondents reported a suspected cause for new onset seizures in COVID-19 patients. Most often the mechanism thought to be responsible for the seizures was lowered seizure threshold with preexisting risk factors. Some respondents suspected viral invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) and injury from SARS-CoV-2. Rarely, seizures were attributed to cardiac arrest or stroke that occurred during the illness. Most survey respondents (63%) indicated that the new-onset seizures were mostly focal-onset with or without evolution to bilateral tonic–clonic seizures. Other respondents identified seizures as generalized, electrographic only or unclassifiable almost equally.

One-third of respondents reported that they had PWE in their practice that had been diagnosed with COVID-19. A majority of these PWE had no change in seizure frequency. About 17% of the respondents noted worsening, while none noted an improvement in seizures in PWE with COVID-19.

In PWE who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, most respondents did not see a change in seizure frequency in their patients. However, 10% of respondents noted a worsening in seizure frequency, while 5% noted an improvement (Figure 2). Worsening of seizure frequency was attributed to increased stress, sleep deprivation, and reduced access to pharmacies and medications. However, when survey participants were specifically asked if PWE were reporting increased seizures as a result of emotional stress, more than 80% of respondents either disagreed or were neutral or unsure. Conversely, improved seizure control was attributed to better sleep and medication adherence.

### Antiepileptic drug treatment of rolandic epilepsy and panayiotopoulos syndrome: clinical practice survey and clinical trial feasibility [^b89e0c8e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Panayiotopoulos syndrome

In Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS), seizure semiology involves prominent autonomic symptoms. At onset, nausea, retching and vomiting are characteristic, often accompanied by other autonomic symptoms, such as pupillary changes, pallor/flushing, alterations in heart rate, breathing irregularities and temperature instability. Syncope-like episodes may occur. Impairment of consciousness develops as the seizure progresses, often accompanied by eye and head deviation. Seizures may end in hemi or generalised convulsions. Two-thirds of seizures occur during sleep. Seizures are often prolonged, most lasting over 10 min and many over 30 min (autonomic, non-convulsive status epilepticus). Potentially life-threatening cardiorespiratory arrest has been described in PS. As in RE, cognitive and behavioural difficulties have been associated with PS. Prognosis for remission of seizures is excellent.

When treated, carbamazepine and lamotrigine are recommended as first-line monotherapy by NICE (see table 1) and others, although the evidence base is acknowledged to be poor, and there are theoretical risks of carbamazepine exacerbating the seizures or EEG abnormalityand also speech production. International practice beyond the UK diverges widely, as does expert opinion on the subject. Sulthiame is considered first-line in Germany, Austria and Israel, although it may have adverse effects on cognition; sodium valproate in France; while levetiracetam is popular in the USA. Thus, the rationale for treatment versus non-treatment is not established and the evidence base in favour of specific AEDs is unknown amid widespread national and international variation in practice. This equipoise scenario sets the stage for an RCT, for which it would be important to learn the treatment preferences of physicians likely to recruit to such a trial, in order to assess various aspects of design feasibility. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, (1) to examine current clinical practice for RE and PS in relation to NICE guidance, specifically asking what proportion of patients are routinely not treated and (2) to explore the feasibility of alternative syndrome-specific RCT designs for RE and PS. We specifically address the questions of clinicians' attitudes towards placebo-controlled designs, and which AEDs would be either preferred or unpopular comparators.

### The nose knows: an unusual presentation of a cerebral aneurysm [^8baaa309]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebral aneurysms most commonly present with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a catastrophic event. However, 11–15% of unruptured aneurysms are symptomatic, with presentations including seizures, unilateral cranial nerve deficits, visual loss, headache, and ischemia. Of patients presenting with seizures, the semiology described includes speech arrest, "feelings of dread", localized pins and needles, and tonic clonic episodes. We report the case of a patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complex partial seizures secondary to a cerebral aneurysm.

Case Report

A 54-year-old woman presented to the ED after an episode where she had noticed a "bad smell" and sensations of nausea and dizziness. This was the third episode she had experienced in 2 weeks, and other than migraine, she had no significant medical or family history. Physical examination was normal, but a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed a 15-mm aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery. The patient was subsequently transferred for urgent neurosurgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The emergency physician should strongly consider the use of head CT in the evaluation of adults presenting with a first unprovoked seizure, as rarely they can be caused by urgent pathologies including cerebral aneurysms. If a patient is found to have a possible symptomatic unruptured aneurysm, they should be referred for urgent neurosurgical consultation, as these lesions have an increased risk of rupture.

### The autoantibody-mediated encephalitides: from clinical observations to molecular pathogenesis [^4e62751a]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

LGI1-antibody encephalitis is most common in the elderly with a significant male preponderance. There is an annual incidence of approximately 1–2 per million per year (Irani and Waters, unpublished observations). Genetic studies have shown that around 90% of patients with LGI1 antibodies from both Caucasian and Asian cohorts carry the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB*07:01.

The two cardinal clinical features of LGI1-antibody encephalitis are seizures and cognitive impairment. The pathognomonic seizure syndrome for this condition is termed faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) and has only been recognised in association with LGI1 antibodies to date. This specificity may be akin to the stereotyped complexity of movement disorders and psychopathology closely associated with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. FBDS refer to brief stereotyped events, most commonly involving the hemiface and ipsilateral arm which occur at a median of 50 times per day at disease nadir. They are associated with classically epileptic ictal features such as speech arrest, agitation, fear, and automatisms. FBDS often precede the development of the cognitive impairment seen in patients with LGI1 antibodies which predominantly involves episodic memory and executive function. Other frequent focal seizure semiologies which may occur concurrently with, or in the absence of FBDS, include thermal sensations, body shuddering, motor automatisms, gelastic seizures, and paroxysmal dizzy spells. Generalised tonic–clonic seizures are uncommon and usually manifest in the later stages of disease. Importantly, focal seizures — in particular FBDS — are often the first feature of this illness. Hence, their early clinical recognition is paramount prior to the development of a fulminant encephalitic syndrome.

### Three-and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy [^3cef07d6]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

We have provided 3-D and 4D mapping of speech and language function based upon the results of direct cortical stimulation and event-related modulation of electrocorticography signals. Patients estimated to have right-hemispheric language dominance were excluded. Thus, 100 patients who underwent two-stage epilepsy surgery with chronic electrocorticography recording were studied. An older group consisted of 84 patients at least 10 years of age (7367 artefact-free non-epileptic electrodes), whereas a younger group included 16 children younger than age 10 (1438 electrodes). The probability of symptoms transiently induced by electrical stimulation was delineated on a 3D average surface image. The electrocorticography amplitude changes of high-gamma (70–110 Hz) and beta (15–30 Hz) activities during an auditory-naming task were animated on the average surface image in a 4D manner. Thereby, high-gamma augmentation and beta attenuation were treated as summary measures of cortical activation. Stimulation data indicated the causal relationship between (i) superior-temporal gyrus of either hemisphere and auditory hallucination; (ii) left superior-/middle-temporal gyri and receptive aphasia; (iii) widespread temporal/frontal lobe regions of the left hemisphere and expressive aphasia; and (iv) bilateral precentral/left posterior superior-frontal regions and speech arrest. On electrocorticography analysis, high-gamma augmentation involved the bilateral superior-temporal and precentral gyri immediately following question onset; at the same time, high-gamma activity was attenuated in the left orbitofrontal gyrus. High-gamma activity was augmented in the left temporal/frontal lobe regions, as well as left inferior-parietal and cingulate regions, maximally around question offset, with high-gamma augmentation in the left pars orbitalis inferior-frontal, middle-frontal, and inferior-parietal regions preceded by high-gamma attenuation in the contralateral homotopic regions. Immediately before verbal response, high-gamma augmentation involved the posterior superior-frontal and pre/postcentral regions, bilaterally. Beta-attenuation was spatially and temporally correlated with high-gamma augmentation in general but with exceptions. The younger and older groups shared similar spatial-temporal profiles of high-gamma and beta modulation; except, the younger group failed to show left-dominant activation in the rostral middle-frontal and pars orbitalis inferior-frontal regions around stimulus offset. The human brain may rapidly and alternately activate and deactivate cortical areas advantageous or obtrusive to function directed toward speech and language at a given moment. Increased left-dominant activation in the anterior frontal structures in the older age group may reflect developmental consolidation of the language system. The results of our functional mapping may be useful in predicting, across not only space but also time and patient age, sites specific to language function for presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy.

### Foreign language ictal speech automatisms in nondominant temporal lobe epilepsy [^54ebbffd]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Foreign language ictal speech automatism (FLISA) is a rare ictal sign that has been hitherto reported in five unilingual patients, all right handed men with right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), only one of whom has benefited from an intracerebral EEG investigation.

Methods

We report three unilingual French patients who consistently presented English spoken ictal speech automatisms and were investigated with intracerebral EEG recordings.

Results

All three patients were right-handed men with nondominant TLE originating in the right amygdala. However, FLISA only occurred when the ictal EEG discharge spread to the ipsilateral temporal neocortex or frontal operculum. In addition, FLISA were emotionally salient, referring to the patient's parents or to the intensity of the ongoing seizure.

Conclusion

Our findings, together with previously published data, suggest that foreign language ictal speech automatisms are more likely to occur in men with nondominant amygdala onset seizures, an observation that might reflect the sexual dimorphism observed in the right amygdala during emotional processing.

### Abstract… [^a13a76a9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

In generalized onset seizures, abnormal electrical activity initiates throughout the brain. These types of seizures always include loss of awareness. 1 Focal onset seizures begin in one area of the brain, although they may generalize to involve the entire brain and may or may not include loss of awareness. 1 Motor symptoms can include the classic tonic-clonic movements as well as myoclonus or atonic seizures. 1 Nonmotor symptoms of seizures may include emotional, sensory, and cognitive changes, or a lack of movement due to absence seizures.

1. PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are seizure-like symptoms without abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They have psychological origins and have also been called pseudoseizures. The diagnostic standard for PNES is video-electroencephalography monitoring during typical seizure-like activity.

23 PNES does not rule out neurologic seizures, because PNES can coexist with neurologic seizures and epilepsy. In one study of more than 2, 000 people with refractory epilepsy, 32% had PNES on video-EEG monitoring. 24 In the same study, 5% of people diagnosed with PNES had epilepsy, and 2% were diagnosed with both.
24. HISTORY In addition to the patient's recollection of events, witness statements are essential. Seizure is more likely if tongue biting, head turning or twisting, limb jerking, or urinary incontinence occurred. Prodromal symptoms, such as déjà vu, mood changes, hallucinations, confusion, or post-event amnesia, also increase the likelihood of seizure. Factors that suggest diagnoses other than seizure include chest pain, nausea, dyspnea, palpitations, and presyncopal symptoms such as lightheadedness, tunnel vision, and dizziness. 7, 16.

EEG should be done only in patients whose clinical presentation is consistent with a possible seizure, such as witnessed tonic-clonic movements, a postictal period, and evidence of tongue biting or other indicative physical examination finding. In approximately one-half of patients with a first seizure, an EEG abnormality is identified. EEG abnormalities are also found in 4% of patients without seizure. 7 EEG cannot rule out seizure in a patient who had unwitnessed loss of consciousness. Normal EEG results do not eliminate epilepsy because up to 10% of patients with epilepsy initially have a normal EEG. 7.

### Hemifacial motor and crying seizures of temporal lobe onset: case report and review of electro-clinical localisation [^fbee5dce]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of temporal lobe epilepsy with clinical presentation of paroxysmal episodes of "tightness" over the right hemiface, and ictal crying, and review electroclinical localisation of this phenomenon.

Methods

Clinical semiology, neurophysiological localising tests, and epilepsy surgery outcome are reported in a subject presenting with paroxysmal right hemifacial movements and ictal crying. Pertinent past reports of somato-motor signs and ictal crying in temporal lobe epilepsy are reviewed and the findings correlated with proposed human facial cortical representation.

Results

Simple partial seizures caused by temporal lobe epilepsy presented with right sided tonic facial movements and ictal crying. Intracranial EEG monitoring documented a left medial temporal onset of seizures that remained asymptomatic until they propagated to the left cingulate region. Anterior temporal lobectomy with resection of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus resulted in cessation of seizures.

Conclusions

This is a rare example of epileptic seizures of medial temporal onset presenting with isolated somato-motor manifestations and ictal crying. Anatomical-electrical-clinical correlations with cortical regions controlling facial movements were highly suggestive that this case represents secondary activation of "emotional" motor cortex M3 and M4 (rostral and caudal cingulate motor cortex), giving rise to focal hemifacial movements and ictal crying.

### ILAE classification and definition of epilepsy syndromes with onset in neonates and infants: position statement by the ILAE task force on nosology and definitions [^99708cdf]. Epilepsia (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on neonatal seizures:

- **Definition**: Neonatal seizures are abnormal electrical discharges in the brain of a newborn, typically occurring within the first 28 days of life, often with an acute brain injury or insult.
- **Pathophysiology**: Neonatal seizures arise when normal asynchronous cortical activity becomes synchronous, detected on electroencephalography as spike-and-slow-wave patterns. This aberrant firing often reflects a combination of enhanced neuronal connectivity, heightened excitatory transmission, and failed inhibitory mechanisms, all of which are influenced by developmental factors such as transient overexpression of glutamate receptors and the immature expression of GABA receptors. Most common causes of neonatal seizures are hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, infections, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Other causes may include hypoglycemia, CNS infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain malformations, metabolic disorders, genetic causes (such as mutations in KCNQ2, STXBP1, SCN2A, PNKP, ARX genes), and drug withdrawal syndrome.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of neonatal seizures is estimated at 1–5 per 1,000 live births in full-term neonates and 14 per 1,000 in preterm neonates.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for neonatal seizures include smoking during pregnancy, nulliparity, advanced maternal age, increased maternal BMI, diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, maternal fever, chorioamnionitis, shoulder dystocia, placental abruption, assisted vaginal delivery, induced labor, and occiput posterior position at birth.
- **Disease course**: Seizures may present clinically or be detectable only on electroencephalography (subclinical). Seizure activity often begins focally but may generalize and involve the entire body. The clinical presentation varies widely depending on gestational age, underlying etiology, and concurrent medical conditions. Clinical seizures can include automatisms, clonic, myoclonic, or tonic seizures, epileptic spasms, autonomic seizures, behavioral arrest, sequential seizures, and other unclassified seizure types.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Neonatal seizures are associated with a 20% mortality rate and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, including worsened motor and cognitive function compared with neonates without seizures, as well as an increased risk of remote seizures and epilepsy.

Table 1
Clinical features of pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients presenting short neocortical seizures

Patient 1 (Fig. 8 A) is a 19-year-old man who suffered severe traumatic brain injury at six years of age from a sporting accident. The first recognized convulsive seizure occurred a few weeks later, and others followed every few months. Complex partial seizures consisting of fluttering of eyes, confusion and speech impairments also occurred frequently but were not initially recognized. They were later noted to occur several times per week and were found to be refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the ictal sites to be in left inferior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Patient 2 (Fig. 8 B) is a 31-year-old woman who sustained severe closed head injury, from a motor-vehicle accident, at age 2. Seizures were diagnosed at age 23. Typical complex partial seizures started with a period of staring and unresponsiveness, with head turning towards the right, which could be followed by body hemiclonic movements and tonic–clonic convulsions. Seizures were refractory to several anti-epileptic drugs. Invasive monitoring confirmed the onset of the typical complex partial seizures to be in the left lateral superior frontal region. The patient was seizure-free after surgery. Both Patients 1 and 2 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site as the longer complex partial seizures, which were distant from motor areas. These brief seizures were not reported by patients, nor were they associated with any detectable external behaviour, but were electrographically identical to the onset of the patient's longer complex partial seizures. Patient 3 (Fig. 8 C) was a 22-year-old man, with long standing developmental delay who suffered from as many as 100 complex partial or secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. Scalp video-EEG monitoring demonstrated typical focal seizures lasting > 1 min and with onset suspected to be in the left lateral frontoparietal neocortex. During ECoG monitoring, several of the patient's typical complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures were captured, but it also became clear that the patient suffered many shorter seizures manifested only by brief runs of right eye blinking ('twitching') that were often unnoticed by the patient but recognized by family members as the earliest signs of seizures. Additional surface skin EMG electrodes were placed peri-orbitally to the right eye to capture the earliest clinical manifestations of seizures. Eye-twitching episodes, lasting < 5 s, each correlated with brief discharges limited to a few contacts over the left sensori-motor cortex. The ECoG changes appeared to precede EMG changes by ∼200 ms. Patient 4 (Fig. 8 D) was a 47-year-old woman, with a history of perinatal infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory, and subsequent cerebral palsy with mild left spastic hemiparesis. The patient experienced two dozen complex partial seizures and two secondarily generalized tonic–clonic seizures per month. The seizures lasted > 1 min and were manifested by movements on the left side including left hand twitching and posturing. Scalp video-EEG monitoring captured multiple focal simple and complex partial seizures suspected to begin in the right lateral hemispheric neocortex. Invasive ECoG monitoring was carried out with additional skin surface electrodes placed over left forearm, upper arm, face and leg areas to identify the earliest clinical manifestations of the seizures. Monitoring showed typical complex partial seizures with onset in the contralateral primary motor cortex. The patient also had brief simple partial motor seizures with cortical ECoG signals lasting < 2 s with associated EMG activity from the contralateral pectoralis muscle. Both Patients 3 and 4 presented short electrographic seizures originating in the same ictal site, within sensory-motor areas, as the longer complex partial seizures. These brief seizures were similar in ECoG appearance to the initial portion of longer complex partial seizures, and were accompanied by evident ictal behaviour consisting of twitching of the corresponding contralateral muscles as confirmed by simultaneous skin-EMG recordings.

Epilepsy and seizure semiology

The median age of epilepsy onset was 3.4 months (range from 4 days to 18 months). About half of patients had epilepsy onset between 0 and 3 months (19/34), while the other half (15/34) had initial seizures between 3 and 18 months of life.

At the onset, most patients showed focal seizures (55.8%), followed by generalized epileptic spasms (44.1%) and tonic seizures (32.3%). Myoclonic seizures (11.7%) and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (5.8%) were less common. Focal seizures were characterized by both motor and non-motor components, and often included sudden awakening during sleep, fear, ictal eyes blinking, facial flushing, followed by asymmetrical tonic contraction or clonic seizures. Overall, 47% (16/34) of patients at the onset had more than one type of seizures among focal motor and non-motor seizures, tonic seizures, and epileptic spasms. Among patients with early-onset epilepsy (< 3 months), 73.6% (14/19) had focal motor seizures, followed by spasms in 8 patients (42.1%), and tonic seizures in 6 patients (31.5%). Whereas in cases with epilepsy onset after 3 months of life, tonic seizures were more frequent (53.3%, 8/15), as well as spasms (53.3%, 8/15). On note, generalized tonic clonic seizures were not reported in the early-onset group but in 2 of 15 patients within the group with 3–18-month seizure onset. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures, when not present at the onset, appeared later during lifetime (5.8% vs 23.5%). In our cohort of patients, HTSS or HTSS-like, even if occurring in different orders (i.e. first tonic seizures, then hypermotor phase and spasms, or hypermotor phase at last) was reported in 6/34 patients (17.6%) at any lifetime point. In 5 patients, HTSS or HTSS-like appeared at the onset, whereas in one patient, they occurred in the next phases of the disease. At the last long-term evaluation, focal seizures were confirmed to be the most frequent (50%), followed by spasms (38.2%), tonic seizures (26.4%), generalized tonic–clonic seizures (23.5%), and myoclonic seizures (2.9%).

### Singing seizures [^2980b32c]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Automatisms are commonly seen in epilepsy, either ictally or postictally. However, most automatisms are simple, with hand movements, mouth smacking, nose-rubbing, repetition of a single word, or coughing, grunting, or screeching. Complex automatisms are less common and striking. The authors report two cases of seizure-associated singing where song expression may be recognizable.

EEG: Standard: The EEG is recommended as part of the neurodiagnostic evaluation of the child with an apparent first unprovoked seizure. Neuroimaging studies: Guideline: If a neuroimaging study is obtained, MRI is the preferred modality; Option: Emergent neuroimaging should be performed on a child of any age who exhibits a postictal focal deficit that does not quickly resolve or who has not returned to baseline within several hours after the seizure. Option: Nonurgent imaging studies with MRI should be seriously considered in any child with a significant cognitive or motor impairment of unknown etiology, unexplained abnormalities on neurologic examination, a seizure of partial onset with or without secondary generalization, an EEG that does not represent a benign partial epilepsy of childhood or primary generalized epilepsy.

### Dazed and confused: altered mental status in an adolescent male [^4fb6fc9e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Absence status epilepticus (ASE) is a form of generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. ASE is characterized by impairment in consciousness, which can vary widely, making the diagnosis more difficult. The typical patient with ASE will be confused yet responsive and in a "trance-like state" with delayed speech, clumsy gait, and the ability to perform simple tasks after prompting. With treatment, typical ASE has an excellent prognosis and does not appear to be associated with significant neuronal damage.

Case Presentation

An 11-year-old boy with history of febrile seizures presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status without trauma or ingestion. His vital signs and physical examination were normal, with the exception of appearing intoxicated with sparse verbalization and inappropriate emotional responses. All laboratory results and imaging were unremarkable. While in the ED, his neurologic examination trended toward normal, returning almost to baseline. He was admitted to the hospital for video electroencephalogram, which revealed status epilepticus. After benzodiazepine therapy, epileptic electrical activity ceased and the patient's symptoms resolved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? ASE is a rare condition that is uncommonly described in the pediatric population. These patients are frequently misdiagnosed on initial presentation as their alteration in mental status can be easily confused with ingestion, trauma, psychiatric illness, or infectious etiologies. Overturning the long-standing emergency dogma of "if they're talking to you, it's not a seizure" is undoubtedly difficult, but both pediatric and adult providers should be aware of this clinical entity.

### Association between semiology and anatomo-functional localization in patients with cingulate epilepsy: a cohort study [^fdeba762]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Cingulate epilepsy (CE) is a rare type of focal epilepsy that is challenging to diagnose because of the polymorphic semiology of the seizures, mimicking other types of epilepsy, and the limited utility of scalp EEG.

Methods

We selected consecutive patients with drug-resistant CE who were seizure-free after surgery, with seizure onset zone (SOZ) confirmed in the cingulate cortex (CC) by histology or stereo EEG. We analyzed subjective and objective ictal manifestations using video recordings and correlated semiology with anatomical CC subregion (anterior, anterior middle, posterior middle, and posterior) localization of SOZ.

Results

We analyzed 122 seizures in 57 patients. Seizures were globally characterized by complex behaviors, typically natural seeming and often accompanied by emotional components. All objective ictal variables considered (pronation of the body or arising from a lying/sitting position, tonic/dystonic posturing, hand movements, asymmetry, vocalizations, fluidity and repetitiveness of motor manifestations, awareness, and emotional and autonomic components) were differently distributed among CC subregions (p < 0.05). Along the rostro-caudal axis, fluidity and repetitiveness of movement, vocalizations, body pronation, and emotional components decreased anterior-posteriorly, whereas tonic/dystonic postures, signs of lateralization, and awareness increased. Vestibular and asymmetric somatosensory, somatosensory, and epigastric and enteroceptive/autonomic symptoms were distributed differently among CC subregions (p < 0.05). Along the rostro-caudal axis, vestibular, somatosensory, and somatosensory asymmetric symptoms increased anterior-posteriorly.

Discussion

CE is characterized by a spectrum of semiologic manifestations with a topographic distribution. CE semiology could indicate which cingulate sector is primarily involved.

Case 3

A 49-year-old woman with no history of interest. Comorbidity: hypothyroidism and vitiligo. At age 24, she began having generalized tonic-clonic seizures during sleep. After those, other stereotyped seizures that began with epigastric knots, speech arrest, and loss of awareness. Sometimes the autonomic symptoms are more profuse, with anguish, fear, and other reflex seizures to musical stimulation that implies an emotion with the same semiology.

Antiseizure treatment was started with different strategies, controlling generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but not focal seizures. Approximate cadence of 18 seizures per month that worsen with menstruation.

Treatment with CNB was started with the usual dose escalation schedule, up to 150 mg per day. An approximate reduction of 94% in the number of seizures was achieved after 4.5 months of follow-up.

Case 4

A 43-year-old woman, with no antecedents of interest, who had a first generalized tonic-clonic seizure during sleep at the age of 24. A few months later, she began to present with psychic and dyscognitive seizures with loss of awareness, sometimes in a clustered way, which have been repeated with a frequency of 2–3 a week despite the different treatments. She has been developing a mild-moderate cognitive impairment, mainly in episodic and declarative memory. In October 2022, CNB treatment was added in the usual scheme of ascending regimens up to 100 mg, with a 90% reduction in the number of seizures in the last 3 months.

Case 5

A 37-year-old woman with no relevant antecedents at the age of 12 years with focal seizures with loss of awareness and a semiological profile of medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Psychiatric comorbidity includes psychotic episodes and somatic comorbidity with type I diabetes mellitus and seropositive myasthenia gravis. At age 20 years, she underwent a right temporary lobectomy without benefiting from seizure control.

Treatment with CNB was started with the usual dose escalation schedule, up to 200 mg per day. At 5 months of onset, the patient has been seizure-free for the last 3 months.

### Medical management of… [^109e056b]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

5 Most authorities recommend that all patients who experience an unprovoked seizure undergo a brain imaging study in an effort to detect underlying cerebral lesions. In nonurgent cases, the imaging modality of choice is magnetic resonance imaging, since it is more sensitive than computed tomography in identifying these lesions. Vagus Nerve Stimulator The vagus nerve stimulator is a novel, non-pharmacologic treatment for epileptic patients whose seizures are uncontrolled by medication. The device was approved by the FDA in mid-1997 for implantation in patients over 12 years of age with medically refractory localization-related epilepsy. Under general anesthesia, a bipolar lead is wrapped around the left vagus nerve and tunneled to the infraclavicular region, where it is connected to a signal generator.

This signal generator delivers a precise pattern of stimulation to the vagus nerve; the parameters for stimulation are non-invasively programmed by the physician using a computerized programming wand. Typically, the device stimulates for 30 seconds every five minutes. In addition, by using a hand-held magnet the patient or a caregiver can manually activate the stimulator at the onset of a seizure with the goal of terminating the seizure before it escalates. Anterior temporal lobe resection is the most common procedure performed for the treatment of epilepsy. Since surgery often results in complete seizure control, studies of epilepsy surgery differ from medication trials in that they typically recognize complete control of seizures as a primary outcome measure. Since seizure control is the most important goal of surgery, the operation is considered a success if the patient becomes seizure-free, even if medication is still required.

Over time, the trend has gradually turned toward better surgical outcome in patients undergoing anterior temporal resections. 27 Improved outcomes probably reflect the enhanced ability to localize epileptogenic tissue with modern imaging and EEG techniques. Currently, 80 percent of all patients undergoing temporal lobe resections at our center become seizure-free. Furthermore, patients with evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis on MRI have a prospect for a seizure-free outcome that is greater than 90 percent.
28. Most patients undergoing seizure surgery are young and otherwise healthy, which probably explains the low rates of surgical morbidity. Permanent, severe deficits related to the surgery are rare. However, subtle changes in verbal skills, especially naming, are sometimes present postoperatively in a minority of patients undergoing language-dominant temporal lobe resections. 30.

### New ways of looking at an old disease: the reimagination of epilepsy [^2ea55dad]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The reclassification of SE provides a more reasoned argument. Certainly, improved communication between healthcare professionals is needed in the emergency setting. However, this also highlights a limitation since it is directed at an audience most accepting of the proposed changes. It could be argued that the optimum target for reclassification should be Emergency Physicians who are more likely to encounter SE at presentation. Nevertheless, this more accurate guide to the description, semiology and aetiology of the seizure will undoubtedly aid management. Less helpful in the acute management (but more so with ongoing management) is an EEG correlate, an investigation that may not always be provided in a timely fashion.

### Functional seizures and their mimics: a retrospective service review of cases from a tertiary video telemetry database [^2e34e439]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

VTEEG also highlighted a group of 5 individuals (24%) with ES followed by a behavioural elaboration or functional overlay. These ES were brief, subtle and typically manifested with for example eyelid myoclonia, changes in facial expression, a brief pause in or loss of awareness or consciousness or head turning in the presence of EEG correlates. Their brevity and subtle nature meant witnesses had typically not noticed these features. The subsequent FS elaboration presented more obviously with features including irregular body jerks, head shaking, muddled speech and protracted periods of emotional upset. The elaborations typically followed the cessation of electrographic seizure activity. However, in one case, the unusual behaviour occurred during increased frequency of widespread polyspike waves of an absence seizure.

Another group of 4 cases (19%) highlighted the challenges in discerning whether periods of a dialeptic nature where an individual has a brief loss of pause in awareness or consciousness but without added signs were functional or epileptic from history alone.

Two cases (10%) had a historical but unsubstantiated diagnosis of epilepsy and had been referred because the current seizure burden was clearly functional in nature based on prior VTEEG recording of captured seizures and normal interictal findings. In both cases, it was clear from the documented available medical records that the patients had not had any documented seizures with clear epileptic features. In both cases, therefore, the pre-VTEEG diagnosis was thought to be one of FS, and the cases had been referred with this as the primary diagnosis with little credence given to the historical epilepsy diagnosis. Following ASM withdrawal, both subsequently experienced the emergence of new events, different in semiology to their FS, which were subsequently confirmed on VTEEG as epileptic, confirming a dual diagnosis.

In one case (5%), a diagnosis of FS was amended to insular epilepsy. Although this diagnosis had previously been made, it was revised to FS at a different centre due to the lack of ictal EEG correlates and poor response to ASMs. During our study, the stereotypy of the attacks, the associated bradycardia and successful response to a novel ASM implicated an epileptic aetiology.

### Movement disorders in sleep: guidelines for differentiating epileptic from non-epileptic motor phenomena arising from sleep [^5898adbc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Seizures, namely in certain epileptic conditions, may be precipitated by sleep. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy seizures, characterized by bizarre motor behaviour and autonomic activation, appear almost exclusively during sleep. The differential diagnosis between this condition and sleep-related non-epileptic paroxysmal motor phenomena, in particular the parasomnias, is arduous. Moreover, accepted criteria for the diagnosis of nocturnal frontal lobe seizures are lacking and even ictal scalp EEG recording could fail to disclose paroxysmal abnormalities. The clinical and polygraphic features of the different types of seizures in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and of the more common non-epileptic paroxysmal events during sleep are described. The main differentiating features characterizing nocturnal frontal seizures are: onset at any age, several attacks per night at any time during the night, brief duration (s) with stereotyped motor pattern. As video-polysomnographic recordings of the attack, the gold-standard for diagnosis, are expensive and not readily available everywhere, home-made video recordings may be helpful. Further investigations on pathophysiology, genetics and epidemiology are needed to clarify the relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic sleep related paroxysmal phenomena.

### Characteristics and neural correlates of emotional behavior during prefrontal seizures [^4782e16f]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to characterize clinical expression and intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of emotional expression during prefrontal epileptic seizures.

Methods

We performed a descriptive analysis of seizure semiology in patients explored with stereo-EEG (SEEG) for pharmacoresistant prefrontal epilepsy, using a semiquantitative score for seizure-related emotional behavior. Two independent observers scored occurrence and intensity of objective emotional features (face/body movements/vocalization/overall appearance), testing interobserver reliability. Intracerebral electrophysiological changes were documented. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) compared behavioral signs with neural SEEG correlates. For each patient, the clinical and anatomoelectrophysiological scores were established, based on a prototypical emotional seizure.

Results

Forty-two patients (469 seizures) were included. Interobserver correlation for emotional signs was satisfactory (kappa = 0.6–0.8). Prevalence of any subjective and/or objective ictal emotional phenomena was 79% (33/42); objective emotional signs occurred in 27 of 42 subjects (64%). Negatively valenced emotional semiology (ictal feeling of fear, defensive and/or aggressive behaviors) was much more prevalent than positively valenced, prosocial behaviors. Cluster analysis and PCA identified 4 groups with different occurrence of emotional signs and cerebral correlates. Two main clusters of negatively valenced behavior were identified: "active threat response", associated with seizure organizations involving posterior orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral and/or ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; and "passive fear", associated with amygdala, other mesial temporal structures, and posterior orbitofrontal cortex.

Interpretation

Emotional behaviors, especially fear/threat response, are common in prefrontal seizures, reflecting the role of the prefrontal cortex in emotional control. Different cortical seizure localizations were associated with "passive fear" and "active threat response" seizure behaviors at the group level. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:1052–1065.

### Acquired motor speech disorders in childhood epilepsy [^7283dbf7]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate a group of children with epilepsy and motor speech regression, with the aim of characterizing their speech disorders, electrographic features, and outcomes.

Method

Children referred to a tertiary developmental epilepsy clinic with epilepsy and motor speech regression were identified retrospectively. A clinical history was taken, and longitudinal speech and cognitive data were recorded. Speech samples were scored for severity and speech features. Seizure frequency and epileptiform discharges in the interictal electroencephalogram were analysed.

Results

Eighteen children (10 female) were evaluated, including seven with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and six with Rasmussen syndrome. Speech regression occurred at a mean age of 5years (SD = 2years 6months), which was concurrent with seizure onset or peak seizure burden in eight children. Speech features included dysarthria (n = 13), phonological errors (n = 7), and dyspraxia (n = 6). Electrographic abnormalities occurred most frequently in the left centrotemporal and right frontal regions. Among children who were followed up, intelligibility of speech was affected in 13 at baseline and seven at follow-up (p = 0.03). Expressive language standardized scores increased from a mean (SD) of 50.0 (11.3) to 91.4 (27.8) in children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (mean change = 41.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–82.8, p = 0.0498) and decreased from 75.2 (15.3) to 59.0 (9.8) in children with Rasmussen syndrome (mean change -16.2, 95% CI -9.0 to -23.4, p = 0.002) over the follow-up.

Interpretation

Motor speech disorders in epilepsy were severe, multifarious, and often fluctuated with seizure burden. Symptoms typically improved, especially in children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome, but rarely fully resolved.

### Anterior versus posterior insular epilepsy: correlations with semiology based on stereoelectroencephalography [^47ecc50e]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well-defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.

Methods

We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG-confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non-invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co-occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.

Results

A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior-to-posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (p = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (p = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (p = 0.1), blinking (p = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (p = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non-painful somatosensory aura (p = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (p = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.

Interpretation

We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo-electro-clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025.

### Dravet syndrome as epileptic encephalopathy: evidence from long-term course and neuropathology [^b7ff60ad]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical condition and evolution in adulthood

From onset in infancy, there was no period of seizure freedom recorded. In two patients, recognition of a false 'seizure-free period' in childhood led to anti-epileptic drug cessation, but increased seizure severity and frequency led to recommencement of anti-epileptic drugs, and in retrospect the parents could recognize subtle seizures had never ceased to occur. All patients had multiple anti-epileptic drugs with differential control of different seizure types (Table 2), but not complete seizure freedom.

Table 2
Anti-epileptic drug history

There was an evolution of seizure semiology and predominance of certain seizure types with time. There was no single pattern for seizure evolution for all patients.

All patients had multiple seizure types in adulthood (Table 1). For 10 patients, seizures were mostly nocturnal and comprised brief tonic or tonic–clonic seizures. Seizures were recorded in video-EEG telemetry for 10 adults; seizures observed were complex motor, dyscognitive, tonic or secondarily generalized with focal EEG onset pattern or no recognizable EEG change. Myoclonus was not prominent in adulthood, though its frequency may have been under-reported. No adult patient in our series had documented absences; all 'absence-like' (dyscognitive) seizures recorded in adulthood had focal EEG onset or no EEG change documented. Fever sensitivity persisted into adulthood, with even slight variations of temperature sufficient to trigger seizures in nine patients. No patient had any meaningful seizure-free period. Non-convulsive status epilepticus was documented with EEG on at least one occasion in seven patients. Triggers included inter-current infections and slight increases in body or ambient temperature.

Behavioural problems or 'autistic-like' features were observed at some time of the evolution in most patients in our series (Table 1).

At last follow-up, the oldest living patient was 60 years of age. Sixteen patients were in residential care; the remainder lived at home with support. Neurological deterioration continued throughout life in all patients, with further impairment of speech, mobility and ability for daily activities (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Kyphoscoliosis was documented in six patients. Cerebellar signs were found in five patients, pyramidal signs in seven and extra-pyramidal in four patients. Non-ictal urinary incontinence occurred late in the evolution. The majority (18/22) of adult patients had severe intellectual disability (as classified in) at last follow-up (Table 1).

### Presumed aetiologies and clinical outcomes of non-lesional late-onset epilepsy [^076525a4]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The present study has several strengths. First, the study was performed in a large, longitudinal and real‐life cohort of NLLOE patients with short‐term follow‐up (12 months). Secondly, only patients with a consistent diagnosis of NLLOE confirmed by specialized epilepsy teams were included. Thirdly, systematic clinical and paraclinical evaluations with NP and long‐term EEG were performed for all included patients. Fourthly, all data were collected prospectively, enhancing the ability to include a significant set of broad clinically relevant phenotypic variables.

Concerning the limitations of the study, first the inclusion of patients with NLLOE was certainly not exhaustive, whether due to misdiagnosis or simply because they never visited our hospital. Additionally, this investigation was conducted at a single tertiary referral centre in Nancy, France. It is possible that the NLLOE of our cohort would be more severe than that of NLLOE patients in general. These factors cause an unavoidable selection bias and limit the generalizability of our findings to other geographical settings. Secondly, missing data, particularly at paraclinical assessment and during follow‐up, could generate classification bias when forming and monitoring subgroups.

### Closing the diagnostic gap in epilepsy: recognizing more than just motor seizures [^82cba0bb]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

The weight and impact of the former factor on diagnostic delays sinks in with the recent findings of Pellinen et al. In a rigorous multicenter prospective observational study of new-onset focal epilepsy, the authors examined the seizure characteristics associated with diagnostic delays and the impact of untreated seizures prior to diagnosis. Patients were recruited within 4 months of initial treatment for a new diagnosis of focal epilepsy, underwent a structured seizure semiology interview, and retrospectively completed a seizure diary. Seizures were then classified as motor or nonmotor, based on the presence of any observable component, by 2 independent reviewers who reached complete concordance. The authors then correlated seizure characteristics (motor, or "observable," versus nonmotor) with time to diagnosis. Patients with nonmotor seizures prior to motor seizures had a 10-fold delay in obtaining a diagnosis, with a median time of over one and a half years from their first seizure to receiving a diagnosis of epilepsy. Among those with nonmotor seizures, two-thirds eventually experienced a motor seizure, which then led to a diagnosis within a median time of only two weeks. About 80% of the motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) reported prior to a diagnosis of epilepsy occurred among those with undiagnosed nonmotor seizures. In their discussion, the authors calculated an estimate of MVAs that may be occurring yearly as a result of undiagnosed nonmotor focal seizures. Using the known incidence of focal epilepsy, distribution of age of onset (compared to driving age), and this study's data, they came to the astonishing figure of 1816 MVAs every year in the United States. Although this study does not investigate other factors likely to play a significant role in diagnostic delays, such a social determinants of health, the weight of the impact of seizure characteristics on time to diagnosis is striking. Nonmotor seizures are therefore strongly correlated with significant delays in diagnosis and there is a serious risk associated with that delay.

### Three-and four-dimensional mapping of speech and language in patients with epilepsy [^ff9ce101]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Advantages and limitations of our 3D and 4D mapping techniques

The advantage of our ECoG study includes the capability of assessment of both temporal dynamics of neural modulation and stimulation-induced behavioural changes in the lateral, medial, and inferior surfaces of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres with an unprecedented large cohort. Our 4D map (Supplementary Video 1) may be useful for teaching purposes, since the spatial-temporal dynamics of cortical activation related to language processing is easy to digest. Our 3D maps (Fig. 3) provide reasoning for cortical activation at a given region and determined the causal roles of given cortical structures in speech, language and sensory-motor functions. We recommend assessment of region of interest analysis (Fig. 5) for readers to confirm the degree of high-gamma modulation at spatial voxels sampled by less than six patients (Fig. 1), where the mean amplitude changes were presented in a less robust manner. Not all patients underwent the same neuropsychological batteries; thus, we are unable to directly compare the intelligence quotients between the two age groups. Nonetheless, considering the tight association between a larger number of antiepileptic drugs and more severe seizure burden as well as related cognitive impairment, the present study failed to find objective evidence that the effect of epilepsy or antiepileptic medications on ECoG measurement differed between the two age groups. A prior study has shown that interictal spikes from a frontal lobe seizure onset zone may transiently alter ongoing language processing dynamics at nearby sites outside of the seizure onset; however, we excluded any trials associated with interictal spikes and our averaging technique and statistics would be expected to further minimize any influence upon our final results.

Our study was not designed to localize the regions involved in mapping visual onto semantic representations. Previous studies, with patients assigned naming tasks in both auditory and picture domains, reported that picture naming error was induced by stimulation of more posterior and basal temporal sites whereas auditory naming error by more anterior and lateral sites. Likewise, an ECoG study reported that picture naming elicited high-gamma augmentation specifically in portions of the left basal temporal region, whereas auditory naming in the left anterior superior-temporal gyrus. We currently plan to generate a 4D map of picture naming function, and compare the language networks in auditory and visual domains. We expect that such studies will localize the regions involved in semantic analysis in domain-specific and independent manners.

Functions affected during testing. Each coloured bar connects an electrode pair stimulated in patient P#04. Purple = language functions altered by stimulation. Red = motor and blue = sensory responses involving the mouth (a10–13) or mouth and face (c12–13). Green = no sensory or motor changes with stimulation. Green line with black dot = no sensory, motor or language changes with stimulation. The ampersand (&) at i12–j12 indicates where an aura occurred with stimulation. There were no other stimulation-induced functional changes or auras in this patient. Clinical considerations alone determined which electrodes to stimulate. We based functional localizations in all these patients upon responses occurring when stimulation did not produce afterdischarges. Heavy maroon circle edges indicate sites with interictal epileptiform discharges. Red filling within circles indicates sites showing epileptiform discharges at seizure onset. The columns were designated 1–13 for the top four rows (a–d), and 12–13 for the bottom, diagonal, rows (e–l). The top figure is a lateral view, and the bottom a basal view, of the brain. Anterior is left, posterior right. The patient was 13 years old, and her seizures began at age 6 years. She had seizures 4–5 times per month, including events characterized by clusters of 6–8 episodes, MRI had shown increased size and signal in the mesial temporal region on T2 imaging. She underwent a temporal lobectomy. Pathology showed hypercellularity. She was taking lamotrigine at the time of surgery. Previous medications included carbamazepine, gabapentin, phenytoin, tiagabine and valproate.

### Definition and diagnostic criteria of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy [^2f53fc40]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Statements regarding clinical features of SHE were formulated based on core literature consisting of studies of Class III level, or Class IV level.
SHE is characterized by the occurrence of brief (< 2 minutes) seizures with stereotyped motor patterns within individuals and abrupt onset and offset.
The most common clinical expression consists of "hypermotor" events.
Seizures of SHE occur predominantly during sleep; however, seizures during wakefulness may also occur.

SHE is a rare form of focal epilepsy, with an estimated minimum prevalence of 1.8/100,000 individuals, fulfilling the definition of rare disease.SHE affects both sexes, and involves sleep-related seizures with various motor manifestations. Seizure onset may be at any age with a peak during childhood and adolescence. Seizure frequency may be very high, with occurrence either every night or almost every night, usually many times per night. Clustering is characteristic but not obligatory for diagnosis. Seizures occur predominantly during sleep (and consequently most commonly during the night), primarily in non-REM (NREM) sleep and rarely during REM sleep. Seizures during active wakefulness may also occasionally occur during the patient's lifetime. The first occurrence of these seizures may precede, coincide, or follow the onset of sleep-related seizures.

### Expanded clinical phenotype spectrum correlates with variant function in SCN2A-related disorders [^17524671]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through a strategic collaboration, we extended the understanding of the genotype–phenotype associations for SCN2A -RD by systematically characterizing and analysing seizure and non-seizure phenotypes with detailed variant functional classifications. Our findings offer a more inclusive description of the phenotypic landscape and a more thorough evaluation of relationships between variant dysfunction and clinical features that can enable better stratification of affected individuals for inclusion in appropriate clinical trials.

Our approach: (i) refined the primary phenotype to reflect a more granular and developmentally focused approach to age at seizure onset; (ii) developed a separate characterization of non-seizure phenotype to reflect the concept of 'encephalopathy' independently of seizures; and (iii) systematically determined detailed functional properties of a large number of variants found in affected individuals.

Primary phenotype

The modified primary phenotype, which divided age at seizure onset into three developmentally salient groups, resulted in a four-level classification that provided meaningful discrimination between children with respect to the types of seizures and epilepsies and to their degree of non-seizure phenotype impairments and the variant function. This differs from the previous approach using < 3 months versus > 3 months for seizure onset and, importantly, tt disaggregates neonatal onset from infant onset from later onset and thus aligns with distinctions in common clinical practice for child neurology and epilepsy. The distribution of seizure onset after 1 year did not allow for further breakdowns into adequately sized groups for analysis, and almost 90% had experienced the first seizure by 2 years of age. In the epilepsies in general, the importance of age at seizure onset is paramount, with distinctions typically made between neonatal, infant and childhood seizure onset. From previous series of SCN2A -RD patients, these distinctions might not have been feasible; however, with the present sample (n = 81), it is clear that there is a neonatal cluster with onset at or very near birth. The only exception, a 34-week preterm infant whose seizure onset was delayed until 19 days, suggested that maturational catch-up to a critical neurodevelopmental period was required for seizure expression. Onset very near birth could also be consistent with prenatal seizure onset; however, reports so far are anecdotal. Prenatal seizures are difficult to diagnosis. Parents were asked about unusual or excessive activity of the fetus prior to birth as part of a medical checklist. Only two mothers endorsed this, and both had children with neonatal-onset seizures. More detailed questioning of mothers would be needed to determine whether abnormal fetal movements representing seizures might be detectable in utero.

### Functional seizures and their mimics: a retrospective service review of cases from a tertiary video telemetry database [^3db964dd]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Habitual events were recorded in 444 VTEEG reports, and the case notes of a total of 96 patients, where the outcome was that of an ES or both, were reviewed in order to ascertain the nature of the pre-EEG impression and whether a diagnostic revision had indeed occurred. In 21 (4.7%) cases, the diagnosis changed from FS to ES or an alternative paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction (figure 1). Several diagnostic revision groups were identified (figure 2) with a proportion of patients belonging to more than one category.

Figure 1
Percentage of patients that underwent a diagnostic revision from FS to ES/alternative paroxysmal cerebral pathology, in contrast to those whose diagnosis was unchanged or revised from ES to FS. FS, functional seizures; ES, epileptic seizures.

Figure 2
Identified functional seizure mimics.

Of the 21 cases, one group identified were eight individuals (38%) with frontal lobe seizures. This group included stereotyped bizarre hypermotor seizures often occurring during sleep in the absence of ictal EEG changes. These cases had been misdiagnosed as FS due to a previous lack of ictal EEG correlates, as well as the bizarre nature of the seizure, which had been labelled as functional in nature. In 10 patients (48%), most had no ictal EEG abnormalities present, but stereotyped seizures arose during EEG-defined sleep. There was significant overlap between this cohort and those within the frontal lobe seizure category. In patients whose semiologies were not clearly attributable to frontal lobe epilepsy, one individual had multiple stereotypical events from sleep characterised by abrupt waking, confusion, difficulty in breathing with laryngeal symptoms, including a feeling of choking, and severe headache. These stereotypical events also occurred during wakefulness, excluding parasomnias. It was proposed that there was likely a focal epilepsy with some frontal lobe/insular features but not enough evidence for a definitive localisation. The episodes resolved with antiseizure medications (ASMs). Another patient with a predisposing liability for seizures had episodes of jerking of the left arm followed by jerking of all four limbs. These had been captured on a shorter previous study and had no ictal correlates, with the semiology of the generalised jerking in keeping with FS. However, on subsequent longer VTEEG, it was noted that the subtle initial jerking also appeared while the patient was in EEG-defined sleep, and that there was subsequent behavioural elaboration. It was therefore postulated that despite the absence of ictal correlates because the initial onset of the event arose from sleep, this suggested the aetiology was a focal epilepsy.

### Awake craniotomy for resection of left temporal cavernoma: 3-dimensional operative video [^21d65fda]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Cavernomas presenting with seizures refractory to medical treatment may require surgical excision for seizure control. If superficial, they can be surgically accessible but can pose additional risks when located in or near eloquent cortex. In this 3D operative video we illustrate the technique for the resection of a left temporal cavernoma located near eloquent cortex for speech with awake surgery and cortical mapping to avoid a speech deficit postoperatively. Informed consent was obtained for this procedure. Navigation is used to localize the cavernoma following which a large craniotomy is performed exposing the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and sylvian vein. Bipolar stimulation is used to localize speech with the patient awake until speech arrest occurs. The cavernoma is situated immediately inferior to the sulcus over which speech arrest occurs. The sulcus immediately above the cavernoma is opened and adjacent arteries are carefully preserved. The glial plane around the cavernoma is used to dissect the cavernoma from the surrounding cortex. Care is taken to remove the haemosiderin as this can act as a precipitant for ongoing seizures. In this case the patient had no neurological deficits following surgery and was seizure free.

### Management of developmental speech and language disorders. part 2: acquired conditions [^b7c63937]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Many children who present with these acquired impairments of communication have a clear preceding event such as an acquired brain injury from a road traffic accident. Children often respond differently in this situation to adult presentations. They may have a period of mutism when the prognosis might look poor and yet they subsequently make rapid progress and recover speech. They have greater potential for neural plasticity and language recovery, although they often have persisting difficulties in oral and written language. Alternatively, there may be a presentation with a paroxysmal event such as a seizure or a period of depressed consciousness, and the unusual behaviour that may accompany dysphasia and dysarthria may be misinterpreted in the child, whereas for the adult with the more common 'stroke-like' presentation, it would be immediately considered. Rarely the aphasia/dysphasia may itself be the paroxysmal event where actually recognising that the child's disrupted communication is the basis of any observed behaviours can be the greater challenge.

### Getting the best outcomes from epilepsy surgery [^310c1a32]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Patient Selection

Mesial TLE is the prototypical surgically remediable epilepsy syndrome. Others include discrete neocortical lesions such as focal cortical dysplasias and diffuse lesions limited to one hemisphere. Excellent outcomes can also be achieved in patients with multiple lesions, for example, tuberous sclerosis when one tuber is the source of seizures. The best prognostic factor for a good outcome is a discrete structural lesion on MRI, in an area that can be safely removed, which conforms to the location of ictal EEG changes and is consistent with seizure semiology. Conversely, the occurrence of generalized tonic–clonic seizures, a normal MRI, extratemporal onset, psychiatric comorbidity, and learning disability reduce the chances. 11

Objective Signs and General Seizure Characteristics

Every identified sign is depicted in Figure 3 (seizure‐free patients) and Figure S1 (all patients), including the relative temporal timing of the sign within each patient's seizure event. The most common objective manifestations included tachycardia (60%); orofacial elementary motor (55.6% symmetric, 31.1% asymmetric); unilateral arm/hand elementary motor (48.9%); other autonomic signs such as hypersalivation or deep breathing (37.8%); laryngeal signs such as gasping or reactionary reaching for mouth/throat (35.6%); restlessness with repeated repositioning (35.6%); hyperkinetic motor behavior (26.7%); integrated gestural motor behavior of the extremities (26.7%) or orofacial with chewing/swallowing (20%); repetitive blinking (24.4%); and grunting or moaning (26.7%). A total of 51.1% of patients had objective emotional manifestations, most often negative such as an appearance of pain, fear or disgust (35.6%). Other notable signs included axial tonic (20%) and bilateral asymmetric tonic posturing (BAT, 15.6%). Secondary generalized tonic–clonic seizures occurred in only 7 patients (15.6%), 5 of whom had the SOZ arising in the posterior insula.

### Functional mapping of movement and speech using task-based electrophysiological changes in stereoelectroencephalography [^914edba4]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has become the predominant method for intracranial seizure localization. When imaging, semiology, and scalp EEG findings are not in full agreement or definitively localizing, implanted SEEG recordings are used to test candidate seizure onset zones (SOZs). Discovered SOZs may then be targeted for resection, laser ablation, or neurostimulation. If an SOZ is eloquent, resection and ablation are both contraindicated, so identifying functional representation is crucial for therapeutic decision-making. The authors present a novel functional brain mapping technique that utilizes task-based electrophysiological changes in SEEG during behavioral tasks and test this in pediatric and adult patients.

Methods

SEEG was recorded in 20 patients with epilepsy who ranged in age from 6 to 39 years (12 female, 18 of 20 patients < 21 years of age) and underwent implanted monitoring to identify seizure onset. Each performed 1) visually cued simple repetitive movements of the hand, foot, or tongue while electromyography was recorded; and 2) simple picture-naming or verb-generation speech tasks while audio was recorded. Broadband changes in the power spectrum of the SEEG recording were compared between behavior and rest.

Results

Electrophysiological functional mapping of movement and/or speech areas was completed in all 20 patients. Eloquent representation was identified in both cortex and white matter and generally corresponded to classically described functional anatomical organization as well as other clinical mapping results. Robust maps of brain activity were identified in healthy brain, regions of developmental or acquired structural abnormality, and SOZs.

Conclusions

Task-based electrophysiological mapping using broadband changes in the SEEG signal reliably identifies movement and speech representation in pediatric and adult epilepsy patients.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for adults — Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is graded across domains, with ICE (Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy) score ranges of "7–9" (grade 1), "3–6" (grade 2), "0–2" (grade 3), and "0 (patient is unarousable)" (grade 4). Depressed consciousness progresses from "Awakens spontaneously" to "Awakens to voice," "Awakens only to tactile stimulus," and then "Patient is unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse; stupor or coma." Seizure criteria advance from "Any clinical seizure… or non-convulsive seizures on EEG… resolve with intervention" to "Life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5min), repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between." Motor findings for grade 4 include "Deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraplegia," and cerebral edema escalates from "Focal/local edema on neuroimaging" to "Diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging, decerebrate or decorticate posturing, cranial nerve VI palsy, papilledema, or Cushing's triad." ICANS grade "is determined by the most severe event not attributable to any other cause," with the note that "a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia" but "may be classified as grade 4 ICANS if unarousable." Tremors/myoclonus "may be graded according to CTCAE V5.0, but they do not influence ICANS grading," and "Intracranial hemorrhage… is excluded from ICANS grading."

### Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures in early Huntington's disease [^61f9725f]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by motor dysfunction with involuntary movements and loss of voluntary control, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric problems. We report a 51-year-old man with early HD who experienced stereotyped episodes of repetitive, purposeless complex movements and unresponsiveness. His neurological examination was compatible with HD as were all investigations. We diagnosed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. While seizures are common in juvenile-onset HD, they are no more prevalent in adult-onset HD than in the general population. However, neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in HD and can involve a number of different complaints. Patients may experience dissociative attacks soon after manifesting a HD diagnosis. Such episodes can be managed with patient and carer education, cognitive behavioural therapy and anxiolytic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Cerebral reorganization in pediatric patients indicates that the topography of language and, to a lesser extent, motor sites may be altered, and children with developmental pathology are more susceptible to having atypical functional representation. Specifically, language sites may sometimes overlap with developmental lesions such as cortical dysplasia or polymicrogyria or be displaced by encephaloclastic lesions with reorganization depending on lesion nature, location, size, age of occurrence, and chronicity; some patients with atypical language distribution may have more than one discrete area of language representation particularly in the temporal lobe; anterior displacement of temporal language sites or right hemispheric language dominance may be seen with left handedness and earlier age of seizure onset; and naming sites may have a distributed topography and predominance in posterior language area in children with lower IQ.

ASTCT ICANS consensus grading for children defines grade-specific criteria across neurotoxicity domains. ICE score (age ≥ 12 years) thresholds are 7–9 for grade 1, 3–6 for grade 2, 0–2 for grade 3, and 0 (patient is unarousable) for grade 4, while CAPD score (age < 12 years) uses 1–8 for grade 1, 1–8 for grade 2, ≥ 9 for grade 3, and "Unable to perform CAPD" for grade 4. Depressed level of consciousness progresses from "Awakens spontaneously" (grade 1) to "Awakens to voice" (grade 2), "Awakens only to tactile stimulus" (grade 3), and "Unarousable or requires vigorous or repetitive tactile stimuli to arouse" (grade 4). For seizures, the table lists N/A for the first two grade columns, grade 3 as "Any clinical seizure focal or generalized that resolves rapidly or non-convulsive seizures on EEG that resolve with intervention," and grade 4 as "Life-threatening prolonged seizure (> 5min), repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without return to baseline in between." Motor weakness is N/A for the first three grades, with grade 4 including "Deep focal motor weakness such as hemiparesis or paraparesis." Elevated ICP/cerebral edema is N/A for the first two grades, with grade 3 "Focal/local edema on neuroimaging" and grade 4 "Diffuse cerebral edema on neuroimaging; decerebrate or decorticate posturing, cranial nerve VI palsy, papilledema, or Cushing's triad." ICANS grade is determined by the most severe event not attributable to any other cause and should consider baseline ICE or CAPD scores; a patient with an ICE score of 0 may be classified as grade 3 ICANS if awake with global aphasia, but may be grade 4 if unarousable.

### Lesion and lesion network localization of dysnomia after epilepsy surgery [^7f514baa]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Another finding we wish to highlight is the improvement in naming performance observed after right temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that showed significant improvement in naming performance after right temporal lobectomy, possibly because naming is less commonly studied in association with right hemisphere surgery. Possible explanations for this include fewer epileptiform discharges, less frequent seizures, fewer side effects of seizure medications or, most likely, some combination of these factors. A few studies investigated the effect of right temporal lobe resection on visual naming, with findings indicating no significant change in BNT performance, or in the naming of living and non-living entities.

Our study has limitations. The study included a wide range of patients in terms of onset of epilepsy, age at the time of surgery, and there was variable timing after surgery for assessing naming, ranging from 3 months up to 9 years. We focused on the BNT and did not include other categories of visual naming (e.g. famous faces, landmarks) or other modalities (e.g. auditory naming). While BNT is a validated tool to assess naming, it is not sensitive to naming deficits that can be overcome within 20 s, even though this latency may be quite disruptive to the normal use of language. Further, we used correlation of observed and predicted naming to assess out-of-sample model performance, but it may be possible in future studies to include cohorts with comparable changes in naming performance and assess the predictive performance of numeric changes in naming performance. In addition, future studies could evaluate the utility of network disconnection information acquired directly from the patients, which may explain additional variance in outcomes beyond what is possible using normative data. In addition, our study did not distinguish whether the decline in naming ability after left temporal lobe surgery is due to impairments in concept identification (semantic) or word retrieval (lexical), or a combination of the two.

### Presumed aetiologies and clinical outcomes of non-lesional late-onset epilepsy [^4c87c558]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Unlabelled subtype

Unlabelled subtype patients were younger and healthier than MVS and NDS patients at diagnosis, with fewer comorbidities and less brain damage on brain imaging. A lot of ULS patients presented typical temporo‐mesial‐type seizures (29.9%) or transient amnesia‐type seizures (17.9%). Our ULS patients probably included older patients classically described in the literature as suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and, particularly, those with transient epileptic amnesia (TEA). Indeed, the clinical phenotype of our ULS patients is similar to the TEA phenotype reported in the literature: 62 years old on average at seizure onset without comorbidities and with the absence of lesions on brain imaging in 93.1% of cases.

Short‐term epilepsy outcomes

One of the most striking findings was the excellent seizure outcomes at 1 year of treatment with ASM. Ninety‐five per cent of our patients treated with ASM were seizure‐free, including 99.2% with monotherapy. Previous studies have shown that seizures in older patients responded well to ASM with efficient seizure control in approximately 80% of older adults. Seizures were more difficult to control in NDS than in the other groups. This finding is consistent with that of a previous study showing that, in 89 patients with NLLOE, the seizure‐free rate at 12 months was significantly lower in patients with comorbid dementia. Most ASMs are effective at low doses in treating typical seizures in older adults. Therefore, these results highlight that the first ASM should be started at a lower dose with slow titration for better tolerance in older patients. If the first ASM is not well tolerated or ineffective, another should be rapidly substituted to avoid polytherapy.

Syncope versus epileptic seizure — historical and eyewitness features help distinguish the cause of transient loss of consciousness: In epilepsy movements last ~1 min whereas in syncope they are seconds, and in syncope movements only occur after the onset of unconsciousness and after the fall. Syncope is usually triggered; epilepsy rarely is. A tongue bite is more common in epilepsy and is on the side of the tongue whereas it is the tip in syncope, and urinary incontinence occurs in both. Post-event recovery differs, with patients may be confused post-ictally a long time in epilepsy versus syncope where clearheadedness is usually immediate. Table 13 adds that with seizure tonic–clonic movements are usually prolonged and their onset coincides with loss of consciousness, whereas with syncope they are always of short duration (< 15 s) and they start after the loss of consciousness.

### Anterior versus posterior insular epilepsy: correlations with semiology based on stereoelectroencephalography [^c4f6b05f]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize insular seizure semiology and correlate with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure onset in a well‐defined cohort, in particular examining differences between anterior and posterior insular seizures.

Methods

We documented all semiological signs and the timing of emergence for 45 patients with SEEG‐confirmed insular epilepsy, along with the precise location of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) within the insula. Semiological signs and other non‐invasive data were compared between those with anterior and posterior insula SOZ, with more detailed insular subregion description when appropriate. Co‐occurrence patterns of insular semiological signs were also investigated.

Results

A total of 87% reported auras and the corresponding insular SOZ demonstrated an anterior‐to‐posterior gradient by aura type. The absence of aura was significantly associated with an anterior insula SOZ (p = 0.01). Late grunting/moaning (p = 0.07), symmetric mouth elementary motor (p = 0.1), blinking (p = 0.05), and chewing/repetitive swallowing (p = 0.09) also suggested an anterior insula SOZ. Unilateral non‐painful somatosensory aura (p = 0.07) and early arm/hand elementary motor (p = 0.1) suggested a posterior insular SOZ.

Interpretation

We report the characteristics and semiological features in a large cohort of primary insular epilepsy patients. The type of aura is crucial for identifying the SOZ and the timing of semiological emergence contributes to the anatomo‐electro‐clinical localization of an insular SOZ. These findings can enhance identification of insular epilepsy, making targeted curative treatment feasible. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1111–1124

A definition and classification of status epilepticus — report of the ILAE Task Force on Classification of Status Epilepticus

A standardised definition of SE has long evaded medical terminology with previous definitions relying on ambiguous phrases including a seizure as a "fixed and enduring condition", or one persisting for a "sufficient length of time." The authors of this paper have sought to provide a new definition of SE, with a stated goal of providing a structured terminology, but one which could evolve as advances in neurobiology and pathophysiology became apparent. The suggested terms consist of a time point (t 1) after which time a given seizure is considered to be "an abnormally prolonged seizure", and a second time point (t 2) after which time neuronal injury is thought to occur. This second time point provides a degree of impetus about how aggressive one should be in treating an abnormally prolonged seizure. The values of these time points vary depending on underlying seizure type.

This new classification of SE involves four axes: the semiology of the seizure, aetiology, EEG correlate, and the age of the patient. The goals of reclassification are to improve communication between healthcare professionals, improve treatment of patients, permit epidemiological studies, and guide basic research.

Comment. This paper follows on from the natural success of the earlier redefinition and reclassification of the epilepsies from the ILAE. However, it is important to stress that the new definition, by their own admission, is based upon incomplete evidence, and "considerable variation". Whilst they have allowed for the advent of future knowledge in the decision to include two time points, it may have been simpler to adopt a new single approach with the lowest common denominator. Classifying a generalised tonic–clonic seizure 'abnormally prolonged' after 5 min, but a focal motor seizure 'prolonged' after 10 min might appear pedantic since clinicians may not make this distinction in clinical practice. Furthermore, there may be concerns in the suggested guidance that a treating clinician has greater than 60 min before the onset of neuronal injury since it may promote a delay in treatment as a result of a perceived lack of urgency. Furthermore, in spite of these specific time frames, the authors acknowledge that the likelihood of damage is dependent on the location of the epileptic focus the intensity of the status, and the age of the patient.

### Practice parameter: evaluating a first nonfebrile seizure in children: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the Child Neurology Society, and the American Epilepsy Society [^399425c7]. Neurology (2000). Medium credibility.

First nonfebrile seizure in children — immediate evaluation emphasizes history and examination over routine tests. After stabilization, a physician must determine if a seizure has occurred and whether it is the first episode, and the determination is typically based on a detailed history provided by a reliable observer. A careful history and thorough physical examination may allow a diagnosis without need for other tests, and in many children they will provide adequate information regarding probable cause or the need for other tests including neuroimaging. No single clinical symptom can reliably discriminate between a seizure and a nonepileptic event, and studies of serum prolactin or creatine kinase levels indicate neither test is sufficiently reliable to be routinely useful. Unprovoked seizures occur in the absence of precipitating factors and their etiology may be cryptogenic, remote symptomatic, or idiopathic.

### Panayiotopoulos syndrome: a benign childhood autonomic epilepsy frequently imitating encephalitis, syncope, migraine, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis [^9a21654f]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is a common idiopathic childhood-specific seizure disorder formally recognized by the International League Against Epilepsy. An expert consensus has defined Panayiotopoulos syndrome as "a benign age-related focal seizure disorder occurring in early and mid-childhood. It is characterized by seizures, often prolonged, with predominantly autonomic symptoms, and by an EEG [electroencephalogram] that shows shifting and/or multiple foci, often with occipital predominance".

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide guidance for appropriate diagnosis and management of Panayiotopoulos syndrome.

Clinical Features

Autonomic epileptic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus are the cardinal manifestations of Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Autonomic seizures in Panayiotopoulos syndrome consist of episodes of disturbed autonomic function with emesis as the predominant symptom. Other autonomic manifestations include pallor (or, less often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, miosis), cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, incontinence of urine and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications of intestinal motility. In approximately one fifth of the seizures the child becomes unresponsive and flaccid (ictal syncope) before or often without convulsions. Cardiorespiratory arrest is exceptional. More-conventional seizure symptoms often appear after the onset of autonomic manifestations. The child, who was initially fully conscious, becomes confused and unresponsive. Eyes turn to one side or gaze widely open. Only half of the seizures end with brief hemiconvulsions or generalized convulsions. Convulsive status epilepticus is extremely rare. Autonomic symptoms may be the only features of the seizures. Half of the seizures in Panayiotopoulos syndrome last for > 30 minutes, thus constituting autonomic status epilepticus, which is the more common nonconvulsive status epilepticus in normal children. Two thirds of seizures occur during sleep.

Epidemiology

Panayiotopoulos syndrome probably affects 13% of children aged 3 to 6 years who have had 1 or more afebrile seizures and 6% of such children in the 1- to 15-year age group.

Diagnostic Tests

An electroencephalogram is the only investigation with abnormal results, usually showing multiple spikes in various brain locations.

Pathophysiology

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is probably the early-onset and Rolandic epilepsy the late-onset phenotype of a maturation-related benign childhood seizure-susceptibility syndrome. Ictal epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate autonomic disturbances and emesis, to which children are particularly vulnerable. The symptoms/sequence of autonomic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus in Panayiotopoulos syndrome are specific to childhood, and they do not occur in adults.

Prognosis

Panayiotopoulos syndrome is remarkably benign in terms of seizure frequency and evolution. Autonomic status epilepticus imparts no residual neurologic deficit. The risk of epilepsy in adult life seems to be no higher than in the general population. However, autonomic seizures are potentially life-threatening in the rare context of cardiorespiratory arrest, an area in which additional study is required. MISDIAGNOSIS: The clinical features of Panayiotopoulos syndrome are frequently mistaken as nonepileptic conditions such as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis. The consequence is avoidable misdiagnosis, high morbidity, and costly mismanagement.

Management

Education about Panayiotopoulos syndrome is the cornerstone of management. Prophylactic treatment with antiepileptic medication may not be needed for most patients. Autonomic status epilepticus in the acute stage needs thorough evaluation; aggressive treatment may cause iatrogenic complications including cardiorespiratory arrest.
