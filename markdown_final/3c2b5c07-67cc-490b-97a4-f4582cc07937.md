## Question

What size kidney stone warrants a referral to a urologist?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what size kidney stone warrants a referral to a urologist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about emergency features that mandate ED transfer rather than outpatient referral. Then, I should classify by stone location and size thresholds that influence spontaneous passage and procedural choices. Next, I will translate those thresholds into immediate versus routine urology referral versus primary care management. After that, I need to consider high-risk patient factors that lower referral thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm, verify measurement and imaging nuances, and incorporate data on asymptomatic stones and recurrence risk to ensure the plan is balanced and evidence-based [^1143mCBu] [^1148hBRF] [^1123ooAc].

> Let me first confirm which presentations are emergencies requiring ED transfer and urgent decompression, not outpatient urology referral, because missing these is the biggest safety risk. Infected obstructing stones, sepsis with hydronephrosis, anuria or acute kidney injury especially in a solitary kidney, and intractable pain or vomiting are urologic emergencies that warrant urgent drainage with stent or nephrostomy and postponement of definitive stone treatment, typically best initiated in the ED setting, and this is explicitly recommended by the AUA/Endourological Society surgical guideline and supported by emergency medicine reviews [^1143mCBu] [^116hCtoc].

> Next, I should classify by location because ureteral and renal stones behave differently, and size thresholds are not interchangeable between these sites. Ureteral stone passage is highly size-dependent with a steep drop-off in spontaneous passage beyond approximately 10 mm, and location also matters, with more cranial stones less likely to pass; although reported percentages vary, the consistent signal is that < 5 mm stones often pass, 5–10 mm stones pass less often, and > 10 mm stones rarely pass, a pattern supported by imaging-based prognostic studies and cross-guideline syntheses that also anchor renal stone interventional thresholds at about 20 mm overall and a lower success of SWL for lower pole stones > 10 mm [^113qiC4H] [^111uiv7C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to verify immediate urology referral triggers and separate guideline-mandated thresholds from expert consensus. Immediate urology referral is appropriate for ureteral stones > 10 mm given the very low likelihood of spontaneous passage and the need to plan definitive URS or SWL, for lower pole renal stones > 10 mm where AUA advises not offering SWL as first-line and alternative interventions must be weighed, for staghorn calculi that typically require PCNL, and for any stone with obstructive nephropathy or rising creatinine even without overt infection; while I initially considered stating that all renal pelvic stones > 15 mm mandate immediate intervention, I should correct that to say they carry higher progression risk and merit prompt specialist discussion rather than asserting a hard mandate, as that 15 mm renal pelvis risk point traces to a narrative review rather than a formal guideline threshold [^114P17o5] [^111yjKAT] [^113myxXt].

> I will now examine situations that warrant routine, non-urgent urology referral after a trial of conservative management. Ureteral stones 5–10 mm that have not passed after approximately 4–6 weeks of observation with medical expulsive therapy should be escalated to definitive treatment, aligning with AUA recommendations and primary care guidance, and asymptomatic renal stones around 10–15 mm or those demonstrating interval growth on surveillance deserve specialist input for shared decision-making regarding SWL, URS/RIRS, or continued observation, consistent with cross-guideline summaries and family practice recommendations for reimaging and escalation when size increases or symptoms persist [^114thHXV] [^1123ooAc] [^111uiv7C].

> Wait, let me verify what can be managed in primary care with structured follow-up so I do not over-refer. For likely distal ureteral stones < 5 mm without high-risk features, a short trial of analgesia plus an alpha-blocker with reimaging at about 14 days to assess position and hydronephrosis is acceptable, and for asymptomatic, non-obstructing renal stones < 10 mm, observation with ultrasound or KUB at 6–12 months and then annually is reasonable if reliable follow-up is assured, as supported by family practice guidance and EAU surveillance recommendations, with the caveat that patient preference and access to urgent care should temper the plan [^1123ooAc] [^1148hBRF].

> I should confirm which high-risk patient factors lower thresholds for referral because these can trump size alone. Referral earlier and at smaller sizes is prudent for solitary kidneys, CKD with eGFR < 60, diabetes or immunosuppression, pregnancy due to imaging constraints, pediatric patients, recurrent stone formers, bilateral or multiple stones, non-calcium stone types, and occupations where an acute stone could compromise public safety; the CUA 2022 guideline explicitly lists many of these as triggers for in-depth metabolic evaluation, underscoring that such patients benefit from coordinated urology and nephrology involvement, and ACR provides pregnancy-specific imaging pathways that reinforce specialist coordination [^117JqHcB] [^112vwgDG].

> Let me synthesize consensus thresholds into a pragmatic statement so it's easy to apply while acknowledging the evidence gradations. Ureteral stones > 10 mm, renal lower pole stones > 10 mm, and renal stones > 20 mm in general lean toward immediate urology referral for treatment planning, ureteral stones 5–10 mm transition to referral if they fail to pass by 4–6 weeks despite MET, and asymptomatic renal stones < 10 mm can be observed with scheduled imaging if low risk, always adjusting earlier for high-risk clinical contexts and shared decision-making about procedural versus observational approaches, which mirrors convergent recommendations from AUA and EAU guidances and supportive clinical reviews [^111yjKAT] [^114thHXV] [^1148hBRF].

> But wait, I need to ensure the decision algorithm is explicit and safety-first. First, screen for obstruction plus infection, anuria, or uncontrolled symptoms; if present, send to ED for urgent decompression and antibiotics as indicated, delaying stone treatment until stabilized, then involve urology without delay, per AUA Part II. Second, if stable, determine location and size; if ureteral > 10 mm, lower pole renal > 10 mm, or any renal > 20 mm, refer now for URS/RIRS, SWL consideration, or PCNL planning. Third, if ureteral 5–10 mm and no passage after 2–4 weeks with MET, refer for intervention. Fourth, reduce these thresholds in high-risk patients as above. Fifth, if low-risk and small, continue primary care management with scheduled imaging and education on red flags and hydration goals, documenting shared decisions throughout [^1143mCBu] [^114thHXV] [^1123ooAc].

> I should double-check imaging and measurement nuances because size drives these thresholds, and measurement variability can misclassify patients. CT can overestimate maximal diameter compared with caliper reference, and reconstruction parameters affect measurement; interobserver differences between radiology and urology reports are common and can alter management categorization, so when decisions hinge on a cutpoint like 10 or 20 mm, requesting review of source images, standardized windowing, or 3D/volume assessment can reduce error, and EAU endorses unenhanced CT with HU assessment when needed during planning, especially if composition may influence modality choice [^116fAuwB] [^115zMMDJ] [^116P58kz].

> Hold on, I should review the role of asymptomatic stones and recurrence risk so I don't over-rely on size alone. Emerging data suggest stone size by itself does not fully dictate symptom development or need for intervention, and many stones pass silently; nevertheless, asymptomatic stones can progress or pass with delayed presentation, and active surveillance with periodic imaging is endorsed by EAU, with counseling guided by recurrence tools such as the ROKS nomogram and by patient-specific risk factors, supporting the stance that surveillance is reasonable for small calyceal stones but vigilance is required [^1131ZUjD] [^1148hBRF] [^111r6Kba].

> Finally, let me reconsider and ensure alignment of procedure selection with thresholds once referral occurs, so that my advice dovetails with urologic planning. Lower pole stones > 10 mm are less favorable for SWL as first-line per AUA Part I, making URS/RIRS or PCNL more likely depending on burden and anatomy, and for renal stone burden > 20 mm, PCNL is generally preferred given superior stone-free rates, whereas ureteral stones that fail observation after 4–6 weeks can be addressed with URS or SWL, with the choice individualized by stone density, skin-to-stone distance, and patient priorities, consistent with AUA guidance and systematic comparisons of surgical approaches [^114P17o5] [^114thHXV] [^1169jmUJ].

Refer to urology for **kidney stones ≥ 10 mm** [^1123ooAc] or any size with obstruction, infection [^1143mCBu], a solitary kidney, or persistent symptoms. Stones 5–9 mm may be observed if asymptomatic and non-obstructing [^114thHXV]; refer if they cause symptoms, enlarge, or fail to pass with medical therapy [^1123ooAc]. Immediate referral is required for **obstructing stones with infection, a solitary kidney, or renal impairment** [^116hCtoc] [^1143mCBu].

---

## Stone size thresholds for urology referral

The size of a kidney stone is **a primary determinant of referral** to a urologist. The following thresholds are commonly used:

| **Stone size** | **Clinical scenario** | **Referral recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 5 mm | Asymptomatic, non-obstructing | Observation, no immediate referral |
| 5–9 mm | Asymptomatic, non-obstructing | Observation or referral if symptomatic, growing, or failing medical therapy |
| ≥ 10 mm | Any location | Referral to urologist for evaluation and management [^1123ooAc] [^114thHXV] |

---

Stones ≥ 10 mm have a low likelihood of spontaneous passage [^113qiC4H] and **typically require urologic intervention** [^114thHXV].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting immediate urology referral

Several scenarios necessitate **immediate referral** to a urologist, regardless of stone size:

- **Obstructing stone with infection**: Obstructing stones with suspected infection [^1143mCBu] require urgent decompression and antibiotic therapy [^116hCtoc].
- **Solitary kidney or renal impairment**: Stones causing obstruction in a solitary kidney or patients with pre-existing renal impairment require immediate referral.
- **Persistent symptoms or failure of medical therapy**: Stones causing persistent pain, hematuria, or failure to pass despite medical expulsive therapy warrant referral [^114thHXV].

---

## Imaging modalities for stone size assessment

Accurate assessment of stone size is **critical for determining referral need**. The following imaging modalities are commonly used:

- **Non-contrast computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for accurate stone size measurement and localization [^117GnFPB].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for initial assessment, particularly in pregnant patients [^112vwgDG] or those requiring radiation avoidance [^116P58kz].
- **Plain radiography (KUB)**: Limited accuracy, often underestimates stone size compared to CT [^117GnFPB] [^1142yVaP].

---

## Potential complications of delayed referral

Delayed referral to a urologist for larger kidney stones may lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Obstruction and hydronephrosis**: Leading to renal impairment or failure [^1162detZ].
- **Infection**: Potentially progressing to sepsis [^116hCtoc].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Increased risk of ESRD and other adverse renal outcomes [^1179z3i3] [^113Tumjb].
- **Persistent pain and reduced quality of life**: Significant morbidity and healthcare costs [^115TyouV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Patients with stones **≥ 10 mm should be referred** [^114thHXV] to a urologist for evaluation and management. Stones **5–9 mm** may be observed if asymptomatic and non-obstructing [^1148hBRF], but refer if they become symptomatic, enlarge, or fail to pass with medical therapy. Immediate referral is required for **an obstructing stone with infection, a solitary kidney, renal impairment, or persistent symptoms**.

### Kidney stones: Treatment and prevention [^1123ooAc]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common disorder, with an annual incidence of eight cases per 1,000 adults. During an episode of renal colic, the first priority is to rule out conditions requiring immediate referral to an emergency department, then to alleviate pain, preferably with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The diagnostic workup consists of urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for conditions requiring active stone removal, such as urinary infection or a stone larger than 10 mm. Conservative management consists of pain control, medical expulsive therapy with an alpha-blocker, and follow-up imaging within 14 days to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis.

Asymptomatic kidney stones should be followed with serial imaging and should be removed in case of growth, symptoms, urinary obstruction, reinfections, or lack of access to health care. All patients with kidney stones should be screened for risk of stone recurrence with medical history, basic laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Lifestyle modifications such as increased fluid intake should be recommended for all patients. Thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, or citrates should be prescribed for patients with recurrent calcium stones. Patients at high risk of stone recurrence should be referred for additional metabolic assessment, which can serve as a basis for tailored preventive measures.

### Size matters: a survey of how urinary-tract stones are measured in the UK [^1142yVaP]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

Stone size forms the basis of management pathways in patients with urolithiasis. We carried out a questionnaire-based audit to find out how stone size is routinely measured by radiologists in the UK. A series of 831 anonymous questionnaires concerning how stone size is assessed using four imaging modalities — plain abdominal radiograph (KUB film), intravenous urogram (IVU), ultrasound, and CT — were sent to 277 radiology departments. Following the survey, a substudy at our institution compared urologists (N = 10) and radiologists (N = 5) in estimating the size of a large (26 mm) and small (11 mm) calculus on KUB films.

Of the questionnaires, 425 were returned, and 421 were analyzed. Of these, 85% were from consultants, 14% from trainees/middle grades, and 1% "unspecified". In total, 92% of the respondents were radiologists (10% uroradiologists) and 8% urologists. Estimation of stone size ("guestimation") from KUB films and IVUs was used by 40% and 36% of radiologists, respectively, whereas graded rulers were used by 57% and 59%, respectively. For ultrasound scans and CT, electronic measurement was the favored method (81% and 73%), but guestimation was still used by 10% and 15%, respectively. When assessing the KUB films and IVU, 59% and 61% of urologists, respectively, also used guestimation. The substudy revealed a significant difference among radiologists in the accuracy of size estimation for the 11-mm stone (mean estimated size 9.6 mm; P = 0.02, one-sample t-test).

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^115TyouV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Kidney stones are a common health care problem, and their prevalence and incidence are increasing worldwide. The prevalence of kidney stones in the United States is estimated to be approximately 12% in men and 10% in women. Kidney stones can be extremely painful, relapse frequently, and cause enormous health care expenditure, excess morbidity, and reduced quality of life.

There are a variety of treatment options for kidney stones, including surgical intervention and conservative management. Despite satisfactory outcomes after intervention, the recurrence rate of kidney stones is high. Without specific treatment, the 5- and 20-year recurrence rates are 40% and 75%, respectively. Kidney stone recurrence is defined as the visible passage of a stone with or without accompanying typical symptoms, a stone requiring urological intervention for removal, or the appearance of new stones or enlargement of preexisting stones on radiological imaging. However, many stones pass without symptoms and aren't noticed by patients.

With the increased use of radiologic examinations and the promotion of regular health screening, the detection of asymptomatic kidney stones as incidental findings has become increasingly common. Although treatment indications for kidney stones are well established, the management strategy for small, nonobstructing, and asymptomatic kidney stones remains controversial. The latest European Association of Urology guidelines for urolithiasis recommend active surveillance with annual follow-up imaging for asymptomatic calyceal stones.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal as the initial or follow-up imaging for pregnant patients with acute-onset flank pain and suspicion of stone disease. It is advisable to consider color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance urography, or unenhanced CT in these patients.

### Guideline of the guidelines: Urolithiasis [^111Rmnga]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Low credibility.

We reviewed the latest guidelines on urolithiasis to highlight the commonalities and differences in the most important recommendations.

Most guidelines utilize a systematic review of literature and grade evidence to generate the appropriate recommendations and statements. Only the latest versions of guidelines were included in this review.

Four national and international guidelines were included, specifically those from the EAU (European Association of Urology), the AUA (American Urological Association)/ES (Endourological Society), the UAA (Urological Association of Asia), and the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). There are general similarities in the most important recommendations. The EAU guidelines provide the latest evidence updates.

### Qualitative review of clinical guidelines for medical and surgical management of urolithiasis: Consensus and controversy 2020 [^115pq7QM]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine major global guidelines addressing the medical and surgical management of urolithiasis. By comparing and contrasting the recommendations among the five most highly cited guidelines on stone disease, the aim was to highlight areas of consensus and ongoing controversy. This underscores the need for further studies to provide higher levels of evidence.

- **Materials and methods**: The study reviewed the American Urological Association's 2019 medical and 2016 surgical guidelines, the 2016 Canadian Urological Association guidelines, the 2020 European Association of Urology guidelines, the 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, and the 2019 Urological Association of Asia guidelines. Tables correlating guideline statements by topic were created, and a comparative analysis was conducted to ascertain consensus and discordance.

- **Results**: The analysis of recommendations revealed a high consensus regarding the medical management of stones between the American Urological Association, Canadian Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and Urological Association of Asia guidelines. For surgical management, there is a high consensus on the treatment of ureteral stones, which includes medical expulsive therapy using alpha blockers, not prestenting for uncomplicated ureteroscopy, and employing either ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy as first-line treatments. This agreement is notably high among the American Urological Association guidelines.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^116QfTgf]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

All decision trees were analyzed and compared to each other to determine consensus or discrepancies between each possible combination of parameters using web-based software (Diagnostic Nodes), as described previously. To evaluate discrepancies, a combined tree containing all recommendations was generated. A mode tree was also generated to identify the most common combination of recommendations for each possible situation.

Consensus was defined as complete overlap between the recommended treatments for any case. If all guidelines recommended only one therapy for a specific situation, agreement was 100%. However, if three of six guidelines recommended therapy A only, and the others therapy A or B, this resulted in only 50% agreement for therapy A.

In addition to comparing all guidelines, the two international and most frequently cited guidelines issued by the EAU and AUA were separately compared to highlight discrepancies or areas of consensus.

### The ROKS nomogram for predicting a second symptomatic stone episode [^111r6Kba]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients with first-time kidney stones undergo limited evaluations, and few receive preventive therapy. A prediction tool for the risk of a second kidney stone episode is needed to optimize treatment strategies. We identified adult first-time symptomatic stone formers residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1984 to 2003 and manually reviewed their linked comprehensive medical records through the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Clinical characteristics in the medical record before or up to 90 days after the first stone episode were evaluated as predictors for symptomatic recurrence. A nomogram was developed from a multivariable model based on these characteristics.

There were 2,239 first-time adult kidney stone formers with evidence of a passed, obstructing, or infected stone causing pain or gross hematuria. Symptomatic recurrence occurred in 707 of these stone formers through 2012 (recurrence rates at 2, 5, 10, and 15 years were 11%, 20%, 31%, and 39%, respectively).

- **Risk factors for recurrence**: Younger age, male sex, white race, family history of stones, prior asymptomatic stone on imaging, prior suspected stone episode, gross hematuria, nonobstructing (asymptomatic) stone on imaging, symptomatic renal pelvic or lower-pole stone on imaging, no ureterovesicular junction stone on imaging, and uric acid stone composition.

Ten-year recurrence rates varied from 12% to 56% between the first and fifth quintiles of the nomogram score. The Recurrence of Kidney Stone nomogram identifies kidney stone formers at greatest risk for a second symptomatic episode.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^1131ZUjD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Our study challenges the assumption that stone size alone should determine the priority of follow-up for kidney stones. Indeed, we observed no significant difference in the size of kidney stones that passed spontaneously between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This implies that stone size might not be the sole determining factor for symptoms or the necessity of interventions. Instead, it is crucial to consider other factors, such as stone composition, location, and individual patient characteristics when determining follow-up strategies.

- **Stone size and risk factors**: Larger stones may generally carry a higher risk of complications and warrant closer monitoring or intervention. However, smaller stones, particularly when multiple, should not be overlooked as they can also pose a risk for symptoms or potential progression. Asymptomatic ureteral stones may lead to permanent kidney impairment, especially when larger stones are not passing spontaneously, as their presentation is often delayed. Although the spontaneously passed stones in this study were small, the absence of symptoms might justify closer imaging surveillance for patients prone to difficulties in passing future ureteral stones.

Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of various factors is necessary to guide follow-up approaches in patients with kidney stones. D'Costa et al. evaluated first-time symptomatic stone formers clinically and radiologically during a follow-up of at least 5 years and reported a combined symptomatic and asymptomatic/radiographic 5-year recurrence rate of 67%. In addition, they found that 51% of patients with asymptomatic stones experienced similar outcomes.

### Stone burden in an average Swedish population of stone formers requiring active stone removal: How can the stone size be estimated in the clinical routine [^112RokUV]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

To obtain information on the distribution of stone burdens in an average group of Swedish stone-forming patients requiring active stone removal from the kidneys or ureters, different methods for assessing the stone burden were compared.

- **Methods**: A computerized device was used to measure the total stone surface area \((A_{measured})\) of 599 stone situations in kidneys and ureters in a consecutive group of patients referred for active stone removal. These measurements were compared with the large and short transverse diameters of the greatest stone, the sum of the largest diameters of the stones, the arithmetically calculated surface area \((A_{calculated})\), as well as with the stone types (A-F) previously described.

- **Results**: There were 483 stone situations with one stone and 116 with more than one stone. The stones were found in 407 men and 192 women. In 343 cases, the stones were on the left side and in 256 on the right side. There were 34 staghorn stones. Of the examined stone situations, 250 were in the kidney and 349 in the ureter. An \(A_{measured}\) above 300 mm\(^2\) was recorded in 7% of all stone situations. The corresponding numbers for \(A_{measured}\) above 200 mm\(^2\), 500 mm\(^2\), and 700 mm\(^2\) were 13%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. When staghorn stones were excluded, good correlations were recorded for all variables, but the best correlation was found between \(A_{measured}\) and \(A_{calculated}\). A revision of the previously published stone-type subgroups is suggested based on the following limits for the stone surface area: A \(\leq\) 30 mm\(^2\), B = 31–300 mm\(^2\), C = 301–700 mm\(^2\).

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^114B88UM]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Hematuria and urolithiasis rank among the most common urologic diagnoses, with urolithiasis being one of the leading causes of hematuria. While the prevalence of hematuria has been reported between 2.4% and 31.1%, the lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis is approximately 15% in developed countries. For patients with suspected urolithiasis, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is recommended, and for patients with hematuria and a high risk for genitourinary malignancy, multiphasic CT is advised as per international guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association, respectively. Due to the rising prevalence of urolithiasis and a high recurrence rate of up to 50%, limiting radiation exposure in these and other urologic patients is a major concern.

In recent decades, technical advances have allowed extensive investigations regarding the reduction of radiation dose in computed tomography. This progress has led to the implementation of low-dose scanning protocols for patients with suspected urolithiasis in the international guideline by the EAU. On the contrary, the radiation dose of multiphasic CT in patients with hematuria, including non-contrast, parenchymal, and excretory phases, still remains high. Virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) of the excretory phase derived from dual-energy CT systems have shown promising results in urinary stone detection, potentially replacing true non-contrast scans. More recently, split-bolus protocols have been described to further reduce radiation dose by combining the parenchymal and excretory phases.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^117Bge7p]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Insights from critical stakeholders are missing. We acknowledge that no caregivers were involved, who could have provided additional perspectives to inform the guidelines, such as selecting and preparing foods for people with experiences of recurrent kidney stones.

A contrast is also evident; clinicians may have an acute perception of kidney stones, focusing on each episode as it occurs, whereas patients place a high value on preventative measures. They aim to have an active role in their care, aiming to minimize recurrence and adopt a strategic, long-term approach. Although consumer involvement in research has become increasingly advocated, there is still no standardized approach for involving people with lived experience in the guideline development process.

The methods highlighted in our organizational framework for consumer involvement in guidelines have been implemented for workshops previously conducted for other chronic kidney disease conditions. These methods are relatively effective and comprehensive for eliciting consumers' perspectives and insights on relevant priority topics and outcomes to be included in guidelines. Despite various guideline organizations involving consumers in guidelines, further research on the methods to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of involvement strategies is required.

### Size and volume of kidney stones in computed tomography: Influence of acquisition techniques and image reconstruction parameters [^116fAuwB]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is routinely used to assess suspected urolithiasis. Information obtained from CT includes the presence, location, and size of stones, with the latter frequently determining the treatment strategy. While there is consensus regarding measurement procedures for kidney stones, the influence of radiation dose and reconstruction techniques on stone measurements are unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the influence of these technical determinants on kidney stone size measurements.

Forty-seven kidney stones of different compositions were scanned using a 64-row multi-detector CT in a 3D-printed, semi-anthropomorphic phantom. Reference stone sizes were measured manually with a digital caliper (Man-M). Stones were imaged with 2 and 10 mGy CTDI. Images were reconstructed using filtered-back-projection, hybrid-iterative, and model-based-iterative reconstruction algorithms (FBP, HIR, MBIR) in combination with different kernels and denoising levels. All stones underwent semi-automatic, threshold-based segmentation for computation of maximum diameter and volume. Statistics were conducted using ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons.

Overall, stone size as compared to manual measurements was overestimated in CT (10.0 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05). MBIR and sharp kernels showed the closest agreement with Man-M (9.3 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05). Differences within single stones were as high.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to blood tests, the CUA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining an in-depth metabolic evaluation in patients with risk factors for recurrent stone disease or any of the following:

- **Children** (< 18 years of age).

- **Bilateral or multiple stones**.

- **Recurrent stones** (≥ 2 kidney stone episodes).

- **Non-calcium stones** (such as uric acid, cystine).

- **Pure calcium phosphate stones**.

- **Complicated stone episodes** resulting in severe (even if temporary) AKI, sepsis, hospitalization, or complicated hospital admission.

- **Stones requiring percutaneous nephrolithotomy**.

- **Stones in the setting of a solitary** (anatomical or functional) kidney.

- **Renal insufficiency**.

- **History of systemic disease** increasing the risk of kidney stones (such as gout, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel disorders, hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus/metabolic syndrome).

- **Occupation where public safety is at risk** (such as pilots, air traffic controllers, police officers, military personnel, firefighters).

- **Family history of kidney stones**.

### Low urologist density predicts high-cost surgical treatment of stone disease [^116uSPiV]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of access to urologic specialists is approaching crisis levels as the number of urologists decreases, while the demand for urologic care increases. The financial implications of this trend have not been thoroughly explored. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of access and other patient factors on the cost to treat urolithiasis. We hypothesized that markers of poor access would be associated with higher costs of surgical encounters for patients presenting with urolithiasis.

A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU) from September 2015 to July 2018 was conducted to investigate the characteristics of surgical patients treated for urinary stone disease. Univariate analysis was performed using the Welch two-sample t-test, and multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.5.

When considering various factors, several were statistically significant. These factors included:

- **Significant patient and procedural factors**:

	- **Procedure type**: patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (p < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] 12.9, confidence interval [CI] 4.05–48.5)

- **Accessibility and demographic factors**:

	- **Urologist density**: bottom quartile (p = 0.014; OR 4.66, CI 1.40–16.9)

- **Health-related factors**:

	- Diabetes (p = 0.018; OR 4.38, CI 1.32–15.6)
	- Experiencing infection (p = 0.007; OR 4.51, CI 1.55–14.0)

### Kidney stone pathophysiology, evaluation and management: Core curriculum 2023 [^1162detZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Kidney stone disease, also known as nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, is a disorder in which urinary solutes precipitate to form aggregates of crystalline material in the urinary space. The incidence of nephrolithiasis has been increasing, and the demographics have been evolving. Once viewed as a limited disease with intermittent exacerbations that are simply managed by urologists, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a complex condition requiring thorough evaluation and multifaceted care. Kidney stones frequently manifest as underlying systemic medical conditions such as metabolic syndrome, genetic disorders, or endocrinopathies. Analysis of urine chemistries and stone composition provides a window into pathogenesis and directs ancillary studies to uncover underlying diseases. These studies allow providers to devise individualized strategies to limit future stone events. Given its complexity, kidney stone disease is best addressed by a team led by nephrologists and urologists, with input from multiple other health professionals, including dietitians, endocrinologists, interventional radiologists, and endocrine surgeons. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we provide a case-based overview of nephrolithiasis, divided by the individual stone types. The reader will gain a pragmatic understanding of the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of this condition.

### When (and how) to surgically treat asymptomatic renal stones [^113myxXt]. Nature Reviews Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic renal stones are identified in 8–10% of screened populations. With the increasing utilization of CT, the number of patients seeking urologic care for incidentally diagnosed renal calculi is likely to increase. Such patients present an important management dilemma: differentiating those to treat surgically from those who can be safely observed. Observational studies have revealed that approximately 50% of asymptomatic stones will progress, but most will not require surgery. Stones greater than 15 mm in diameter and located in the renal pelvis are at the highest risk of progression.

Although no guidelines exist for the optimal monitoring regimen for asymptomatic stones, follow-up studies may include serum creatinine, plain radiography, ultrasonography, and CT. Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) does not seem to offer significant benefit over observation for asymptomatic calyceal stones. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy does improve stone-free rates compared to SWL or observation. Additional research is needed to characterize the role of ureteroscopic management of asymptomatic renal stones.

### Diagnosis and initial management of kidney stones [^112AesrX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and initial management of urolithiasis have undergone considerable evolution in recent years. A major advance in this area is the application of noncontrast helical computed tomography (CT) for patients with suspected renal colic. The superior sensitivity and specificity of helical CT allow for definitive and expeditious diagnosis or exclusion of urolithiasis without the potential harmful effects of contrast media.

Initial management is based on three key concepts: (1) recognition of urgent and emergency requirements for urologic consultation; (2) provision of effective pain control using a combination of narcotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in appropriate patients; and (3) understanding the impact of stone location and size on the natural history and definitive urologic management. These concepts are discussed with reference to contemporary literature, aiming to provide tools that family physicians can use in the emergency department or clinic.

### Clinical review. Kidney stones 2012: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^114K9MT1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The pathogenetic mechanisms of kidney stone formation are complex and involve both metabolic and environmental risk factors. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney stone disease.

- **Evidence acquisition and synthesis**: Both original and review articles were found via PubMed search, reporting on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of kidney stones. These resources were integrated with the authors' knowledge of the field.

- **Conclusion**: Nephrolithiasis remains a major economic and health burden worldwide. Nephrolithiasis is considered a systemic disorder associated with chronic kidney disease, bone loss and fractures, increased risk of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome. Further understanding of the pathophysiological link between nephrolithiasis and these systemic disorders is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options.

### Symptomatic and radiographic manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and their prediction by risk factors: A prospective cohort study [^112BcUM6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

A meaningful interpretation of changes in radiographic kidney stone burden requires understanding how radiographic recurrence relates to symptomatic recurrence and how established risk factors predict these different manifestations of recurrence.

- **Methods**: We recruited first-time symptomatic stone formers from the general community in Minnesota and Florida. Baseline and 5-year follow-up study visits included computed tomography scans, surveys, and medical record reviews. We noted symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care (through chart review) or self-report, and radiographic recurrence of any new stone, stone growth, or stone passage (comparing baseline and follow-up scans). To assess the prediction of different manifestations of recurrence, we used the Recurrence of Kidney Stone (ROKS) score, which sums multiple baseline risk factors.

- **Results**: Among 175 stone formers, 19% had symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care and 25% detected by self-report; radiographic recurrence manifested as a new stone in 35%, stone growth in 24%, and stone passage in 27%. Among those with a baseline asymptomatic stone (54%), at 5 years, 51% had radiographic evidence of stone passage (accompanied by symptoms in only 52%). Imaging evidence of a new stone or stone passage was more strongly associated with symptomatic recurrence detected by clinical care than by self-report. The ROKS score weakly predicted one manifestation — symptomatic recurrence resulting in clinical care (c-statistic, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.73) — but strongly predicted any manifestation of recurrence.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111xPPpV]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to provide novel insights into areas where low consensus between guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

- **Methods**: The webpages of the 61 members of the Societé Internationale d'Urologie were analyzed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While seven national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

- **Conclusions**: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis.

### Influence of socioeconomic factors on stone burden at presentation to tertiary referral center: Data from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter [^112diZ98]. Urology (2019). Low credibility.

To determine social factors associated with advanced stone disease, defined as unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm at the time of presentation to a regional stone referral center, we acknowledge that little is known about social determinants of urolithiasis. We hypothesize that socioeconomic factors impact kidney stone severity at intake to referral centers.

A retrospective review of the prospectively collected data from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter from 2015 to 2018 was conducted to evaluate patient characteristics predictive of having a large (greater than 2 cm) unilateral kidney stone. Data on patient age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, race, language, education level, infection, distance, income, referring regional urologist density, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and stone analysis were evaluated.

Complete imaging and patient variable data were present in 650 of 1142 patients, including 197 patients with unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm. On multivariate analysis, obesity, lower education level, increased distance from the referral center, and symptoms of infection predicted for unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm. Among 191 patients with stone analysis data present, stone type, income, and urologist density predicted for unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm.

In addition to known biological risk factors, patients with lower education levels and from regions of lower mean income were found to be more likely to present to our tertiary care center with a stone burden greater than 2 cm. More research is needed to elucidate the society-environment interaction influencing urolithiasis severity.

### Racial and ethnic representation in nephrolithiasis guidelines: Are they generalizable [^112yrWVU]. Urology (2025). High credibility.

To assess whether clinical trials guiding kidney stone care adequately describe the race, ethnicity, and other key demographic variables of their study populations, guidelines such as those from the American Urological Association represent the highest level of evidence informing clinical practice. We aim to investigate if studies on which they are based include sufficiently diverse patient populations for generalizable results.

- **Methods**: We reviewed American Urological Association/Endourological Society guidelines for the medical and surgical management of kidney stones for all referenced clinical trials reporting human subjects. Study populations were reviewed for reported sex/gender, race, ethnicity, and study country of origin.

- **Results**: Of the 381 studies referenced, 287 met inclusion criteria. Only 18 (6.3%) reported the race or ethnicity of their subjects, and 254 (87%) reported sex/gender. Among studies reporting any race or ethnicity data, there were 468,281 participants, of which 48.5% were White, 1.0% Black, 0.6% Hispanic/Latino, 0.2% Asian, 0.3% other, 0.04% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.001% Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. The remaining 49.4% of subjects had insufficient information to categorize into a race or ethnicity category. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of reporting race or ethnicity included cross-sectional studies (OR 0.14, P = 0.027) and international studies (OR 0.93, P = 0.012).

- **Conclusion**: A small proportion of studies cited in the kidney stone guidelines report patient race or ethnicity.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^116P58kz]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound in patients with suspected kidney stones. Additionally, it is advised to perform an unenhanced helical CT to determine the Hounsfield Units (HUs) to provide information about the possible stone composition.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^117GnFPB]. Nature Reviews Urology (2016). High credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and an initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality to use for evaluating patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis, but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT, but it does not require the use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial, they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department.

- **Modalities**: Both CT and ultrasonography have advantages and disadvantages. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) plain film radiography is most helpful in evaluating interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease and is less useful in the setting of acute stones. MRI offers the possibility of 3D imaging without radiation exposure, but it is costly, and currently, stones are difficult to visualize.

Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones, in light of the guidelines and a randomized controlled trial, could aid clinicians.

### The impact of stone multiplicity on surgical decisions for patients with large stone burden: Results from ReSKU [^114YBZth]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for a total stone burden greater than 20mm. However, it is unclear if the number of stones affects adherence to this guideline. This study aims to assess the impact of stone multiplicity on the choice of ureteroscopy (URS) versus PCNL as a first-line therapy for patients with a high stone burden (> 20mm), and examine whether AUA guideline-discordant care impacts patient outcomes.

Data were collected from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU) database, a prospectively collected registry of patients with stone disease. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) was used to estimate the association between stone multiplicity and the decision to perform URS for high stone burden patients. MLR was further employed to estimate the association between performing URS and the following outcomes: stone-free rate, need for a second operation, and complications. Postoperative hospital stay was compared between patients receiving URS versus PCNL using Student's t-test.

Results indicated that 125 patients were included in this analysis. For patients with a total stone burden exceeding 20mm, those with more than three stones had roughly nine times the likelihood of undergoing URS over PCNL compared with patients with a single stone (adjusted odds ratio 9.21, confidence interval [95% CI] 2.55–40.58, p = 0.001). Stone-free rates, Clavien-Dindo scores, and frequency of second-look operations did not differ significantly between URS and PCNL patients. URS patients were…

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111yD6sw]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common hereditary kidney disorders, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 live births, affecting millions worldwide. ADPKD is characterized by the progressive formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, leading to a decline in renal function. It is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with more than 50% of patients reaching ESRD by the age of 60. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which regulate renal tubular epithelial cell function, are primarily responsible for the pathogenesis of ADPKD, contributing to abnormal cyst formation and progressive kidney damage.

Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone disease) is a frequent complication of ADPKD, occurring in 20–36% of patients, significantly higher than the approximately 8–10% prevalence observed in the general population. The formation of kidney stones in ADPKD is often attributed to anatomical distortions caused by cysts and metabolic abnormalities, including urinary stasis and hypercalciuria. Although these stones can remain asymptomatic, they may still contribute to disease progression by exacerbating renal dysfunction, causing urinary tract infections, hematuria, or obstruction. Despite the prevalence of nephrolithiasis in ADPKD, studies specifically investigating the impact of asymptomatic stones on the progression of chronic kidney disease are limited.

The role of asymptomatic kidney stones in ADPKD has not been thoroughly examined, creating a gap in the understanding of their clinical significance. Most current studies do not adequately address the potential impact of these stones on disease progression, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

### Identifying and integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in clinical practice guidelines on managing kidney stones [^112oFfcS]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Kidney stones affect about 10% of the adult population, and the incidence of kidney stones is increasing worldwide. About 35% to 50% of people with kidney stones experience recurrence within five years. Kidney stones cause debilitating symptoms, such as vomiting, nausea, and pain. Emergency departments are burdened by the presentation of acute pain due to kidney stones, with one of the highest rates of representation at these services. People with kidney stones have reported impaired quality of life, with recurrence causing anxiety and low mood. Kidney stones can also limit life participation through impacts on the ability to work, leading to financial concerns and family impacts.

Although there are guidelines on the management of kidney stones, they may not address the areas relevant to people who have had kidney stones. Integrating patient perspectives and priorities in clinical practice guidelines is now widely advocated to ensure they are meaningful and relevant to patients. The Caring for Australians and New Zealanders with Kidney Impairment (CARI) Guidelines have demonstrated that the involvement of people with lived experience of disease broadens the scope of clinical practice guidelines and enhances their relevance and translation.

We convened workshops to identify perspectives on topics and outcomes to integrate into the CARI Guidelines update on kidney stones management. We also aimed to describe reasons for their selection of topics and outcomes and discuss how their input was integrated by the guidelines.

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114wih6d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common hereditary disorder leading to end-stage kidney disease due to the progressive formation of renal cysts. Nephrolithiasis is a frequent complication of ADPKD, with a prevalence significantly higher than in the general population; however, its role in disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of asymptomatic nephrolithiasis on kidney function decline in ADPKD patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort of 195 ADPKD patients was followed at our nephrology clinic. Of these, 85 patients had nephrolithiasis (N+), and 110 did not (N-). Data on demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, and kidney function were collected. ΔeGFR (change in eGFR over time) served as the primary outcome. Statistical analyses, including correlation and multiple linear regression, were performed to assess the predictors of ΔeGFR.

- **Results**: The N+ group exhibited a significantly greater decline in kidney function compared to the N- group (ΔeGFR: 16.53 vs. 12.82 mL/min/1.73 m², p = 0.008). Lower calcium levels were observed in the N+ group (p = 0.007), potentially reflecting metabolic abnormalities linked to nephrolithiasis. Nephrolithiasis was independently associated with kidney function decline (B = 3.159, p = 0.038). Follow-up duration was strongly associated with ΔeGFR (p < 0.001). Age showed a trend toward significance but did not reach statistical significance.

- **Conclusion**: Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis is associated with accelerated kidney function decline in ADPKD patients. These findings suggest a need for careful monitoring of nephrolithiasis in these patients.

### Size matters: The width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^113qiC4H]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The steep middle part of the predictive regression curve simplifies the decision of treatment strategy based on stone size, but is also sensitive to inter- and intra-observer measuring differences and variances related to scan parameters. Patel et al. showed that interobserver variability could be substantially reduced with an automated volume measurement. Several promising automated, reader-independent measurement methods have been proposed, and further studies with these methods would be of interest.

In conclusion, our results show that spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone can be predicted with high accuracy with the knowledge of stone width or length and whether the stone is localized cranial to the sacroiliac joint, provided that standardized window settings and magnifications are used. The present study demonstrates a method for predicting the probability of stone passage in the short and long term, based on stone size and location.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^111o17ag]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for bladder stones, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend individualizing follow-up imaging for each patient. Recognize that factors affecting follow-up include whether the underlying functional predisposition to stone formation can be treated, such as with transurethral resection of the prostate, and metabolic risk.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: a cohort study [^1179z3i3]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common and potentially preventable cause of morbidity in the general population. Using a cohort of more than three million people treated in a universal healthcare system, we found that the risks of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and of two other clinically relevant adverse renal outcomes were all significantly higher in people with at least one symptomatic kidney stone episode.

The excess risk of all three adverse renal outcomes associated with stone episodes appeared to be greater in women than in men, and greater among younger individuals compared to those aged ≥ 50 years. The observed association between stones and risk was independent of potential confounders and seemed to be magnified in people with more than one episode of stones compared to those with a single episode. These findings suggest that kidney stones are an important potential contributor to the risk of ESRD and that patients with prior kidney stones should be considered at increased risk for adverse renal outcomes, especially younger women or those with multiple symptomatic episodes.

Consistent with our data, a recent prospective cohort study of about 1.5 million people in the United Kingdom found that kidney stones were a significant risk for ESRD in women but not men. The basis for this finding is unclear, but we speculate that, although men are more likely to develop stones, they are protected from obstructive complications due to differing anatomy.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111uiv7C]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to renal stone size, thresholds of 20 mm are used in the EAU, DGU, and SAU guidelines, while the AUA guidelines differentiate between lower pole calculi > 10 mm and ≤ 10 mm, and non-lower pole stones > 20 mm and ≤ 20 mm. The SUA guidelines provide recommendations for lower pole calculi regardless of size, and the AFU guidelines differentiate between > 20 mm and ≤ 20 mm, involving an ante- and retrograde approach in the EAU guidelines.

The comparative analysis assessing the most often recommended combination of procedures revealed an agreement ranging from 50% to 83% for different stone sizes and locations. A high degree of consensus was found, in particular for lower pole renal stones below 20 mm, with 83% of the guidelines recommending 'SWL or URS or PNL', and distal ureteral stones, where 83% of the guidelines recommend 'SWL or URS'.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^111WEH6Z]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Consequently, kidney stones not only cause pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous healthcare costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and aren't noticed by the patient. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with calcium-containing stones.

We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤ 5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^1148hBRF]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining periodic follow-up in patients with untreated renal stones initially after 6 months, and then yearly. This evaluation should include assessment of symptoms and stone status, using ultrasound, kidney-ureter-bladder X-ray, or CT.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^111BCsMH]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

- **Influence of kidney stone size on detection rate**: Considering a general cut-off for insignificant stones of ≤ 5 mm described by guidelines, 32 kidney stones (34.8%) were ≤ 5 mm, while 60 kidney stones (65.2%) were > 5 mm. The overall detection rate of kidney stones ≤ 5 mm was significantly lower compared to stones > 5 mm (80.6% vs. 87.1%; p < 0.01) when averaging all reconstructions. With increasing iodine-induced attenuation, detection rates in low-dose protocols dropped sooner compared to high-dose protocols (e.g. VNC 1000HU 68.8% vs. 85.0%; p < 0.01).

- **Detection rate of kidney stones in different contrast media/saline mixtures**: The mixtures exhibited specific iodine-induced attenuation regarding kidney stone size. Conventional images (CI), Hounsfield unit (HU), and virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) were considered in the analysis.

### Decision-making, preference, and treatment choice for asymptomatic renal stones-balancing benefit and risk of observation and surgical intervention: A real-world survey using social media platform [^113kspEJ]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Low credibility.

The burden of kidney stone disease has risen, and several treatment options now exist. We wanted to evaluate preferences and treatment choices based on the information provided for the management of hypothetical 8mm and 15mm renal stones, as well as the factors that influenced decision-making.

An online questionnaire was formatted using Microsoft Forms to investigate trends in decision-making for two hypothesized scenarios of asymptomatic kidney stones (8mm and 15mm). This questionnaire was posted on social media (Facebook) in Europe. Ethical approval was obtained from the University Ethics Committee, and data were collected from the general public between September and November 2020.

A total of 476 participants of different ages and backgrounds answered the survey, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2.7. The age groups were categorized as 18–25 years (n = 149), 26–49 years (n = 192), and 50+ years (n = 135). In the 8mm scenario, 107 of the 476 participants (22.5%) chose observation, 249 (52.3%) chose extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), and 120 (25.2%) opted for ureteroscopy (URS). In the 15mm scenario, 194 participants chose SWL treatment (40.8%), 216 (45.4%) URS, and 66 (13.9%) preferred percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

The influencing factors were success rate, complication risk, and invasiveness of the procedure. In comparison to the 8mm stone scenario, while stent avoidance and activity limitation were considered less important for the 15mm stone (p < 0.001), complication rates were considered more important (p < 0.001).

### Reducing shock number dramatically decreases lesion size in a juvenile kidney model [^111kdfXD]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Adult stone patients are treated with several thousand lithotripter shockwaves (SWs) in order to pulverize a kidney stone. This typical clinical dose assures that the stone will be fractured completely. However, this same dose induces damage to the kidney, especially pediatric-size kidneys. If increasing SW number is known to increase renal injury and functional impairment, will reducing SW number below typical treatment levels significantly decrease kidney damage and hemodynamic changes?

- **Materials and methods**: To address this question, one kidney in each of nine juvenile pigs (6–7 weeks old) was treated with 1000 SWs at 24 kV directed at a lower-pole calix with an unmodified HM-3 lithotripter. Parenchymal-lesion size was determined by sectioning the entire kidney and quantitating the amount of hemorrhage in each slice. Renal function was determined before and after SW treatment by inulin clearance, paraaminohippurate (PAH) extraction, and PAH clearance. The resulting morphologic and functional changes were then compared with those of kidneys that had been treated with a typical clinical dose of 2000 SWs (data previously published; J Am Soc Nephrol 2000;11:310). Eleven pigs were utilized as sham-treated controls.

- **Results**: Limiting SW number to 1000 significantly reduced the size of the lesion (by 95%) and reduced the degree of functional change (glomerular filtration rate by 38%, PAH extraction by 73%, renal plasma flow by 46%) compared with kidneys receiving 2000 SWs (an adult dose).

- **Conclusions**: These data support the idea that SW number should be limited to reduce kidney damage.

### Do kidney stone formers have a kidney disease [^113Tumjb]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a highly prevalent disorder affecting approximately one in eleven people and is associated with multiple complications, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Significant epidemiologic associations with chronic kidney disease and ESRD have been noted and are reviewed herein, but debate persists in the literature as to whether kidney stone formation is a pathogenic process contributing to kidney disease. Corroborating evidence supporting the presence of kidney disease in stone formers includes the variability of renal function by stone type, the positive association of stone size with renal dysfunction, the presence of markers of renal injury in the urine of even asymptomatic stone formers, and direct evidence of renal tissue injury on histopathology.

- **Proposed pathogenic mechanisms**: Re-obstruction and comorbid conditions such as urinary tract infections and structural abnormalities. Recent work evaluating the renal histopathology of different groups of stone formers adds further granularity, suggesting variability in mechanisms of renal injury by stone type and confirming the pathogenic effects of crystal formation.

- **Genetic abnormalities**: Conditions leading to stone formation, including cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria, contribute to the burden of disease in the stone-forming population.

### Asymptomatic lower pole small renal stones: Shock wave lithotripsy, flexible ureteroscopy, or observation? A prospective randomized trial [^1144GSQ8]. Urology (2015). High credibility.

The objective of the study is to present the outcomes of flexible ureteroscopy (F-URS), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), and observation in the management of asymptomatic lower calyceal stones.

A total of 150 patients with asymptomatic lower calyceal stones were randomized into F-URS (group 1), SWL (group 2), and observation (group 3) groups. The main criteria for patient enrollment were having asymptomatic single lower pole stones < 1 cm.

- **Results**: In F-URS, the mean stone-free rate was 92% (46 out of 50). The mean number of sessions for the SWL group was 1.48 ± 0.65, with a stone-free rate of 90% (45 out of 50). In the observation group, patients were followed up for a mean of 21.02 ± 3.65 months. Three stones passed spontaneously without any symptoms. Pain developed in three patients during follow-up, and two of them passed a stone and responded to analgesics without further treatment. Complication rates for groups 1 and 2 were similar, but group 2 had higher Clavien grades.

For asymptomatic small-sized lower calyceal stones, SWL and F-URS are established treatment modalities. However, with low auxiliary treatment rates, observation may be an option for the management of non-symptomatic small-sized lower pole kidney stones.

### Tract sizes in miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy: A systematic review from the European Association of Urology Urolithiasis Guidelines Panel [^111y2iCe]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Miniaturized instruments for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), utilizing tracts sized ≤ 22 Fr, have been developed to reduce morbidity and increase the efficiency of stone removal compared with standard PNL (> 22 Fr).

- **Objective**: We systematically reviewed all available evidence on the efficacy and safety of miniaturized PNL for removing renal calculi.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Due to the inability to perform a meta-analysis, data were summarized in a narrative synthesis.

- **Evidence synthesis**: After screening 2945 abstracts, 18 studies were included (two randomized controlled trials [RCTs], six nonrandomized comparative studies, and 10 case series). Thirteen studies were full-text articles, and five were only available as congress abstracts. The size of tracts used in miniaturized procedures ranged from 22 Fr to 4.8 Fr. The largest mean stone size treated using small instruments was 980 mm². Stone-free rates were comparable in miniaturized and standard PNL procedures. Procedures performed with small instruments were associated with significantly lower blood loss, although the procedure duration tended to be significantly longer. Other complications were not notably different between PNL types. Study designs and populations were heterogeneous. Limitations included selection and outcome reporting bias, as well as a lack of information on relevant confounding factors.

- **Conclusions**: The studies suggest that miniaturized PNL offers potential benefits in terms of reduced blood loss, although procedural duration may be longer. Further research is needed to address study limitations and confounding factors.

### Physician and patient adherence to kidney stone prevention guidelines in a diverse, low-resource, urban population [^114Kj69m]. Urology (2025). High credibility.

To assess barriers to guideline-concordant metabolic kidney stone evaluations in a diverse, low-resource, urban population, the American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines recommend that recurrent, high-risk, and interested first-time kidney stone formers undergo metabolic evaluation. Patients with low socioeconomic status are less likely to complete 24-hour urine studies.

We retrospectively identified high-risk kidney stone patients who required stone surgery between 2016 and 2022 and completed a validated social needs screening tool. Clinical notes, orders, pharmacy, and laboratory records were reviewed for the year before and after surgery. Guideline compliance was assessed with respect to each of the following: recommendation for and completion of 24-hour urine, results counseling, dietary/pharmacologic compliance, and repeat 24-hour urine recommendation and completion.

Two hundred eighty patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 25.4% were Black and 51.8% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age was 57 years (IQR 48–65). Of those eligible, 123 (43.9%) were recommended to undergo metabolic evaluation, 70 (25%) completed the collection, 45 (16.1%) had dietary/pharmacologic counseling, 25 (8.9%) were recommended to repeat 24-hour urine, 13 (4.6%) completed this repeat collection, and 10 (3.6%) had a visit to discuss repeat results. On univariate analysis, Asian race, hyperparathyroidism, female sex, increased age, and private insurance were associated with an increased likelihood of guideline-concordant care (p < 0.05).

### Kidney stone disease: Risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^117KsZFW]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract, constituting a major global health-care problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex, or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and enormous health-care expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and low bone mass.

Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH. A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary, and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations, and guide therapy.

Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized and underserved.

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^11542VKh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common hereditary disorder leading to end-stage kidney disease due to the progressive formation of renal cysts. Nephrolithiasis is a frequent complication of ADPKD, with a prevalence significantly higher than in the general population. However, its role in disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of asymptomatic nephrolithiasis on kidney function decline in ADPKD patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort of 195 ADPKD patients was followed at our nephrology clinic. Of these, 85 patients had nephrolithiasis (N+), and 110 did not (N-). Data on demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, and kidney function were collected. ΔeGFR (change in eGFR over time) served as the primary outcome. Statistical analyses, including correlation and multiple linear regression, were performed to assess the predictors of ΔeGFR.

- **Results**: The N+ group exhibited a significantly greater decline in kidney function compared to the N- group (ΔeGFR: 16.53 vs. 12.82 mL/min/1.73 m², p = 0.008). Lower calcium levels were observed in the N+ group (p = 0.007), potentially reflecting metabolic abnormalities linked to nephrolithiasis. Nephrolithiasis was independently associated with kidney function decline (B = 3.159, p = 0.038). Follow-up duration was strongly associated with ΔeGFR (p < 0.001). Age showed a trend toward significance but did not reach statistical significance.

- **Conclusion**: Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis is associated with accelerated kidney function decline in ADPKD patients.

### Percutaneous nephrolithotomy versus retrograde intrarenal surgery for treatment of renal stones in adults [^1169jmUJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Kidney stones, also called renal stones, can be a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. Depending on size, location, composition, and other patient factors, the treatment of kidney stones can involve observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS; i.e. ureteroscopic approaches), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and two trials registries up to 23 March 2023. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated PCNL, grouped by access size in French gauge [Fr] into three groups: ≥ 24 Fr (standard PCNL), 15–23 Fr (mini-PCNL and minimally invasive PCNL), and < 15 Fr (ultra-mini-, mini-micro-, super-mini-, and micro-PCNL), versus RIRS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Our primary outcomes were stone-free rate, major complications, and need for secondary interventions. Our main secondary outcomes were unplanned medical visits to emergency/urgent care or outpatient clinic, length of hospital stay, ureteral stricture or injury, and quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE criteria.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^112AsZq1]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location, size, patient's comorbidities, and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations, with several institutions around the world issuing guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the evidence available and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, a careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insight.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analyzed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^116M6ifc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The main objective of the NOSTONE trial was to investigate the dose-response relationship for the prevention of the primary endpoint, which is a composite of symptomatic or radiologic kidney stone recurrence. In a secondary analysis of this prospective database, the frequency of total (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was evaluated. The association between spontaneous passage and covariates was assessed using linear regression analyses.

A total of 33 NOSTONE participants who did not have a CT scan available at the end of the study were excluded from the radiological stone recurrence analysis. For missing laboratory values, complete randomness was assumed in the analysis. In the per-protocol analysis of stone recurrence, patients were considered dependently censored if they withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or were noncompliant for nonmedical reasons. This approach led to the exclusion of nonadherent patients when noncompliance was first observed.

The comparison of median sizes between asymptomatic and symptomatic stones was performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Linear regressions were formulated in the subsequent step. Here, the dependent variables of the number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages and the total number of spontaneous stone passages were regressed on all independent variables. It should be noted that the regressions were tested for the ordinary least squares assumptions. Specifically, the presence of heteroscedasticity was first examined. For this purpose, the Breusch–Pagan test was applied.

### Variation in radiologic and urologic computed tomography interpretation of urinary tract stone burden: Results from the registry for stones of the kidney and ureter [^115zMMDJ]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

To compare the measured stone burden recorded between urologists and radiologists, and examine how these differences could potentially impact stone management. As urologic stone surgery guideline recommendations are based on stone size, accurate stone measurements are crucial to direct appropriate treatment. This study investigated the discrepant interpretation that often exists between urologic surgeons and radiologists' estimation of patient urinary stone burden.

- **Materials and methods**: From November 2015 through August 2016, new patients prospectively enrolled into the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU) were included if they had computed tomography images available and an accompanying official radiologic report at the time of their urologist provider visit. Stone number and aggregate stone size were compared between the urologic interpretation and the corresponding radiologic reports.

- **Results**: Of 219 patients who met the inclusion criteria, concordance between urologic and radiologic assessment of aggregate stone size was higher for single stone sizing (63%) compared with multiple stones (32%). Statistical significance was found in comparing the mean difference in aggregate stone size for single and multiple stones (p < 0.01). Over 33% of stone-containing renal units had a radiologic report with an unclear size estimation or size discrepancy that could lead to non-guideline-driven surgical management.

- **Conclusion**: Significant variation exists between urologic and radiologic computed tomography interpretations of stone burden. Urologists

### Kidney stones [^114VYfCh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

The age of peak incidence for stone disease is 20–40 years, although stones are seen in all age groups, with a male to female ratio of 3:2.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions for stone removal in people with asymptomatic kidney stones? What are the effects of interventions for the removal of symptomatic renal stones? What are the effects of interventions to remove symptomatic ureteric stones? What are the effects of interventions for the management of acute renal colic? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodic drugs, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, intravenous fluids, NSAIDs, opioids, oral fluids, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and ureteroscopy.

### Urolithiasis in the emergency department [^116hCtoc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urolithiasis commonly presents to the emergency department with acute, severe, unilateral flank pain. Patients with a suspected first-time stone or atypical presentation should be evaluated with a noncontrast computed tomography scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out alternative diagnoses. Narcotics remain the mainstay of pain management; however, in select patients, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories alone or in combination with narcotics provide safe and effective analgesia in the emergency department. While most kidney stones can be managed with pain control and expectant management, obstructing kidney stones with a suspected proximal urinary tract infection are urological emergencies requiring emergent decompression, antibiotics, and resuscitation.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to the surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones.

Materials and methods used in the development of these guidelines include a systematic review of the literature, with search dates from January 1, 1985, to May 31, 2015, to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. This review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as clinical principles and expert opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

Results identified by the panel include 12 adult index patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional index patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to aid clinicians in identifying optimal management.

Conclusions emphasize that proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This guideline is intended for use in clinical practice to enhance patient care.
