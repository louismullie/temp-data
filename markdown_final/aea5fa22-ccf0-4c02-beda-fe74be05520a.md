## Question

would neurologist handle seizures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether neurologists handle seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what neurologists are trained to do and whether seizures fall squarely within that scope. Then, I should verify how seizures and epilepsy are classified and who the guidelines designate as responsible for diagnosis and management. Next, I will examine the concrete clinical roles neurologists fill in seizure care across diagnostic workup, acute management, long-term treatment, and specialized referrals. After that, I need to map where neurologists enter the care pathway from ED to outpatient settings, consider subspecialists like epileptologists, and differentiate acute versus chronic responsibilities. Finally, I should address counterarguments about whether primary care or emergency physicians can manage seizures without neurology and synthesize a clear conclusion aligned with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the professional identity and training piece, because if I get this wrong, all downstream inferences will wobble; neurologists are physicians specializing in nervous system disorders, and seizure disorders are embedded in that core training, with routine clinical use of EEG even if depth of EEG interpretation varies by trainee and practice setting [^116ekSLC].

> Next, I should review classification to ensure I'm not assuming the domain incorrectly; epilepsy and seizures are explicitly categorized as neurologic conditions by major bodies and reviews, making them a natural fit for neurologist-led care, and epilepsy is among the most prevalent chronic neurologic conditions worldwide, which further anchors seizure management in neurology's domain [^113w9mKZ] [^112JmHid].

> Wait, let me verify whether guidelines and systems explicitly name neurologists in seizure care rather than implying it; comprehensive epilepsy centers are structured around multidisciplinary teams in which neurologists are central, inpatient neurological evaluation tightens initial ED diagnoses, and pediatric first-seizure pathways and reviews consistently rely on neurologic assessment and follow-up, all signaling that neurologists are the primary specialists for seizure diagnosis and management [^113w9mKZ] [^111o5zJ1] [^112mZVWB] [^112JSftW].

> I will now examine the diagnostic roles concretely, because management follows classification; neurologists take the lead on detailed history and examination to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic events, arrange and interpret EEG after a first unprovoked seizure, and determine appropriate neuroimaging — typically MRI as first-line in nonemergent settings and CT in emergent trauma — steps that are foundational to correct diagnosis and tailored treatment plans [^112JSftW] [^116ekSLC] [^115qWu4D] [^113CL9ac].

> Hold on, I should verify therapeutic decision points too; neurologists counsel on recurrence risk after a first unprovoked seizure and individualize whether to start antiseizure medication immediately, and when seizures persist or present as status epilepticus, they select and sequence second-line agents per ED and neurology-aligned guidance, integrating patient-specific factors and syndrome classification into long-term ASM choices and monitoring [^113w9mKZ] [^112JmHid] [^114ePB1U].

> Let me consider the emergency end of the spectrum, because that's where role clarity can blur; status epilepticus requires rapid recognition and protocolized treatment, with definitions anchored at the 5-minute mark and ICU-directed critical care steps including airway, hemodynamics, urgent antiseizure therapy, and continuous EEG, where neurologists and neurocritical care teams are central to diagnosis, escalation, and ongoing management decisions including anesthetic coma for refractory cases [^114ePB1U] [^112JFgpD] [^1142yuZ4] [^1126wWG9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, refractory disease often demands more than routine outpatient care; drug-resistant epilepsy is specifically funneled to comprehensive epilepsy centers where neurologists coordinate multidisciplinary evaluations for surgery, neuromodulation, and rescue strategies, reducing misdiagnosis and pseudopharmacoresistance and improving outcomes when referrals are timely [^113w9mKZ] [^111nUEzy].

> I need to check specialized populations, because if I overgeneralize I may miss nuances; in neonates and infants, child neurologists guide EEG-based diagnosis and staged antiseizure therapy per ILAE neonatal recommendations, and in mitochondrial epilepsies, neurologists follow consensus adaptations to general seizure guidelines, notably avoiding valproic acid in POLG-related disease and tailoring escalation strategies; post-stroke seizures and ICH bring further neurology-directed decisions around cEEG surveillance and judicious ASM use depending on context and evolving evidence [^115bguDu] [^114poxcJ] [^116WdkaC] [^113uMMGQ] [^112GV3or] [^1127psJ6].

> Next, I should review the typical care pathway and where neurology enters, to avoid oversimplifying "who handles what"; after initial ED stabilization of a first seizure, best practice includes neurologist referral for accurate classification, EEG, and MRI, with European audit and position papers specifically calling for reliable specialist referral as the norm and for clinics to see these patients promptly, while ongoing outpatient management of diagnosis confirmation, ASM titration, safety counseling, and escalation decisions rests with neurology [^112JSftW] [^115ErQQa] [^1124RL6o] [^113w9mKZ].

> Hold on, I should verify subspecialization within neurology, because complex seizures often require it; epileptologists and clinical neurophysiologists (neurologists with advanced EEG expertise) are integral to advanced diagnostics and presurgical planning, and child neurologists commonly lead management in pediatric epilepsy and seizure-prone neurodevelopmental conditions, underscoring that seizure care is not only "in neurology" but is also a mature subspecialty within it [^113w9mKZ] [^116ekSLC] [^114HfL6S].

> Let me reconsider the division of acute versus longitudinal responsibility to avoid overstating exclusivity; emergency physicians initiate stabilization and first-line benzodiazepines, then neurology typically directs second-line choices and ongoing evaluation in the ED and inpatient settings, with AAN/AES guidance informing recurrence risk counseling and long-term treatment decisions that are best delivered in neurology follow-up or epilepsy centers when appropriate [^111JdC5q] [^111nUoyE] [^113w9mKZ] [^112JSftW].

> But wait, what if someone argues that primary care or the ED can manage seizures entirely; I should double-check the guidance language; multiple sources emphasize that accurate epilepsy classification and access to investigations are specialist-led, and European audits identify gaps in specialist access as a quality deficit, reinforcing that while non-neurologists are essential in initial care, specialist neurology involvement is the recommended standard to ensure correct diagnosis, risk counseling, and optimal long-term outcomes [^112JSftW] [^115ErQQa] [^1124RL6o].

> Therefore, after checking identity, classification, explicit guideline roles, diagnostics, emergency protocols, subspecialization, and care pathways, I can conclude with confidence that yes — neurologists handle seizures, serving as the primary specialists for diagnosis, acute and chronic management, and coordination of multidisciplinary care across all settings and patient populations, with subspecialty epileptologists leading advanced and drug-resistant cases [^113w9mKZ].

Neurologists are the **primary specialists** who handle seizures [^111nUoyE]. They perform the initial evaluation, order and interpret EEG [^112JSftW] and neuroimaging [^115qWu4D], and start antiseizure medications [^112JmHid]. Neurologists manage acute seizures and status epilepticus [^111JdC5q], and **coordinate care with epilepsy centers** for drug-resistant cases [^113w9mKZ]. They also provide patient education [^113w9mKZ], safety counseling, and long-term follow-up to optimize seizure control and quality of life [^112JmHid].

## Diagnostic approach by neurologists

Neurologists use a **structured approach** to diagnose seizures and epilepsy:

| **Diagnostic step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Clinical history | Detailed account of seizure events [^112JSftW], triggers, and family history |
| Physical examination | Comprehensive neurologic exam to identify deficits or underlying conditions [^112JSftW] |
| EEG | Detects epileptiform activity and helps classify seizure type [^112JSftW] |
| Neuroimaging | MRI or CT [^113CL9ac] to identify structural abnormalities or lesions [^115qWu4D] |
| Laboratory tests | Identify metabolic or infectious causes of seizures [^112JSftW] |

---

## Treatment strategies employed by neurologists

Neurologists use **evidence-based strategies** to manage seizures:

- **Antiseizure medications (ASMs)**: First-line therapy tailored to seizure type and patient factors [^111nUoyE] [^1125N4vu].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Counseling on sleep, stress, alcohol, and adherence to reduce seizures [^1125N4vu].

- **Surgical interventions**: Referral to epilepsy centers [^113w9mKZ] for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) [^111nUEzy].

- **Neuromodulation therapies**: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or responsive neurostimulation (RNS) for refractory seizures [^113w9mKZ].

---

## Collaboration with other healthcare professionals

Neurologists **collaborate with other professionals** to provide comprehensive care [^113w9mKZ]:

- **Epileptologists**: For complex or refractory epilepsy.

- **Neurosurgeons**: For surgical evaluation and intervention.

- **Primary care physicians**: For overall health and comorbidity management.

- **Psychologists and psychiatrists**: For mental health and cognitive issues.

- **Nurses and allied health professionals**: For patient education and support.

---

## Special considerations in seizure management

Neurologists address **special considerations in seizure management** by collaborating with pediatric neurologists for age-specific care in children [^114cB5p1]. They provide rapid, guideline-based escalation for status epilepticus [^111GDKzH] and refer patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to comprehensive epilepsy centers for advanced therapies [^113w9mKZ].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Neurologists provide **education and counseling on seizure control** [^1125N4vu], emphasizing medication adherence and trigger avoidance. They also counsel on safety measures, including driving, occupational safety, and lifestyle adjustments [^1125N4vu]. They address quality of life by discussing psychosocial issues and available support resources [^113w9mKZ].

### Epilepsy: A clinical overview [^1125N4vu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of seizures and epilepsy are common tasks for physicians. Approximately 1 in 10 people will experience a seizure during their lifetime. Epilepsy is characterized by the tendency to have unprovoked seizures and is the fourth most common neurological disorder. It affects 1 in 26 people in the United States and 65 million people worldwide. The evaluation of a patient presenting with a seizure involves excluding underlying neurological or medical conditions, classifying the seizure type, and determining if the patient has epilepsy. Proper treatment requires an accurate diagnosis of the epilepsy type and syndrome and the use of medication that is both effective and free of adverse effects. Most patients can achieve complete seizure control with medication; however, if medication is unsuccessful, surgical treatment may be an option. Special situations in the care of people with epilepsy include status epilepticus, women with epilepsy, older adults, and safety issues.

### Evaluation following a first seizure in adults [^112JSftW]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on first seizure in adults:

- **Definition**: A first seizure in adults refers to a single, spontaneous episode of abnormal neuronal activity resulting in transient neurologic dysfunction. It may be classified as either provoked (acute symptomatic) or unprovoked, depending on the presence of an identifiable acute cause.

- **Pathophysiology**: Seizures arise from abnormal, synchronous electrical discharges within the cerebral cortex, reflecting an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. Mechanistically, seizures involve re-excitatory synaptic activity and loss of coordinated signaling between neuronal populations. This cortical disorganization leads to transient neurologic dysfunction. In prolonged seizures, normal homeostatic mechanisms may become impaired, exacerbating metabolic stress, altering cerebral perfusion, and increasing the risk of neuronal injury. The pathophysiology varies depending on whether the seizure is provoked (due to acute metabolic, infectious, or structural insults) or unprovoked, which may involve chronic or idiopathic mechanisms including genetic predisposition or remote cerebral injury.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of a first seizure in adults ranges from 23 to 61 cases per 100,000 person-years, with the risk increasing significantly after age 55 and peaking in individuals older than 75. The lifetime risk of experiencing a seizure is up to 10%, while only about 3% of adults are ultimately diagnosed with epilepsy. The rate of first seizures is higher in low- and middle-income environments.

### Guidelines for specialized epilepsy centers: Executive summary of the report of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers Guideline Panel [^113w9mKZ]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurologic conditions worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 3.4 million persons in the United States. Epilepsy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life, and far-reaching socioeconomic implications. These risks are further elevated for approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy who have refractory seizures despite treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs), categorized as drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). As such, national and international professional organizations advocate for comprehensive epilepsy centers to provide both routine and highly specialized care for people with epilepsy (PWE).

Comprehensive epilepsy care requires infrastructure encompassing inpatient and outpatient settings, as well as the organization of a multidisciplinary care team spanning both environments. Patient-centered care begins with accurate diagnosis and pharmacologic treatment of seizures, epilepsy-related education, screening and/or management of comorbid conditions, and provision of psychosocial resources for patients and caregivers.

The National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC) is a nonprofit association in the United States with a membership of more than 260 epilepsy centers. NAEC published its first guidelines in 1990 to provide a basic framework for services, personnel, and facilities for in-patient care. Each decade since then, updated guidelines have expanded content to include epilepsy surgery considerations, interdisciplinary care approaches, and safety and quality measures.

### Agreement between initial and final diagnosis of first seizures, epilepsy and non-epileptic events: a prospective study [^111o5zJ1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Differentiating between first seizure, epilepsy, and a non-epileptic event is a challenging clinical exercise for many physicians as it may lead to different therapeutic implications. This study aims to investigate the agreement between the initial diagnosis at the accident and emergency (A&E) department and the final diagnosis following inpatient neurological evaluation of seizure disorders.

- **Method**: A prospective observational study between April 2004 and June 2005 in a regional hospital in Hong Kong recruited 1701 patients from the A&E to neurology/medical wards with initial diagnoses/labels matching any one of 12 predefined keywords which were categorized as either "seizure specific" or "non-specific".

- **Results**: Among the 1170 patients with "non-specific" initial diagnoses/labels, 58 (5%) were finally diagnosed as having had a first seizure or epilepsy. Among 531 patients with "seizure specific" initial diagnoses/labels, 27 (5.1%) were subsequently diagnosed as having had non-epileptic events. The kappa value for agreement between the initial and final diagnosis was 0.88. Of the 154 patients with a final diagnosis of first seizure, 34 (22%) had "non-specific" initial labels. Among these patients, components of the evaluation contributing to the revision of diagnosis included retrieval of witness accounts (47%), epileptiform discharges on EEG (47%), short-term monitoring in patients suspected of acute symptomatic seizures (28%), and panel discussion of cases (22%).

- **Conclusion**: There was generally a high degree of agreement between the initial and final diagnosis.

### Why can seizures remain intractable? Clinical vignettes from the life experience of a pediatric epileptologist [^1125LKo1]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Most childhood seizures can be controlled by the appropriate antiepileptic drugs. When seizures remain intractable in a normally developing child with an intact neurologic examination, it is usually possible to identify a clear reason, and the physician, like a detective, needs to investigate and reveal it. In this article, we will describe cases that were encountered during a lifetime at a pediatric epilepsy clinic, which will illustrate the different reasons seizures remain intractable in patients who do not have structural abnormalities or resistant epileptic syndromes.

### Epilepsy emergency rescue training [^113CiA74]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend immediate treatment for people with epilepsy (PWE) where there is a proven risk of seizures becoming life-threatening, such as seizures lasting more than five minutes that may progress to status epilepticus (SE) and/or neurological morbidity. Seizures that last more than five minutes are less likely to terminate spontaneously. Timely treatment depends on the presence of another person, such as a family member or paid carer, who is trained to recognize the situation, analyze it as trained, and then administer rescue medication. The Joint Epilepsy Council guidelines on epilepsy training aim to address this need.

However, several challenges are recognized:

- **Regional variation**: There are disparities in service provision across the UK.
- **Trainer knowledge**: The diverse range of trainer specialties may affect their depth of knowledge about epilepsy.
- **Training structure**: There is a lack of clear structure for training, including training duration, topics to be covered, feedback systems for both the training and the trainer, etc.
- **Trainer competencies**: There is a lack of clear structure to check and support trainer competencies, such as through peer groups and good practice portfolios.
- **Trainee backgrounds**: Trainee groups, including paramedics, family members, and paid carers, come from diverse backgrounds.
- **Duty of care**: Responsibilities are unclear, especially given the poor understanding of outcomes, such as the high risk of death when procedures are not followed correctly.
- **Complex pathways**: The involvement of different groups and agencies, such as specialists, general practitioners (GPs), family, and paid carers, requires a structured reaction process.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European Audit of Seizure Management in Hospitals [^115ErQQa]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Specialist services can provide a firm diagnosis, access to investigations, and a management plan that includes the use of rescue therapy, as well as expectations for ambulances and EDs for that individual. Given the EuroNASH findings, it is suggested that there must be a reliable referral service to specialist advice, applicable to both first suspected seizures and known epilepsy cases. Guidance on managing and using investigations for those presenting to the ED with seizures is also needed.

- **Five-step approach**:
	- Create and agree on guidance on the management and use of investigations for those presenting to EDs due to a seizure. This multidisciplinary issue must include collaboration among relevant clinical disciplines, managers, and patients or representatives. This process should identify metrics and quality standards against which performance can be assessed.

- **Guidance document for specialist referral**:
	- Create and agree on a guidance document for all hospitals to make specialist referral the norm, using the same multidisciplinary approach as above.

- **Referral process**:
	- Create a process by which referral can be easily achieved and incorporated into the workings of local hospitals with minimal effort. Patient issues, such as transport, must also be considered. Better use of information technology could facilitate this.

- **Epilepsy clinic service**:
	- Ensure that the epilepsy clinic service can receive these referrals and see the patients within a short time period, which may have staffing implications in many countries.

### Medical therapy of epilepsy: When to initiate treatment and when to combine [^113vRDEF]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Most patients reporting more than one well-documented or witnessed seizure require prophylactic antiepileptic therapy (AED). Patients with an underlying brain disorder and/or an abnormal electroencephalogram should probably be treated after their first event. The goal should be the maintenance of a normal lifestyle by complete seizure control with no or minimal side effects. Failure of the first AED due to lack of efficacy implies refractoriness, and a policy of consecutive substitutions is unlikely to be an effective strategy. Thus, if the first or second monotherapy improves control but does not produce seizure freedom, an AED with different and perhaps multiple mechanisms of action should be added.

- **Combining drugs**: Strategies for combining drugs should involve individual assessment of patient-related factors, including seizure type and epilepsy syndrome classifications coupled with an understanding of the pharmacology, side effects, and interaction profile of the AEDs. Reducing the dose of one or more AEDs may help accommodate the introduction of a second or third drug.

An orderly approach to the pharmacological management and, when appropriate, surgical investigations for each epilepsy syndrome will optimize the chance of perfect seizure control and help more people achieve safer and more fulfilled lives.

### Optimizing the diagnosis and management of Dravet syndrome: Recommendations from a North American consensus panel [^113TTEk5]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To establish standards for early, cost-effective, and accurate diagnosis; optimal therapies for seizures; and recommendations for the evaluation and management of comorbidities for children and adults with Dravet syndrome, a modified Delphi process was utilized.

- **Methods**: An expert panel was convened, comprising epileptologists with nationally recognized expertise in Dravet syndrome and parents of children with Dravet syndrome. The panelists' experience and understanding were enhanced by their active roles in Dravet syndrome associations. Panelists were asked to base their responses to questions both on their clinical expertise and results of a literature review that was forwarded to each panelist. Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted to identify areas of consensus and the strength of that consensus, as well as areas of contention.

- **Results**: The panel consisted of 13 physicians and five family members. Strong consensus was reached regarding the typical clinical presentation of Dravet syndrome, the range of electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging findings, the need for genetic testing, and critical information that should be conveyed to families at diagnosis. Additionally, priorities for seizure control and the typical degree of control, seizure triggers and recommendations for avoidance, first- and second-line therapies for seizures, requirement and indications for rescue therapy, specific recommendations for comorbidity screening, and the need for family support were agreed upon. Consensus was not as strong regarding later therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy, and specific therapies.

### Implementation of a febrile seizure guideline in two pediatric emergency departments [^116VXZJq]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Despite the typically benign nature of febrile seizures, a large number of children with simple febrile seizures are overinvestigated and overtreated, according to the personal clinical experience of the treating doctors. The study objective was to analyze the effect of implementing an evidence-based medicine guideline on the management of febrile seizures in two European pediatric emergency departments. After the introduction of a selected guideline, we analyzed the change in hospitalization rate and in the rate of execution of blood exams in children presenting with febrile seizures.

Included in the study were 483 children. Clinical characteristics of seizures were similar both before and after implementation. Clinical management was modified after guideline introduction, because the hospitalization rate significantly decreased (respectively, from 57.3% to 20.5%, and from 16.9% to 3.2%), without any concomitant increase in readmission rate. Readmission cases were never due to severe bacterial infections. The proportion of patients who received blood examinations decreased significantly.

We conclude that in both of the emergency departments studied, the introduction of a guideline on febrile seizures positively modified clinical management. The availability of a guideline contributed to accelerating the process of improving welfare and positively influenced the quality of care.

### Neonatal seizures: Treatment practices among term and preterm infants [^114JCz8r]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures are common clinical conditions in both term and preterm neonates, yet no clinical management guidelines for direct care exist. We surveyed 193 international neurologists, neonatologists, and specialists in neonatal neurology or neonatal neurocritical care to assess management practices for seizures in preterm and term neonates. We found high reported rates of electroencephalogram and amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) monitoring to detect neonatal seizures, prevalent use of older anticonvulsant agents, and high rates of neuroimaging.

Overall, responses were similar for term and preterm neonates. However, term neonates were likelier to be more heavily investigated, with higher use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram and aEEG monitoring of at-risk neonates. Continuous monitoring and cranial imaging of neonatal seizures now comprise the standard of care in many centers, although management practices vary widely.

Early recognition and management of neonatal seizures and possible underlying injury may lead to increased opportunities for stopping seizures, protecting the brain, and improving developmental outcomes in at-risk neonates. The need for collaboration among neonatologists and neurologists is urgent to address gaps in knowledge regarding the management of neonatal seizures in term and preterm neonates.

### Evidence-based guideline: Treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults: Report of the guideline committee of the American Epilepsy Society [^1178G8kB]. Epilepsy Currents (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of status epilepticus, the AES 2016 guidelines recommend the administration of fosphenytoin, valproic acid, or levetiracetam. This urgent therapy should be initiated when the seizure duration reaches 20 minutes. The response or lack of response to the second therapy should be concluded by the 40-minute mark.

### EFNS guideline on the management of status epilepticus in adults [^1142yuZ4]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding medical management specifically for initial treatment of status epilepticus, the EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend the following general management approaches for generalized convulsive, complex partial, and subtle status epilepticus (SE):

- **Assessment and control of the airways and ventilation**: Ensure airway management and provide supplemental oxygen if needed.

- **Arterial blood gas monitoring**: Evaluate for metabolic acidosis and hypoxia, which may require immediate intervention.

- **ECG and BP monitoring**: Regularly monitor the electrocardiogram and blood pressure.

- **IV glucose and thiamine**: Administer as required to prevent complications.

- **Emergency measurement of antiepileptic drug levels**: Assess to ensure therapeutic levels are achieved quickly.

- **Electrolytes and magnesium**: Monitor to avoid imbalances that could exacerbate the condition.

- **Full hematological screen, hepatic, and renal function tests**: Conduct these tests to comprehensively evaluate the patient's condition.

### Status epilepticus: What's new [^116Wvszw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The emergent evaluation and treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus present challenges for emergency physicians. This disease is one of the few in which minutes can mean the difference between life and significant morbidity and mortality. It is imperative to use parallel processing and have multiple treatment options planned in advance, in case the treatment is not successful. There is also benefit to exploring or initiating treatment algorithms to standardize care for these critically ill patients.

### Navigating barriers to epilepsy surgery: A national survey of patient and neurologist perspectives [^117PFWXY]. Neurosurgical Focus (2025). Low credibility.

Epilepsy surgery is underutilized globally due to patient and/or caregiver reluctance and neurologist knowledge gaps. In Pakistan, the treatment gap is 70%-94% for medically refractory epilepsy (MRE). This study assessed the knowledge and practices of neurologists and patients to identify barriers to adequate epilepsy surgery provision in Pakistan.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study consisting of two surveys. One survey was designed for epilepsy patients and their caregivers. The medical records of patients diagnosed with epilepsy at the authors' hospital between July 2018 and December 2020 were retrieved from the neurophysiology database. Patients or their caregivers were then contacted via telephone to complete the survey. The second survey was designed for neurologists working in Pakistan, and this form was sent via email.

- **Results**: For the patient survey, 250 patients or caregivers were contacted, of whom 194 responded. The median age of the patients was 10 years (IQR 6–14 years). The authors found that 74.2% (n = 144) of the patients were unaware of surgical options in MRE. Furthermore, 48 (24.7%) patients/caregivers reported experiencing more than one seizure per month, and 29 (60.4%) of them were unaware of the surgical treatment. Seizures were disabling in 56.7% (n = 110) of the patients. Patients taking more antiepileptic drugs were significantly more likely to be aware of surgical options (p = 0.001). For the neurologist survey, only 6.6% (4/61) always discussed epilepsy surgery with MRE patients. Around half of the neurologists (n = 27, 44.3%) had never discussed it.

### Traditional and non-traditional treatments for autism spectrum disorder with seizures: An online survey [^114HfL6S]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Overall, for children with ASD in general, pediatricians managed medical and developmental issues. A child neurologist managed the medical and developmental issues of the majority of children with ASD and either clinical and/or subclinical seizures. The medical and developmental aspects of the child were managed, in part, by a doctor affiliated with Defeat Autism Now! in approximately one-third of children overall. It is clear from this data that multiple practitioners, in general, manage children with ASD, presumably due to the complexity of this disorder.

The great majority of children (i.e. > 88%) with clinical and subclinical seizures were diagnosed and managed, at least in part, by a child or adult neurologist. This is an encouraging finding, but it is important for all children with any type of seizure activity to be managed by an expert in seizures such as a neurologist or epileptologist. Over half of the control children with ASD were never evaluated for seizures.

Our recent study on subclinical discharges demonstrated that many of the children with such discharges have no specific symptoms except for delays in language development and features of ASD and/or attention deficit. Thus, it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for seizures, especially subclinical seizures, in children with ASD since the symptoms of subclinical seizures can be subtle. In addition, partial complex seizures, especially those that originate in the temporal or frontal lobes, can present as complex behaviors and automatisms.

### Management of status epilepticus: a narrative review [^1147M9fk]. Anaesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus causes prolonged or repetitive seizures that, if left untreated, can lead to neuronal injury, severe disability, coma, and death in pediatric and adult populations. While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes.

When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose, or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with an electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anesthetic wean. However, it is resource-intensive, costly, available only in highly specialized centers, and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications.

This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented, and comprehensive review of status epilepticus, including its definitions, etiologies, treatments, outcomes, and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: A systematic review of current randomised evidence [^116HoaUy]. Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

The mean age of participants in the four trials ranged from 48 years to 55.9 years in the active treatment arms and from 43.8 years to 53 years in the control groups. In all four trials, about half to three-quarters of the participants were male. In three of the included trials, the most common cause of convulsive status epilepticus was a sub-therapeutic level of antiepileptic drugs, while a brain lesion was reported as the most frequent cause in the fourth trial.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: The risk of bias assessments of individual trials are presented in Table 2, which provides a summary of the demographic characteristics of the participants enrolled in the four included trials. It includes definitions such as GCSE (generalised convulsive status epileptics), IM (intramuscular), IV (intravenous), NR (not reported), SD (standard deviation), and SE (status epilepticus). Additional details include criteria for GCSE entrance into the study and definitions for convulsive episodes witnessed in the emergency room.

These comprehensive assessments aim to evaluate potential biases affecting the validity of the trial results.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, particularly in the management of seizures, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding a full neurological evaluation in patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures following stimulant use if the seizures can be clearly attributed to substance use or withdrawal. Proceed with evaluation and management of seizures according to usual best practices when the cause of the seizures cannot be clearly attributed to stimulant use.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, and more specifically with respect to the management of seizures, the AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend considering obtaining continuous electroencephalography (≥ 24 hours). This is to diagnose electrographic seizures and epileptiform discharges in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who present with unexplained abnormal or fluctuating mental status or a suspicion of seizures.

### Management of seizures in patients with primary mitochondrial diseases: Consensus statement from the InterERNs Mitochondrial Working Group [^113u5XRw]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In this study, 24 experts from seven European countries, along with two patient representatives, convened to discuss the optimal management of seizures in patients with primary mitochondrial diseases (PMD). The aim was to assist clinicians and patients in decision-making, and it was agreed to follow the general National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for seizure management, with some minor modifications. It is important to emphasize that while consensus-based information provides useful guidance, decisions regarding seizure treatment in both children and adults should always be tailored to the specific needs and risks of each patient.

It is acknowledged that these recommendations are not evidence-based due, in part, to the inherent challenges of conducting clinical trials in rare diseases. Our comprehensive search of the European Clinical Trials Register revealed no ongoing or planned clinical trials focused on specific anti-seizure medications (ASMs) and PMDs. Although consensus methods are widely used to inform clinical practice in the absence of empirical data, expert judgment ranks low in the hierarchy of evidence. Our recommendations were derived from a consensus approach, based on clinical experience from leading mitochondrial clinical services and epileptic services that are part of the EpiCare European Reference Network (ERN) in several European countries, combined with the appraisal of existing literature. The goal was to provide transparent opinions based on the available studies and clinical evidence, and to prevent the unnecessary withholding of effective ASMs from patients with PMDs. It was unanimously agreed that the NICE guidelines should be applied to PMD, with the sole exception of valproic acid (VPA), which is absolutely contraindicated.

### Investigating and managing neonatal seizures in the UK: An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach [^1141t25k]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Consultants face many challenges when considering the cause of abnormal neonatal movements and need to reach a "point of certainty" before making a diagnosis of a seizure. A number of factors increase this degree of certainty, the main one being the ability to witness the events themselves. This is a challenge because consultants are typically called to review a baby after the event has stopped and find that junior medical or nursing staff provide bland "seizure types", which are often incorrect, instead of detailed descriptions of what happened.

This issue may arise from a cultural difference between neonatology and general pediatrics/neurology, where ictal phenomenology and the use of videos are essential parts of the diagnostic process. As a result, consultants often find that an abnormal neonatal event has already been attributed and treated as a seizure before they attend, without a consideration of differential diagnoses. This, along with the traditional classifications of seizure types in neonates as described by Volpe, may partly explain why over-diagnosis of neonatal seizures is common and why consultants believe diagnostic accuracy could be improved. They argue that even without neurophysiology support, a thorough approach to diagnosis could enhance accuracy. However, even if this is true, it would not improve diagnosis rates for the large majority of neonatal seizures, which have either subtle, brief, or no clinical features at all. This supports calls for reliance on neurophysiological techniques in diagnosing neonatal seizures.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic management of a first unprovoked seizure in children and adolescents with a focus on the revised diagnostic criteria for epilepsy [^112mZVWB]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Unprovoked seizures are defined as those not precipitated by identifiable factors, such as fever or trauma. A thorough history and physical examination are essential in caring for pediatric patients with a potential first unprovoked seizure. This involves reviewing differential diagnosis, EEG, neuroimaging, laboratory tests, and the initiation of treatment. Treatment is typically initiated after two unprovoked seizures or after one seizure in select patients with distinct epilepsy syndromes. The recent expansion of the definition of epilepsy by the ILAE allows for the diagnosis of epilepsy to be made after the first seizure if the clinical presentation and supporting diagnostic studies suggest a greater than 60% chance of a second seizure. This review summarizes the literature on the diagnostic and therapeutic management of first unprovoked seizures in children and adolescents while considering the revised diagnostic criteria of epilepsy.

Regarding patient education for a first seizure in adults, the AAN/AES 2015 guidelines recommend advising patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include:

- **Prior brain insult**: Such as a stroke or trauma.
- **EEG with epileptiform abnormalities**.
- **Significant brain-imaging abnormality**.
- **Nocturnal seizure**.

These factors should be clearly communicated to patients during general counseling.

### Management of seizures in patients with primary mitochondrial diseases: Consensus statement from the InterERNs Mitochondrial Working Group [^11487wGX]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) are common inborn errors of energy metabolism, with an estimated prevalence of one in 4,300. These disorders typically affect tissues with high energy requirements, including the heart, muscle, and brain. Epilepsy may be the presenting feature of PMD, can be difficult to treat, and often represents a poor prognostic feature. The aim of this study was to develop guidelines and consensus recommendations on safe medication use and seizure management in mitochondrial epilepsy.

A panel of 24 experts in mitochondrial medicine, pharmacology, and epilepsy management of adults and/or children, along with two patient representatives from seven countries, was established. Experts were members of five different European Reference Networks, known as the Mito InterERN Working Group. A Delphi technique was used to allow the panellists to consider draft recommendations on safe medication use and seizure management in mitochondrial epilepsy, using two rounds with predetermined levels of agreement.

A high level of consensus was reached regarding the safety of 14 out of all 25 drugs reviewed, resulting in the endorsement of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for seizure management, with some modifications. Exceptions, including valproic acid in POLG disease, vigabatrin in patients with γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency, and topiramate in patients at risk for renal tubular acidosis, were highlighted.

These consensus recommendations describe our intent to improve seizure control.

### Treatment of seizures in the neonate: Guidelines and consensus-based recommendations-special report from the ILAE Task Force on Neonatal Seizures [^115bguDu]. Epilepsia (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for neonatal seizures, specifically with respect to antiepileptic drugs, the 2023 ILAE guidelines recommend considering the administration of a sodium channel blocker, such as phenytoin or carbamazepine, depending on the clinical condition of the neonate. This decision should take into account whether the neonate is critically ill or otherwise well, as well as the regional availability of antiseizure medication and the ability to monitor drug levels. Sodium channel blockers are recommended as a second-line antiseizure medication if channelopathy is suspected as the etiology for seizures based on clinical or EEG features.

### Classifying epilepsy pragmatically: Past, present, and future [^111sf9h1]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Low credibility.

The classification of epilepsy is essential for people with epilepsy and their families, healthcare providers, physicians, and researchers. The International League Against Epilepsy proposed updated seizure and epilepsy classifications in 2017, while another four-dimensional epilepsy classification was updated in 2019. An Integrated Epilepsy Classification system was proposed in 2020.

Existing classifications, however, lack consideration of important pragmatic factors relevant to the day-to-day life of people with epilepsy and stakeholders. Despite promising developments, consideration of comorbidities in brain development, genetic causes, and environmental triggers of epilepsy remains largely user-dependent in existing classifications.

Demographics of epilepsy have changed over time, while existing classification schemes exhibit caveats. A pragmatic classification scheme should incorporate these factors to provide a nuanced classification. Validation across disparate contexts will ensure widespread applicability and ease of use.

A team-based approach may simplify communication between healthcare personnel, while an individual-centered perspective may empower people with epilepsy. Together, incorporating these elements into a modern but pragmatic classification scheme may ensure optimal care for people with epilepsy by emphasizing cohesiveness among its myriad users. Technological advancements such as 7T MRI, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence may affect future classification efforts.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^114H9BGX]. Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Two review authors (MC, MI) independently screened all citations identified by the search strategies, retrieved, and assessed for eligibility all potentially relevant full-text articles. The same review authors extracted data on study design, participant characteristics (number of participants in each group, demographic information), characteristics of intervention (provider, dose, and route of administration), and comparator intervention. The risk of bias in included trials was assessed by the same review authors using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Each risk of bias domain was assessed separately for objective and subjective outcomes. For the risk-of-bias assessment, we categorized seizure cessation, recurrence of seizure, and respiratory depression (without ventilation) as subjective outcomes and mortality and respiratory depression (requiring ventilation) as objective outcomes.

At all stages of the study selection and data collection process, disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus or referred to a third review author (CC or MB).

We planned to conduct random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses; however, due to the limited number of identified trials and their heterogeneity in terms of treatment comparisons and reported outcomes, this proved unfeasible. We also considered conducting a systematic review of economic evaluations but failed to identify sufficient evidence in the literature. Results of each included study were tabulated and summarized narratively for each.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^111Vi2mk]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a common cause of persistent and disabling neurological symptoms. These symptoms are varied and include abnormal control of movement, episodes of altered awareness resembling epileptic seizures, and abnormal sensation. They are often comorbid with chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive symptoms. There is increasing evidence for the role of neurologists in both the assessment and management of FND.

The aim of this review is to discuss strategies for the management of FND by focusing on the diagnostic discussion and general principles, as well as specific treatment strategies for various FND symptoms. It highlights the role of the neurologist and proposes a structure for an interdisciplinary FND service.

### Wearable sensors in paediatric neurology [^113kAYYu]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Early and accurate seizure detection can improve the quality of life for patients with epilepsy by enabling better seizure management, facilitating preventive measures, reducing anxiety, and allowing greater participation in daily life activities. The consulted literature explores diverse sensor modalities, including accelerometry, electrocardiography, electrodermal activity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), electroencephalography, and electromyography, to detect seizure-related changes.

- **Epilepsy and seizure**:
	- Subtle alterations in EDA signal entropy in a group of individuals with epilepsy suggest that it could serve as an indicator of seizure risk. Significant changes in PPG features during the pre-seizure period of focal impaired awareness seizures were associated with autonomic changes related to seizures. Similarly, PPG signals during generalized tonic–clonic seizures exhibited noticeable alterations in amplitude and frequency before and after seizures.

Combining accelerometry and PPG data achieved superior results compared with using only a single data type, demonstrating better-than-chance seizure detection for nine seizure types. A deep-learning-based model using accelerometer and PPG fusion reached high sensitivity, detecting 19 of 28 seizure types. Seizure forecasting, using EDA, accelerometry, body temperature, and PPG, was more accurate than random guessing in about half of the assessed patients. Performance improved with more training data, suggesting that integrating data from a wider range of patients could enhance predictability and reliability in seizure detection.

### How not to read an EEG: Concluding statements [^116ekSLC]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A neurologist undergoes four years of postgraduate education after medical school to specialize in the clinical practice of disorders of the nervous system. Seizures are an inextricable component of that education due to the sheer prevalence of encounters. In contrast, the time spent on EEG interpretation is typically 0 to 3 months. The exposure and experiences acquired during training establish our knowledge base of clinical neurophysiology. Most practicing neurologists are required to utilize EEG in clinical practice. Limited exposure or experience in EEG interpretation during training translates to persistent inexperience in clinical practice.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: A systematic review of current randomised evidence [^116XrDxK]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epileptic attack and a life-threatening neurological emergency, associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. The clinical manifestation of convulsive status epilepticus is characterized by a prolonged tonic-clonic seizure or repetitive seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them.

Epidemiological studies have documented a global annual incidence of status epilepticus of 7 to 41 cases per 100,000 population. In Europe, the annual incidence of status epilepticus lies between 10 and 16 per 100,000 population, and convulsive status epilepticus accounts for 45–74% of all cases. The incidence of convulsive status epilepticus tends to be higher in males than females. Mortality of status epilepticus has been reported to range from around 8–33% according to etiology, with older age being a detrimental factor. A recent meta-analysis of convulsive status epilepticus in high-income countries reported pooled mortality of 15.9%, and the authors noted that survival rates have not improved over the last 30 years.

The ultimate goal of treatment is to stop both clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity as soon as possible, as convulsive status epilepticus can worsen with delayed or suboptimal treatment. Early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, and with a greater proportion of terminated seizures upon arrival at the hospital emergency department.

The first-line treatment of status epilepticus is currently benzodiazepine.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European Audit of Seizure Management in Hospitals [^1124RL6o]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This position paper makes recommendations following an audit of care provided to people presenting with a seizure to emergency departments (EDs) in Europe.

- **Methods**: Participating countries were asked to include five hospitals agreeing to identify 50 consecutive seizure patients presenting to their ED between 1 August 2016 and 31 August 2017. Anonymous data were collected in a web database. Where quoted, percentages are mean site values and ranges are the 10th-90th percentile.

- **Results**: Data were collected on 2204 ED visits (47 sites, up to six per country, across 15 countries): 1270 (58%) had known epilepsy, 299 (14%) had previous blackouts but no epilepsy diagnosis, and 634 (29%) presented with a first seizure. Wide variability was identified for most variables. Of those with known epilepsy, 41.2% (range 26.2%-59.6%) attended the ED in the previous 12 months, but only 64.7% (range 37.2%-79.8%) had seen an epilepsy specialist in the previous 12 months. 67.7% (range 34.0%-100%) were admitted, with 53.1% to a neurology ward (range 0.0%-88.9%). Only 37.5% of first seizure patients (range 0.0%-71.4%) were given advice about driving.

- **Conclusions and recommendations**: It is recommended that in Europe guidance is agreed on the management and onward referral of those presenting to the ED with a seizure. A referral process should be created that can be easily implemented. It should be ensured that the seizure services receive referrals and see the patients within a short time period. Additionally, a simple system should be developed and implemented to allow continuous monitoring of key indices of epilepsy care.

### Status epilepticus protocol variation across accredited National Association of Epilepsy Centers members [^116XAK3f]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency that requires urgent recognition and medical management. SE management remains heterogeneous across centers.

- **Methods**: We analyzed SE treatment protocols from level 3 and level 4 epilepsy centers. Discrete data, including stabilization measures, timing of treatment phases, medications, doses, and routes of administration were collected from each protocol and described using frequency for categorical variables and median for continuous variables. The distribution of treatment times and dosing were compared with the AES guideline.

- **Results**: A total of 256 SE treatment protocols were included. Only 66% of SE protocols detailed treatment times. Doses below recommendations occurred in 4% of protocols for initial benzodiazepine (BZD) and 14% for first non-BZD medications. Infusion therapy was outlined in 61% of protocols.

- **Discussion**: Despite the importance of timeliness in SE management, one third of institutional protocols did not specify treatment times. This analysis of US hospital inpatient SE protocols provides expert opinion regarding infusion therapy management and highlights gaps and targets for improvement in SE treatment.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European Audit of Seizure Management in Hospitals [^114BtNGb]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

There was substantial variation in the percentage of patients admitted (e.g. group 1 range: 27.5%–100% and group 3 range: 41.7%–100%) and in the type of ward to which they were admitted (e.g. in group 1, 0%–93.5% were admitted to a neurology ward). The median length of stay was 3 days (range 1–11 days) for both first seizure (group 3) patients and those with an existing epilepsy diagnosis (group 1).

Data collection on advice given to patients about driving or the management of future seizures allowed for the broadest definition; for example, the driving standard advice was based on establishing either that the person was a non‐driver or that advice was given to drivers. Even with this broad definition, there is still wide variation across sites (e.g. group 3 mean: 37.5%, range: 0%–71.4%).

- **Referral for specialist neurology input**: Included both inpatient assessment and referral to outpatient services. For group 3 (first seizure patients), this varied between 35.7% and 89.5% across sites. Referral rates were higher for group 1 (55.0%–96.3%) and group 2 (50.0%–100.0%) patients. Patients were more likely to be referred if younger (79.0% aged under 60 vs. 62.3% if older) and if they were recorded as having had an alcoholic binge (83.5% vs. 72.6%).

Variability among sites is further illustrated in Figure 1, which shows results for recording temperature, contacting an eyewitness, CT and MRI imaging, providing driving advice, and making a specialist referral.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European audit of seizure management in hospitals [^112uiSKA]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Our overarching aim is to provide data that can inform programs of quality improvement in epilepsy care, leveraging experience from other clinical disciplines. For example, collecting reliable up-to-date data on 'time to needle' in the UK led to the proportion of acute myocardial infarctions receiving thrombolysis within 30 minutes rising from less than 35% to nearly 80% with substantial benefit in survival outcomes. This improvement was enabled by the Central Cardiac Audit Database led by the Royal College of Physicians, established in 1998 to measure the 'time to needle'. Cardiologists, ambulance teams, and patient organizations collaborated to establish a minimum dataset needed to address the question; each hospital entered its own data and had access to a comparative report on a daily basis showing performance over time and in comparison to neighboring sites. In just over 2 years, all UK hospitals were participating.

Success factors included:

- **Shared buy-in** from professionals and patient groups.
- **Introduction of thrombolysis nurses**: These nurses played a crucial role in the project.
- **Instant feedback in the public domain**: This facilitated transparency and accountability.

That project has continued and successfully expanded to cover other aspects of cardiology. There were similar achievements in stroke care supported by national audit, leading to the creation of stroke units across the country, with benefits in outcomes.

In 2011, these achievements led some of the investigators to wonder if it would be possible to apply these approaches to epilepsy, and the UK NASH was born. A seizure presenting to hospital was the starting point from which…

### Management of status epilepticus [^113Dzohe]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is an increasingly recognized public health problem in the United States. It is associated with a high mortality rate, largely contingent on the duration of the condition before initial treatment, the etiology, and the age of the patient. Treatment is evolving as new medications become available. Three new preparations — fosphenytoin, rectal diazepam, and parenteral valproate — have implications for the management of status epilepticus. However, randomized controlled trials show that benzodiazepines (in particular, diazepam and lorazepam) should be the initial drug therapy in patients with status epilepticus.

Despite the paucity of clinical trials comparing medication regimens for acute seizures, there is broad consensus that immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this condition. Moreover, investigators have reported that status epilepticus often is not considered in patients with altered consciousness in the intensive care setting. In patients with persistent alteration of consciousness for which there is no clear etiology, physicians should be more quickly prepared to obtain electroencephalography to identify status epilepticus. Physicians should rely on a standardized protocol for the management of status epilepticus to improve care for this neurologic emergency.

### Complex febrile seizures: A practical guide to evaluation and treatment [^114SpEh4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Febrile seizures are the most common type of childhood seizures, affecting 2% to 5% of children. A complex febrile seizure is characterized by focal onset, occurrence more than once during a febrile illness, or lasting more than 10 to 15 minutes. Confusion still exists on the proper evaluation of a child presenting with a complex febrile seizure. There are ongoing research attempts to determine the link between complex febrile seizures and epilepsy. Further clarification and understanding of this disorder would be of great benefit to primary care providers and child neurologists.

### New-onset seizure in adults and adolescents: A review [^113S44p1]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately 8% to 10% of the population will experience a seizure during their lifetime, but only about 2% to 3% of these individuals will develop epilepsy. Understanding the underlying etiology leading to an accurate diagnosis is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment and that patients with low risk for recurrence are not treated unnecessarily.

Patients can present with new-onset seizure for various reasons, such as acute symptomatic seizures due to acute brain injury or metabolic derangements, or unprovoked seizures that are the initial manifestation of epilepsy. A patient history and physical examination may identify features more consistent with an epileptic event, and laboratory studies and brain imaging can identify an acute insult contributing to the presentation. Patients diagnosed with first-time unprovoked seizure require electroencephalography and epilepsy protocol-specific magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, which includes thin-cut coronal slices to determine the risk of recurrence and the need for long-term treatment. In patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of epilepsy, selecting an appropriate antiepileptic medication, with consideration of comorbidities, adverse effect profile, and type of epilepsy, is essential along with appropriate counseling.

Approximately 3% of the population will develop epilepsy, but 2 to 3 times as many patients will experience a single seizure or seizure-like event. A diagnosis of epilepsy has significant medical, social, and emotional consequences, highlighting the importance of a careful patient history.

### Treatment of physicians with epilepsy [^111sYs5F]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Physicians with epilepsy (physician-patients) are an understudied, unique patient population due to the potential adverse outcomes that seizures or medication side effects might have on patients under their care, as well as their ability to modify treatments without consulting treating physicians. We examine the effect epilepsy has upon physician-patients as well as surveying epileptologists on their views and experiences in treating physician-patients.

- **Methods**: We reviewed charts to assess the clinical course of all physician-patients treated and distributed a questionnaire to active physician-patients at our epilepsy center. We surveyed epileptologists throughout the United States on their experience and views on treating physician-patients.

- **Results**: Seventy-three percent of responding physician-patients experienced seizures while in a medical setting, 55% while interacting with patients, and 18% during invasive procedures. Eighteen percent of physician-patients felt seizures impacted their work, and 9% were on disability secondary to epilepsy. Among epileptologists surveyed, 35% would counsel and manage physician-patients differently than other patients, and 26% favored establishing guidelines or regulations governing physician-patients. The majority of physician-patients and one-third of epileptologists felt that physician-patients were most analogous to professions that are currently regulated by the federal government.

- **Conclusion**: This study highlights the diverse ways that epilepsy can affect physician-patients and the challenges that arise in treating this population.

### Evidence-based guideline: Management of an unprovoked first seizure in adults: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society [^112JmHid]. Neurology (2015). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for a first seizure in adults, specifically with respect to general counseling, the AAN/AES 2015 guidelines recommend advising patients that although immediate antiepileptic drug therapy, compared to delaying treatment until a second seizure occurs, is likely to reduce the risk of seizure recurrence within 2 years following a first seizure, it may not improve the quality of life.

### Acute symptomatic seizures in the emergency room: Predictors and characteristics [^113kbuo7]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Epileptic seizures are among the most common neurological conditions leading to presentations in the emergency room (ER). With respect to rough etiological groups, epileptic fits are dichotomized into acute symptomatic seizures (ASS) and unprovoked seizures (US). ASS are defined as occurring in close temporal and likely causal relationship to an acute cerebral or systemic impairment of structural, metabolic, toxic, infectious, or inflammatory origin. The conceptual reason why ASS and US are differentiated is due to long-term prognosis regarding seizure recurrence.

A patient with a US and a risk of at least 60% to develop seizures over the following decade is considered to have epilepsy. This 60% threshold is reached when a second US occurs more than 24 hours apart from the first US or if EEG and/or MRI findings after the first US indicate a significantly elevated risk of seizure recurrence. In contrast, ASS have a lower long-term recurrence risk, approximately 20% in the 10 years after the index seizure.

When treating a patient following a seizure in the ER, rapidly discerning ASS from US is pivotal, as the former may indicate the necessity of imminent management of the potentially life-threatening underlying condition. Separating ASS from a first US is also important from a long-term perspective, as administration of antiseizure medication (ASM) is handled differently. The two conditions also bear different psychosocial consequences, such as the duration of a driving ban.

In this study, we sought to evaluate predictors for ASS compared to US in patients presenting to the ER with an epileptic seizure.

### The management of status epilepticus [^1113okWo]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a major medical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is best defined as a continuous, generalized, convulsive seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, or as two or more seizures during which the patient does not return to baseline consciousness. Lorazepam, at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, is the drug of first choice for terminating status epilepticus. Patients who continue to have clinical or EEG evidence of seizure activity after treatment with lorazepam should be considered to have refractory status epilepticus and should be treated with a continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam. This article reviews information regarding the management of status epilepticus in adults.

### What can we do for people with drug-resistant epilepsy? The 2016 Wartenberg lecture [^111nUEzy]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for epilepsy include achieving no seizures and no side effects as soon as possible, but these goals are too often unmet. Approximately 1 million people in the United States continue to have seizures despite adequate treatment with antiseizure drugs. This group represents 40% of those with epilepsy and accounts for 80% of the cost associated with epilepsy. Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) can lead to developmental delay in infants and young children, as well as severe disability and morbidity in older children and adults, with a mortality rate 5–10 times higher than the general population.

While diagnosis and treatment at a full-service (levels 3 and 4) epilepsy center have been shown to improve seizure control, fewer than 1% of people with DRE are referred to these centers, and those who are referred arrive an average of over 20 years after the onset of habitual seizures. A possible reason for this underutilization is the misconception that surgery is the only service offered by these centers.

Full-service epilepsy centers are staffed by specialized multidisciplinary teams, which include:

- **Medical professionals**: Neurologists, clinical neurophysiologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists
- **Mental health experts**: Psychologists, psychiatrists
- **Support staff**: Social workers, counselors

These teams can recognize and address issues such as:

- **Pseudopharmacoresistance**: Due to nonadherence
- **Misdiagnosis and underlying conditions**: Seizures that are not epilepsy, treatable underlying conditions, misdiagnosis of epilepsy syndromes
- **Treatment errors**: Treatment with the wrong drug or wrong dosage
- **Lifestyle factors**: Addressing remediable lifestyle issues

In addition to surgical options, a variety of alternative treatment approaches are available for patients who continue to have seizures. Full-service epilepsy centers can provide comprehensive care tailored to the needs of each patient.

### Emergency seizure management [^1154wF99]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Seizures are a common presentation in both emergency departments and general pediatric practices. Epilepsy affects more than 3.4 million people nationwide, of which approximately 500,000 are children, with more than 200,000 first-time seizures each year. Of the affected individuals, as many as 100,000 are estimated to experience status epilepticus (SE). Both general practitioners and neurologists must be able to define, recognize, and treat seizure emergencies.

This review article defines and describes SE, discusses the emergency evaluation and management of SE that is both new-onset and breakthrough in people with epilepsy, reviews the treatment recommendations for SE in both home and hospital settings, and introduces special populations that may be at high risk for SE or other seizure emergencies.

### Care in Europe after presenting to the emergency department with a seizure; position paper and insights from the European Audit of Seizure Management in Hospitals [^1166VPoZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This position paper makes recommendations following an audit of care provided to people presenting with a seizure to emergency departments (EDs) in Europe.

- **Methods**: Participating countries were asked to include five hospitals agreeing to identify 50 consecutive seizure patients presenting to their ED between 1 August 2016 and 31 August 2017. Anonymous data were collected to a web database. Where quoted, percentages are mean site values and ranges are the 10th–90th centile.

- **Results**: Data were collected on 2204 ED visits (47 sites, up to six per country, across 15 countries): 1270 (58%) known epilepsy, 299 (14%) previous blackouts but no epilepsy diagnosis, and 634 (29%) with a first seizure. Wide variability was identified for most variables. Of those with known epilepsy, 41.2% (range 26.2%–59.6%) attended the ED in the previous 12 months, but only 64.7% (range 37.2%–79.8%) had seen an epilepsy specialist in the previous 12 months. In total, 67.7% (range 34.0%–100%) were admitted, with 53.1% admitted to a neurology ward (range 0.0%–88.9%). Only 37.5% of first seizure patients (range 0.0%–71.4%) were given advice about driving.

- **Conclusions and recommendations**: It is recommended that in Europe guidance is agreed on for the management and onward referral of those presenting to the ED with a seizure. A referral process should be created that can be easily implemented, ensuring that the seizure services receive referrals and see the patients within a short time period. Moreover, a simple system should be developed and implemented to allow continuous monitoring of key indices of epilepsy care.

### First: A practical approach to the causes and management of febrile seizures [^113bBN7k]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

During almost four decades of clinical practice in pediatrics and pediatric neurology, the senior authors have rarely made a formal presentation on the topic of "febrile seizures". In any large pediatric teaching hospital, questions about the diagnosis and management of febrile seizures are raised by medical students, pediatric residents, and both adult and pediatric neurology residents. The acronym FIRST was developed as a teaching tool to present a simple and pragmatic clinical approach to children presenting with a single seizure or a cluster of seizures in one day, associated with a febrile illness before, during, or after the seizure event(s). FIRST stands for Febrile, Illness, Related, Seizure(s), and Template, with "Template" representing an outline of the basic cause(s). The authors propose using the table as a tool to help determine the underlying etiology of febrile seizures, as this is the major factor affecting the choice of treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® seizures and epilepsy [^115Zu6YR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Seizures and epilepsy are a set of conditions that can be challenging to diagnose, treat, and manage. This document summarizes recommendations for imaging in different clinical scenarios for a patient presenting with seizures and epilepsy. MRI of the brain is usually appropriate for each clinical scenario described, with the exception of known seizures and unchanged semiology (Variant 3). In this scenario, it is unclear if any imaging would provide a benefit to patients.

In the emergent situation, a noncontrast CT of the head is also usually appropriate as it can diagnose or exclude emergent findings quickly and is an alternative to MRI of the brain in these clinical scenarios. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### European stroke organisation guidelines for the management of post-stroke seizures and epilepsy [^115o6xLD]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Following a stroke, acute symptomatic seizures (manifestation within seven days) and epilepsy, i.e. the occurrence of at least one unprovoked seizure (manifestation after more than seven days), are reported in 3–6% and up to 12% of patients, respectively. The incidence of acute symptomatic seizures is higher in intracranial hemorrhage (10–16%) than in ischemic stroke (2–4%). Acute symptomatic seizures and unprovoked seizures may be associated with unfavorable functional outcomes and increased mortality. In view of the clinical relevance, the European Stroke Organisation has issued evidence-based guidelines on the management of post-stroke seizures and epilepsy.

- **Method**: A writing committee of six clinicians and researchers from five European countries and Israel identified seven questions relating to the prevention of (further) post-stroke seizures and epilepsy and to the amelioration of functional outcome and prevention of mortality. Recommendations are based on findings in randomized controlled trials and observational studies using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach.

- **Results**: In the absence of adequately powered randomized controlled trials, evidence for all recommendations is very low. Based on findings in observational studies, some weak recommendations have been made. In most instances, we suggest not administering antiepileptic drugs. Due to the high incidence of seizure recurrence after one post-stroke unprovoked seizure, secondary antiepileptic drugs prophylaxis needs to be considered.

- **Conclusion**: Due to very low evidence, these guidelines should be interpreted with caution and used to inform clinical practice.

### Guidelines for seizure prophylaxis in patients hospitalized with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage: A clinical practice guideline for health care professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^115Hav38]. Neurocritical Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically in the context of seizure prophylaxis, the NCS 2025 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of prophylactic antiseizure medications in hospitalized adult patients with acute nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). If seizure prophylaxis is utilized, consider administering levetiracetam over phenytoin or fosphenytoin for a short duration (≤ 7 days).

### Clinical features and treatment of stroke-like episodes in mitochondrial disease: A cohort-based study [^116WdkaC]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

There are no randomized trial data on seizure management in patients with mitochondrial disease. The treatment of mitochondrial epilepsy associated with POLG variants is particularly challenging, as super-refractory status epilepticus is not uncommon. The consensus-based recommendation from 2019 advises the prompt initiation of intravenously administered ASM and generally recommends avoiding ASMs with known mitochondrial toxicity, especially valproic acid. The recently published consensus statement for managing seizures in patients with primary mitochondrial disease suggests following the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) general guidelines for seizure management. However, it advises against valproic acid in POLG patients, against vigabatrin in γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency, and against topiramate in patients at risk for renal tubular acidosis.

A recent study involving 19 POLG patients recommends a combination of a sodium channel blocker and benzodiazepine for generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and topiramate, phenobarbital, or clonazepam for myoclonus. In our study, the most commonly used ASM was levetiracetam, which is commonly used in mitochondrial epilepsy and has been reported to be both safe and effective. Propofol was the most used general anesthetic in our study. Propofol should be used with care because of the potential risk for propofol infusion syndrome. None of our patients developed propofol infusion syndrome. The typical reason for starting other general anesthetics than propofol was the insufficient effect of propofol in super-refractory cases.

### The emergency neurology literature 2020 [^111QmuSu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Managing neurological emergencies is an essential element of emergency physicians' armamentarium, irrespective of the specific nature of their practice. The combination of evolving literature and advances in imaging fuels the rapidly changing standards of care, especially in high-stakes diagnoses such as stroke. Navigating the emergency neurology literature to stay abreast of updates is becoming more challenging with the sheer volume of publications, combined with the recent dominance of COVID-19 on the literature and media attention. This review article summarizes emergency neurology literature updates that can help improve the care of these high-risk presentations; articles covering stroke, dizziness, intracerebral hemorrhage, head trauma imaging, headache, seizures, and COVID-19 are reviewed.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^112JFgpD]. Neurocritical Care (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of status epilepticus, and more specifically with respect to initial management, the NCS 2012 guidelines recommend including the following measures in the critical care treatment of convulsive and non-convulsive SE, to be completed prior to or upon arrival to the ICU:

- **Noninvasive airway protection and gas exchange**: Head positioning is essential.

- **Intubation**: Required if airway/gas exchange is compromised or elevated ICP is suspected.

- **Vital signs monitoring**: This includes oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate.

- **Vasopressor support of blood pressure**: Necessary if systolic BP is less than 90 mmHg or mean arterial BP is less than 70 mmHg.

- **Fingerstick blood glucose monitoring**.

- **Peripheral IV access**: This is important for emergent initial antiepileptic drug therapy, fluid resuscitation, and nutrient resuscitation.

- **Urgent SE control therapy**: Key with antiepileptic drugs.

- **Neurologic examination**.

- **Triage laboratory testing panel**.

- **Refractory SE treatment**.

- **Urinary catheter insertion**.

- **Continuous EEG monitoring**.

- **Diagnostic testing, depending on the clinical presentation**: Methods include CT, MRI, and lumbar puncture.

- **ICP monitoring, depending on the clinical presentation**.

### Diagnosis and management of childhood epilepsy [^114cB5p1]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epilepsy is a relatively common neurologic disorder in children that has significant implications for development, parents, and society. Making the correct diagnosis begins with an accurate and complete history, which consequently leads to a directed diagnostic workup. This article outlines an approach to diagnosing and managing pediatric seizures and epilepsy syndromes. Accurately diagnosing epilepsy or its nonepileptic imitators enables practitioners to prescribe appropriate therapy.

Initial management of typical epileptic syndromes and seizures, along with potential adverse effects, is discussed. Alternative treatment options for pharmacologically resistant patients, such as a ketogenic diet, vagal nerve stimulation, and surgery, are also examined. While most children respond favorably to antiepileptic medications, early identification of medication failure is crucial to ensure optimal neurodevelopment.
