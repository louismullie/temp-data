## Question

What are the LDL targets?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the LDL cholesterol targets are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guideline frameworks we are aligning to and their philosophical differences. Then, I should verify how risk is categorized and mapped to LDL-C goals or thresholds. Next, I will check the precise numeric targets and percent-reduction requirements, including any special-case updates. After that, I need to confirm treatment escalation pathways and monitoring intervals. Finally, I should review safety evidence for very low LDL-C and synthesize practical recommendations for clinical use, noting any pitfalls and nuances that require adjustment or correction as I go [^112QMZmt].

> Let me first confirm the frameworks and their logic because this drives everything downstream: the ESC/EAS retains treat-to-target LDL-C goals by risk category, whereas the ACC/AHA prioritizes risk-based statin intensity and uses thresholds to consider add-on therapy rather than fixed LDL targets; the CCS adopts a hybrid with numeric targets and percentage reduction, so I need to keep those distinctions explicit to avoid conflating goals with thresholds [^112UJbcF] [^1138QxsW] [^115kCcsq] [^112QMZmt].

> I will now examine risk categorization because the LDL-C target depends on baseline risk; in ESC/EAS, very high risk includes clinical ASCVD, unequivocal imaging ASCVD, diabetes with target organ damage or long duration, severe CKD, and familial hypercholesterolemia, with high, moderate, and low risk defined by major risk factors or SCORE estimates, while ACC/AHA organizes treatment groups as secondary prevention ASCVD, severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), diabetes ages 40–75 with LDL 70–189 mg/dL, and primary prevention by 10-year ASCVD risk with enhancers, which I should confirm aligns with the 2018/2019 updates [^112UJbcF] [^1138QxsW].

> Hold on, I should verify the numeric LDL-C goals in ESC/EAS before applying them; very high risk targets < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L), high risk targets < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L), moderate risk targets < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L), and low risk targets < 116 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L), and importantly the ESC/EAS requires a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline in addition to attaining the absolute goal, so I need to ensure I track both metrics in follow-up [^1147iChS] [^116GYDVx] [^113U5npo] [^116Bfjt6].

> Wait, let me verify the special-case updates because they change targets in key groups; in chronic coronary syndromes the ESC 2024 guideline reiterates a goal of < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction, while in acute coronary syndromes the 2023 guidance intensifies the goal to < 40 mg/dL (< 1.0 mmol/L) if there is a recurrent atherothrombotic event within 2 years on maximally tolerated statin-based therapy, and in type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk the recommended target is < 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction, with very high-risk diabetes aligning to < 55 mg/dL, which I should confirm case-by-case [^113Ext4y] [^112sLSQr] [^1168g1ef] [^116nCuxs] [^112S8aht].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ACC/AHA framework has no numbers at all, but that is not quite right; while it does not specify numeric treat-to-target goals, it uses an on-treatment threshold of LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) in very high-risk ASCVD to consider adding ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor if needed, on top of high-intensity statins, so I should be careful to distinguish "thresholds for intensification" from "targets for attainment" in communications with patients and teams [^1138QxsW] [^113w3MTL] [^115e1AQY] [^112QMZmt].

> Let me consider where CCS fits because clinicians often ask for a single practical number; the 2016 CCS guidance recommends an LDL-C goal of < 2.0 mmol/L (< 77 mg/dL) or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for most high-risk patients, functioning as a simplification of the treat-to-target approach while maintaining the importance of proportional LDL lowering [^115kCcsq] [^116s2q8s].

> I should confirm the percent-reduction principle and whether a "floor" exists; ESC/EAS mandates ≥ 50% reduction from baseline to accompany the absolute goal, and multiple analyses suggest risk reduction continues with further LDL-C lowering even at very low levels without clear safety signals, supporting "lower is better" with no identified lower bound for benefit within trial experience to date, though ongoing vigilance is prudent [^1147iChS] [^1113KeWi] [^113DKmHK] [^112mFCb6].

> Next, I should review the stepwise pharmacotherapy to achieve these goals; start with high-intensity statins to the maximally tolerated dose, add ezetimibe if the absolute goal or threshold is not reached, and then add a PCSK9 inhibitor for very high-risk patients whose LDL-C remains above goal or threshold, with consideration of inclisiran or bempedoic acid as adjuncts where appropriate, ensuring the plan is individualized by risk, baseline LDL-C, and tolerability [^113w3MTL] [^1138QxsW] [^113WxAMk] [^112QMZmt].

> I need to check the monitoring cadence to confirm target attainment and percentage reduction; obtain baseline lipids, reassess 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose changes to verify both absolute LDL-C and proportional reduction, and then follow every 3–12 months to reinforce adherence, adjust therapy, and monitor safety, aligning the intervals with the clinical setting and stability of control [^1138QxsW] [^112UJbcF].

> Let me now apply nuances for common clinical scenarios and ensure I do not oversimplify; familial hypercholesterolemia is treated as high to very high risk requiring combination therapy early to reach < 55 mg/dL, diabetes is stratified by overall risk with < 70 mg/dL for high risk and < 55 mg/dL for very high risk, severe CKD places patients at very high risk with < 55 mg/dL goals, and post-ACS patients should be driven immediately to < 55 mg/dL, with intensification to < 40 mg/dL for recurrent events within 2 years despite best therapy [^112UJbcF] [^1147iChS] [^1168g1ef] [^112sLSQr].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety of very low LDL-C while recommending aggressive lowering; large randomized datasets and meta-analyses show continued event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C lowering even when starting near 70 mg/dL, with no excess adverse events at very low levels in trial follow-up, supporting the safety of reaching goals such as < 55 mg/dL and even < 40 mg/dL in selected very high-risk patients under guideline frameworks [^1113KeWi] [^113DKmHK] [^112mFCb6].

> I should double-check implementation barriers and practical levers because target attainment in real-world care is often suboptimal; after AMI and across high-risk cohorts, a substantial proportion fail to reach goals without proactive intensification and adherence support, so structured follow-up, clinician prompts, affordable access to combination therapy, and patient education can materially improve attainment and outcomes [^1123k6Wm] [^112uh2vT] [^112QMZmt].

> Before closing, I need to ensure measurement nuances do not mislead decision-making; elevated lipoprotein(a) contributes cholesterol that is counted within measured or calculated LDL-C, potentially inflating LDL-C and obscuring true apoB-containing particle burden, so measuring Lp(a) at least once and considering non–HDL-C or apoB targets in select cases is prudent, and I should also account for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and risk-enhancing factors when tailoring therapy intensity [^1113TbEL] [^115Qq6KL] [^112Bav1w].

> In synthesis, I should align practice to the core principles: use ESC/EAS numeric goals by risk with a concurrent ≥ 50% reduction, apply ACC/AHA statin intensity with the ≥ 70 mg/dL on-treatment threshold in very high-risk ASCVD to add nonstatins, consider CCS's < 2.0 mmol/L or ≥ 50% reduction where appropriate, escalate stepwise with combination therapy, verify both absolute and proportional LDL-C lowering on follow-up, and lean on evidence that deeper LDL-C reductions yield proportional event reductions without identified harm signals in trial horizons, while continuously rechecking assumptions in special scenarios and updating with new guideline iterations [^112UJbcF] [^1138QxsW] [^115kCcsq] [^113Ext4y] [^1113KeWi] [^113DKmHK].

LDL goals are risk-based [^1147iChS]: **< 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction for very high risk** [^113Ext4y] [^114jJwm2] (ASCVD, recent ACS, or T2DM with target organ damage) [^112UJbcF]; **< 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction for high risk** [^116GYDVx] [^112UJbcF] (severe hypercholesterolemia, T2DM with additional risk, or high-risk primary prevention) [^1168g1ef]; **< 100 mg/dL for moderate risk** [^113U5npo] and **< 116 mg/dL for low risk** [^116Bfjt6]. For recurrent events within 2 years despite maximal therapy [^116nCuxs], consider a target of **< 40 mg/dL** [^112sLSQr]. US guidelines use a threshold approach: add nonstatins [^112mFCb6] if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL [^112QMZmt] in very high-risk patients [^113w3MTL].

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults older than 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

- **Table 1 - Classification of ASCVD risk and LDL‐C thresholds defined by US and European guidelines**.

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events. However, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging, or various other higher‐risk conditions.

### The evolution of European guidelines: Changing the management of cholesterol levels [^1165rLhC]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e. in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^115dFvXB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In summary, a personalized approach, focusing on identifying patients at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid-lowering therapies in combination with statins, will enable more patients to achieve LDL-C targets and help to address the high global burden of ASCVD.

### Counterpoint: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit supports a more individualized approach to clinical decision-making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Modifiable factors associated with failure to attain low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal at 6 months after acute myocardial infarction [^1123k6Wm]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Although controversial, reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to target levels remains a common therapeutic goal after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We sought to illuminate patient and provider characteristics associated with LDL-C goal nonattainment after AMI.

- **Methods**: In an observational registry of 24 US hospitals, we included 366 patients with AMI who had baseline LDL-C levels ≥ 100 mg/dL and underwent 6-month fasting LDL-C reassessment. Our primary outcome was failure to reach the guideline-recommended LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL at 6 months post-AMI.

- **Results**: One in three patients with AMI with initially elevated LDL-C failed to attain LDL-C goal at 6 months. Compared with those who attained the LDL-C goal, those who did not were more often discharged without a statin (21% vs. 9%, P < .001), despite only 4% having documented contraindications. Patients not achieving the LDL-C goal also more frequently discontinued statin use by 6 months (24% vs. 6%, P < .001). Multivariable modeling (c index, 0.78) revealed the absence of a statin prescription at discharge and lack of persistence on statin therapy as the strongest independent factors associated with failure to reach the LDL-C goal. Additional independent risk factors were patient report of not consistently adhering to prescribed medications, not participating in cardiac rehabilitation, nonwhite race, and lack of insurance.

- **Conclusions**: One-third of patients with AMI with baseline hyperlipidemia do not attain the LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL at 6 months. Our findings support targeted interventions in the transitional phase to improve LDL-C goal attainment in this patient population.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: Opportunities and challenges [^114jJwm2]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

All clinicians attest to the fact that guidelines, although helpful, do not match day-to-day practice. Many patients do not fit neatly into the categorized recommendations, and judgment must be made on the most prudent course of action. The recently updated guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) present a further challenge. They recommend aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering: < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident ASCVD; and < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years.

The ESC/EAS approach of recommending these very low goals for LDL-C distinguishes it from the recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. These guidelines identified a threshold of 70 mg/dL as a level at which the addition of non-statin to maximally tolerated statin therapy could be considered, but no lower goal was set. The European guideline writers believe that the science is strong enough to state that "no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined".

This approach prompts a number of questions: How do we translate this into clinical practice? Should it be applied universally or selectively? This review briefly lays out the evidence that led the writers to recommend the most aggressive goals yet for LDL-C lowering.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^113115Yt]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at the highest risk, within the paradigm of 'lower is better'. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality.

Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that, over the 5–7 years of treatment experience at the time of writing, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing lifelong very low LDL-C levels (< 1.4 mmol/L; < 55 mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarises key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to reduce markedly LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at the highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance.

### Clinical lipidology and the prevention of vascular disease: Time for personalized therapy [^112w5RN7]. Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2018). High credibility.

Genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle modifications can cause elevations of lipoproteins that contribute to atherosclerotic lesions over time. In the modern world, with life extension from many improvements in medicine and public health, most humans live long enough to develop atherosclerosis with concentrations of blood plasma lipoproteins that are very common. Familial abnormalities are prevalent and provide additional challenges in identifying unhealthy but treatable values of low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).

Multiple community studies and clinical trials have provided guidance on selecting targets and new tools that make possible effective goals of treatment. Lipid-lowering drugs are making it possible to achieve those goals and place responsibility on physicians to master the art of preventing atherosclerotic events. Lipoprotein management remains a very focused effort and requires an artful individualized approach for each patient. Few skills are more important for healthcare providers in primary care and cardiovascular medicine.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^115CQM36]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The guidelines have many similarities. Both emphasize cardiovascular (CVD) risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL‐C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high‐intensity statin for further reduction of LDL‐C levels. Both guidelines have the potential to change practice, as the use of a moderate dose of statins is still frequent in many patients after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and is unlikely to efficiently reduce cardiovascular risk.

- **Figure 1**: Risk stratification and LDL‐C targets as recommended by the European guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. This involves classifications such as ACS (acute coronary syndromes), ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), BP (blood pressure), CKD (chronic kidney disease), DM (diabetes mellitus), FH (familial hypercholesterolemia), and the SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation).

- **Figure 2**: Patient management groups as recommended by the American guideline for the management of cholesterol. This figure is adopted from reference 1 and discusses LDL‐C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).

However, the guidelines have important differences, including the concepts of treatment thresholds (American) versus treatment goals (European) and the specific classes for recommendations, most notably in secondary prevention.

### Knowledge of HbA1c and LDL-C treatment goals, subjective level of disease-related information and information needs in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113r1Y2e]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Risk factor control of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially dyslipidemia, remains unsatisfactory in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We aimed to analyze the knowledge of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) treatment goals, subjective level of information, and information needs in very high-risk patients with ASCVD.

- **Methods**: ASCVD patients (n = 210; 75 ± 9 years; 71.4% male; 89.5% coronary disease) with DM (96.7% type 2) completed a questionnaire assessing knowledge of HbA1c and LDL-C treatment goals and subjective level of information and information needs on disease-related topics of DM and ASCVD. Serum LDL-C and HbA1c were measured.

- **Results**: HbA1c goal (< 7.0% in 60.6%) was attained more frequently than LDL-C goal (< 70 mg/dl in 39.9%; p < 0.01). Significantly more participants named the correct goal for HbA1c compared to LDL-C (52.9% vs. 2.4%; p < 0.01). Subjective levels of information were higher, and information needs were lower for DM than for ASCVD (p < 0.01 for all topics). No associations of knowledge of treatment goals and level of information with the attainment of treatment goals for HbA1c and LDL-C were found. However, in multivariate regression, higher levels of education were associated with knowledge of treatment goals (HbA1c: odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.72, p = .04; LDL-C: OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.07–5.03; p = .03).

- **Conclusion**: In very high-risk patients with ASCVD, a deficit of knowledge of treatment goals to control dyslipidemia exists when compared to DM.

### Lowering LDL cholesterol in adults: A prospective, community-based practice initiative [^113Sj2zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of our study was to determine if a clinic-wide initiative, featuring low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)-lowering interventions, could serve as an effective health maintenance strategy to decrease LDL levels to 100 mg/dL. Patients who met these criteria were placed on a lipid-lowering action plan and re-evaluated with a follow-up LDL (LDL(2)) test in 3–4 months. For those whose LDL(2) values remained elevated, an additional action plan was provided, and their values were retested in another 3–4 months for a third LDL (LDL(3)) test. The primary endpoints were the comparison of LDL(1) levels with post-intervention LDL measurements (LDL(2) or LDL(3)), while secondary endpoints included total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels across the three measurement periods.

Of the 514 patients who received action plans, 443 returned for their follow-up lipid assessment. In this group, LDL levels decreased from 140.7 ± 29.2 mg/dL (LDL(1)) to 110.9 ± 29.6 mg/dL (LDL(2)) (P < .05). Of these 443 patients, 167 individuals achieved LDL(2) levels that met the National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (< 100 mg/dL), and 87 were now regarded by their primary care provider as controlled, with LDL levels ranging from 100 to 130 mg/dL. However, 158 individuals had LDL(2) levels that were either not controlled or not meeting National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Pharmacological strategies for lowering LDL cholesterol: Statins and beyond [^114jMY6d]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

A continuous, graded relationship exists between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This finding has been confirmed at progressively lower levels of LDL-C by results from clinical trials of therapies, particularly high-potency statins, which provide increasingly greater reductions in LDL-C levels. Based on this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. Some notable exceptions have been made, however, such as patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure.

To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels. These agents could be particularly appropriate for patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels, such as those with genetic dyslipidemia, for whom maximal drug therapy is insufficient to reduce LDL-C concentrations to recommended levels.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Prior to the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with two or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk.

The four statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are:

1. Patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
2. Adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL)
3. Patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL)
4. Patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention)

With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. Additionally, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C level.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and is key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone.

Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence supporting the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events.

Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^1113TbEL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. LDL-C is used as a screening test, a diagnostic marker for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a target of therapy for diet, drugs, and apheresis, and a goal for adequate care in the outpatient clinic, after hospital discharge, and in clinical guidelines. It is generally accepted that the laboratory measure "LDL-C" is an accurate representation of what is being measured. However, because of methodological limitations, all available clinical methods that measure and report "LDL-C" are affected by the presence of the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]-C). This includes all methods of calculated or measured "LDL-C", including the Friedewald formula, ultracentrifugation, or direct LDL-C methods. The main reason for this is the inability to separate low-density lipoprotein from lipoprotein(a) particles and quantify cholesterol content separately on these particles.

Lipoprotein(a) is composed of apolipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B-100, cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and carbohydrates on apolipoprotein(a). Based on observations from multiple laboratories with expertise in lipoprotein(a) biochemical analyses, the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) constitutes approximately 30% to 45% of the total lipoprotein(a) mass. This implicates that if lipoprotein(a) mass levels are low (e.g. < 10 mg/dL), the contribution of Lp(a)-C to plasma LDL-C is small (< 5 mg/dL). However, if lipoprotein(a) mass is high (e.g. 150 mg/dL), the calculation error in LDL-C due to high Lp(a)-C levels necessitates adjustments to ensure accurate risk assessments for cardiovascular events.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^1143fR5g]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment algorithm for patients with elevated fasting triglycerides includes several important considerations.

- **Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal**: The goal depends on absolute cardiovascular risk.
- **Secondary causes**: Potential secondary causes for hypertriglyceridemia are discussed. Further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction will also help in achieving non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Omega-3-FA (omega-3 fatty acids) and MCT (fats containing medium-chain fatty acids) are noted. Experimental therapies are mentioned.

Most remaining cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) are strongly polygenic in nature. This involves contributions from rare heterozygous variants in five canonical FCS genes and/or accumulated common variants associated with elevated triglyceride levels identified in genome-wide association studies. Sometimes referred to as multifactorial HTG (formerly Type 5), certain secondary factors can further exacerbate the expression of severely elevated triglyceride levels.

Mild-to-moderate HTG is similarly highly polygenic. Simple HTG (formerly Type 4) resembles severe HTG but with a lower burden of genetic determinants. Dysbetalipoproteinemia (formerly Type 3) also has a polygenic foundation, but with the additional genetic 'hit' of homozygosity for the binding defective apo E2/E2 isoform or a rare binding defective dominant mutation in APOE. Combined hyperlipidemia (formerly Type 2B) similarly has polygenic susceptibility to HTG, but some patients additionally have polygenic susceptibility.

### Alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113HBHrV]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with high-intensity statins is generally recommended. However, alternative approaches considering statin-related adverse effects and intolerance are needed.

- **Objective**: To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD in randomized clinical trials.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, and other websites (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Society of Cardiology, tctMD) were systematically searched from inception to April 19, 2024.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials comparing an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD, with the presence of cardiovascular events as endpoints.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Individual patient data were obtained from randomized clinical trials that met the prespecified eligibility criteria: RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-Lowering With Statin Monotherapy vs Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease) and LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy vs Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease). The moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy in the RACING trial and the treat-to-target strategy in the LODESTAR trial were classified as alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategies.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: Synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management, accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Methods**: A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts carried out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for the estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into four risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before the initiation of statin therapy.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL-C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) without associated safety concerns or adverse events, even when LDL-C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL-C in a risk-stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very-high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL-C levels in groups at very-high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines, and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines, recommend an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline for very high-risk patients. In contrast, US guidelines suggest high-intensity or maximal statin therapy, with the addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL-C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the adult [^115kCcsq]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, specifically with respect to treatment targets, the CCS 2016 guidelines recommend targeting an LDL-C level of less than 2.0 mmol/L, or achieving a 50% reduction of LDL-C in patients already receiving treatment. This is suggested to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. Long-term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid-lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events. However, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis — including coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography — a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high-risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL-C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab in high-risk patients receiving a statin: Secondary analysis of patients with low LDL cholesterol levels and in those already receiving a maximal-potency statin in a randomized clinical trial [^114GnPmP]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease focus on high-intensity statins and targeting a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial is unknown.

The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of evolocumab versus placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, as well as in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

This secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial compared randomized treatments in two subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin therapy. Patients were classified by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity (maximal: atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal: all other dosages). Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization.

### Effect of electronic prescription on attainment of cholesterol goals [^113162Am]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Although recent federal mandates provide incentives for physicians to use electronic prescribing (e-prescribing), clinical endpoints to support its use are lacking.

- **Hypothesis**: E-prescribing should improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) goal attainment.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we queried the electronic medical records (Allscripts Electronic Health Record [EHR]) of a multispecialty outpatient academic medical practice to identify patient encounters during which consecutive lipid panels were drawn in 2007 (n = 2218). The EHR did not include a clinical decision tool for guideline adherence but did include formulary decision support (FDS), which informs physicians about drug costs specific to each patient. Logistic regression was used to examine whether the odds of reaching LDL goal were influenced by e-prescribing and adjusted for characteristics known to affect prescribing patterns and goal attainment.

- **Results**: Of 796 patients not at LDL goal at baseline, 49% (n = 393) were at goal at follow-up. Patients receiving an e-prescription with FDS were 59% more likely to achieve LDL goal than those with a manual prescription (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–2.25). Superior LDL goal attainment may result from the lower cost of medications; patients with an e-prescription were significantly more likely to receive a generic statin than patients with a manual prescription (38% vs. 22.9%; P = 0.0004), and for each $10 increase in prescription price, the likelihood of being at goal decreased by 5% (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93–0.98).

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates the positive influence of e-prescribing, with features like FDS, on LDL goal attainment.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes the implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidence-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets.

Furthermore, the guideline provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for the outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy.

- **Development process**: The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications.
- **Focus on LDL cholesterol**: The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

### Effective use of statins to prevent coronary heart disease [^113C5w2e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary prevention trials have shown that the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) to lower an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level can substantially reduce coronary events and death from coronary heart disease. In 1987 and 1993, the National Cholesterol Education Program promulgated guidelines for cholesterol screening and treatment. Thus far, however, primary care physicians have inadequately adopted these guidelines in clinical practice. A 1991 study found that cholesterol screening was performed in only 23 percent of patients. Consequently, many patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels and a high risk of primary ischemic events remain unidentified and untreated. A study published in 1998 found that fewer than 15 percent of patients with known coronary heart disease have low-density lipoprotein levels at the recommended level of below 100 mg per dL (2.60 mmol per L). By identifying patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein levels and instituting appropriate lipid-lowering therapy, family physicians could help prevent cardiovascular events and death in many of their patients.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^113DKmHK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Observational studies have raised questions about the safety of low levels of LDL‐C achieved through intensive lipid lowering; however, there does not appear to be a "too low" level of LDL‐C. Populations with naturally occurring low levels of LDL‐C exist, and studies of individuals with genetic mutations leading to reduced LDL‐C levels reveal no safety issues and have shown an association with reduced ASCVD risk. This notion is recognized by the lower LDL‐C goals in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which recommend target LDL‐C levels as low as < 55 and < 40 mg/dL, the latter for patients who have had multiple ASCVD events within 2 years.

Achievement of very low LDL‐C levels in clinical trials of lipid‐lowering therapies has not been associated with an increased prevalence of adverse events. In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, 42% of patients achieved LDL‐C levels ≤ 25 mg/dL at 48 weeks with no significant difference between the evolocumab and placebo groups in terms of adverse events beyond injection‐site reactions. In a prespecified analysis of IMPROVE‐IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), patients who achieved very low LDL‐C levels (< 30 mg/dL) at 1 month after acute coronary syndrome had a similar safety profile over a period of 6 years compared with patients who achieved LDL‐C concentrations ≥ 30 mg/dL; furthermore, the very low LDL‐C group had the numerically lowest rate of cardiovascular events.

### Efficacy and safety of further lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients starting with very low levels: A meta-analysis [^1113KeWi]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

In the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (CTTC), patients starting with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of approximately 3.4 mmol/L (131.5 mg/dL) experienced a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C. The magnitude of clinical benefit of further LDL-C lowering in patients already with very low LDL-C levels remains debated.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of further lowering LDL-C levels in patient populations presenting with median LDL-C levels of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

- **Data sources and study selection**: The CTTC was used for statin data. For nonstatin therapy, the Medline database was searched from 2015 to April 2018. Key inclusion criteria were a randomized, double-blind, controlled cardiovascular outcome trial of LDL-C lowering with data in populations starting with LDL-C levels averaging 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two authors independently extracted data into standardized data sheets, and data were analyzed using meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The risk ratio (RR) of major vascular events (a composite of coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization) per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level.

- **Results**: In the subgroup of patients from the CTTC meta-analysis of statins with a mean LDL-C in the control arm of 1.7 mmol/L (65.7 mg/dL), 1922 major vascular events occurred and the RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.89).

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112rA5Hz]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in the context of primary prevention, lipid-lowering therapy is advised. The 2022 USPSTF guidelines recommend initiating statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in adults aged 40–75 years who have at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor (such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112Bav1w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Beyond LDL-C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk-enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10-year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL-C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid-related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk-enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### Achievement of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets in primary and secondary prevention: Analysis of a large real practice database in Italy [^111F3q4A]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Low credibility.

Target and intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy should be tailored according to the individual global cardiovascular (CV) risk. We aimed at retrospectively evaluating real-life LDL-C goal attainment and predictive factors for predefined LDL-C therapeutic goals both in primary and secondary prevention.

- **Methods**: We collected data from a large cohort of outpatients aged 40–65 years, followed by general practitioners, cardiologists, and diabetologists in Italy. All data were centrally analysed for global CV risk assessment and rates of control of major CV risk factors, including LDL-C. The study population was stratified according to the presence or absence of previous CV events, including coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), or stroke/TIA. CV risk profile characterization was based on the European SCORE. Predefined therapeutic goals were set according to the European guidelines on dyslipidaemia: LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dl for very high CV risk patients in primary prevention and for those in secondary prevention; < 100 mg/dl LDL-C levels for high CV risk patients in primary prevention. Logistic regression analysis with clinical covariates was used to identify predictive factors for achieving these goals; lipid-lowering therapy entered in the analysis as a continuous (model 1) or categorical variable (model 2).

- **Results**: We included 4,142 outpatients (43.7% female, age 58.0 ± 5.2 years, BMI 28.5 ± 5.0 kg/m²) among whom 2,964 (71.6%) were in primary and 1,178 (28.4%) were in secondary prevention.

### Identifying patients for aggressive cholesterol lowering: The risk curve concept [^115yWvQd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program's 2004 report identified more aggressive optional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol treatment goals of < 70 mg/dl for secondary prevention patients and < 100 mg/dl for moderately high-risk, primary prevention patients. Although LDL cholesterol reduction is the first step in reducing cardiovascular risk, it may be difficult for clinicians to visualize the risk reduction benefit for patients from various risk interventions. The concept of a "risk curve", or the absolute risk of a patient for subsequent cardiovascular events over a range of LDL cholesterol values, is proposed. Placing a patient on the appropriate risk curve may facilitate an individualized clinical management strategy that considers the patient's absolute benefit from further LDL cholesterol reduction as well as from shifting the risk curve downward through non-LDL cholesterol interventions.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^1168g1ef]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, and more specifically the management of dyslipidemia (lipid targets), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend setting an LDL-C target of < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) and achieving an LDL-C reduction of at least 50% in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1148dNK8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD), is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease; however, the case for primary prevention is less clear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

- **Search strategy**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007), and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of statins with a minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life, and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^112GHh2m]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods and results**: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks. During the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < 0.001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg dosage.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in pediatric patients, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the obtainment of fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profiles as early as age 2 years. This is to detect familial hypercholesterolemia or rare forms of hypercholesterolemia in pediatric and adolescent patients who have a family history of either early CVD or significant hypercholesterolemia.

### Improving statin treatment strategies to reduce LDL-cholesterol: Factors associated with targets' attainment in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes [^111pXbmS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In these patients, dyslipidemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor. As such, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the best therapy for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) reduction. Several trials have shown significant cardiovascular risk reduction through LDLc lowering in patients with diabetes, supporting its causal role in atherogenesis, as also demonstrated in genetic studies. Statin therapy is considered essential both in primary and secondary prevention of CVD in diabetes. Trials have shown that statin therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary heart disease or high cholesterol concentrations.

In the Health Protection Study (HPS), allocation to 40 mg of simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in the diabetic patients included in that study. Key observations provide evidence that, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the benefit of statin therapy confers protection at considerably low LDLc levels of less than 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl). Additional trials and meta-analyses have highlighted a benefit by further reducing LDL cholesterol down to 55 mg/dl. This concept has been incorporated in most of the recent guidelines, which now recommend the initiation of statin treatment based on the LDL cholesterol target levels and the cardiovascular risk profile of the patient. Most of the patients referring to diabetes clinics suffer from…

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: Synopsis of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines. They used a rigorous process to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention, as well as the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in eight areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### How low to go with glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure in primary prevention of CVD [^115XUj1B]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension are modifiable risk factors that predict cardiovascular disease events. The effect of these risk factors on incident cardiovascular disease increases with progressively higher levels of glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. The thresholds for initiating treatment of these modifiable risk factors and the optimal goals of risk factor modification are a focus of primary prevention research. Although an aggressive approach is appealing, adverse events may occur, and potential physiological barriers may exist. This paper discusses primary prevention of coronary heart disease that may be achieved through modification of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension by summarizing guidelines and pertinent clinical trial data from intervention trials that included a primary prevention cohort.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD, is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published in 2011, and in light of new data, an update of this review is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

- **Search methods**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4, 2011), and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with a minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke), and adverse events.

### Lovastatin [^113oo72Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines are summarized below:

- **LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals**: After the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the triglycerides (TG) are still ≥ 200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.

- **Initiating drug therapy**: At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C is ≥ 130 mg/dL.

- **Treatment monitoring**: Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available should the total cholesterol be used to monitor therapy.

- **Use in hyperlipoproteinemia**: Although lovastatin tablets USP may be useful to reduce elevated LDL-C levels in patients with combined hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia where hypercholesterolemia is the major abnormality (Type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia), it has not been studied in conditions where the major abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons, VLDL, or IDL (i.e. hyperlipoproteinemia types I, III, IV, or V).

The NCEP classification of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease is summarized below:

- **Pediatric treatment**: Children treated with lovastatin in adolescence should be re-evaluated in adulthood, and appropriate changes made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen to achieve adult goals for LDL-C.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations, such as the European Atherosclerosis Society and European Society of Cardiology, have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on the guideline organization. Others, like the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, use a treatment "intensification threshold". The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead providers to possibly back-titrate the dose or even deprescribe medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value and did not aim for a specific target level. Some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Intensity of lipid-lowering therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment among the elderly before and after the 2004 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III update [^1177LGws]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

In 2004, the Coordinating Committee of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an update to the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines on cholesterol management (the Update). Our objectives were to compare the proportion of elderly patients receiving intensive or minimal-guideline lipid-lowering therapy and the proportions meeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals before and after the update.

- **Methods**: We used dispense records from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, OR) to identify elderly patients who received statin therapy in 2003 (n = 14,425) and 2005 (n = 19,422) and laboratory records to assess LDL-C goal attainment.

- **Results**: Among new statin initiators, 85.4% of very-high-risk patients received minimal-guideline therapy in 2005, compared with 65.3% (P < .0001) in 2003. Of all new initiators, < 1% received very aggressive therapy in either year (0.4% vs 0.3%, P = .315). Overall, 77.7% and 59.0% of ongoing users in 2005 and 2003, respectively, received minimal-guideline therapy (P < .0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment did not differ between 2003 and 2005 continuing statin users. Among very-high-risk patients who initiated statin treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in 2005 versus 2003 attained the optional goal of < 70 mg/dL (45.5% vs 34.4%, P = .014). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion attaining < 100 mg/dL (77.8% vs 81.8%, P = .281).

- **Conclusion**: After the Update, more elderly patients were receiving intensive or minimal-guideline statin therapy. Low-density li

### Pushing the limits of LDL cholesterol: Emerging paradigms in cardiovascular risk reduction [^111WCQaW]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). High credibility.

LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) has long been recognized as a primary contributor to cardiovascular disease. Over time, guideline-recommended LDL-C targets have varied considerably, trending toward progressively more aggressive therapeutic goals. The focus on residual risk reduction and development of novel therapies — including PCSK9 inhibitors, siRNA-based treatments, and ANGPTL3 inhibitors — have significantly expanded the options for achieving unprecedentedly low LDL-C levels.

Given the fundamental role of cholesterol in cellular function, it has long been postulated that very low cholesterol could be associated with adverse events. In this review, we dissect the benefits and potential risks of very low LDL-C levels. We begin by providing an overview of the evolution of LDL-C targets in previous guidelines and highlighting therapies — including newer agents — used for aggressive LDL-C lowering. Drawing on clinical and genetic evidence, we then examine the benefits and risks associated with achieving very low LDL-C levels. Finally, we present a practical framework for balancing the potential risks and benefits of intensive LDL-C reduction in patient care.

### Cholesterol lowering therapies and achievement of targets for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes: Unmet needs in a large population of outpatients at specialist clinics [^112uh2vT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Low credibility.

The well-established benefit of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering treatments (LLTs) has led clinical guidelines to lower cardiovascular prevention targets. Despite this, there is a surprising scarcity of real-world studies (RWS) evaluating whether recommendations are applied in the routine clinical management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore evaluated, in a large RWS, the pattern of LLTs use and the achievement of LDL-c targets in patients with T2D in Italian diabetes specialist clinics.

- **Methods**: We collected data from 46 diabetes outpatient clinics (following 281,381 subjects), including 104,726 T2D patients, for whom the use of LLTs between 2015 and 2016 was ascertained. We used the 2016 and 2019 European Atherosclerosis Society and European Society of Cardiology (EAS-ESC) guidelines to define cardiovascular risk categories, LDL-c targets, and the expected LDL-c reduction and cardiovascular benefit achievable with LLT intensification.

- **Results**: 63,861 patients (61.0%) were on statin therapy, 9.2% of whom were also on ezetimibe. Almost all subjects were at high (29.3%) or very high (70.4%) cardiovascular risk, including 17% being in secondary prevention. Among very high-risk patients, 35% were not on statin despite half of them having LDL-c > 2.6 mmol/l, and only 15% of those on statins had LDL-c < 1.8 mmol/l. Overall, 35% and 14% of subjects achieved the LDL-c targets as suggested by the 2016 and 2019 EAS-ESC Guidelines, respectively.

### LDL cholesterol: How low to go [^116kRVgD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal and continuous not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis, therefore, to set a target or 'floor' for LDL cholesterol lowering, and this presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers.

With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly; however, health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. It is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk, such as those with aggressive and established cardiovascular disease who will obtain the highest benefit, particularly those with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy, based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy.

### 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the adult [^116s2q8s]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, the CCS 2016 guidelines recommend targeting a reduction of LDL-C by more than 50% in patients with LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL (or over 5.0 mmol/L) who are already receiving treatment. This is intended to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.

### Narrative review: Lack of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets: A solvable problem [^115uY7g7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Recent national recommendations have proposed that physicians should titrate lipid therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk and less than 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) for patients at high cardiovascular risk. To examine the clinical evidence for these recommendations, the authors sought to review all controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examined the independent relationship between LDL cholesterol and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL). For those with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL), the authors found no clinical trial subgroup analyses or valid cohort or case-control analyses suggesting that the degree to which LDL cholesterol responds to a statin independently predicts the degree of cardiovascular risk reduction.

Published studies had avoidable limitations, such as a reliance on ecological (aggregate) analyses, use of analyses that ignore statins' other proposed mechanisms of action, and failure to account for known confounders (especially healthy volunteer effects). Clear, compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy in patients at high cardiovascular risk (regardless of their natural LDL cholesterol values), but clinical evidence does not demonstrate that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL cholesterol levels is beneficial or safe.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing a reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care, with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding the implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to the suboptimal management of LDL-related risk.

This review summarizes the guidelines for the reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in the implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^113WxAMk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies that target PCSK9, such as alirocumab and evolocumab, have been shown to reduce LDL-C levels by approximately 60% when added to statin therapy, with few adverse events. In cardiovascular outcome trials involving patients at very high risk for ASCVD, anti-PCSK9 antibodies have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

In the FOURIER trial, which included patients with clinical ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, the addition of evolocumab to background statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe) lowered LDL-C levels to a median of 30 mg/dL at 48 weeks and reduced the risk of MACE by 15% compared to statins plus placebo (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79–0.92]). The clinical benefit was observed across baseline LDL-C subgroups, and the magnitude of risk reduction for the primary and secondary endpoints increased over time. Furthermore, evolocumab conferred even greater absolute and relative risk reduction among higher-risk patients, such as those with recent myocardial infarction, more extensive coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial disease. In the open-label extension follow-up period of the FOURIER trial, patients who were originally randomized to receive evolocumab exhibited a 15% to 20% lower risk of MACE and a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular death compared to those randomized to placebo.

Similarly, in the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial involving patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, the addition of alirocumab to maximally tolerated statins resulted in a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events compared to placebo (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78–0.93]).

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: Opportunities and challenges [^117K2Wwx]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

In the management of other risk factors for ASCVD, such as blood pressure and blood glucose, a balance must be struck between the risk of having a high level (and accelerated atherosclerosis) and problems linked to too low a level (hypotension, hypoglycemia). Management of LDL-C requires a distinct approach since there appears to be no 'downside' to profound lowering of this lipoprotein. The key question is: can we lower LDL-C into the proximity of the goals identified in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines without detriment to the patient? This is a particularly pertinent issue in secondary prevention where there is a perceived need to immediately and aggressively decrease the exposure of atherosclerotic lesions to LDL-C with the objective of inducing lesion stabilization and regression.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^116nCuxs]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, particularly concerning lipid-lowering therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend targeting an LDL-C goal of < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) in patients who experience a recurrent atherothrombotic event (not necessarily of the same type as the first event) while on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: A clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8 mmol/L (> 70 mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111BLQN9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In addition to the assessment of traditional risk factors, there is extensive evidence on the utility of CAC in refining the prediction of vascular events. The MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) 10-year coronary heart disease risk score was the first to include CAC and traditional risk factors and was developed to help guide therapeutic decision-making. CAC scoring is recommended by both the AHA/ACC/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines to aid risk assessment in those at borderline or intermediate risk, under consideration for statin therapy. In support of these recommendations, a study of individuals at intermediate risk of ASCVD within MESA demonstrated an association between CAC score and significant improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification for ASCVD events.

The AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend initiation of statin therapy for any patient with a CAC score ≥ 100 Agatston units and/or ≥ 75th percentile, and statin therapy can be considered for any non-0 score (i.e. CAC > 0). Recently, a CAC score > 300 Agatston units in primary prevention patients has been associated with ASCVD mortality rates equivalent to people with a stable ASCVD secondary prevention-level risk. As such, a CAC score > 300 Agatston units may be a suitable threshold at which to treat patients according to the recommended approach for the secondary prevention population (i.e. LDL-C reduction ≥ 50% and target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL), who may require the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^115Qq6KL]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining lipoprotein(a) measurements at least once in every adult's lifetime. This is to identify patients with very high inherited levels of lipoprotein(a) (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 mmol/L), which equate to a lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) similar to that associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### LDL-C: Lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^115cjydc]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) causes atherosclerotic disease, as demonstrated in experimental and epidemiological cohorts, randomized controlled trials, and Mendelian randomization studies.

There is considerable inconsistency between existing guidelines as to how to effectively manage patients at low overall risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have persistently elevated levels of LDL-C. We propose a step-by-step practical approach for the management of cardiovascular risks in individuals with low (140 mg/dL, 3.6 mmol/L) LDL-C. The strategy proposed is based on the level of adherence to lifestyle interventions (LSI), and in case of non-adherence, stepwise practical management, including lipid-lowering therapy, is recommended to achieve target LDL-C levels (< 115 mg/dL, 3.0 mmol/L).

Further studies are necessary to answer the questions on the long-term efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the suggested approach, considering the ever-increasing numbers of such low-risk patients seen in clinical practice.

### The challenge of achieving national cholesterol goals in patients with diabetes [^112tczAt]. Diabetes Care (2005).

- **Objective**: This study analyzed lipid results from a large community-based population of patients with diabetes to assess the feasibility of attaining the standard and new optional LDL-based lipid goals using currently available lipid-lowering medications.

- **Research design and methods**: Ambulatory patients with diabetes who were interviewed as part of the Vermont Diabetes Information System trial with a reported LDL were analyzed. Patients were categorized into high-risk and very-high-risk cardiovascular status. For patients not at the LDL goal, the required changes in therapy to achieve the goal were assessed.

- **Results**: Of the entire cohort, 49.4% (321 of 650) had LDL < 100 mg/dl. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, 29.4% (191 of 650) of patients were very high risk and have an optional LDL goal of < 70 mg/dl. Only 15.7% (30 of 191) of very-high-risk patients had an LDL < 70 mg/dl. Based on our analysis of high-risk patients, 17 of 459 (3.7%) would require more than two lipid-lowering drugs to achieve an LDL < 100 mg/dl. In the very-high-risk group, we estimate that 26.2% (50 of 191) of patients will not reach LDL < 70 mg/dl with two lipid-lowering medications.

- **Conclusions**: In many patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it will be difficult to attain an LDL goal of < 70 mg/dl. Approximately 25% of patients will require more than two lipid-lowering drugs at maximal doses to attain this goal, assuming 100% tolerance of lipid-lowering medications.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^1147iChS]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of dyslipidemia, particularly concerning treatment targets, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend achieving an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL-C level of < 55 mg/dL or < 1.4 mmol/L. These targets are advised for both primary and secondary prevention in patients considered very high-risk.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^1151kjpF]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

The guidelines address specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning pediatric patients. For individuals 10 years or older with familial hypercholesterolemia, the 2020 EAS/ESC guidelines recommend targeting an LDL-C level suitable for treatment.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^112Cw6Wv]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning the management of dyslipidemia, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering setting an LDL-C goal of less than 1.0 mmol/L (less than 40 mg/dL) in patients with a reatherothrombotic event (recurrence within two years of the first ACS episode) while taking maximally tolerated statin-based therapy.
