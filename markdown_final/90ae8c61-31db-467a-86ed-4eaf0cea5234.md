## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret a CBC showing RBC 5.35 × 10¹²/L, MCV 78 fL, RDW 15.8%, and platelets 461 × 10⁹/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the reported values are truly abnormal and by how much. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of each abnormality in context. Next, I will integrate the pattern to generate a prioritized differential diagnosis. After that, I need to outline the immediate next diagnostic steps and why they matter. Finally, I will consider management implications and prognosis, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the abnormalities and their magnitude. The RBC count of 5.35 × 10¹²/L is at the high end of normal and, in the right clinical context, could represent mild erythrocytosis, though I should confirm whether hemoglobin and hematocrit are concordantly elevated before labeling it as such [^116wMXhs]. The MCV of 78 fL sits just below the usual adult lower limit of 80 fL, indicating borderline microcytosis that warrants attention even if subtle. The RDW of 15.8% is mildly increased above the typical 11–14.5% range, suggesting anisocytosis that often accompanies iron deficiency or mixed processes [^112LM63t]. The platelet count of 461 × 10⁹/L represents mild thrombocytosis, which is commonly reactive to iron deficiency or inflammation rather than clonal in origin [^115dVSvN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should interpret each parameter in clinical context. Mild erythrocytosis can reflect primary clonal disease such as polycythemia vera, but it is far more often secondary to hypoxia, erythropoietin-producing tumors, or dehydration, so I need to check hemoglobin, hematocrit, EPO, and consider JAK2 testing if erythrocytosis persists and is unexplained [^113YdaL2] [^112puSuY]. Borderline microcytosis with a slightly elevated RDW strongly suggests early or mild iron deficiency, although thalassemia trait remains a consideration if iron studies are unrevealing, so I should verify ferritin, transferrin saturation, and consider hemoglobin electrophoresis if indicated [^117NHQFZ]. Mild thrombocytosis in this setting is most consistent with a reactive process, particularly iron deficiency or inflammation, rather than essential thrombocythemia, but I should confirm there are no other myeloproliferative features before excluding clonal disease [^115dVSvN].

> Next, I should review the integrated pattern. The combination of borderline microcytosis, mildly elevated RDW, and mild thrombocytosis is a classic signature of early iron deficiency anemia or iron deficiency without overt anemia, where microcytosis and anisocytosis emerge before hemoglobin drops and reactive thrombocytosis is common [^114AKt1p]. Wait, let me verify the strength of RDW as a marker here; RDW has high sensitivity for iron deficiency in inflammatory contexts and tends to rise early, which supports this interpretation in the absence of competing causes of anisocytosis [^114AKt1p]. I should also keep in mind that anemia of chronic disease can be normocytic early and may coexist with iron deficiency, so I need to check inflammatory markers and interpret ferritin in that light [^115gs2r8].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis and prioritize it. Most likely is iron deficiency, either absolute or mixed with anemia of chronic disease, given the microcytosis, elevated RDW, and thrombocytosis, so I should confirm with ferritin, transferrin saturation, CRP, and reticulocyte count while remembering ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may read higher in inflammation [^115gs2r8]. Less likely but important is thalassemia trait, which can produce microcytosis with a normal or high RBC count and relatively normal RDW; if iron studies are unrevealing, hemoglobin electrophoresis is appropriate [^117NHQFZ]. Early myelodysplastic syndrome is possible but less likely without cytopenias or dysplasia; nonetheless, if macrocytosis evolves or cytopenias appear, I should reconsider and pursue marrow evaluation per guidelines [^111Y5frp]. Essential thrombocythemia is unlikely without sustained platelets above 450 × 10⁹/L plus other MPN features, but I should remain vigilant if counts rise or clonal features emerge [^114RezYt].

> Let me outline the immediate next diagnostic steps and why they matter. I should confirm hemoglobin and hematocrit to determine whether anemia is present and to calculate the reticulocyte production index, because that will refine whether erythropoiesis is appropriate or suppressed [^111Y5frp]. I need ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and TIBC to characterize iron status, with awareness that ferritin between 30 and 100 µg/L in active inflammation may still indicate iron deficiency, and I should add CRP to contextualize ferritin interpretation [^115gs2r8] [^115wbRKn]. A reticulocyte count will help distinguish hypoproliferative from hyperproliferative states, and if microcytosis persists without iron deficiency, hemoglobin electrophoresis can help identify thalassemia trait [^117NHQFZ]. If hemoglobin and hematocrit are concordantly elevated, I should check serum EPO and consider JAK2 V617F testing to evaluate for polycythemia vera or secondary erythrocytosis, keeping in mind that a JAK2 mutation supports a clonal process when present [^113YdaL2] [^112puSuY].

> But wait, what if iron deficiency is confirmed; how should I approach management. I should first identify and treat the source of iron loss, most commonly gastrointestinal, because even asymptomatic patients with confirmed iron deficiency warrant evaluation for occult bleeding or malabsorption, including consideration of age-appropriate cancer screening when indicated [^114J4SK1]. Iron replacement can be oral or intravenous depending on tolerance, severity, and comorbid inflammation; a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks of therapy is highly suggestive of true iron deficiency and can serve as a therapeutic diagnostic test when initial studies are equivocal [^114J4SK1]. If iron deficiency is excluded and thalassemia trait is diagnosed, I should provide genetic counseling and avoid unnecessary iron therapy [^117NHQFZ].

> I should double-check prognostic implications, even if the abnormalities are mild. Elevated RDW has repeatedly been associated with adverse outcomes across acute and chronic diseases, including increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts and worse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD and community populations, so even a modest RDW elevation may carry risk information beyond anemia typing and should prompt attention to underlying drivers and comorbidities [^114F37x4] [^115N3brm] [^1179FRpv]. Let me reconsider whether any lifestyle or inflammatory contributors could be amplifying RDW in this patient, as addressing those may both correct the labs and mitigate risk [^112fsS86].

> Final synthesis: the most parsimonious explanation for RBC 5.35 × 10¹²/L, MCV 78 fL, RDW 15.8%, and platelets 461 × 10⁹/L is early iron deficiency with reactive thrombocytosis, with thalassemia trait as an alternative if iron studies are unrevealing and hemoglobin electrophoresis is abnormal [^114AKt1p]. I should confirm hemoglobin and hematocrit, obtain iron studies with CRP, a reticulocyte count, and consider hemoglobin electrophoresis if microcytosis persists without iron deficiency; if erythrocytosis is confirmed, I need EPO and JAK2 testing to distinguish primary from secondary causes before labeling a myeloproliferative neoplasm [^115gs2r8] [^113YdaL2]. Management hinges on identifying the source of iron loss, initiating appropriate iron therapy, and monitoring response, recognizing that a brisk hemoglobin rise after iron supports the diagnosis and guides further evaluation [^114J4SK1].

The patient's labs show **mild microcytosis (MCV 78 fL)** and **mild thrombocytosis (platelets 461×10⁹/L)** with a **slightly elevated RDW (15.8%)** [^111wbP4h]. This pattern most likely reflects **early iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease**, with the thrombocytosis as a reactive response [^115dVSvN] [^114AKt1p]. I recommend confirming with **ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP** [^115gs2r8], and checking a peripheral smear and reticulocyte count [^112LM63t]. If iron deficiency is confirmed, treat and find the source of blood loss; if anemia of chronic disease is likely, manage the underlying condition and monitor CBC trends [^111wbP4h].

## Clinical significance of laboratory findings

| **Parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| RBC count | 5.35×10¹²/L | 4.2–5.4×10¹²/L | Mild erythrocytosis (polycythemia) |
| MCV | 78 fL | 80–100 fL | Mild microcytosis |
| RDW | 15.8% | 11.5–14.5% | Mildly elevated (anisocytosis) |
| Platelet count | 461×10⁹/L | 150–400×10⁹/L | Mild thrombocytosis |

---

The combination of **mild microcytosis**, **mildly elevated RDW**, and **mild thrombocytosis** suggests a **microcytic, hypochromic anemia** — most often due to iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease [^114AKt1p].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **key differentials** for this pattern include:

- **Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)**: Microcytosis, elevated RDW, and reactive thrombocytosis are classic for IDA [^114AKt1p].
- **Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)**: Normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia with elevated RDW and thrombocytosis from chronic inflammation [^114AKt1p].
- **Thalassemia trait**: Microcytosis with normal or high RBC count and mild thrombocytosis; RDW is usually normal [^117NHQFZ].
- **Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)**: Microcytosis, elevated RDW, and thrombocytosis can occur, but are less likely without cytopenias or dysplasia [^1146eZDx].

Given the pattern, **IDA or ACD** is most likely; **thalassemia trait** is possible but less likely without a family history or a high RBC count [^117NHQFZ].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

To confirm the cause, **order**:

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, TIBC, CRP to distinguish IDA from ACD [^111wbP4h].
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assess red cell morphology and platelet morphology [^113boezN].
- **Reticulocyte count**: Evaluate marrow response [^111Y5frp].
- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: If thalassemia trait is suspected [^117NHQFZ].
- **Additional tests**: Vitamin B12, folate, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function as indicated [^115gs2r8].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Identify and treat the source of blood loss; provide iron replacement (oral or IV) and monitor response [^114J4SK1].
- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition; consider iron therapy if functional iron deficiency is present [^notfound].
- **Thalassemia trait**: Usually requires no treatment; genetic counseling may be indicated [^notfound].
- **Myelodysplastic syndrome**: Requires hematology referral and bone marrow evaluation if suspected [^112LM63t].

---

## Prognostic significance

An elevated RDW correlates with **higher mortality and adverse outcomes** across multiple settings, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and COVID-19 [^114F37x4] [^115N3brm]. Thrombocytosis increases thrombotic risk, particularly when persistent or clonal [^114FueTC]. Thus, this profile suggests modest increased risk; addressing the cause and monitoring counts are prudent.

---

## Summary and recommendations

The most likely diagnosis is **early iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease**, with reactive thrombocytosis. Confirm with iron studies, CRP, a smear, and reticulocyte count, then treat the underlying cause and monitor CBC trends. If iron deficiency is confirmed, identify and treat the source of blood loss; if anemia of chronic disease is likely, optimize management of the inflammatory condition and reassess.

Preoperative investigations and operative parameters

Analyses of preoperative investigations were done (Table 2). Only Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean platelet volume (MPV), and Platelet Distribution Width (PDW) were found statistically significant (p = 0.014, p = < 0.001, p = 0.009, p = 0.030 and p = < 0.001 respectively). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was normal in most of the study populations, two patients had LVEF < 30%, each in Group B and Group C, and LVEF 30–50% in 37.3% patients (Group A), 44.4% patients (Group B), and 23.1% patients (Group C). Triple vessel disease (TVD) was the most frequent preoperative diagnosis among the three groups (Table 1). The mean number of distal anastomoses performed was 2.79 ± 0.58, 3.00 ± 0.63, and 3.18 ± 0.60 among Group A, Group B, and Group C patients respectively (p = 0.004) (Table 2).

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116sTZky]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

When evaluating for the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient's microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost 4 years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than an iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

Learning points

Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation.
Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin.
Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology.
Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

Background

This systematic review (2018–2023) evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of MCV and MPV in pregnancy-related disorders.

Objectives

Evaluate diagnostic accuracy of MCV/MPV for pregnancy complications.

Methods

PRISMA 2020 review of 36 studies (2018–2023) using automated analyzers.

Results

- MPV > 10.2 fL predicts preeclampsia (78% sensitivity, AUC 0.81). - MCV < 80 fL indicates iron-deficiency anemia (85% specificity). - MPV > 9.8 fL associates with gestational diabetes (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–3.0). - 0.20/test cost advantage.

Conclusion

These low-cost markers could enhance early detection in resource-limited settings. These hematological markers are associated with up to 60% reduction in diagnostic costs when compared to conventional testing methods, making them viable for LMICs.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117DEawE]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency without anemia

Iron deficiency with relevant clinical symptoms can be present even before anemia develops as a long-term consequence. In such cases, early changes in the CBC, for example an increased RDW or an MCH close to the lower limit of normal, can represent early manifestations of iron deficiency. As described above, the reticulocyte count can be decreased even before erythrocyte indices are affected. Iron storage indices can also be interpreted in a similar way as in the diagnosis of IDA: in patients with IBD and no clinical, endoscopic or biochemical sign of active disease, a ferritin level below 15–30 μg/liter is diagnostic for iron deficiency. In the case of active disease, a ferritin level up to 100 μg/liter can still be consistent with iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% reflects a reduced availability of iron for erythropoiesis, either due to total iron deficiency or due to functional iron deficiency (e.g. in chronic inflammation or following treatment with erythropoietin). It was suggested that a TfS below 20% with a ferritin below 100 μg/liter defines total iron deficiency. A TfS below 20% and a ferritin above 100 μg/liter were defined as functional iron deficiency. In otherwise unclear cases, sTfR can also be useful.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114F37x4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Absent phenotypic expression of X-linked sideroblastic anemia in one of 2 brothers with a novel ALAS2 mutation [^111X5WHf]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) is caused by mutations in the erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS2) gene. Hemizygous males have microcytic anemia and iron overload. A 38-year-old male presented with this phenotype (hemoglobin [Hb] 7.6 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 64 fL, serum ferritin 859 microg/L), and molecular analysis of ALAS2 showed a mutation 1731G > A predicting an Arg560His amino acid change. A 36-year-old brother was hemizygous for this mutation and expressed the mutated ALAS2 mRNA in his reticulocytes, but showed almost no phenotypic expression. All 5 heterozygous females from this family, including the 3 daughters of the nonanemic hemizygous male, showed marginally increased red-cell distribution width (RDW). Although variable penetrance for XLSA in males has been previously described, this is the first report showing that phenotypic expression can be absent in hemizygous males. This observation is relevant to genetic counseling, emphasizing the importance of gene-based diagnosis.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^113edu4K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^111jjGLk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115N3brm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 282 patients with CKD who were admitted for CAD in 2011 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%; n = 213) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%, n = 69) groups. The baseline characteristics of the study cohort are presented in Table 1. The elevated RDW group had older patients than did the normal RDW group (68.2 ± 13.1 vs 63.7 ± 13.8, P = 0.018) and also had a lower proportion of male patients (62.3% vs 77.9%, P = 0.017). Moreover, patients in the elevated RDW group presented significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 48.4 ± 18.4 vs 55.6 ± 15.7, P = 0.017), lower hemoglobin levels (11.3 ± 2.1 vs 13.4 ± 2.3, P < .001), lower serum albumin levels (3.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.005), and higher creatinine levels (1.89 ± 1.58 vs 1.31 ± 0.93, P < .001), compared with those in the normal RDW group. The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar in terms of comorbidities, systolic and diastolic BP, leukocyte count, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase levels, sodium levels, potassium levels, sugar levels, total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein levels, HDL levels, and medications. During the 3-year follow-up period, the elevated RDW group exhibited a higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes (46.4% vs 17.8%, P < .001). No statistical difference was observed; however, a trend toward higher mortality was noted in the elevated RDW group (10.1% vs 3.8%, P = 0.059).

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — erythrocytapheresis is presented as an alternative to phlebotomy that selectively removes red blood cells (RBCs) while returning plasma proteins, clotting factors, and platelets; it can remove up to 1,000 mL of RBCs per procedure compared with 200–250 mL with phlebotomy; the recommended frequency is once in every 2–3 weeks depending on the patient's hemoglobin; the RBC volume to be removed is usually between 580 and 800 mL and the minimal targeted post‑procedure hemoglobin must be at least 10 g/dL; in patients without comorbidities and estimated removed RBC volume of ≤ 500 mL, volume expansion is not needed, but for higher RBC volumes it is recommended that 30% of the removed RBC volume be replaced with isotonic saline during the first treatment; in maintenance, erythrocytapheresis was equally effective as phlebotomy with a significantly lower number of treatments annually (1.9 vs 3.3).

### Comparison of demographic characteristics and haematological parameters in newborns with and without haemolytic disease due to ABO incompatibility [^1141bzab]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ABO incompatibility is the most common blood group incompatibility in newborn babies, haemolytic disease develops in very few cases and is much milder than Rh incompatibility. In our study, we aimed to retrospectively examine the changes in platelet parameters, in addition to the expected decrease in the erythrocyte count, in immunized ABO incompatible patients, by comparing them with those in the control group.

Methods

The demographic data and laboratory results of patients born in our hospital between November 1, 1997, and December 31, 2023, who had accessible information, were examined. The haemogram parameters of newborns with haemolytic disease who did not have ABO incompatibility those of newborns with ABO incompatibility and those of newborns with positive direct anti-globulin test results were compared using statistical methods.

Results

A total of 5,198 out of 7,780 newborns were included in the study. A total of 2582 newborns for whom demographic and laboratory values ​​could not be obtained were excluded from the study. When the data of 5,158 newborns without incompatibility and 40 newborns with haemolytic disease due to ABO incompatibility were compared, the mean red blood cell (RBC), haematocrit, haemoglobin and mean platelet volume (MPV) values of newborns with haemolytic disease were found to be statistically significantly lower than those of newborns in the control group, whereas the platelet, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RDW) values were greater. Thrombocytopenia was not observed in any patient.

Conclusions

Haemolytic disease due to ABO incompatibility is a mild haemolytic disease that is thought to be caused by maternal antibody density or low antigen density on neonatal erythrocytes. We detected an increase in the platelet count and a decrease in the erythrocyte count values in in the haemolytic group. Prospective studies are needed on this subject that also examine erythropoietin and thrombopoietin values.

Hematoxylin-Eosin stain of testicualr tissues. A: 100×; B: 200×; C: 300×; and D: 400× (date: December 20, 2012). The thickening of seminiferous tubular walls is a typical symptom of early testicular atrophy. The Leydig cells and Sertoli cells appear normal with mature spermatogenesis, however with reduced density and lack of compact cell linings as usually seen in normal subjects.

The laboratory data revealed extremely lowered HGH, lower levels of LH, testosterone, E2, total thyroxine and free T4, accompanied with severely lowered cortisol, low end level ACTH, FSH, total T3, and free T3; highly elevated TSH, high end normal prolactin, and normal estriol were also noticed (Table 1). Complete blood count revealed low RBC, severely lowered Hb, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, PLT, MPV, elevated RDW (Table 2); severely lowered ferritin, low serum iron levels, highly elevated serum total iron binding capacity, elevated transferrin and the low end marginal e-GFR (Table 3). This patient was commenced on replacement therapy with cortisone injections, Ringer's solution (3%), thyroxine (T4), and testosterone replacement were immediately prescribed.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^114jZJTV]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### The automated complete blood cell count… [^1169piWe]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The availability of automated blood cell analyzers that provide an index of red blood cell volume distribution width and a mean platelet volume has led to new approaches to patients with anemia and thrombocytopenia. The RDW, which measures heterogeneity of the red blood cell population, complements the mean corpuscular volume in the differential diagnosis of anemia based on peripheral blood analysis. The MPV varies inversely but nonlinearly with the platelet count in normal individuals and is of value in assessing platelet production in the thrombocytopenic patient. The clinical applications of the RDW and MPV, which are currently reported on most routine blood cell counts, are discussed. Karnad A, Poskitt TR.

Red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte indices — red cell size factor (RSf), RDW, and IRF: many RBC parameters are affected by the long lifespan of erythrocytes (about 120 days). RSf, defined as the square root of MCV multiplied by mean reticulocyte volume (MRV), correlates with CHr and, when low, indicates iron deficiency anemia; a level below 98.6 fL was found to be 83% sensitive and 98% specific, with positive predictive value 67% and negative predictive value 92%. High RDW combined with low RSf is highly predictive of iron deficiency, and the immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) is an early and sensitive index of erythropoiesis useful for distinguishing increased versus decreased erythropoietic activity.

### The correlation between RDW, MPV and weight indices after metabolic surgery in patients with obesity and DM / IGR: follow-up observation at 12 months [^1178UgH1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a common indicator in blood routine analysis, which reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cell volume in the circulation. It is calculated as the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of red blood cell volume divided by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and then multiplied by 100. In previous studies, RDW has been used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of erythrocyte disorders, especially anemia, and for the evaluation of nutritional status. Elevated RDW is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, etc.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a common indicator of platelet activity in routine blood. Increased MPV is commonly seen in primary thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndrome, while decreased MPV is commonly seen in acute leukemia chemotherapy and aplastic anemia.

In the last decade, RDW and MPV have both been considered new biomarkers for the prognosis of cardiovascular disease. RDW levels were significantly higher in patients with end point events such as death, heart failure and arrhythmia than in those without end point events. Cardiovascular risk score and MPV in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients can accurately predict the risk of acute cardiovascular events within 1 year.

Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between the two indicators and obesity. Elisia et al. found that RDW was significantly higher in people with a BMI > 35 kg·m −2 than in those with a BMI ≤ 35 kg·m −2. In individuals with metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity, MPV levels were positively correlated with waist circumference and were significantly higher than in those without metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity.

RDW and MPV are also associated with diabetes. RDW levels in diabetic patients were significantly higher than in control subjects; also, RDW levels in diabetic patients with HbA1c > 7% were significantly higher than in those with HbA1c ≤ 7%. MPV was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than in those without T2DM and higher in T2DM patients with microvascular complications (retinopathy or microalbuminuria) than in those without.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM. Metabolic surgery by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the most effective treatment for patients with T2DM complicated with obesity. A simple and economic indicator that can accurately predict the outcome of surgery in advance may be useful to make the optimum choice of metabolic surgery.

Extended — hematologic parameters with prognostic or diagnostic value: In Ph+ pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), low-risk on d1 defined by peripheral blood WBC < 100 000 and bone marrow blast < 5% was associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with EFS: 55% low risk, 18% high risk; OS: 79% low risk, 27% high risk. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds are prognostic, as Hgb > 10 g/dL is associated with better OS in Int-1 and Int-2 MDS, and in MDS, significantly different survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with Hgb < 10 g, platelet count (Plt) < 100 000, and absolute neutrophil count < 0.8. Baseline thrombocytopenia < 100 000 was associated with 39% transfusion independence versus 73% without thrombocytopenia, and the odds ratio for decreased cytogenetic response with, versus without, thrombocytopenia was 4.78. For differentiating aplastic anemia (AA) from hypoplastic MDS in adults, peripheral blood Plt, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly different, and red cell distribution width (RDW) values differ with mean RDW, 16.8% severe AA; 17.4% nonsevere AA; versus 20.4% MDS.

Method of data collection

An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to record demographic, clinical, biochemical and ultrasonographic parameters, CTP class, UGIE findings & haematological parameters.
Assessment of esophageal varices by UGIE

All patients underwent diagnostic UGIE to document the presence or absence as well as the grading of OV according to variceal size: small OV with < 5 mm in size with minimal elevation from the mucosal surface or large OV > 5 mm in size involving more than one third of the esophageal mucosa, according to the World Gastroenterology Organization practice guidelines on OV.
b) Assessment of haematological parameters and peripheral blood morphology

Two mL of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated blood was collected prior to any transfusions and processed by an automated hematology analyzer in order to obtain the following hematological readings: Total white blood count (WBC), differential leukocyte count (DC), hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), red cell count (RCC), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count and mean platelet volume (MPV).

Peripheral blood smears were stained by Leishman stain. The blood films were assessed by a Consultant Haematologist, blinded for clinical and endoscopic findings of the patients, for the presence of target cells, macrocytes, fragmented cells and other abnormalities. In addition, assessment of visual platelet count was done in order to overcome possible errors with the automated haematology analyzer. The platelet size was assessed morphologically and divided into three groups: small, normal and large and giant size. Small platelets were defined as nearly pinpoint, large platelets defined as closer towards red cell size and normal size defined as in between small and large.

### Clinical utility of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the diagnosis of iron deficiency [^111svRYK]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) provides an early measure of functional iron deficiency because reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into blood and circulate for only 1 to 2 days. The CHr in 78 patients undergoing bone marrow examination was measured to assess its clinical utility for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were iron deficient, based on the lack of stainable iron in the aspirate. The diagnostic power of CHr is limited in patients with high mean cellular volume (MCV) or red cell disorders such as thalassemia. However, when patients with MCV more than 100 fL are excluded, receiver operator curve analysis of CHr, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV demonstrates that CHr has the highest overall sensitivity and specificity of these peripheral blood tests for predicting the absence of bone marrow iron stores.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10 12 /l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Multiplicative interaction between mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in predicting mortality of elderly patients with and without anemia [^1179FRpv]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) is an important predictor of adverse outcomes. However, the strength of this biomarker has not been tested in a large outpatient elderly population. Also since increased RDW can be due to a variety of etiologies, additional biomarkers are needed to refine the prognostic value of this variable. We assembled a cohort of 36,226 elderly (≥ 65yo) patients seen at an outpatient facility within the Einstein/Montefiore system from January 1st 1997 to May 1st 2008 who also had a complete blood count performed within 3 months of the initial visit. With a maximum follow-up of 10 years, we found that an elevated RDW (> 16.6) was associated with increased risk of mortality in both non-anemic (HR = 3.66, p < 0.05) and anemic patients (HR = 1.87, p < 0.05). The effect of RDW on mortality is significantly increased in non-anemic patients with macrocytosis (HR = 5.22, p < 0.05) compared to those with normocytosis (HR = 3.86, p < 0.05) and microcytosis (HR = 2.46, p < 0.05). When comparing non-anemic patients with both an elevated RDW and macrocytosis to those with neither, we observed an elevated HR of 7.76 (higher than expected in an additive model). This multiplicative interaction was not observed in anemic patients (HR = 2.23). Lastly, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each RDW/MCV subgroup and found worsened survival for those with macrocytosis and an elevated RDW in both anemia and non-anemic patients. Based on our results, the addition of MCV appears to improve the prognostic value of RDW as a predictor of overall survival in elderly patients.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

Materials and methods

Patients

All patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated surgically at the authors' institution between 2014 and 2019 were entered into a computerized database (SPSS, version 25, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Approval was obtained from the institutional ethics committee for conducting the present study. To homogenize the patient cohort, only patients who underwent surgical resection were included, thus excluding patients with biopsy alone or no surgical intervention at all. In addition, only patients for whom the information listed below remained complete were included in further analysis.

To focus on the information available preoperatively, patient records were retrospectively reviewed for information such as patient characteristics, radiological features, results of preoperative laboratory tests, as well as functional neurological status at admission and during the course of treatment for further analysis. Thereby, the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) was used to grade patients according to their neurological functional status preoperatively, postoperatively, and during follow-up. In this regard, a KPS ≥ 70 was defined as favorable outcome. Established prognostic factors, such as the extent of surgical resection, postoperative prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) and/or additional molecular-pathological features (e.g. MGMT status) were discarded from additional multivariable analysis to focus solely on preoperatively available information. As previously reported, treatment decisions were reached in an interdisciplinary and consensus manner at the patient's initial presentation and during follow-up via the institutional tumor board meetings.

Regarding laboratory analyses, values such as serum CRP (CRP < 3 g/dl versus [vs.] ≥ 3 g/dl), white blood cell (WBC) count (≤ 12 G/l vs. > 12 G/l), platelet count, RDW (≤ 14% vs. > 14%), and hemoglobin (Hb) were obtained in the routine preoperative laboratory tests and dichotomized according to laboratory-defined normal-range values and/or previous experience. Anemia was defined sex-specific according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (Hb < 12 g/dl for women and Hb < 13 g/dl for men).

Overall survival (OS) was measured from the day of glioblastoma surgery until death or last observation. All parameters were compared in relation to OS.

Methods

General information

From January 2023 to June 2023, a total of 211 patients with hyperglycemia were selected from all the population who underwent physical examination at the Jinling Hospital. Among them, 150 patients met the diagnostic criteria for DM, while 61 patients met the diagnostic criteria for IGT. Simultaneously, a control group comprising 202 individuals with normal glycemic levels was chosen for comparative analysis. Demographic information, blood glucose levels, and blood RT results were collected for all participants in these three groups. This study selected the blood RT indexes including white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil percentage (NE.%), lymphocyte percentage (LY.%), eosinophil percentage (EO.%), basophil percentage (BA.%), monocyte percentage (MO.%), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), coefficient variation of the distribution width of the red blood cell (RDW-CV), platelet count (PLT#), thrombocytopenia (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW). The blood RT indexes were determined using an automated haematology analyser (Sysmex XE-5000; Wakinohama-Kaigandori, Japan).

Diagnostic criteria

The diagnostic criteria of the present study adhere to the guidelines set by the international diabetes associations (International Diabetes Federation [IDF], American Diabetes Association [ADA], European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD], etc.) and the World Health Organization (WHO). DM was defined as fasting plasma glucose of ≧ 7.0mmol/l (≧ 126 mg/dl), and IGT was defined as fasting glucose values of < 5.6–6.9 mmol/l (100–125 mg/dl). Persons with fasting glucose values of < 5.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) were included in the normal group. The research subject of this investigation has excluded numerous potential underlying diseases, including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory diseases, impaired liver and kidney function, hematological disorders, neurological disorders, neuromuscular damage, metabolic disorders, as well as immunosuppressive states or compromised immune systems.

### How laboratories use RBC indices… [^114bSFK3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In the February Archives Fischer and Fischer claim that the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration provide little clinical information and should be abandoned. However, laboratories still use these indices as quality control indicators to detect instrument malfunction. The average value of mean corpuscular volume, MCH, and MCHC for a large number of patients remains relatively constant in each laboratory. Modern hematology instruments incorporate microcomputers that use a special "moving average" formula to monitor patient RBC indices. The moving average values for MCV, MCH, and MCHC can rapidly detect instrument malfunction and indicate which RBC parameters are at fault. 1In addition, laboratory technologists use the consistency of the MCHC to ensure accuracy of the measured RBC parameters on individual patient samples. An abnormal MCHC value must be regarded with suspicion.

Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^111p1tpc]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Other studies found the sensitivity of RDW to be very high (96–100%) in detecting iron deficiency anemia. On the contrary, there is a report of a limited specificity of RDW for diagnosis of IDA among children with microcytic hypochromic anemia. At a cut-off value of 17.4%, as obtained from the ROC curve, the sensitivity and specificity of RDW in diagnosis of IDA were 81.0% and 53.4% and a positive and negative predictive value of 63.0% and 72.2%, respectively.

One of the other approaches used to predict IDA is the use of indexes such as Mentzler's, discriminant function, Srivastava's, Shine and Lal's, MCV/MCH indices which are based on many hematological parameters instead of one. In our study also, when we used Hb and RDW together the sensitivity and specificity improved considerably with high positive and negative predictive values. These data suggest that the combined approach of using Hb ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15% (sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 90.5% and negative predictive value of 98.9%) performs well obviating the need for using expensive biochemical tests for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia in a low resource setting.

### Importance of RDW value in differential diagnosis of hypochrome anemias [^1135enbt]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in adults carrying delta-beta thalassemia traits (deltabeta-TT) who were 20–40 years of age (n = 29), beta thalassemia traits (beta-TT) with an age range of 18–60 years (n = 49), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in individuals aged 1–18 years (n = 27), and in controls with an age range of 20–40 years (n = 20). Although red blood cell count, MCV, and MCH values showed no statistically significant differences between deltabeta-TT and beta-TT, the mean RDW value was significantly higher in deltabeta-TT (20.14 ± 1.21) compared to beta-TT (14.88 ± 1.77) (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between the means of RDW in deltabeta-TT and IDA (18.00 ± 1.94) (P > 0.05). A significant rise in RDW in IDA 5–7 days after initiation of iron therapy (P = 0.00) which was continued to rise up to the 4(th) week of therapy was suggested as an important tool in differentiation of IDA from deltabeta-TT. These observations could be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of deltabeta-TT from beta-TT and IDA by determining the red blood cell count, red cell indices, and RDW only.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD (diagnosis), ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a combination of true iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease is likely in the case of serum ferritin levels between 30 and 100 mcg/L.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^113BLgw2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

Management

A dearth of compelling evidence defining optimal management strategies for JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis stems from the heterogeneity in associated hereditary and acquired disorders. Hence, it is common practice to inadvertently extrapolate outcomes from studies conducted in PV patients or follow consensus guidelines. In order to formulate our recommendations that have been summarized in Fig. 3, we reviewed the relevant literature pertaining to secondary erythrocytosis associated with common acquired and hereditary conditions (Table 1). Data regarding thrombosis risk in acquired secondary erythrocytosis has been conflicting; while the majority of studies do not support an increased thrombotic risk, two recent studies have implied the contrary. In a noteworthy large population-based series, erythrocytosis defined by higher Hgb/Hct thresholds, as per the 2008 WHO criteria, was associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, details of conditions associated with erythrocytosis were not specified but a high incidence (38%) of clonal hematopoiesis and cardiovascular risk factors were reported accounting for a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. In a second smaller series of 35 patients with secondary erythrocytosis, thrombosis rates at or prior to diagnosis were similar to those reported in PV, which is likely explained by the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors in those with secondary erythrocytosis.

As the venous hematocrit rises above 65%, the thickness or viscosity of whole blood also increases, potentially compromising blood flow to a variety of organs. Fortunately, relatively few infants who have neonatal polycythemia or hyperviscosity develop complications attributable to their thick blood; however, controversy and the need for continued research envelop the issue of which infants are at risk and need to be treated.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

Treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg/ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA therapy. (ungraded)

### Red blood cell count and risk of adverse outcomes in patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^113ZTy9v]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our findings suggest that reduced RBC counts are associated with increased CV mortality in patients with HFmrEF. Women with HFmrEF are more sensitive to changes in RBC counts than are men. Compared with men with HFmrEF, women with reduced RBC counts had a greater risk of CV death, and an increased RBC count was associated with a more significant reduction in the risk of CV death in women. Correcting a decreased RBC count can potentially reduce the risk of CV death in patients with HFmrEF. However, there is no clear conclusion regarding the need for medication to correct anemia in patients with HFmrEF. Further research is needed to understand the risk associated with anemia in patients with HFmrEF. A better understanding of risk factors for anemia in patients with HFmrEF may help to develop strategies to improve outcomes of patients with this severe disease.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^112fsS86]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume (MCV), an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies, have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Because RBCs characteristically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, persistence of these older, smaller cells thus increases volume variance, and this clearance delay coincides with and offsets a net decrease in RBC production. These reports suggest the possibility that an elevated RDW in some circumstances may reflect a clinical state in which RBC production and turnover have slowed in the setting of increased production and turnover of leukocytes or platelets such as would occur in inflammation. Although a definitive mechanism for RDW elevation has not yet been established, there is evidence that RDW can provide robust risk-stratification among patients diagnosed with the same acute illness. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether an association exists between mortality risk and elevated RDW measured at hospital admission and during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^1161c2nN]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

View a reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent value < 30.6 pg as predictive of the likelihood of response to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD on hemodialysis.

Results

Baseline Characteristics of Patients

We retrospectively investigated RDW measured at the time of admission for a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1641 patients admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 62 (18) years, and 886 were men (54%). Of 1641 patients, 740 were White individuals (45%) and 497 were Hispanic individuals (30%). Of 1641 patients, 276 died (17%). Other baseline characteristics of patients, stratified by survival status, are shown in Table 1.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^112DJuwu]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### Pseudoreticulocytosis in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^114wa1vp]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 52‐year‐old woman diagnosed in 2017 with low‐risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with multilineage dysplasia (R‐IPSS score 1.5) is evaluated for persistent reticulocytosis since 4 years, without evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.

Her laboratory results indicate the following: red blood count 3.56 × 10 12 /L (reference range: 3.8–5.2 × 10 12 /L); hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL (11.7–15.7 g/dL); hematocrit 0.32 L/L (0.35–0.47 L/L); MCV 93 fl (81–99 fl); MCHC 313 g/L (310–360 g/L); red cell distribution width 16.7% (11%–15%); reticulocytes 929 × 10 9 /L (20–120 × 10 9 /L), 26.1% (0.5%–1.5%); platelets 146 × 10 9 /L (150–350 × 10 9 /L); and leukocytes 2.2 × 10 9 /L (4.0–10 × 10 9 /L). Of note, MCV, expected to be increased in case of reticulocytosis is normal. Hemolytic parameters (LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) and creatinine are normal. The direct antiglobulin test is negative. Scattergram (Image 1A, white circle) shows small‐size reticulocytes with dim fluorescence (low RNA content), corresponding to a population of old reticulocytes. Peripheral blood smear (Image 1B) shows marked anisopoikilocytosis, polychromasia, and anisochromia. Presence of reticulocytes is confirmed on cresyl blue stain (Image 1C, arrows).

Next, we performed XGBoost with the same variables, and we found that the predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.9998, an accuracy of 0.996 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9780–0.9999] in the training set. In the testing set, the AUC was 0.7873, with an accuracy of 0.7684 [95% CI, 0.6706–0.8488]. The results are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 4, the individualized predicted probability of more than 0.5 was shown in Fig. 4 a, and less than 0.5 was shown in Fig. 4 b. As shown in Fig. 4 a, variables (included age, age at diagnosis, course of disease, usage of D-penicillamine, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, basophil count, lymphocyte percentage, monocyte percentage, basophil percentage, red blood cell count, HCT, MCV, MCHC, RDW-SD, platelet count, and P-LCR) led to a decrease of probability of occurrence of liver cirrhosis. However, other variables (included female, age at onset, delayed diagnosis time, serum ceruloplasmin, urinary copper, white blood cell count, eosinophil count, NLR, neutrophil percentage, eosinophil percentage, hemoglobin, MCH, RDW-CV, MPV, PDW, PCT, and P-LCC) led to an increase of probability of occurrence of liver cirrhosis.

Areas requiring further investigation

It is currently unknown which patients are at higher risk of drug-induced erythrocytosis or require more extensive investigations such as bone marrow biopsy or molecular testing. The development of a predictive model or scoring system may help clarify this. Further studies for prospective validation would also be beneficial to determine thromboembolic risk associated with drug-induced erythrocytosis, to establish whether antiplatelet agents or phlebotomy have a role in mitigating this risk, and to clarify long-term follow-up in this heterogeneous patient population.
