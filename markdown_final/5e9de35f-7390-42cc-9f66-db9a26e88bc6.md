## Question

what FIB-4 index should fibroscan be gotten at

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain a FibroScan based on FIB-4 thresholds in patients with suspected MASLD/NAFLD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial risk stratification with FIB-4 and the validated cutoffs. Then, I should verify how age modifies the low-risk threshold. Next, I will examine the indeterminate and high-risk ranges and the recommended second-line tests. After that, I need to check the specific FibroScan stiffness thresholds that trigger referral. Finally, I should consider special populations, discordant results, and the evidence supporting a sequential strategy, and close with practical next steps and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the primary risk stratification framework. In adults with suspected MASLD/NAFLD, FIB-4 is the recommended first-line test to triage fibrosis risk, with three pragmatic categories: low risk, indeterminate, and high risk, using cutoffs of less than 1.3, 1.3 to 2.67, and greater than 2.67, respectively, which are consistently endorsed by AGA/AASLD pathways and AASLD guidance [^115AUMkB] [^112QjjEq] [^113DZzGd].

> Wait, let me verify the age-related adjustment because misapplying this can misclassify patients. For patients older than 65 years, the low-risk threshold is raised to less than 2.0 rather than less than 1.3, which reduces false positives due to age-related increases in FIB-4; conversely, FIB-4 has not been validated in adults under 35 years, so results should be interpreted cautiously and secondary assessment considered if clinical suspicion is high [^115AUMkB] [^112nGVnn] [^111GjRGP].

> I will now examine the low-risk category. If FIB-4 is less than 1.3 (or less than 2.0 if older than 65), the negative predictive value for advanced fibrosis is high, generally around 90% or more, so patients can typically be managed in primary care with periodic reassessment rather than immediate elastography; I should double-check that this NPV assertion aligns with guideline statements, and yes, both AGA/AASLD and AASLD endorse this approach with interval reassessment every 1–3 years depending on risk factors [^115AUMkB] [^112nGVnn] [^113DtiLm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for the indeterminate range. If FIB-4 is 1.3 to 2.67, the performance is limited and further testing is warranted; AASLD recommends obtaining vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan), MRE, or ELF as second-line tests to better characterize fibrosis risk, with VCTE generally preferred as the initial secondary test in primary care or endocrinology settings when available [^111EWoPD] [^112QjjEq] [^112rZzc9].

> Let me consider the high-risk category carefully. If FIB-4 is greater than 2.67, the specificity for advanced fibrosis is high, and guidelines recommend referral to hepatology for confirmatory assessment; importantly, some pathways allow proceeding directly to specialty referral without additional testing, though many clinicians still obtain elastography to refine staging and guide surveillance planning, which I should acknowledge as acceptable variation in practice [^115AUMkB] [^112QjjEq] [^113DZzGd].

> Next, I should review the FibroScan thresholds that trigger action after the second-line test. Commonly used VCTE cutoffs include less than 8.0 kPa to exclude advanced fibrosis, 8.0 to 12.0 kPa as indeterminate, and greater than 12.0 kPa as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; I need to ensure these align with contemporary guidance, and yes, AASLD and related pathways endorse these ranges, with some sources using 7.9–8.0 kPa and 12.0–12.5 kPa as pragmatic cut points, and Baveno VII also highlights that LSM 10 kPa or higher warrants careful confirmation due to false positives [^114jB4h6] [^113L6iuf].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where FIB-4 performs poorly. In type 2 diabetes, FIB-4 can underperform with higher false-negative rates, so a lower threshold for second-line testing or even direct elastography may be justified in high-prevalence diabetes clinics; similarly, in adults under 35, FIB-4 is not validated, so clinical judgment and alternative noninvasive strategies should be used, and in older adults, the adjusted low threshold helps mitigate age-related false positives [^113zU18g] [^112nGVnn] [^111GjRGP].

> I should double-check the evidence supporting a sequential strategy. Sequential testing with FIB-4 followed by VCTE in those with FIB-4 1.3 or higher improves accuracy and reduces unnecessary biopsy compared with either test alone, and combining tests (for example, FIB-4 with VCTE or ELF) further reduces misclassification; this is supported by AASLD imaging guidance and multiple pathway documents emphasizing tiered approaches to reduce indeterminate results and optimize referral yield [^116kbD8i] [^112QjjEq] [^113DtiLm].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer clearly. Obtain a FibroScan when FIB-4 is 1.3 or higher, with two branches: if FIB-4 is 1.3–2.67, use VCTE as a second-line test to refine risk; if FIB-4 is greater than 2.67, proceed to hepatology referral where VCTE is typically obtained as part of confirmatory staging, recognizing that some pathways permit direct referral without prior elastography, and remember to use the age-adjusted low threshold of less than 2.0 for patients older than 65 years [^115AUMkB] [^112QjjEq] [^111EWoPD].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and contingency planning are explicit. For patients with low FIB-4, repeat risk assessment in 1–3 years depending on metabolic risk, and for those with indeterminate VCTE results or discordant tests, consider MRE or ELF and refer to hepatology; if VCTE is not feasible due to obesity or ascites, MRE is an appropriate alternative, and in all cases, interpret results in the context of pretest probability and local prevalence to avoid over- or under-calling advanced fibrosis [^112QjjEq] [^111EWoPD] [^113DtiLm].

---

FibroScan is indicated when the FIB-4 score is **≥ 1.3** [^115AUMkB] in patients with suspected MASLD/NAFLD, as this indicates intermediate or high risk of advanced fibrosis and warrants further evaluation with elastography [^111EWoPD]. For patients with FIB-4 **< 1.3** (or < 2.0 if age > 65) [^112nGVnn], advanced fibrosis is unlikely and FibroScan is not routinely needed; these patients can be monitored with periodic FIB-4 reassessment [^115A3sVk]. If FIB-4 is **> 2.67**, direct referral to hepatology is recommended, with FibroScan often performed as part of specialist assessment [^115AUMkB].

---

## FIB-4 score interpretation and clinical implications

The FIB-4 score is a noninvasive blood-based test that uses age, AST, ALT, and platelet count to estimate fibrosis risk in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly MASLD/NAFLD [^113DZzGd]. The score is interpreted using established thresholds:

| **Fib-4 score** | **Risk category** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1.3 (or < 2.0 if age > 65) | Low risk | Advanced fibrosis unlikely; routine monitoring recommended [^112nGVnn] |
| 1.3–2.67 | Intermediate risk | Possible advanced fibrosis; further evaluation with FibroScan recommended [^111EWoPD] |
| > 2.67 | High risk | High likelihood of advanced fibrosis; direct hepatology referral recommended [^112pnuEm] |

---

## Indications for FibroScan based on FIB-4 score

FibroScan (transient elastography) is a noninvasive imaging technique that measures liver stiffness, correlating with fibrosis severity [^111Tjbi9]. It is recommended as a second-line test when the FIB-4 score indicates intermediate or high risk of advanced fibrosis [^111EWoPD].

---

### FIB-4 score ≥ 1.3

When the FIB-4 score is **≥ 1.3**, patients are considered at intermediate or high risk of advanced fibrosis [^113DZzGd]. At this threshold, further evaluation with FibroScan is recommended to assess liver stiffness and confirm the presence and severity of fibrosis [^111EWoPD]. This approach aligns with major society guidelines, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [^112QjjEq] [^116poUp9].

---

### FIB-4 score > 2.67

When the FIB-4 score is **> 2.67**, patients are at high risk of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^116X54jp]. Direct referral to hepatology is recommended, and FibroScan is often performed as part of the specialist evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^115AUMkB].

---

### FIB-4 score < 1.3 (or < 2.0 if age > 65)

When the FIB-4 score is **< 1.3** (or **< 2.0** for patients older than 65), patients are considered at low risk of advanced fibrosis [^115AUMkB]. Routine monitoring with periodic FIB-4 reassessment is recommended, and FibroScan is generally not indicated unless clinical circumstances change or additional risk factors emerge [^115AUMkB].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting FibroScan use at specific FIB-4 thresholds

Several studies and guidelines support the use of FibroScan at specific FIB-4 thresholds:

- **Sequential testing**: The AGA/AASLD clinical care pathway recommends a sequential approach, using FIB-4 as the initial test followed by FibroScan for patients with intermediate or high FIB-4 scores [^115AUMkB]. This strategy improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces unnecessary liver biopsies [^116kbD8i].
- **Diagnostic accuracy**: Combining FIB-4 with FibroScan significantly improves the accuracy of detecting advanced fibrosis compared to either test alone, reducing misclassification and indeterminate results [^116kbD8i].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Sequential testing with FIB-4 followed by FibroScan is cost-effective, particularly in primary care settings, by identifying patients who truly benefit from specialist referral and advanced diagnostics [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While FIB-4 and FibroScan are valuable tools, certain limitations should be considered:

- **False positives/negatives**: FIB-4 may yield false positives or negatives, particularly in patients with acute liver injury, chronic inflammatory conditions, or thrombocytopenia unrelated to liver disease [^113eas8e].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and clinical context should be considered when interpreting FIB-4 results and deciding on further testing with FibroScan [^112nGVnn].
- **Alternative tests**: In cases where FibroScan is unavailable or contraindicated (e.g. severe obesity, ascites), alternative noninvasive tests such as magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) or the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test may be considered [^111EWoPD].

---

FibroScan is indicated when the FIB-4 score is **≥ 1.3**, indicating intermediate or high risk of advanced fibrosis [^111EWoPD]. This approach ensures accurate risk stratification and appropriate management of patients with chronic liver disease, particularly MASLD/NAFLD [^112QjjEq].

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115AUMkB]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk stratification using FIB-4 — initial thresholds and actions are as follows: FIB-4 score < 1.3 (< 2.0 in those older than 65 years) can reliably exclude advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, with a negative predictive value of ≥ 90%, and patients below this cutoff do not need further evaluation, but we recommend repeat testing with FIB-4 in 2–3 years; in a prospective cohort with T2D, only 12% had a > 30% relative increase in liver stiffness after 3 years of follow-up. Patients with a FIB-4 score > 2.67 are at high risk for advanced fibrosis with specificities of 80%−90%, and we recommend referring these patients to hepatology for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) or liver biopsy to confirm stage. The remaining 30%−40% of patients typically fall into the indeterminate range (1.3–2.67) and should also undergo LSM, which can be performed as a point-of-care test in primary care or endocrinology clinics or ordered for review at the next visit or as part of referral to hepatology.

### Identifying and linking patients at risk for MASLD with advanced fibrosis to care in primary care [^116SSitY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The FIB-4 score identifies a substantial proportion of patients in the indeterminate or high-risk category (i.e. increased risk) needing further evaluation. In the US, it is estimated that 20.3 million patients would be categorized as indeterminate or high-risk based on the FIB-4 score. Due to the low positive predictive value of FIB-4 score for advanced fibrosis, especially within the indeterminate population, subsequent assessment strategies such as elastography or serum tests are recommended to evaluate for liver fibrosis. In those patients undergoing further assessment (i.e. elastography), it is suggested those patients who remain at indeterminate or high risk and/or have discordant findings undergo additional testing (i.e. subspecialty referral and/or liver biopsy). The objective in this population is to identify patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis so targeted and evidence-based interventions that improve morbidity and mortality can be appropriately initiated (i.e. variceal and hepatocellular carcinoma screening). Thus, identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis has important clinical implications. Prior population-based data suggest approximately 4% of patients with indeterminate FIB-4 scores will have elastography suggesting advanced fibrosis, thus re-classifying these patients as high-risk. If our entire indeterminate risk population (n = 8847) were screened with elastography, there would be an additional 354 patients diagnosed with advanced fibrosis. However, in our study, 0.7% (n = 61) of the entire indeterminate risk population was screened and only 18 patients were diagnosed with advanced fibrosis, leaving a majority of patients with advanced fibrosis undiagnosed.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of liver-related mortality and is already the leading etiology of liver disease requiring liver transplantation in women. The burden of end-stage liver disease is expected to increase over the coming decade given the high prevalence of NAFLD. In patients with NAFLD, the fibrosis stage is a critical determinant of prognosis and mortality with a substantial step up in all-cause mortality and liver-related outcomes in those with bridging fibrosis (stage 3 disease) or cirrhosis (stage 4). These sub-populations are thus at highest risk of outcomes, underscoring the need to identify these individuals within the population with NAFLD.

For patients referred to secondary and tertiary level liver clinics, a key diagnostic objective is to identify those with stage 3 or 4 disease. The current reference standard is histological assessment of liver biopsy (LB) sections. Liver biopsies are invasive and can occasionally cause severe morbidity and even mortality. Their use is further limited by sampling, intra- and inter-observer variability in interpretation. These limitations have restricted the widespread use of an LB-based approach in clinical care and serve as a rationale to develop non-invasive tools for this purpose. While a substantial body of literature on the use of laboratory aids such as the FIB-4 score or vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) has been published, none have met regulatory standards for approval and there remains a continued need to develop non-invasive tools to identify those with NAFLD who have AF (F ≥ 3) or cirrhosis (F = 4).

Simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis — This algorithm applies to persons aged ≥ 18 years who have not been previously treated and do not have evidence of cirrhosis; evidence of cirrhosis includes a FIB-4 score > 3.25, FibroScan stiffness ≥ 12.5 kPa, noninvasive serologic tests that exceed proprietary cutoffs, clinical evidence such as liver nodularity and/or splenomegaly on imaging or platelet count < 150,000/mm3, or prior liver biopsy showing cirrhosis. The simplified treatment algorithm is not recommended for persons with HIV and/or HBV infection, prior liver transplantation, HCC, end-stage renal disease, and/or current pregnancy because they require more nuanced care, and the pretreatment evaluation should include assessment for cirrhosis, medication reconciliation, drug–drug interactions, and patient education regarding treatment administration and the importance of adherence and transmission prevention.

### Degree of discordance between FIB-4 and transient elastography: an application of current guidelines on general population cohort [^113NY8R4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

In the American Gastroenterological Association/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AGA/AASLD) Clinical Care Pathway, Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) is used to stratify patients at risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as low-, indeterminate-, or high-risk for developing advanced liver fibrosis. We assessed the performance of FIB-4 in a general population.

Methods

Using the 2017 to 2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys dataset, we selected subjects ≥ 18 years who had FibroScan data. We followed AGA/AASLD guidelines to identify subjects with characteristics that place them at risk for MASLD-associated liver fibrosis. Other causes of liver disease were excluded. Our final cohort had 3741 subjects. We then categorized these subjects based on recommended FIB-4 cutoffs. FibroScan liver stiffness measurement (LSM) served as the outcome measurement.

Results

Among the 2776 subjects (74.2%) classified as low risk by FIB-4, 277 subjects (10%) were not classified at low risk by LSM, and 75 subjects (2.7%) were classified as high risk by LSM. Among the 86 subjects classified as high risk by FIB-4, 68 subjects (79.1%) were not at high risk by LSM, and 54 subjects (62.8%) were at low risk by LSM. Subjects misclassified by FIB-4 as low risk were older; had a higher body mass index, waist circumference, glycohemoglobin A1c level, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, diastolic blood pressure, controlled attenuation parameter score, white blood cell count, alkaline phosphatase, and fasting glucose level; but had lower high-density lipoprotein, and albumin level (all P < .05). Misclassified subjects were also more likely to have prediabetes/diabetes.

Conclusion

Using FIB-4 in the AGA/AASLD guidelines to risk-stratify subjects at risk for MASLD-associated fibrosis results in many subjects being misclassified into the low- and high-risk categories. Therefore, it may be worthwhile considering caution in interpretation and/or alternative strategies.

### Staging liver fibrosis and cirrhosis using non-invasive tests in people with chronic hepatitis B to inform WHO 2024 guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115YHvER]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Non-invasive tests (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index [APRI] and transient elastography [FibroScan]) were recommended in the 2015 WHO guidelines to guide treatment decisions in people with chronic hepatitis B. We updated the systematic review and meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines to inform new cutoffs for non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis for the 2024 WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B.

Methods

We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science) for studies published in any language between Jan 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2023. We included all studies that reported cross-sectional data on the staging of fibrosis or cirrhosis with APRI, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and FibroScan compared with liver biopsy as the reference standard in people with chronic hepatitis B. We excluded studies in which the maximum interval between liver biopsy and non-invasive fibrosis test was more than 6 months; that reported on fewer than ten patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis; that were done exclusively in children; and did not report diagnostic accuracy across our prespecified ranges of test cutoffs. The results of this updated search were collated with the meta-analysis that informed the 2015 guidelines. Outcomes of interest were the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive tests using defined index test cutoffs for detecting significant fibrosis (≥ F2), advanced fibrosis (≥ F3), and cirrhosis (F4) based on the METAVIR staging system. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate random-effects model.

Findings

Of 19933 records identified by our search strategy, 195 were eligible for our systematic review and combined with the 69 studies from the previous meta-analysis to total 264. Two studies were at low risk of bias, 31 studies had unclear risk of bias, and 231 studies had a high risk of bias. Of these 264, 211 studies with 61665 patients were used in the meta-analysis. For the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥ F2), sensitivity and specificity were 72.9% (95% CI 70.2–75.5) and 64.7% (95% CI 61.0–68.2) for the APRI low cutoff (> 0.3 to 0.7), 30.5% (23.7–38.3) and 92.3% (89.3–94.6) for the APRI high cutoff (> 1.3 to 1.7), and 75.1% (72.2–77.7) and 79.3% (76.2–82.2) for FibroScan (> 6.0 to 8.0 kPa), respectively. For the diagnosis of cirrhosis (F4), sensitivity and specificity were 59.4% (53.2–65.2) and 73.9% (70.1–77.4) for the APRI low cutoff (> 0.8 to 1.2), 30.2% (24.2–36.9) and 88.2% (85.4–90.6) for the APRI high cutoff (> 1.8 to 2.2), and 82.6% (77.8–86.5) and 89.0% (86.3–91.2) for FibroScan (> 11.0 to 14.0 kPa), respectively. Using a hypothetical population of 1000 unselected patients with chronic hepatitis B with a 25% prevalence of significant fibrosis (≥ F2), the APRI low cutoff for significant fibrosis (≥ F2) would result in 262 (26.2%) false positives but only 68 (6.8%) false negatives. The FibroScan cutoff would result in 158 (15.8%) false positives and 63 (6.3%) false negatives. In a population with a 5% prevalence of cirrhosis (F4), the APRI low cutoff for cirrhosis (F4) would result in 247 (24.7%) false positives and 21 (2.1%) false negatives and the FibroScan cutoff would result in 105 (10.5%) false positives and nine (0.9%) false negatives.

Interpretation

These findings have informed new thresholds of APRI and FibroScan for diagnosis of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in the 2024 WHO guidelines on chronic hepatitis B, with an APRI score greater than 0.5 or a FibroScan value greater than 7.0 kPa considered to identify most adults with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and an APRI score greater than 1.0 or a FibroScan value greater than 12.5 kPa to identify most adults with cirrhosis (F4). These patients are a priority for antiviral treatment.

### Comprehensive medical evaluation and assessment of comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112pnuEm]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) thresholds and test scope in MASLD — An FIB-4 value of ≥ 1.3 is considered higher probability of at-risk metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with clinically significant fibrosis (= F2), whereas a value of > 2.67 confers high risk of advanced fibrosis (F3–F4) and referral to the liver specialist is warranted without additional testing; FIB-4 has not been validated in pediatric populations or in adults aged < 35 years, and in people with diabetes ≥ 65 years of age, higher cutoffs for FIB-4 have been recommended (1.9–2.0 rather than 1.3). Transient elastography thresholds further refine risk: an LSM value of < 8.0 kPa has a good negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (= F3–F4), while if LSM is ≥ 8.0 kPa, such individuals should be referred to the hepatologist. Screening should not rely on elevated aminotransferases alone, as a strategy using > 40 units/L would miss most individuals with MASH; the American College of Gastroenterology considers the upper limit of normal ALT to be 29–33 units/L for male individuals and 19–25 units/L for female individuals.

### Enhanced diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in individuals with NAFLD using fibroScan-based agile scores [^114mfHkF]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Currently available non-invasive tests, including fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM by VCTE), are highly effective at excluding advanced fibrosis (AF) (F ≥ 3) or cirrhosis in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but only have moderate ability to rule-in these conditions. Our objective was to develop and validate two new scores (Agile 4 and Agile 3+) to identify cirrhosis or AF, respectively, with optimized positive predictive value and fewer indeterminate results, in individuals with NAFLD attending liver clinics.

Methods

This international study included seven adult cohorts with suspected NAFLD who underwent liver biopsy, LSM and blood sampling during routine clinical practice or screening for trials. The population was randomly divided into a training set and an internal validation set, on which the best-fitting logistic regression model was built, and performance and goodness of fit were assessed, respectively. Furthermore, both scores were externally validated on two large cohorts. Cut-offs for high sensitivity and specificity were derived in the training set to rule-out and rule-in cirrhosis or AF and then tested in the validation set and compared to FIB-4 and LSM.

Results

Each score combined LSM, AST/ALT ratio, platelets, sex and diabetes status, as well as age for Agile 3+. Calibration plots for Agile 4 and Agile 3+ indicated satisfactory to excellent goodness of fit. Agile 4 and Agile 3+ outperformed FIB-4 and LSM in terms of AUROC, percentage of patients with indeterminate results and positive predictive value to rule-in cirrhosis or AF.

Conclusions

The two novel non-invasive scores improve identification of cirrhosis or AF among individuals with NAFLD attending liver clinics and reduce the need for liver biopsy in this population.

Impact and Implications

Non-invasive tests currently used to identify patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, such as fibrosis-4 index and liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled transient elastography, have high negative predictive values but high false positive rates, while results are indeterminate for a large number of cases. This study provides scores that will help the clinician diagnose advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. These new easy-to-implement scores will help liver specialists to better identify (1) patients who need more intensive follow-up, (2) patients who should be referred for inclusion in therapeutic trials, and (3) which patients should be treated with pharmacological agents when effective therapies are approved.

### FIB-4, APRI, and AST / ALT ratio compared to fibroScan for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in bandar abbas, iran [^116qp2sf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Of note, although liver biopsy has traditionally been the gold standard and reference method for evaluating liver fibrosis, it has some limitations that has made its use questionable. This can also be the reason for the difference between the findings of previous studies and our results regarding the diagnostic performance of non-invasive indices, as they have most commonly taken the results of biopsy as reference, while we used FibroScan results. One limitation of liver biopsy is that a small volume of liver is evaluated which cannot reflect the fibrotic changes in the entire liver. Another limitation is that various parts of the liver may be at different stages of liver fibrosis and the extracted sample may not be indicative of the true stage of fibrosis. Moreover, biopsies are evaluated by pathologists which makes their experience an influential factor in the assessment of fibrosis.

FIB-4 and APRI have been recommended by many guidelines, including the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to determine the stage of fibrosis in countries with limited resources. A retrospective study of 113 chronic hepatitis C patients has demonstrated good diagnostic performance of APRI and FIB-4 for determining advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis C patients. Moreover, in a systematic review by Lee et al. FIB-4 and APRI were comparable with liver biopsy in terms of risk stratification for liver-related morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) had the same properties in their study. The high NPV of these two indices in our study (99.2% and 95.3%, respectively), suggests that they can be used to exclude advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Nonetheless, AST/ALT ratio had a lower NPV. McPherson et al. have also reported a high NPV for AST/ALT ratio and FIB-4 (93% and 95%, respectively).

### Diagnostic performance of the fibrosis-4 index and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score in lean adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111smg9M]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is it appropriate to apply conventional fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) cutoffs for assessing advanced fibrosis in lean adults with NAFLD?

Findings

In this diagnostic study including age- and sex-matched adults with NAFLD, the overall diagnostic performance of FIB-4 and NFS were not significantly different between the lean and nonlean groups. However, while the sensitivity and specificity of FIB-4 were not affected by body mass index and remained reasonable, those of NFS were unacceptably low to be used as first step screening tool.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the FIB-4, at the current cutoff value, represents a better screening parameter of advanced NAFLD fibrosis in lean individuals.

### Combined use of the CLivD score and FIB-4 for prediction of liver-related outcomes in the population [^112CizeQ]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Early detection of chronic liver disease is challenging but can be accomplished through noninvasive fibrosis testing in individuals who do not exhibit symptoms but are at a high risk for future liver-related outcomes (LROs). Currently, the recommended first-line method for risk stratification of fibrosis is the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, primarily because of its widespread availability and low cost in clinical practice. In other studies, a low FIB-4 value was used to exclude the risk of advanced liver fibrosis, whereas individuals with elevated FIB-4 values required further testing.

However, the performance of the FIB-4 index is suboptimal when applied to unselected populations. For instance, in a large population study, the sensitivity of an FIB-4 cutoff of 1.3 was only 37%. Therefore, the current EASL and AASLD guidelines emphasize that noninvasive tests such as FIB-4 should be used only in high-risk populations, specifically those with a sufficiently high pretest probability. Nevertheless, a final definition of "high risk" in the general population has yet to be established.

The Chronic Liver Disease (CLivD) score was recently introduced as a prognostic tool for predicting future LROs in the general population. Calculated based on lifestyle factors alone or by including gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) as the only laboratory variable, the CLivD assigns a score on a continuous scale that corresponds to an individual's risk for LROs. The CLivD score can be used to identify high-risk populations, which necessitates subsequent evaluation with fibrosis testing; however, the effectiveness of such a strategy has not been firmly established. Although the CLivD score has been externally validated in 3 independent samples from Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States, further validation studies are needed. In addition, studies on the combined or sequential use of the CLivD score and FIB-4 are lacking.

This study had 2 objectives. The first objective was to externally validate the predictive ability of the CLivD score for LROs and compare it with the predictive performance of FIB-4 in the UK Biobank population. The secondary objective was to assess the combined use of CLivD and FIB-4 scores for predicting LROs. We hypothesized that utilizing the CLivD score to define the at-risk population could improve the predictive performance of FIB-4. The findings of this study are important for designing pathways for screening liver fibrosis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1126AcTQ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Of note, recent guidance by NICE on NAFLD proposed single testing with serum ELF measurements without recourse to algorithms or other diagnostic modalities, on the basis of cost-effectiveness analyses. This recommendation was noted and carefully considered during the drafting of this guideline. On balance, however, it was felt that the evidence for diagnostic tests, and their use in combination in NAFLD, was still evolving and thus this guidance took a broader view setting out a pathway structure with a range of options. This view is endorsed by the EASL-ALEH guidelines for the non-invasive assessment of liver disease.

Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine their extent of liver fibrosis.
First-line testing should use either FIB-4 or NAFLD Fibrosis Score – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D)
Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum ELF measurements or Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. (level 2b, grade B)
We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area figures 1 and 2.

ARLD

Alcohol-related cirrhosis is the the most common cause of liver-related mortality in Western populations. The majority of patients with this condition are heavy daily drinkers, with a median alcohol consumption of around 120 units/week. Notably, 25% of the population drink more than recommended guidelines (≤ 14 units/week), with 10% drinking twice as much and 1.4% drinking more than 75 units/week. The relationship between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis is exponential; at 20 units/week the relative risk is approximately 3, whereas at 80 units/week it is 30. There is also a synergy between alcohol intake and obesity; when body mass index (BMI) is > 35, the risk of liver disease doubles for any given alcohol intake (see figures 1 and 3).

### Low accuracy of FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores for screening for liver fibrosis in the population [^113eas8e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) are the 2 most popular noninvasive blood-based serum tests proposed for widespread fibrosis screening. We therefore aimed to describe the accuracy of FIB-4 and NFS to detect elevated liver stiffness as an indicator of hepatic fibrosis in low-prevalence populations.

Methods

This study included a total of 5129 patients with concomitant measurement of FIB-4, NFS, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by Fibroscan (Echosens, France) from 5 independent population-based cohorts from Spain, Hong Kong, Denmark, England, and France; 3979 participants from the general population and 1150 from at-risk cohorts due to alcohol, diabetes, or obesity. We correlated LSM with FIB-4 and NFS, and calculated pre- and post-test predictive values of FIB-4 and NFS to detect elevated LSM at 8 kPa and 12 kPa cutoffs. The mean age was 53 ± 12 years, the mean body mass index was 27 ± 5 kg/m 2, and 2439 (57%) were women. One in 10 patients (552; 11%) had liver stiffness ≥ 8 kPa, but 239 of those (43%) had a normal FIB-4, and 171 (31%) had normal NFS. The proportion of false-negatives was higher in at-risk patients than the general population. FIB-4 was false-negative in 11% of diabetic subjects, compared with 2.5% false-negatives with NFS. Waist circumference outperformed FIB-4 and NFS for detecting LSM ≥ 8 kPa in the general population. Almost one-third (28%-29%) of elevated FIB-4/NFS were false-positive in both the general population and at-risk cohorts.

Conclusions

FIB-4 and NFS are suboptimal for screening purposes due to a high risk of overdiagnosis and a non-negligible percentage of false-negatives, especially in patients with risk factors for chronic liver disease. Waist circumference emerged as a potential first step to identify patients at risk for liver fibrosis in the general population.

Evidence and rationale — HCV: In the current era of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for HCV, excluding stage F0–1 prior to treatment is less clinically relevant than detecting advanced fibrosis (F3–4) or cirrhosis. A systematic review of 10 simple and complex biomarker panels reported that clinically relevant predictive values (PPV ≥ 90% and NPV ≥ 95%) for significant fibrosis (F2–4) were achieved for only 35% of patients with HCV before therapy. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and FIB-4 are described as the best validated simple, cheap, readily available nonproprietary tests but are associated with "indeterminate" range scores and unreliable diagnostic performance in some patients, while FibroTest and, in the United States, FibroSURE are noted as the most validated proprietary blood-based biomarker algorithms.

AASLD–IDSA simplified HCV treatment — eligibility and pretreatment assessment for treatment‑naive adults without cirrhosis specify that adults with chronic hepatitis C (any genotype) who do not have cirrhosis and have not previously received hepatitis C treatment are eligible, whereas patients with prior hepatitis C treatment, cirrhosis, end‑stage renal disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), HIV or HBsAg positive, current pregnancy, known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma, or prior liver transplantation are not eligible. For cirrhosis assessment, a patient is presumed to have cirrhosis if they have a FIB‑4 score > 3.25 or findings such as FibroScan stiffness > 12.5 kPa or platelet count < 150,000/mm3. Pretreatment laboratory testing includes, within 6 months of initiating treatment, a complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and calculated glomerular filtration rate; any time prior to therapy, quantitative HCV RNA, HIV antigen/antibody test, and hepatitis B surface antigen; and before initiating therapy, serum pregnancy testing and counseling about pregnancy risks for women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

We found APRI to be the best index to predict advanced liver fibrosis compared to FIB-4 and AST/ALT ratio, with this index having the strongest correlation with FibroScan results. Therefore, in the setting of limited resources where FibroScan is not available, APRI is an appropriate index for the prediction of significant liver fibrosis, contributing to decision making for further evaluations, referral to higher levels, and potentially lifestyle modifications or prescription of medications.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112nGVnn]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) primary care risk assessment — In low-prevalence settings, use fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) to exclude advanced fibrosis; when FIB-4 is < 1.3, patients can be followed in primary care with periodic reassessment. Patients with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or ≥ 2 metabolic risk factors can be reassessed every 2–3 years, and those with prediabetes/T2DM or 2 or more metabolic risk factors may warrant more frequent FIB-4 monitoring (eg, every 1–2 y). In patients older than 65, a FIB-4 cutoff of > 2.0 should be used; FIB-4 has low accuracy in those under age 35, so secondary assessment should be considered in those < 35 with increased metabolic risk or elevated liver chemistries, and FIB-4 should not be used alone in acutely ill patients.

### AST / ALT ratio, APRI, and FIB-4 compared to fibroScan for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B in bandar abbas, hormozgan, iran [^113sCks2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

By comparing APRI with FIB-4 and AST/ALT ratio, we discovered that APRI had the strongest correlation with the findings of FibroScan and was the most effective marker for ruling out advanced liver fibrosis. Moreover, it was the best index to rule in any grade of liver fibrosis in CHB patients. Thus, in order to evaluate liver fibrosis in CHB patients, APRI seems to be the best FibroScan alternative, aiding in the choice of further potentially invasive tests, refer patients to higher levels of care, and recommend lifestyle changes. Future studies should take body mass index, hepatitis B activity, and FIB-5 scores into consideration.

Estimation of liver fibrosis in NAFLD — biomarkers (FIB-4 and ELF): Noninvasive tests (NITs) "derived from clinical variables can estimate of the presence of advanced fibrosis", and among them "FIB-4 is the most validated". FIB-4 "is calculated using a simple algorithm based upon age, ALT, AST, and platelet count" and status categories span low risk "(< 1.3)" to intermediate "(1.3–2.67)" to high risk "(> 2.67)", which "may be used to assess clinical progression". Despite statistical inferiority to some alternatives, "FIB-4 is still recommended as a first-line assessment for general practitioners and endocrinologists based on its simplicity and minimal, if any, added cost". High-risk biomarker thresholds are also defined for ELF: "An ELF score of ≥ 9.8 reliably identifies patients with NAFLD at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver-related clinical events".

### Validation of novel fibrosis index (NFI) for assessment of liver fibrosis: comparison with transient elastography (fibroScan) [^116DwxSC]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Previously many studies tried to find out the authentic, non-distressing biomarkers and tried to determine the ties between aminotransferases level, hyaluronic acid levels, number of platelets, collagen levels and baseline viral load with fibrosis but to no avail, as results were uncertain. Since then different thresholds of several scoring indices like AAR, APRI, FI, FIB-4, API, Pohl score and FCI have been proclaimed to anticipate the existence and non-existence of fibrosis or cirrhosis in patients infected with HCV. However, earlier stages of fibrosis and mild fibrosis cannot be determined accurately by using only one structure of biomarkers, also all the readily available indices have some limitations like inability to differentiate all fibrosis stages singly and some have been constructed primarily for patients having co-infection. In this study, we collated the diagnostic performance of non-invasive indices with transient elastography, that is, FibroScan, which are available to predict cirrhosis like AAR, APRI, FI, FIB-4, API, Pohl score and FCI. They are cheap, readily available, non-invasive and cost-effective than other non-invasive techniques like transient elastography, that is, FibroScan. For this objective and assessment of much earlier stages of fibrosis, we refined a new serum fibrosis index by evaluating several clinical and pathological aspects.

Our results back the latest recommendations by the European Association for the Study of the Liver to apply non-invasive tests as first-line tests in prognostication of liver fibrosis. According to our conclusions and these new recommendations, liver biopsy is needed only if redundant non-invasive tests show dissension. Blood markers can be used to predict cirrhosis and advanced stages of fibrosis and should be used if transient elastography is not available or cost-effective to patient or when diagnostic yield is constrained as in patients with obesity.

For AAR at cut-off value < 1, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity was 41.9% and area under curve (AUC) was 0.377 for predicting F0–F3. At cut-off value > 1, sensitivity and specificity were 62.8% and 37.6%, respectively, with AUC = 0.412 for F4 and our study results support the results of other studies.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver fibrosis assessment

An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated advancing liver fibrosis as the key predictor of liver-related events and mortality in patients with NAFLD. Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (equivalent to Brunt fibrosis stage 3 or 4) are at increased risk of complications of chronic liver disease, decompensation, liver transplantation and death in the short- to medium-term.

Since liver blood tests and ultrasound poorly discriminate fibrosis stage, primary care pathways for patients with NAFLD should assess for the presence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using validated non-invasive fibrosis tests. Accordingly, we suggest the finding of liver steatosis on ultrasound, or unexplained abnormal liver blood tests, should prompt risk assessment for liver fibrosis (Recommendation 4, Table 1). Use validated widely available non-invasive tests with high negative predictive value to risk assess for significant liver fibrosis in the community (Recommendation 5, Table 1). Refer patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis to a hepatologist. For patients stratified as indeterminate risk, offer further discriminatory tests (such as transient elastography or ELF test) or refer for further evaluation (Recommendation 6, Table 1).

Indirect biomarkers of liver fibrosis such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis score have been shown to have prognostic value for long term outcomes and are validated against liver biopsy with good negative predictive value to rule-out advanced liver fibrosis in NAFLD. They combine routinely applied laboratory tests with clinical parameters and are easily applicable. Patients with a FIB-4 index < 1.3 (or < 2.0 if over 65 years) or NFS < -1.455 (or < 0.12 if over 65 years) have a low probability of having advanced fibrosis and can be reassured –. Of note, neither the FIB-4 nor the NFS have been validated in patients under 35 years of age. Evidence for the performance of other biomarkers such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test (ELF) or transient elastography (discussed below) in young patient cohorts is also lacking so non-invasive tests should be interpreted with caution in this age group.

Approach to common conditions

NAFLD

NAFLD is diagnosed by the presence of an echobright liver on ultrasound in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. For adults with NAFLD it is recommended that a first-line, non-invasive assessment, such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4)or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), is undertaken to identify patients with advanced fibrosis (table 3). Patients with a low FIB-4 (< 1.3 for those aged < 65 years or < 2.0 for those > 65 years) or low NFS (< −1.455 for those aged < 65 years or < 0.12 for those > 65 years) can be managed in primary care. Presently, the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD is to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity with the aim of inducing gradual and long-term weight loss (see figures 1 and 2).

Table 3
Non-invasive algorithms for gauging liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD

Those patients with indeterminate FIB-4 (1.3–3.25) or NFS scores (−1.455 to 0.675) should undergo further testing with a second-line test such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. The decision to use Fibroscan or ARFI should be based on local expertise and availability of respective devices. Consider referral to a specialist clinic for patients with serum ELF measurements > 9.5 or Fibroscan > 7.8 kPa. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturerand thus should be tailored to the device used.

Finally, those patients with elevated FIB-4 (> 3.25) or NFS (> 0.675) should be considered for referral to a specialist clinic irrespective of second-line tests. Non-invasive markers of fibrosis have not been sufficiently validated in children to recommend routine use in clinical practice.

Statement 5: In Patients With NAFLD and Metabolic Risks, Presence of Hepatic Fibrosis Should Be Considered Regardless of Level of Transaminase Elevation

This statement targets PCPs, who often do not consider the risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and metabolic risk factors, particularly in those with normal transaminases". Consideration of hepatic fibrosis" may include diagnostic efforts and interventions or eventual referral to a specialist. The statement may challenge deep-rooted PCP-referral patterns that rely heavily on transaminase elevation. Emerging literature suggests that an approach based on transaminase elevation likely will miss many patients with NASH and clinically significant fibrosis (≥ F2) — stages that correlate with adverse liver outcomes.

While organizations' guidelines agree that patients with NAFLD, cardiometabolic risk factors, and elevated transaminases should be evaluated for hepatic fibrosis, disagreement exists on how to proceed if transaminases are "normal" in the presence of the other 2 variables. Various guidelines recommend for, and against, routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends a "high index of suspicion for NAFLD and NASH in patients with T2D", while other guidelines recommend that clinicians "consider" screening high-risk individuals (age above 50 y, T2D, or MetS). The American Diabetes Association suggests that patients with prediabetes or T2D and elevated ALT or NAFLD per ultrasound "should be evaluated" for steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis.

### Screening for MAFLD: who, when and how? [^111FaUP6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Apart from the mentioned parameters, there are specific scores that combine different variables for the evaluation of MAFLD in an individual. These scores range from the diagnosis of fatty liver to quantification of fibrosis in a patient with MAFLD. The fatty liver index (FLI) incorporates the patient's BMI, waist circumference, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and serum triglyceride levels. Liver fibrosis is considered. Liver fibrosis is the principal determinant of liver-related morbidity and mortality in patients with MAFLD. Therefore, non-invasive fibrosis scores in patients with MAFLD have been developed, mainly to exclude the presence of advanced fibrosis. These scores include the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) that considers fasting glucose and albumin, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), which takes into account age, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and platelet count. Comparison of the non-invasive markers of fibrosis showed the superiority of the FIB-4 score over other commonly used scores. Of the non-invasive blood tests, FIB-4 and NFS mostly outperformed the other scoring systems (namely, APRI and BARD, which stands for BMI, AST/ALT ratio and presence of T2DM) for both MAFLD and NAFLD. Even though these two tests can be used with confidence in overweight, obese and severely obese patients, their performance in lean and morbidly obese patients was found to be questionable.

Even though we described many aspects regarding the diagnostic tests, these tests alone are not able to define the patients at high risk of advanced fibrosis adequately. Therefore, for the NAFLD patients, a further diagnostic method, such as Fibroscan following FIB-4 is recommended. This stepwise approach can significantly lower the unnecessary biopsies. ADAPT followed by Fibroscan and FIB-4, succeeded by the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score are other diagnostic options, which were shown to increase the diagnostic rate.

Even though more studies need to be carried out to validate the more effective methods for fibrosis assessment in the MAFLD defined population, these studies show a clear path for starting risk assessment. By measuring simple clinical parameters, diagnosis and damage stratification can be carried out in the population.

NAFLD — Screening for advanced fibrosis and risk stratification prioritizes high‑risk groups and staged noninvasive testing. General population-based screening for NAFLD is not advised, whereas high-risk individuals should be screened for advanced fibrosis. All patients with hepatic steatosis or clinically suspected NAFLD should undergo primary risk assessment with the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), and in prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or with 2 or more metabolic risk factors or imaging steatosis, FIB-4 should be repeated every 1–2 y with secondary assessment considered. If FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, vibration-controlled elastography (VCTE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), or enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) may be used to exclude advanced fibrosis. In nongastroenterology/hepatology settings, suspected advanced NASH or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) warrant specialist referral; patients with NASH cirrhosis require routine surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal varices, and decompensation monitoring. ELF > 11.3 is linked to hepatic decompensation in advanced fibrosis and should prompt screening and management of cirrhosis and portal hypertensive complications.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114aStch]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Noninvasive testing performance and sequential strategies in NAFLD — prevalence and sequential testing data support a tiered approach. In primary care clinic populations of patients with risk factors for NAFLD, the prevalence of advanced fibrosis (F3–F4) is higher than previously recognized, ranging from 9% to 15% in different studies, and most NITs have high negative predictive values at the low cutoffs. Sequential testing improves accuracy: the risk-stratification process is supported by a study of 759 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD showing that noninvasive fibrosis scores followed by LSM (with FibroScan) only for indeterminate or high scores was most accurate, and another study of 968 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD found sequential testing using NAFLD Fibrosis Score or FIB-4 followed by FibroScan for indeterminate scores was more accurate than using tests individually. For aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index, a tertiary-center study reported a value of ≤ 0.48 had a negative predictive value of 78% and a value of > 1.34 had a positive predictive value of 78%, with values between 0.49 and 1.33 representing the indeterminate group.

### Fibrosis-4 index vs nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score in identifying advanced fibrosis in subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis [^115kvNUD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), advanced fibrosis (AF) carries the highest risk of adverse liver-related events. To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, several noninvasive tools (NITs) for the risk stratification of fibrosis have been developed. We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the performance of the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis scores (NFS), the 2 most common NITs, for the appropriate selection of subjects with AF for biopsy.

Methods

Four databases were searched until December 2020 (CRD42021224766). Original articles reporting data on the performance of FIB-4 and NFS, interpreted according to standard cutoffs in subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD, were included. Separate data extractions were performed according to the lower cutoff, the higher cutoff, and the dual threshold approach. The numbers of subjects classified as true-negative, true-positive, false-negative, and false-positive were extracted. Summary operating points were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Eighteen studies evaluating 12,604 subjects were included. Participants were adult outpatients with biopsy-proven NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Overall, a weak-to-moderate performance was found for both scores. The head-to-head comparison showed FIB-4 to be associated with a higher performance in ruling in and NFS in ruling out AF in the single threshold approach, whereas, with the dual threshold approach, a lower prevalence of indeterminate findings was found for FIB-4.

Discussion

This meta-analysis suggested that currently available NITs have a limited performance in identifying AF among subjects with NAFLD. Further studies are needed to optimize existing thresholds or develop new NITs.

### Use of new CORE risk score to predict 10 year risk of liver cirrhosis in general population: population based cohort study [^1161ha3A]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

In terms of predicted risk, a CORE risk estimation of 0.4% largely corresponds to a FIB-4 value of 1.3, and a CORE risk estimation of 5% corresponds to a FIB-4 value of 2.67. However, health economic evaluations are needed to inform what risk threshold should motivate referral for hepatology evaluation or second line tests such as vibration controlled transient elastography. Although CORE had a higher net benefit (that is, identified more true positives per false positive or vice versa) than FIB-4 at all risk thresholds, which threshold is appropriate to choose for referral in clinical practice is not apparent. This would depend on differing willingness to pay between countries, as well as on the development of novel therapies. One also needs to separately consider organised screening (for example, by invitation every one to three years for patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes) and opportunistic screening (for example, by testing CORE when patients with obesity visit primary care for other reasons). To our knowledge, this has not been earnestly discussed in the presentation of these types of risk scores or in the field as a whole.

Liver disease severity assessment in chronic hepatitis B — Determination of liver disease severity is integral to monitoring because of its importance to making treatment and surveillance decisions, and non-invasive tests of fibrosis such as hepatic transient elastography or serum markers such as FIB-4 can be considered for fibrosis staging, with elastography generally showing better performance than FIB-4; liver biopsy is infrequently used but is the most accurate means of defining severity of inflammation.

### Cost-comparison analysis of FIB-4, ELF and fibroscan in community pathways for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112jcLRn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In all scenarios SC delivered by PCPs included history, physical assessment followed by investigation of liver function, tests for viral, immune and metabolic causes of liver disease and an ultrasound scan in order to make an assessment of the risk of advanced liver fibrosis. This was classified as a binary outcome with the case deemed to be at 'high risk' of advanced liver disease necessitating referral to a specialist, or at 'low risk' and thus appropriate for management in primary care. This decision process required 3 PCP consultations, 3 routine bloods tests and 1 ultrasound scan. In scenarios 2 and 3, SC was supported by the calculation of a FIB-4 score in all patients to improve the identification of patients at risk of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR ≥ F3). Low risk patients (FIB-4 < 1.30) were managed in primary care whilst high-risk patients (FIB-4 > 3.25) were referred to a specialist in secondary care. Patients with indeterminate scores (FIB-4 1.30–3.25) required an ELF test (Scenario 2) or a community fibroscan (Scenario 3). Published cut-offs were used to identify cases at increased risk of advanced fibrosis (≥ 10.3 for ELF and ≥ 7.9 kPa for Fibroscan). A fibroscan failure rate of 5% was assumed. For patients managed in Scenario 4, SC was followed by ELF test for all patients and in Scenario 5 SC was followed by fibroscan for all patients.

Patients identified as being at high-risk of advanced fibrosis were referred to a secondary care specialist. Evaluation included further blood tests, fibroscan, imaging including US scan (50% of cases, informed by local audit), CT scan (5% of cases, informed by local audit), MRI Liver (5%, informed by local audit) and liver biopsy (15% of cases, informed by local audit). Patients deemed to not have advanced fibrosis (false positive) would be discharged to primary care, whilst those confirmed with advanced fibrosis would enter recognised surveillance pathways.

The time horizon for the base-case was 1 year to assess short-term benefits, likely to relate to resource utilisation. A 5- year timeframe was applied to assess the longer-term implications.

Interpreting FIB-4 score

The FIB-4 index helps in stratifying the patients into various groups of risk regarding liver fibrosis. A FIB-4 score of < 1.45 is taken to indicate a low risk for significant fibrosis, suggesting a low likelihood of advanced liver disease, for which further evaluation may not be necessary. Scores of FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 reflect indeterminate risk. Patients in this range will likely need additional tests confirming the extent of fibrosis, such as liver imaging e.g. elastography or FibroScan or liver biopsy. The FIB-4 score of > 3.25 signifies a high risk for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis, where a high likelihood of advanced fibrosis is considered; thus, further management, including referral for liver biopsy or advanced imaging, is recommended.

Calculation of NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) by the following formula:

Interpreting NFS score

The NAFLD Fibrosis Score allows stratification of the patients according to their possibility of having advanced liver fibrosis. An NFS < -1.455 means a low likelihood of advanced fibrosis, having a negative predictive value of approximately 90%, and therefore, clinically significant fibrosis is unlikely. A score ranging from -1.455 to 0.675 is an indeterminate risk, and additional evaluation may be recommended for staging the extent of fibrosis, as with FibroScan or liver biopsy. An NFS above 0.675 indicates an increased probability of advanced fibrosis and carries an approximate 82% positive predictive value for such a condition, reflecting more severe liver damage.

Calculation of steatosis indices

Calculation of Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) by the following formula:

Interpreting HSI score

The Hepatic Steatosis Index is a method of assessing the probability of hepatic steatosis. An HSI < 30 indicates a low probability of hepatic steatosis and, therefore, a low concern for fatty liver. A score between 30 and 36 is indeterminate, where confirmation of liver fat by imaging or biopsy may be required. An HSI > 36 indicates a high probability of hepatic steatosis, and this would suggest the presence of fatty liver that has to be further managed clinically.

Calculation of Fatty liver index (FLI) by the following Formula:

The FLI is calculated using the following formula:

Where: ln = natural logarithm, TG = Triglycerides (mg/dL), BMI = Body Mass Index (kg/m 2), GGT = Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (U/L), WC = Waist Circumference (cm).

### Accuracy of blood-based biomarkers for staging liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a systematic review supporting the AASLD practice guideline [^117CNa7y]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Stage F4 HCV — diagnostic accuracy of APRI and FIB-4 is reported with pooled performance metrics and strength ratings. For APRI across progressively higher thresholds, pooled sensitivity/specificity and likelihood ratios (LR) are: 0.81 (0.72 to 0.88) and 0.72 (0.66 to 0.78) with LR+ 2.86 and LR− 0.26; 0.76 (0.72 to 0.80) and 0.86 (0.83 to 0.90) with LR+ 3.12 and LR− 0.31; 0.64 (0.59 to 0.69) and 0.82 (0.76 to 0.88) with LR+ 3.82 and LR− 0.36; 0.54 (0.50 to 0.59) and 0.94 (0.91 to 0.97) with LR+ 7.15 and LR− 0.63; corresponding diagnostic odds ratios are 10.96, 9.99, 10.55, and 11.36, and evidence is rated Moderate. For FIB-4, pooled sensitivity/specificity and LR are 0.88 (0.80 to 0.93) and 0.63 (0.51 to 0.74) with LR+ 2.39 and LR− 0.21, and at a higher threshold 0.68 (0.63 to 0.78) and 0.79 (0.75 to 0.83) with LR+ 3.48 and LR− 0.34; diagnostic odds ratios are 12.54 and 10.19, with strength of evidence Moderate.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^115vXAU7]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Technical remarks — combination strategies, cutoffs, and sequential approach: Very few studies are available that have solely compared the combination of serum biomarkers to a single biomarker; simple single blood-based NILDA such as APRI, FIB-4, and NFS with upper and lower cutoffs (e.g. FIB-4 1.3–2.67) are available, and 2-step cutoffs categorization can better classify patients according to fibrosis severity. Analyses supporting PICO 3 provided imprecise diagnostic estimates with quality of evidence judged to be low; for identifying patients with NAFLD advanced fibrosis, AASLD recommended a sequential approach with FIB-4 followed by imaging NILDA or ELF in FIB-4 ≥ 1.3 when available.

Statement 4: NASH Should Be Confirmed by Liver Biopsy Before Initiating Pharmacological Therapy in NAFLD

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm NASH, new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These are stages that correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4+ ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising NIT is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by TE with AST. In the derivative/validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with AUROC of ~0.80 and 2 author-determined cutoffs: the first (≤ 0.35) to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2 and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

### Validation of novel fibrosis index (NFI) for assessment of liver fibrosis: comparison with transient elastography (fibroScan) [^1157Coyh]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

The following formulas were used to review the predicted scores with particular cut-off values:

AAR = AST (IU/L)/ALT (IU/L)

If AST/ALT ≥ 1, significant cirrhosis.

APRI = [{AST (IU/L)/ALT_ULN (IU/L)} × 100]/platelet count (10⁹/L)

If APRI < 0.5, no or minimal fibrosis; if APRI > 1.5, significant fibrosis.

FI = 8.0 − 0.01 × PLT (10⁹/L) − serum albumin (g/dL)

If FI < 2.1, no or minimal fibrosis; FI ≥ 2.1, significant fibrosis and FI ≥ 3.3, significant cirrhosis.

FIB-4 = [age (years) × AST (IU/L)]/[platelet count (×10⁹/L) × √(ALT (IU/L))] If FIB-4 < 1.45, no or minimal fibrosis, if FIB-4 > 3.25, significant fibrosis.
FCI = (alkaline phosphatase × serum bilirubin/serum albumin × platelet count)

If FCI < 0.131, significant fibrosis; if FCI > 1.25, significant cirrhosis.

API = age/Platelet Index

Age (years) < 30 = 0; 30–39 = 1; 40–49 = 2; 50–59 = 3; 60–69 = 4; ≥ 70 = 5.

Platelet count (10⁹/L): ≥ 225 = 0; 200–224 = 1; 175–199 = 2; 150–174 = 3; 125–149 = 4; < 125 = 5.

It ranges from 0 to 10, where 0–2 = no or minimal fibrosis, 3–5 = mild fibrosis with few septa formation and 6 ≥ bridging fibrosis to cirrhosis and/or moderate-to-severe necroinflammatory lesions.

Pohl score; AST:ALT:platelet count (10⁹/L)

If AST/ALT < 1 and platelet count > 150 000 then excludes marked fibrosis.

NAFLD — combinations of TE-LSM with blood-based tests for advanced fibrosis show specific performance metrics. Sequential TE-LSM for patients in the indeterminate range for NFS or FIB-4 or after TE > 7.9 kPa was associated with an increased accuracy of 70%, reducing uncertainty to 20% with 9–11% misclassified. In a multicenter phase III trial of 3202 patients with NAFLD (71% of participants had F3–4), synchronous TE-LSM+FIB-4 or NFS reduced misclassification to < 5%, and sequential FIB-4 and TE-LSM reduced the indeterminate range to 20% but increased the misclassified proportion to 20%. A model combining TE-LSM, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and AST (FAST score) with upper and lower index cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity at ≥ 0.9 has been proposed to identify patients with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS ≥ 4), and ≥ F2, but 30–39% remained indeterminate. More recently, in 577 subjects, combining FIB-4 (using a threshold of 1.3) with either TE-LSM or 2D-SWE-LSM (both thresholds 8 kPa) outperformed either test alone, and when all three tests were combined performance was accuracy 81%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 89.5%, PPV 82%, NPV 81%, reducing liver biopsy need to 7.3%. In clinical practice, a sequential approach using TE-LSM or ELF in those with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3 is recommended.

Introduction

Chronic liver disease (CLD) can lead to a progressive accumulation of fibrosis in the liver which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The burden of CLD worldwide is substantial, with approximatively 2 million deaths annually attributed to cirrhosis and HCC, caused mainly by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-related liver disease, or viral hepatitis, in addition to other important but less common causes of CLD.

Both the prognosis and the management of CLD patients are closely linked to liver fibrosis. Treating the cause of CLD is mandatory to prevent further progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis and its complications. Liver biopsy is the reference procedure for a liver fibrosis evaluation, but its invasive nature makes it unsuitable as a first-line procedure. Blood tests and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography have been recently developed for the noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis and provide an exciting alternative to biopsy. However, the high cost of the most accurate blood fibrosis test (Fibrosure, Fibrometer) limits its widespread use and liver elastometry is only accessible in specialized centers. Other scores, simple and usable in current medical practice, are based on a simple and free calculation of commonly measured biomarkers: FIB-4 Aspartate aminotransferase to Platelets Ratio Index, NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). Among these noninvasive simple indexes, FIB-4 and NFS offer the best diagnostic performance for detecting significant fibrosis.

In practice, most CLD patients are seen and managed by general practitioners (GPs) who encounter challenges in evaluating a liver disease that remains silent for many years with normal routine diagnostic tests. In addition, GPs have very limited access to the best noninvasive liver fibrosis tests. Consequently, CLD remains unrecognized in many patients with progressive fibrosis. Thus, the liver conditions in these patients are diagnosed too late when they have reached the stage of cirrhosis.

The FIB-4 score appears as a new screening tool for hepatic fibrosis, which is simple, based on biomarkers of current practice, free of charge, and usable 'at a glance' by all physicians, who may or may not be specialized in hepatology. FIB-4 can be automatically generated as soon as the transaminases and platelets levels are measured. Earlier detection and management of CLD would be possible by detecting significant fibrosis through the use of FIB-4 in primary care.

### AST / ALT ratio, APRI, and FIB-4 compared to fibroScan for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B in bandar abbas, hormozgan, iran [^112vPLJw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study's findings demonstrated that APRI can rule in any grade of liver fibrosis (with a PPV of 90.8%) and rule out F3/F4 of liver fibrosis (with an NPV of 95.4%) in CHB patients. Moreover, this index showed the highest AUROC compared to AST/ALT ratio and FIB-4 for the detection of any grade of liver fibrosis and superior AUROC than AST/ALT ratio but similar AUROC to FIB-4 for distinguishing between F3/F4 and F0-F2 of liver fibrosis in these patients.

Chronic hepatitis B is still widespread worldwide. The treatment, monitoring, and prognosis of CHB patients depend on an accurate diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques have attracted a lot of attention in recent years as means of determining the stage of hepatic fibrosis; nevertheless, a large number of CHB patients without fibrosis were mistakenly diagnosed as having significant fibrosis by the most commonly used indices in clinical practice, proving that these indices were ineffective in predicting CHB-related liver fibrosis. A false-positive result may lead to early or unnecessary use of antiviral medications and the accompanying risk of drug toxicity and possible drug resistance. On the other hand, given the potential risks of liver biopsy and the cost of FibroScan in areas with limited resources, non-invasive hepatic fibrosis assessment is necessary.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Use of NITs in NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 1 states that noninvasive tests (NITs) can be used for risk stratification in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A key predictor for liver-related outcomes is advanced fibrosis (AF), defined as presence of stage 3 (bridging fibrosis) or 4 (cirrhosis) on liver biopsy. The Fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4) is calculated using age, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and platelet count, outperforms other calculations in identifying patients with a low probability of AF, and is recommended as a first-line assessment for practitioners based on its simplicity and low cost. An Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score > 9.8 reliably identifies patients with NAFLD at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and liver-related clinical events. Imaging-based biomarkers, including vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE), shear wave elastography (SWE), and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), are used most frequently and have been validated.

Table 3 — Proportional odds ratio (POR) comparisons of APRI with other serum tests indicate specific advantages for FIB-4 at defined cutoffs. The proportional odds ratio compares the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of APRI to other tests, and a 95% CI that excludes 1 can suggest a significant difference. FIB-4 (1.45) was significantly better than APRI (0.5) for F2–4 with POR: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99). FIB-4 (3.25) was better than APRI (1.5) for F3–4 with POR: 0.58 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.81) and for F4 with POR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.66).

BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ragazzo et al. compared FibroScan, VTQ, the enhanced liver fibrosis test, the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, and the FIB-4 index with liver biopsy results for evaluation of fibrosis. In that study, FibroScan and VTQ remained the most effective methods for evaluating all degrees of fibrosis. The accuracy of all methodologies was best at F4. However, the authors did not examine SVR and non-SVR status. Vallet-Pichard et al. compared the FIB-4 index with the Fibro test and METAVIR scores, respectively, and found that FIB-4 index was associated with Fibro test and METAVIR scores. However, the study also did not distinguish between SVR and non-SVR. Therefore, these studies may be influenced by SVR status.

Nagata et al. and Chen et al. reported that FIB4-Index and M2BPGi levels are significantly decreased regardless of degree of fibrosis in SVR patients. In addition, Bachofner et al. reported that FIB-4 index levels are also decreased in SVR patients. SVR status of patients in this study is shown in Table 2. The AST, ALT and HCC stages of SVR patients tended to be lower than those of non-SVR patients. In this study, the AUC of FIB-4 index and M2BPGi appeared to be low, which seemed to be due to the inclusion of SVR patients. Taking these effects into consideration, a similar study was conducted focusing on SVR and non-SVR patients separately. Although the values were different, the benefits of FibroScan and VTQ did not change in non-SVR patients. Superiority of blood data was observed in SVR patients compared to other studies. However, since the number of SVR patients is small, it would be desirable to consider increasing the number.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment

Patients with NAFLD should undergo sequential use of a simple non-invasive test (e.g. FIB-4) and specialist non-invasive tests (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) to assess the severity of fibrosis. (Recommendation 13, Table 1). Ideally, an initial fibrosis assessment should have been undertaken in primary care and patients with suspected advanced fibrosis referred into secondary care as they have the greatest risk of hepatic morbidity. In secondary care, fibrosis stage should be confirmed, or second line testing conducted with more specialist tests in individuals where simple non-invasive tests are indeterminate. The performance of biomarkers may be influenced by the prevalence of the target condition in the population being assessed so clinicians should consider the likely disease prevalence in their practice setting and adopt suitable test thresholds to achieve the desired performance. In general, use of simple non-invasive tests excludes the majority of cases with mild fibrosis. Addition of a second line test (e.g. ELF, transient elastography or ARFI), further reduces the number of cases with an indeterminate score, allowing liver biopsy to be reserved for use in a minority of patients where it adds additional useful information. Such two-stage care pathways are currently considered to provide the most robust means for the risk-stratification of patients with NAFLD. Ongoing regular non-invasive fibrosis reassessment should be considered every 1–3 years to monitor response to treatment or for fibrosis progression.

In this study, we validated the performance of the noninvasive diagnostic model acFibroMASH index in predicting at-risk MASH based on pathological diagnosis of liver tissue biopsies, with an AUC of 0.780. This value suggests that the model has excellent diagnostic ability to differentiate at-risk MASH accurately. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of other noninvasive fibrosis indicators was evaluated. Among the evaluated models, the AUC of FAST was 0.770 (95% CI: 0.717, 0.823), comparable to the diagnostic performance of acFibroMASH. FAST, a validated model designed explicitly for identifying at-risk MASH, was established by British academics by combining LSM and CAP, measured by FibroScan and AST. It has been subjected to several external validations. Notably, the diagnostic efficacy of acFibroMASH and FAST was superior to that of FIB-4, NFS, and APRI. According to the AACE guidelines, the FIB-4 score is recommended to assess the risk of liver fibrosis in patients with MASLD. The specific recommendations are: FIB-4 < 1.3: low risk, FIB-4 > 2.67: high risk, FIB-4 1.3–2.67: uncertain risk. We, therefore, analyzed at-risk MASH by borrowing the two cut-off values for FIB-4. FIB-4, NFS and APRI are noninvasive diagnostic models based on routine laboratory parameters that are widely used in clinical settings, especially in primary care and resource-limited settings, because of their low cost and ease of use. However, these models were initially designed for advanced liver fibrosis, are not sensitive enough for early liver fibrosis, are prone to underdiagnose patients with mild fibrosis, and do not reflect the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of MASH. In contrast, the acFibroMASH and FAST models, which integrate LSM data, have higher diagnostic accuracy and are notably superior to FIB-4, NFS, and APRI in identifying at-risk MASH. However, their reliance on the FibroScan device may increase the cost of the assay, limiting its application in resource-limited settings. However, with the increasing adoption of liver elastometry, there is a growing expectation that the applications of acFibroMASH and FAST will expand, leading to an enhancement in the diagnostic process and an improvement in the early diagnosis rate and management efficiency of patients with at-risk MASH.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116eYsuT]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Noninvasive liver fibrosis assessment in T2DM with NAFLD — clinical prediction calculators such as the FIB-4, non-alcoholic fibrosis score (NFS), AST-to-platelet ratio index, and aspartate aminotransferase/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio may be used to assess advanced liver fibrosis and classify patients by the probability of disease, often defined as F3 and F4 by histopathological criteria. In patients with T2DM, the FIB-4 test has consistently performed favorably compared with other prediction models and is the only one with evidence demonstrating likelihood ratios reaching clinical usefulness. With a threshold of 2.67 to predict a high likelihood of advanced fibrosis, the FIB-4 is more specific than it is sensitive and is therefore better at ruling in rather than ruling out significant fibrosis, raising concerns for false negatives. The FIB-4 has been validated in patients under age 65, so caution should be exercised when interpreting results in older adults. Across models, including FIB-4, performance underperforms in patients with diabetes compared with the general population, and the current evidence informing this topic is generally of low quality with methodologic limitations.

### Validation of novel fibrosis index (NFI) for assessment of liver fibrosis: comparison with transient elastography (fibroScan) [^111yMBPL]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Identification of infected individuals early in the disease process is the crucial point of management and follow-up. It is the assessment of progression to cirrhosis that is of high priority in devising treatment plan of each patient. This assessment remains a substantial challenge.

Conventionally, liver biopsy had been a gold standard for staging of fibrosis, however, it is an invasive procedure requiring workforce (skilful handling), bringing discomfort and significant expense to patient. Moreover, internal bleeding may occur thereafter. Variability among observersin scoring liver biopsies, inability to follow-up progression and a sampling error up to 30% is also problematic.

A number of non-invasive markers have been developed which are useful supplements to asses stages of fibrosis. These are biomarkers (aspartate transaminase (AST) to alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio (AAR), AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), fibrosis index (FI), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), Age-Platelet Index (API), Pohl score, Fibrosis Cirrhosis Index (FCI)) and radiological markers including MRI and transient elastography.

Ultrasound-based FibroScan is one recent development (first machine inaugurated in 2010 in Pakistan at the National Institute of Liver and Gastrointestinal Diseases, Dow University), but it is quite expensive technique and its universality or accessibility is also an issue in curbing prevalent hepatitis in low-income and middle-income countries. Moreover, obesity is another limitation in diagnostic yield of FibroScan.

We tried to examine whether the combination of certain biomarkers can make assessment of liver fibrosis more precise. Then, we tried to evaluate and asses the combined diagnostic presentation of cheap and easily accessible biomarkers if they could serve same purpose as FibroScan score in predicting prognosis of chronic liver disease in clinical practice.

A priori hypothesis

Validation of cheap and readily available serum biomarkers in correlation to transient elastography and developing a new index, Novel Fibrosis Index (NFI), if that can give prognosis of liver fibrosis without essential reliance on FibroScan that may not be available or unaffordable to patient.

### Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111Tjbi9]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPDMA was reported in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-IPD Statementand was registered as PROSPERO CRD42019157661.

Criteria for considering studies for the IPD meta-analysis

Patients

Studies reporting data on adults (≥ 18 years) with NAFLD and paired liver histology and LSM-VCTE were eligible. When studies reported study groups of participants with unselected aetiologies, only IPD of those with NAFLD were sought.

Index tests

The index test of main interest was LSM-VCTE performed with FibroScan (Echosens, France). Results for serum-based biomarkers NSF, FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratioand AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI)) were also computed where data were available. Online supplemental table 1 summarises the definition of NITs considered in this IPDMA.

Universally accepted cut-offs for diagnosing different groups of fibrosis stages do not exist (several suggested cut-offs are presented in online supplemental table 2). For LSM-VCTE, < 7.9 kPa and ≥ 9.6 kPa are the most used for respectively ruling out and in, advanced fibrosis.

Reference standard

Only studies reporting histological classification of liver fibrosis based on the non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) staging system were considered.

Target conditions

Advanced fibrosis (F3–4) and cirrhosis (F4) were the target conditions of interest. To fulfil the aims of the study, cut-offs were selected to rule out or rule in advanced fibrosis, and to rule out advanced fibrosis or rule in cirrhosis.

Study design

All study designs were considered if they were reporting on patients with NAFLD undergoing both liver biopsy and LSM-VCTE within 6 months. No language restrictions were applied.

Establishing collaborations

Authors of eligible studies were contacted by email and reminders were sent if a response was not received within 2 weeks. Only data from studies that received ethical approval were used. Additional ethical approval was not sought for the meta-analysis as only anonymised data were provided.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^113xfmdU]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD practice guideline — blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) recommendations for fibrosis staging: In adult patients with chronic HBV and HCV undergoing fibrosis staging prior to antiviral therapy, AASLD recommends using simple blood-based NILDA such as APRI or Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) as an initial test to detect significant (F2–4), advanced fibrosis (F3–4) or cirrhosis (F4) compared with no test (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In adult patients with NAFLD undergoing fibrosis staging, AASLD recommends using simple blood-based NILDA tests such as FIB-4 to detect advanced fibrosis (F3–4) compared to no test (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In adult patients with ALD or chronic cholestatic liver disease undergoing fibrosis staging, there is insufficient evidence to recommend using blood-based NILDA for staging fibrosis (ungraded statement).

### Baveno VII-renewing consensus in portal hypertension [^113L6iuf]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to liver elastography follow-up, Baveno VII 2022 guidelines recommend to repeat an index liver stiffness measurement ≥ 10 kPa in fasting conditions as soon as feasible or complement with an established serum marker of fibrosis (FIB-4 ≥ 2.67, enhance liver fibrosis test ≥ 9.8, FibroTest ≥ 0.58 for alcohol-related/viral liver disease, FibroTest ≥ 0.48 for MASLD) since transient elastography can lead to false-positive results.

### Liver fibrosis assessments using fibroScan, virtual-touch tissue quantification, the FIB-4 index, and mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer levels compared with pathological findings of liver resection specimens in patients with hepatitis C infection [^115MtNy5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Compared with blood-based parameters, AUC scores associated with ultrasound-based parameters were higher than those associated with blood-based parameters in almost all previous reports. Regarding these differences, ultrasonic parameters can be used to evaluate the liver specifically, while blood-based parameters such as the FIB-4 index and M2BPGi level, are influenced by factors outside the liver. As noted above, the FIB-4 index and M2BPGi level yielded relatively poor results in comparison with previous studies. According to the ROC analyses, the sensitivity and specificity of the FIB-4 index and M2BPGi level for diagnosing fibrosis decreased as liver fibrosis progressed. However, the detection of fibrosis using blood-based parameters was equivalent to that using FibroScan and VTQ for mild fibrosis stages.

There are several limitations in this study. The number of patients included in the study was small. Especially, there were only two patients of F0–1 cases with HCC. Therefore, patients with liver metastasis were included in all studies as a control in F0–1 cases. And the study population was restricted to HCC patients; blood-based parameters may be altered by the presence of HCC, which might affect the accuracy of the results. Future studies including other patient groups will be necessary for replication. In addition, there were 32 patients for whom the measurement site and resected specimen differed. Because there is a possibility of measurement error resulting from this, it would be preferable for the excision site and the measurement part to be identical. There was also some discrepancy in the results of two ultrasonic elastographies. Although it is reasonable that the presence of HCC and gender-related differences might affect the results, these effects could not be investigated in this study. In addition, there were 11 patients in the study cohort who were treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization as neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgical resection of the tumor. These treatments might have resulted in hepatocyte necrosis or inflammation, which can confound liver stiffness or FIB-4 index and M2BPGi measurements.

### The diagnostic utility of fibrosis-4 or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score combined with liver stiffness measurement by fibroscan in assessment of advanced liver fibrosis: a biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease study [^1144DwWB]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Aim

The clinical guidelines recommend the use of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and fibrosis-4 score for estimating the advanced liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, these scores are used confidently in eliminating advanced fibrosis, rather than detecting it. Therefore, paired combination with liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography is recommended. In this study, we aimed to validate this combined algorithm in our study population.

Methods

A total of 139 consecutive biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients were enrolled in the study. We calculated the noninvasive scores and performed liver stiffness measurement examination for each patient.

Results

The optimal cutoff of liver stiffness measurement for advanced fibrosis was 11.0kPa (area under curve: 0.856) with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 78%. Using the fibrosis-4 score (< 1.45 for low risk of advanced fibrosis and > 3.25 for high risk of advanced fibrosis) in combination with the liver stiffness measurement cutoffs revealed the best diagnostic performance (< 8.8kPa for low risk of advanced fibrosis and > 10.9kPa for high risk of advanced fibrosis). This paired combination had the positive predictive value of 0.735 at a sensitivity of 89% and the negative predictive value of 0.932 at a specificity of 82%.

Conclusion

A paired combination of the fibrosis-4 score and liver stiffness measurement (< 8.8kPa for exclusion of advanced fibrosis and > 10.9kPa for inclusion of advanced fibrosis) is able to diagnose the patients with advanced fibrosis with the highest diagnostic accuracy.

### Liver fibrosis assessments using fibroScan, virtual-touch tissue quantification, the FIB-4 index, and mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer levels compared with pathological findings of liver resection specimens in patients with hepatitis C infection [^111tFw7G]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

However, Nagata et al. and Chen et al. reported that FibroScan, VTQ, FIB4-Index and M2BPGi levels are significantly decreased regardless of degree of fibrosis in patients with Sustained Viral Response (SVR). In addition, Bachofner et al. reported that FIB-4 index levels are also lower in patients with SVR after treatment.

Therefore, in this study, we compared FibroScan, VTQ, FIB-4 index and the level of M2BPGi with liver fibrosis in both SVR and non-SVR groups.

Correlations were calculated between METAVIR scores and each of these ultrasound tests as well as two hematological marker-based methods: the FIB-4 index and M2BPGi level. ROC curves were generated to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values of the tests. From the results, we examined differences in reliability. Inspections were conducted by experienced examiners.

### Distribution of FIB-4 index in the general population: analysis of 75, 666 residents who underwent health checkups [^11469mvj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common diseases found by abdominal ultrasonography at health checkups. Of the 75,670 residents in Japan who underwent abdominal ultrasonography at health checkups, 23.7% were diagnosed with NAFLD. NAFLD is categorized into non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which typically does not progress, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Liver fibrosis is the most important factor associated with prognosis in patients with NAFLD. It is critical to find cases with advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Although histological assessment with liver biopsy is essential to distinguish NAFL from NASH and determine the liver fibrosis stage, it cannot be performed in all patients with fatty liver. Therefore, the use of clinical scoring tools such as the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index has been recommended to non-invasively detect advanced liver fibrosis.

FIB-4 index is based on aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, platelet count, and age. When evaluating liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, a FIB-4 index < 1.3 is categorized as low risk, while a FIB-4 index ≥ 2.67 is categorized as high risk of fibrosis. The recommendation for referral from primary care clinicians to hepatologists is a FIB-4 index ≥ 1.3. However, there is a paucity of data on the distribution of FIB-4 index in the general population with fatty liver detected by ultrasonography at health checkups in Japan. In addition, since FIB-4 index can be easily calculated using routine clinical and biochemical indices, it may be useful if it can be used for primary screening for advanced fibrosis in the general population. However, the characteristics of FIB-4 index distribution in the general population remain unknown. This large-scale community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to present data on the distribution of FIB-4 index in a general population cohort in Japan.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of fibrosis, hepatitis B, AGA 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining vibration-controlled transient elastography with a cutoff of 11.0 kPa, rather than other nonproprietary, noninvasive serum tests, such as APRI, FIB-4, to detect cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

### Accuracy of blood-based biomarkers for staging liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a systematic review supporting the AASLD practice guideline [^113VFT96]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Blood-based biomarkers for liver fibrosis — overall accuracy limits and hepatitis C virus (HCV) thresholds indicate constrained performance: a perfect diagnostic marker or biopsy-detected fibrosis will not exceed an AUROC of 0.9, and none of the tests achieved a pooled sensitivity and specificity > 0.8 for F2–4 in chronic liver disease (CLD); for HCV F3–4, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) 0.5 and FIB-4 1.45 yielded high sensitivities of 0.82–0.86, while upper thresholds APRI 1.5 and FIB-4 3.25 were associated with high specificity of 0.85–0.90 for F4; indeterminate-range scores with APRI and FIB-4 occur in greater than one-third of patients and require secondary confirmatory tests; for advanced stages of fibrosis in HCV, proprietary tests showed performance similar to simple tests with high sensitivity and comparable likelihood and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs).

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^116Nknxe]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Algorithm scope and test selection — AASLD recommends use of simple non-proprietary tests with thresholds for both non-NAFLD and NAFLD; NFS can be considered as equivalent to FIB-4 in NAFLD for assessing advanced fibrosis; the simplified algorithm is not intended for nonviremic viral hepatitis (HCV RNA or HBV DNA negative); and the degree of steatosis may decrease or disappear as fibrosis advances, so absence of steatosis on imaging with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis does not exclude fatty liver disease as an etiology.

### Parallel randomised trial testing community fibrosis assessment for suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: outcomes from LOCATE-NAFLD [^113zU18g]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Moreover, recent studies have raised concerns about the utility of FIB-4 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Boursier et al demonstrated an appreciable risk of liver-related events among patients with FIB-4 scores below 1.3 and diabetes during follow-up. Additionally, a recent study using FibroScan to assess fibrosis in community diabetes clinics found that a significant number of patients with diabetes and FIB-4 scores below 1.3 showed advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.

The reduced accuracy of FIB-4 in diabetes may be attributed to the higher pretest probability of advanced fibrosis in this group. For instance, in a study of patients with type 2 diabetes and abnormal liver enzymes, the prevalence of advanced fibrosis on liver biopsy was 38%.

This is especially relevant in an Australian population where the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 4.6%. In our cohort of unselected referrals from primary care, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance was nearly 50%, suggesting that — in our population at least — a first step of evaluation with FibroScan rather than FIB-4 may be more effective. A recent study from the UK in patients with type 2 diabetes referred from primary care demonstrated that FIB-4 had a false negative rate of 38%, and FibroScan was shown to be cost-effective with a FibroScan having the most substantial gains in quality-adjusted life years.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^114RFF54]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Psoriasis systemic therapy — methotrexate cumulative dose–related hepatotoxicity and noninvasive assessment — reports that high cumulative doses may be associated with increased risk of liver damage; cumulative methotrexate doses of 1 to 2 grams were less associated with clinically significant hepatotoxicity, whereas inflammation and fibrosis were seen with cumulative doses of 3 to 4 grams. Prior guidelines recommended consideration of liver biopsy after 3.5 to 4 cumulative grams, but noninvasive options are now available, including serologic tests such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), FibroTest/FibroSure, FibroMeter, Hepascore, and liver stiffness assessment with FibroScan. A combination of FibroTest and FibroScan with type III serum procollagen has been proposed, though type III procollagen is not widely available in the United States and these tests have not been proven to eliminate the risk of serious liver complications. Magnetic resonance elastography is a more accurate technique that should be considered if vibration-controlled transient elastography fails or in patients at high risk of such failure, such as those with body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2.

### Aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index and fibrosis-4 index score predict hepatic fibrosis evaluated by transient hepatic elastography in hepatitis C virus-infected hemodialysis patients [^116T8MLQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) in chronic kidney disease stage 5D HCV-infected patients compared to transient hepatic elastography (TE) as the gold standard.

Methods

Hemodialysis HCV-infected patients submitted to TE (FibroScan, Echosens, Paris, France) had APRI and FIB-4 calculated. Based on the best area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, APRI and FIB-4 cutoffs were determined and their performances were compared.

Results

Seventy patients were included. Both APRI and FIB-4 showed good performance for identifying significant fibrosis [AUROC = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.83 and 0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.88; P < 0.05] and cirrhosis [AUROC = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.90 and 0.85, 95% CI 0.75–0.93; P < 0.05]. APRI ≤ 0.25 excluded significant fibrosis with negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.8% and APRI > 0.61 confirmed it with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81.8%. Similarly, NPV for FIB-4 ≤ 0.60 regarding significant fibrosis was 90.9%. NPV for cirrhosis for APRI ≤ 0.42 or FIB-4 ≤ 1.40 was 97%. However, APRI > 0.73 or FIB-4 > 2.22 showed a modest PPV of 60 and 70% to confirm cirrhosis, respectively.

Conclusion

APRI and FIB-4 are simple, non-expensive scoring systems with good accuracy to assess fibrosis in HCV-infected hemodialysis patients, mainly excluding both significant fibrosis or cirrhosis and may be an alternative to TE in the evaluation of this population.

### Liver fibrosis staging with combination of APRI and FIB-4 scoring systems in chronic hepatitis C as an alternative to transient elastography [^1114i1KW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding FIB-4 score, Vallet-Pichard et al evaluated its use in 847 patients with CHC in comparison to liver biopsy. FIB-4 with a threshold < 1.45 had an NPV of 94.7% to exclude significant fibrosis, with a Se of 74.3%, while a threshold higher than 3.25 had a PPV to confirm the existence of a significant fibrosis of 82.1%, with a Sp of 98.2%.

It is not unusual for threshold values to differ between published data. Differences in patient populations, including the prevalence of significant fibrosis, cirrhosis, and reference ranges used for AST and ALT levels, may explain these discrepancies. Our data included a large number of patients with advanced fibrosis (63.5%) or cirrhosis (46%), quite a high proportion compared to literature data. The most important difference is that, in our study, biochemical markers were compared to TE-LS rather than liver biopsy, which remains the gold standard for liver fibrosis assessment.

In the era of economic crisis, and taking into account the high prices of antiviral drugs together with the need to simplify treatment in terms of HCV elimination, the question arises whether the use of biochemical scores such as APRI and FIB-4 could avoid TE or liver biopsy. Based on our findings, patients with advanced fibrosis could be defined relatively safely using a combination of APRI and FIB-4. But what about the non-cirrhotic patients? In this context we also tried to find a best lower cutoff that could help in directly prescribing DAAs in CHC patients without the use of TE. Using a lower cutoff FIB-4 score of 0.98 or less and an APRI of 0.3 or less we were able to distinguish F1/F2 patients who do not need TE. Taking together the 2 groups of patients (those with severe fibrosis and those with low fibrosis) we could obviate the need for TE assessment in 58.5% of referred patients, leaving TE to be used only in the "grey zone", which seems to contain less than 50% of patients.

### FIB-4, APRI, and AST / ALT ratio compared to fibroScan for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in bandar abbas, iran [^112RobGS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Researchers have tried to develop indices to assess liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients to avoid liver biopsy. In this study we aimed to compare fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio with FibroScan for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included patients with NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) referred to the Gastroenterology Clinic of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran, in 2019. Demographic features of the participants including age and gender were recorded. All participants underwent FibroScan and had their AST, ALT, and platelet count measured in a random blood sample, taken within 1 month of the FibroScan.

Results

Of the 205 NAFLD patients included in this study with a mean age of 42.95 ± 10.97 years, 144 (70.2%) were male. Fibroscan results revealed that 94 patients (45.9%) had F1, 67 (32.7%) F2, 29 (14.1%) F3, and 15 (7.3%) F4 liver fibrosis. A significant correlation was found between FibroScan score and FIB-4 (r = 0.572), APRI (r = 0.667), and AST/ALT (r = 0.251) (P < 0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of APRI at the 0.702 cut-off for the differentiation of F3 and F4 from F2 and F1 were 84.1, 88.2, 66.1, 95.3, and 87.3%, FIB-4 at the 1.19 cut-off 97.7, 72.7, 49.4, 99.2 and 78%, and AST/ALT at the 0.94 cut-off 61.4, 77, 42.2, 87.9, and 73.7% respectively. Moreover, the area under the receiver operating curve of APRI, FIB-4, and AST/ALT for the differentiation of F3 and F4 from F2 and F1 was 0.923, 0.913, and 0.720, respectively.

Conclusions

Based on these results, APRI appears to be the most appropriate substitute of FibroScan for the detection of significant fibrosis in NAFLD patients. FIB-4 was the second best, suggesting that in case of FibroScan unavailability, APRI and FIB-4 are the best indices to assess liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients.

### AASLD practice guideline on blood-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^116X54jp]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — FIB-4, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and ELF performance for advanced fibrosis: Revised FIB-4 thresholds of ≤ 1.30 and ≥ 2.67 have been proposed for F3–4, and upper thresholds have high rule-in performance — six studies with 1910 patients found FIB-4 ≥ 2.67 and ≥ 3.25 both with summary specificity 0.96, and a systematic review of 32 studies showed pooled specificity 0.94 for both thresholds. Diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) for F3–4 were 7.81 and 10.19 at lower thresholds of 1.3 and 1.45, and 10.76 and 7.01 at upper thresholds of 2.67 and 3.25, respectively. For NFS, a review including 11,372 biopsy-confirmed NAFLD patients assessed performance using original validation cutoffs of ≤ −1.455 and ≥ 0.676 across 22 studies; with study-level prevalence ranging 3% to 80%, sensitivity for excluding F3–4 at less than −1.455 was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61–0.81), specificity for diagnosing F3–4 at greater than 0.676 was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.98), and indeterminate rates were 33.5% (95% CI: 25.6–44.4). An individual patient meta-analysis of 32,428 NAFLD patients reported specificity 0.91 for F3–4 at established NFS cutoffs with indeterminate rates 39%. For enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) tests, a meta-analysis of 11 studies showed high sensitivity (0.93) but limited specificity (0.34) at threshold 7.7, and higher thresholds plus F3–4 prevalence of at least 30% were needed to increase PPV to > 0.8. Overall, both simple and complex blood-based marker algorithms have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for NAFLD advanced fibrosis in higher prevalence tertiary center cohorts, and in community-based or other low prevalence cohorts, blood-based NILDA are useful for excluding advanced fibrosis with high NPV but need additional noninvasive tests to improve PPV.

### Development of a simple noninvasive index to predict significant fibrosis in patients with HIV / HCV coinfection [^111J7cNx]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" for hereditary hemochromatosis, portal hypertension, hepatitis C virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol use disorder, alcohol-related liver disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and liver cirrhosis.

The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis is a clinical calculator used to estimate the degree of liver fibrosis in patients. It is primarily used in patients with chronic liver disease, particularly those with Hepatitis C and B, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The FIB-4 Index is a non-invasive tool that uses age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count to calculate a score. The higher the score, the greater the likelihood of significant liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. This calculator is useful in identifying patients who may require further diagnostic testing, such as liver biopsy, and in monitoring disease progression. It is not recommended for use in patients with acute liver disease or in those with other causes of liver disease where the pathophysiology of fibrosis may be different.

The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis Calculator helps estimate the likelihood of liver fibrosis using a blend of clinical inputs: an individual's age, levels of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase), and platelet count. The calculation involves determining the FIB-4 score with this formula:

(age * AST) / (platelet count * √ALT)

Each input is provided in specific units: age in years, AST and ALT in IU/L, and platelet count in 10⁹/L. The score is precise to two decimal places.

Depending on the age group, the interpretation of the score assists in predicting the presence of advanced fibrosis. Here's how it works:

- **For those aged 35 or younger**:

- A score less than 1.3 suggests "Advanced fibrosis excluded".
- A score of 1.3 or more signals "Further investigation required".

- **For individuals aged 36 to 64**:
- A score less than 1.3 indicates "Advanced fibrosis excluded".
- A score from 1.3 to 2.67 suggests "Further investigation required".
- A score above 2.67 indicates "Advanced fibrosis likely".

- **For those 65 and older**:

- A score under 2.0 denotes "Advanced fibrosis excluded".
- A score between 2.0 and 2.67 means "Further investigation required".
- A score exceeding 2.67 points to "Advanced fibrosis likely".

The result of this calculation supports healthcare practitioners in making informed decisions about the potential need for additional diagnostic actions or patient care strategies.

### Serum identification of at-risk MASH: the metabolomics-advanced steatohepatitis fibrosis score (MASEF) [^1161WshG]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Early identification of those with NAFLD activity score ≥ 4 and significant fibrosis (≥ F2) or at-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a priority as these patients are at increased risk for disease progression and may benefit from therapies. We developed and validated a highly specific metabolomics-driven score to identify at-risk MASH.

Methods:

We included derivation (n = 790) and validation (n = 565) cohorts from international tertiary centers. Patients underwent laboratory assessment and liver biopsy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Based on 12 lipids, body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, the MASEF score was developed to identify at-risk MASH and compared to the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score. We further compared the performance of a FIB-4 + MASEF algorithm to that of FIB-4 + liver stiffness measurements (LSM) by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE).

Results:

The diagnostic performance of the MASEF score showed an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0.76 (95% CI 0.72–0.79), 0.69, 0.74, 0.53, and 0.85 in the derivation cohort, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.75–0.83), 0.78, 0.65, 0.48, and 0.88 in the validation cohort, while FibroScan-AST performance in the validation cohort was 0.74 (95% CI 0.68–0.79; p = 0.064), 0.58, 0.79, 0.67, and 0.73, respectively. FIB-4+MASEF showed similar overall performance compared with FIB-4 + LSM by VCTE (p = 0.69) to identify at-risk MASH.

Conclusion:

MASEF is a promising diagnostic tool for the assessment of at-risk MASH. It could be used alternatively to LSM by VCTE in the algorithm that is currently recommended by several guidance publications.

### The association of fibrosis-4 index scores with severe liver outcomes in primary care [^117B86p5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4)non-invasively assesses fibrosis risk in chronic liver disease (CLD), but underdiagnosis limits FIB-4's application in primary care.

Objective

To evaluate the association of FIB-4 risk with hazard of severe liver outcomes in primary care patients with and without diagnosed CLD.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of primary care data from 2007 to 2018.

Participants

Adult patients with qualifying aminotransferase and platelet count results were included and a single FIB-4 score was calculated for each patient using the first of these values. Patients with a CLD diagnosis or outcome prior to their FIB-4 score were excluded.

Measures

FIB-4 advanced fibrosis risk categorization (low, indeterminate, and high) was the primary predictor variable. Patients were followed from FIB-4 score to a severe liver outcome, a composite of cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We analyzed the association of FIB-4 risk categories with hazard risk of a severe liver outcome using stratified Cox regression models, stratifying patients by known CLD.

Key Results

A total of 20,556 patients were followed for a mean 2,978 days (SD 1,201 days), and 4% of patients experienced a severe liver outcome. Of patients with low-, indeterminate-, and high-risk FIB-4 scores, 2%, 4%, and 20% suffered a severe liver outcome, respectively. In the overall adjusted model, high-risk FIB-4 scores were associated with hazard of severe liver disease (HR 6.64; 95% CI 5.58–7.90). High-risk FIB-4 scores were associated with severe liver outcomes for patients with known NAFLD (HR 7.32; 95% CI 3.44–15.58), other liver disease (HR 11.39; 95% CI 8.53–15.20), and no known CLD (HR 4.05; 95% CI 3.10–5.28).

Conclusions

High-risk FIB-4 scores were strongly associated with risk of severe liver outcomes in patients with and without known CLD. Comprehensive FIB-4 application in primary care may signal silently advancing liver fibrosis.

### Late presentation of chronic viral hepatitis for medical care: a consensus definition [^1153xRsT]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

We present two consensus definitions of advanced and late stage liver disease being used as epidemiological tools. These definitions can be applied to assess the morbidity caused by liver diseases in different health care systems. We focus is on hepatitis B and C virus infections, because effective and well tolerated treatments for both of these infections have greatly improved our ability to successfully treat and prevent advanced and late stage disease, especially if diagnosed early. A consensus definition of late presentation with viral hepatitis is important to create a homogenous, easy-to-use reference for public health authorities in Europe and elsewhere to better assess the clinical situation on a population basis.

Methods

A working group including viral hepatitis experts from the European Association for the Study of the Liver, experts from the HIV in Europe Initiative, and relevant stakeholders including patient advocacy groups, health policy-makers, international health organisations and surveillance experts, met in 2014 and 2015 to develop a draft consensus definition of late presentation with viral hepatitis for medical care. This was refined through subsequent consultations among the group.

Results

Two definitions were agreed upon. Presentation with advanced liver disease caused by chronic viral hepatitis for medical care is defined as a patient with chronic hepatitis B and C and significant fibrosis (≥ F3 assessed by either APRI score > 1.5, FIB-4 > 3.25, Fibrotest > 0.59 or alternatively transient elastography (FibroScan) > 9.5 kPa or liver biopsy ≥ METAVIR stage F3) with no previous antiviral treatment. Late stage liver disease caused by chronic viral hepatitis is clinically defined by the presence of decompensated cirrhosis (at least one symptom of the following: jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, clinically detectable ascites, variceal bleeding) and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Conclusion

These consensus definitions will help to improve epidemiological understanding of viral hepatitis and possibly other liver diseases, as well as testing policies and strategies.

### A new combination of blood test and fibroscan for accurate non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis stages in chronic hepatitis C [^112PxMn7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Precise evaluation of the level of liver fibrosis is recommended in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Blood fibrosis tests and Fibroscan are now widely used for the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Detailed fibrosis stage classifications have been developed to provide an estimation of the liver fibrosis stage from the results of these non-invasive tests. Our aim was to develop a new and more accurate fibrosis stage classification by using new scores combining non-invasive fibrosis tests.

Methods

In all, 729 patients with CHC (exploratory set: 349; validation set: 380) had liver biopsy for Metavir fibrosis (F) staging, and 6 fibrosis tests: Fibroscan, Fibrotest, FibroMeter, Hepascore, FIB-4, APRI.

Results

Exploratory set: Fibroscan and FibroMeter were the independent predictors of different diagnostic targets of liver fibrosis. New fibrosis indexes combining FibroMeter and Fibroscan were thus developed for the diagnosis of clinically significant fibrosis (CSF-index) or severe fibrosis (SF-index). The association of CSF- and SF-indexes provided a new fibrosis stage classification (CSF/SF classification): F0/1, F1/2, F2 ± 1, F2/3, F3 ± 1, F4. Validation set: CSF/SF classification had a high diagnostic accuracy (85.8% well-classified patients), significantly higher than the diagnostic accuracies of FibroMeter (69.7%, P < 0.001), Fibroscan (63.3%, P < 0.001), or Fibrotest (43.9%, P < 0.001) classifications.

Conclusions

The association of new fibrosis indexes combining FibroMeter and Fibroscan provides a new fibrosis stage classification. This classification is significantly more accurate than Fibrotest, FibroMeter, or Fibroscan classifications, and improves the accuracy of the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis stages to 86% without any liver biopsy.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114jB4h6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Figure 1 — screening for advanced fibrosis related to NAFLD/NASH outlines a stepwise algorithm in which primary care, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and obesity specialists should screen for NAFLD with advanced fibrosis, then identify patients at risk based on "2 or more metabolic risk factors" and "Steatosis on any imaging modality or elevated aminotransferases", obtain history and laboratory tests ("Excessive alcohol intake, CBC, liver function tests"), and apply non-invasive testing for fibrosis using FIB-4 with categories "FIB-4 < 1.3", "FIB-4 1.3 to 2.67", and "FIB-4 > 2.67", followed by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) thresholds "LSM < 8 kPa", "LSM 8 to 12 kPa", and "LSM > 12 kPa" to assign actions: "LOW RISK — Repeat NIT in 2–3 years unless clinical circumstances change", "INDETERMINATE RISK — Refer to hepatologist for liver biopsy or MR elastography or monitoring with re-eval in 2–3 years", and "HIGH RISK — Refer to hepatologist".

### Identifying patients at risk of inflammation or fibrosis… [^113H16PU]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The FIB-4 score has similar variables as the aspartate transferase to platelet ratio index, with the addition of age. 6 Finally, the NAFLD fibrosis score includes age, BMI, blood glucose levels, transferase levels, platelet count, and albumin levels. 7 It identifies low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. However, there is no good prospective evidence that identifying and evaluating high-risk groups with liver biopsy leads to improved health outcomes. Pooled data from a meta-analysis of 13 studies with 3, 064 patients compared the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive clinical scoring systems using liver biopsy as a reference standard. 8 Three scoring systems were evaluated: NAFLD fibrosis score; BARD score; and transient elastography, an ultrasound-based technique that uses measured liver stiffness to estimate fibrosis.

9 The NAFLD fibrosis score was the best scoring system to predict fibrosis with regards to ease of use, cost, and independent validation across various populations. The low-risk group has a negative likelihood ratio of 0. 17 for advanced fibrosis, whereas the high-risk group has a positive likelihood ratio of
20. 3 for advanced fibrosis. A systematic review of nine studies with 3, 425 patients found summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 97%, respectively, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 85 for the NAFLD fibrosis score. 10 A 2016 meta-analysis of four studies with 1, 038 patients compared the FIB-4 score, NAFLD fibrosis score, and BARD score. 11 The FIB-4 score with a low cutoff of 1. 3 had better diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis than the other scoring systems, using pooled summary receiver operating curves.

The FIB-4 score and NAFLD fibrosis score are recommended for identifying patients at risk of fibrosis. The NAFLD fibrosis score has the benefit of a good negative predictive value for excluding fibrosis, an important consideration. The NAFLD fibrosis score has also been the most extensively validated tool for identifying those with advanced disease. The American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology recommend its use for determining the need for liver biopsy.

### Tool could help counsel patients with liver disease who drink alcohol… [^112gcKQq]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Patients' scores on a Fibrosis-4 calculator might aid clinicians in advising people with steatotic, or fatty liver, disease who do not stop drinking alcohol, a new report found. The FIB-4 score takes into account age, 2 liver enzyme levels, and platelet counts to estimate the amount of scarring in the liver. Harris E.
