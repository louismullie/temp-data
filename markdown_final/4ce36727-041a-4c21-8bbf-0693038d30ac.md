## Question

pseudofolliculitis barbae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pseudofolliculitis barbae, specifically wanting a detailed explanation that includes defining the condition and its epidemiology, verifying the pathophysiology and key risk factors, reviewing the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis, outlining a tiered treatment algorithm (starting with behavioral measures, then topical therapies, and finally procedural options, with attention to safety in skin of color), and considering special populations, follow-up, and a practical plan with monitoring and patient education, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over basics. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by follicular and perifollicular papules and pustules in the beard and neck, driven by ingrown hairs after shaving, and it disproportionately affects individuals with curly hair, particularly Black men, with prevalence estimates up to 60 percent in that group, though it can occur in women and other ethnicities as well [^116XiiH6] [^117BCdK3] [^notfound].

> I need to check the pathophysiology carefully. The core mechanism is extrafollicular and transfollicular penetration of sharply cut, curly hairs that curve back into the skin, triggering a foreign-body inflammatory response. Genetic susceptibility is supported by a keratin K6hf variant (Ala12Thr) that may predispose to this phenotype, and mechanical factors like stretching the skin or using multi-blade razors worsen penetration, so I should emphasize both biological and grooming contributors in counseling [^1117a1vR] [^115DUfM6] [^115n6buy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis. I should confirm that the diagnosis is clinical, based on the distribution in the beard and neck, the presence of skin-colored to erythematous papules and pustules, and a history of shaving or other traumatic hair removal. Over time, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and even scarring can develop, particularly in darker skin types, so I need to document baseline severity and pigmentary sequelae for tracking [^116XiiH6] [^117BCdK3] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the differential so I don't miss mimics. Bacterial folliculitis, tinea barbae, acne keloidalis nuchae, and various inflammatory or infectious entities can overlap; if fungal disease is suspected, I should consider KOH prep or culture, and remember tinea barbae is a labeled indication for systemic griseofulvin, whereas empiric antifungals are not helpful in PFB itself, which is not a fungal condition, so I need to be precise here [^116XiiH6] [^111Cdt6L] [^112n6gpn].

> Let me think about the treatment hierarchy and start with first-line behavioral modification. I should confirm that shaving cessation is the most definitive intervention, with electric trimming to a longer guard or beard retention as practical alternatives; when shaving is unavoidable, advise shaving in the direction of hair growth, avoiding skin stretching, minimizing passes, using a single-blade or sensitive-skin razor, and replacing blades frequently, along with pre-shave preparation and post-shave cool compresses and emollients, while explicitly warning against plucking or tweezing which worsens ingrown hairs [^116XiiH6] [^117BCdK3] [^113ykkKu].

> I should double-check that these behavioral steps are supported. The randomized trial comparing daily versus intermittent shaving and advanced products did not show superiority of daily shaving and showed some improvement across groups, reinforcing that technique matters and that daily shaving is not necessarily better; observational and educational literature consistently support proper skin prep, single-pass shaving, and blade hygiene as key elements to reduce inflammation and ingrown hairs [^113ykkKu] [^116XiiH6] [^117BCdK3].

> Now, for topical therapies, let me verify which agents have evidence and how to pair them. Keratolytics like glycolic acid and salicylic acid can reduce follicular hyperkeratosis, low-potency topical corticosteroids can calm inflammation, and topical antibiotics such as clindamycin can address secondary bacterial colonization. Tretinoin may help with keratinization, though irritation is common, so I need to tailor potency and vehicle to skin type and tolerance and set expectations for gradual improvement over weeks to months [^1167UeEW] [^114i2PoN] [^1148jJyb].

> Wait, I initially thought tretinoin 0.025% nightly would be a universal first-line topical, but I should correct that to a more cautious, stepwise approach: start with gentle keratolytics and consider tretinoin only if tolerated, given irritation and photosensitivity. Combining a keratolytic with a low-potency corticosteroid can reduce inflammation while exfoliating, and short courses of topical antibiotics are reasonable for pustular flares rather than chronic use, to mitigate resistance and irritancy [^114i2PoN] [^1167UeEW] [^1148jJyb].

> Next, I should review procedural options for refractory disease, especially in skin of color. Long-pulsed 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser hair removal is effective and has a favorable safety profile in Fitzpatrick types IV–VI, with studies showing significant reductions in papules and hairs. Low-fluence protocols may further reduce dyspigmentation risk, and adjunctive topical eflornithine can enhance speed of hair reduction and papule clearance during laser courses, which I should discuss as a medically directed path to durable control [^1152tsUN] [^116wqYb9] [^116UCBVz] [^117PFRVd].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives and ensure safety nuance. Diode lasers have supportive data in darker skin, but the strongest evidence base remains with Nd:YAG; electrolysis is slower and can precipitate ingrown hairs if follicles are incompletely destroyed, so it is less favored for PFB, and surgical depilation carries morbidity; thus, I should prioritize Nd:YAG when available and tailor parameters conservatively to minimize pigmentary change [^1117a1vR] [^111TZzvo] [^1148jJyb].

> I will now examine special populations and context so I don't overlook barriers to care. Workforce "clean-shaven" policies can force shaving and worsen PFB; clinicians can support medical exemptions and provide letters to mitigate this burden, which has both dermatologic and psychosocial implications, particularly for Black men, and this equity issue should be addressed explicitly in counseling and advocacy [^117MMW6G] [^114YDTbK].

> But wait, what if scarring or keloidal change emerges. In patients who develop hypertrophic scars or keloids, I should consider intralesional triamcinolone to reduce fibrosis and pruritus, recognizing the higher keloid propensity in skin of color and planning prevention strategies early to limit disfigurement and recurrence [^114YDTbK] [^115Yh4gu].

> I need to ensure the follow-up plan is concrete. Reassess at 4–6 weeks to track papule and pustule counts, ingrown hairs, dyspigmentation, and patient-reported symptoms. Adjust topical potency, consider adding or initiating laser if response is inadequate after 2–3 months of optimized conservative therapy, and document baseline photos for comparison, aligning expectations that multimodal care yields the best outcomes [^1167UeEW] [^114i2PoN].

> Let me summarize a practical, tiered algorithm so it's actionable. Start with shaving modification and beard retention or trimming, add topical keratolytics and a short course of low-potency corticosteroid for flares, escalate to procedural hair reduction with Nd:YAG laser for refractory cases, and layer adjuncts like eflornithine to accelerate laser benefit. Throughout, address secondary infection when present, avoid irritants, and provide clear return precautions for worsening pain, fluctuance, or atypical lesions requiring reassessment for mimics [^116XiiH6] [^117BCdK3] [^1167UeEW].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and safeguards. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is mechanical and inflammatory, not infectious, so counseling on hair removal technique is foundational. Treatments are effective but not curative if shaving continues, and laser hair reduction offers the closest thing to disease modification in motivated patients. Careful attention to skin of color, potential dyspigmentation, and scarring risk shapes both topical and procedural choices, and early, structured follow-up helps sustain improvement and adjust therapy as needed [^116XiiH6] [^114i2PoN] [^1152tsUN].

Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by ingrown hairs after shaving, most common in people with curly hair, especially Black men [^116XiiH6] [^111RmU7u]. It presents as **painful, pruritic papules and pustules** in the beard area and can lead to hyperpigmentation and scarring if untreated [^1167UeEW] [^114i2PoN]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with key mimics (folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae, tinea barbae) excluded by exam and, when needed, KOH or culture [^111RmU7u] [^111Cdt6L]. Management is **multifaceted**: avoid close shaving, use electric trimmers, and adopt proper shaving technique; topical corticosteroids, retinoids, and antibiotics reduce inflammation and prevent infection; for refractory cases, laser hair removal offers durable improvement [^117BCdK3] [^1117a1vR] [^1152tsUN]. Persistent or atypical lesions warrant biopsy to exclude mimics or malignancy [^113VmFuX].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Hair structure**: Curly hair naturally curls back into the skin, causing ingrown hairs and inflammation [^115DUfM6].

- **Shaving**: Close shaving creates sharp tips that penetrate the skin, triggering a foreign-body reaction [^1117a1vR].

- **Inflammation**: Ingrown hairs cause follicular and perifollicular inflammation, papules, pustules, and potential scarring [^1167UeEW].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Lesions**: Skin-colored or erythematous papules and pustules in the beard area (neck, jawline, chin) [^1167UeEW].

- **Symptoms**: Pain, pruritus, and burning, especially after shaving [^117BCdK3].

- **Complications**: Hyperpigmentation, scarring, and secondary bacterial infection [^114i2PoN].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on characteristic lesions and a history of shaving or other hair removal. Key mimics to exclude include bacterial folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae, and tinea barbae; KOH prep or culture can help when fungal infection is suspected [^111Cdt6L] [^112XcfYJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic clues** |
|-|-|-|
| Bacterial folliculitis | Follicular pustules | Culture, response to antibiotics [^116ThiuK] |
| Acne keloidalis nuchae | Keloidal papules on occipital scalp | Location, histology [^117KCrSy] |
| Tinea barbae | Inflammatory plaques, hair loss | KOH prep, culture [^111Cdt6L] |
| Hidradenitis suppurativa | Recurrent boils, sinus tracts | Location, histology |

---

## Treatment strategies

### Conservative measures

Conservative measures include **shaving technique** — shaving in the direction of hair growth, avoiding close shaves, and using electric trimmers [^117BCdK3]. Hair removal alternatives such as chemical depilatories or laser hair removal can reduce recurrence [^1117a1vR]. Skin care with gentle cleansers, warm compresses, and noncomedogenic moisturizers supports barrier function [^notfound].

---

### Medical therapies

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation and pruritus [^116wUkkH].

- **Topical retinoids**: Tretinoin or adapalene reduce keratinization and ingrown hairs [^1117a1vR].

- **Topical antibiotics**: Clindamycin or erythromycin for secondary infection [^1148jJyb].

- **Oral antibiotics**: Tetracyclines or macrolides for severe inflammation or secondary infection [^1117a1vR].

---

### Laser hair removal

Laser hair removal provides **definitive reduction** of ingrown hairs and inflammation. The long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser is safe and effective in darker skin types (IV–VI) [^1152tsUN] [^116wqYb9], and low-fluence 1,064-nm Nd:YAG achieves significant, well-tolerated improvement with minimal dyspigmentation [^116UCBVz].

---

## Prevention

- **Education**: Teach proper shaving techniques and hair removal alternatives [^116XiiH6].

- **Skin care**: Regular exfoliation and moisturization to prevent ingrown hairs [^notfound].

- **Laser hair removal**: Consider for long-term prevention in recurrent cases [^1167UeEW].

---

## Complications

Complications include **hyperpigmentation**, which is common in darker skin types [^114YDTbK]. Scarring may occur, particularly with chronic inflammation [^114i2PoN]. Secondary bacterial infection can develop, requiring antibiotic therapy [^1148jJyb].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate management; however, recurrence is common if shaving continues. Laser hair removal offers the best long-term control [^1117a1vR].

---

Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a chronic inflammatory condition from ingrown hairs after shaving, most common in people with curly hair. Management is **multifaceted**, including shaving technique, topical therapies, and laser hair removal; prognosis is favorable with care, but recurrence is common if shaving continues [^114i2PoN].

Introduction: Orbital tumor is a rare manifestation of ANCA-associated vasculitis, occurring in approximately 15% of patients with polyangiitis and 1% of patients with eosinophilic polyangiitis.

Objectives: To present 3 clinical cases of pediatric patients diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis with orbital tumor as initial presentation on the Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez.

Methods: Description of a clinical cases and review of the literature.

Results:

Case 1: an 8-year-old female who was treated for a 2-month-old right orbital tumor. She underwent a biopsy, reporting histopathologically nonspecific chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Within the approach, a renal biopsy was performed with diffuse endocapillary and extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with cellular crescents, high resolution computed tomography of the lung with ground glass areas and pseudonodules, and positive p-ANCA and MPO antibodies.

Case 2: a 7-year-old female with a history of recurrent epistaxis. She was attended to for a 6-month-old right orbital tumor. The results of the lacrimal gland biopsy were consistent with small-vessel vasculitis with inflammatory infiltrate. High resolution computed tomography was reported with a pulmonary infiltrate, and positive p-ANCA and MPO antibodies.

Case 3: a 7-year-old female with a history of recurrent epistaxis. She was attended to for an orbital tumor, left ptosis, pain, and bilateral conjunctival injections for a month of evolution. The orbital computed tomography was reported with the presence of occupied lesions in both orbits. She underwent a biopsy, reporting histopathologically chronic inflammation and granulomatous reaction. In pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography was seen ground glass areas. IgG4 was negative, but p-ANCA and MPO were positive.

Conclusion: Orbital tumor is a rare ophthalmologic manifestation of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Its diagnosis and treatment continue to be a challenge. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion in patients who present these clinical characteristics at the onset of the disease to carry out a systematized and exhaustive approach that allows us to make an early diagnosis and timely treatment.

It is crucial that hair restoration surgeons understand the basic clinical diagnosis and pathologic condition of other hair loss conditions that are not always amenable to successful hair transplantation. In this article nonscarring and scarring mimickers of androgenetic alopecia are discussed. Nonscarring conditions include alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and tinea capitis. Some of the more common scarring alopecias include lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. Less common inflammatory conditions include pseudopelade of Brocq, discoid lupus erythematosus, and folliculitis decalvans.

### Hypertrophic pseudofolliculitis in white renal transplant recipients [^114w2grK]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are susceptible to many cutaneous disorders, including drug-induced skin changes. Hypertrichosis, sebaceous hyperplasia and gingival hyperplasia are well-recognized effects of ciclosporin, one of the immunosuppressants commonly used in RTRs. Pseudofolliculitis barbae usually affects hair-bearing areas of skin in men with darkly pigmented skin who shave on a regular basis. We describe five cases of hyperplastic pseudofolliculitis occurring in white RTRs taking ciclosporin as part of their immunosuppressive regimen. All five had involvement of the chin, the classic site of pseudofolliculitis barbae, and two had additional psuedofolliculitis of the nose or occiput.

### Griseofulvin [^111Cdt6L]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Griseofulvin is indicated for the treatment of dermatophyte infections of the skin not adequately treated by topical therapy, hair and nails, namely:

Tinea corporis

Tinea pedis

Tinea cruris

Tinea barbae

Tinea capitis

Tinea unguium when caused by one or more of the following species of fungi:

Epidermophyton floccosum Microsporum audouinii Microsporum canis Microsporum gypseum Trichophyton crateriform Trichophyton gallinae Trichophyton interdigitalis Trichophyton megnini Trichophyton mentagrophytes Trichophyton rubrum Trichophyton schoenleini Trichophyton sulphureum Trichophyton tonsurans Trichophyton verrucosum

Note: Prior to therapy, a dermatophyte should be identified as responsible for the infection.

Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate specimens for laboratory testing (KOH preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy) should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.

Griseofulvin is not effective in the following:

Bacterial infections

Coccidioidomycosis

Candidiasis (Moniliasis)

North American Blastomycosis

Histoplasmosis

Cryptococcosis (Torulosis)

Actinomycosis

Tinea versicolor

Sporotrichosis

Nocardiosis

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis with a pulsed infrared laser… [^1117a1vR]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Diode laser treatment is a safe and effective method for improving pseudofolliculitis barbae in patients with skin phototypes I to IV. Extrafollicular penetration of the hair shaft is one cause of pseudofolliculitis barbae. Transfollicular penetration of the hair shaft may occur as well. When the skin is held taut during shaving or when a double-edged razor is used, the sharply cut hair may retract under the skin and grow directly into the follicular wall. Treatment modalities used for pseudofolliculitis barbae have been largely disappointing, and include topical tretinoin cream, corticosteroids, topical and oral antibiotics, surgical depilation, electrolysis, and tedious shaving regimens. 2, 7, 8 Pseudofolliculitis barbae will improve if the hairs are allowed to grow. When shaving is stopped, the ingrown hairs are released automatically by spring action within a 3- to 4-week period.

The only definitive cure for pseudofolliculitis barbae is permanent removal of the hair follicles. Surgical depilation carries a high morbidity. Electrolysis is a laborious procedure, and incomplete follicular destruction has resulted in keratin granulomas and pseudofolliculitis barbae. The successful treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae in 10 women is reported herein. Ten consecutive patients seeking laser hair removal for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae were enrolled in this study. The age of the patients ranged from 18 to 45 years. All patients had skin phototypes II to IV, with coarse curly hair ranging in color from brown to black. Each patient had a history of pseudofolliculitis barbae in the treatment area for a minimum duration of 1 year; patients 1 and 4 also had long-standing hyperpigmentation. Previous treatments included topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and intralesional corticosteroid injections.

Pseudofolliculitis is a common problem typically affecting men in the beard area and women in the axillary and inguinal regions. Traditional treatment options are limited and yield unsatisfactory results. This report demonstrates that treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae with a pulsed diode laser results in dramatic clinical improvement in as few as 3 treatment sessions, with the induction of significant hair-growth delays. This is a practical therapeutic approach, enabling treatment of large body-surface areas quickly with minimal morbidity to the patient.

Periclitoral masses are uncommon disorders in gynecology often leading to pain and distress. With the popularity of female genital hair grooming and depilation, the vulva has been exposed to new insults including contact dermatitis and folliculitis. The unique anatomy of the protective covering of the clitoral hood may subject hair fragments to trapping, inflammation, irritation, and in some cases abscess formation.

### Topical eflornithine hydrochloride improves the effectiveness of standard laser hair removal for treating pseudofolliculitis barbae: a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^117PFRVd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) significantly impacts the military population, especially deployed personnel.

Objective

This study was designed to determine whether the addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment would improve efficacy in treating PFB.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, paired (right and left neck) comparison study examining a combination of eflornithine and hair laser versus placebo and hair laser for the treatment of PFB. In all, 27 male patients with clinical PFB were treated with a long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser with an energy fluence of 25 to 30 J/cm², a pulse duration of 20 to 30 milliseconds, and a 10-mm spot size to the entire bearded neck region. The laser treatment was performed every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. Between laser treatments, patients applied eflornithine and placebo creams twice daily to opposite sides of the bearded neck region. The number of hairs and inflammatory papules were counted bilaterally at each visit.

Results

The eflornithine side had a statistically significant decrease in the number of hairs and inflammatory papules compared with the placebo side. At 16 weeks, the eflornithine side had a median hair reduction of 99.5% from baseline (range 48.5%-100.0%), whereas the placebo side had an 85.0% median hair reduction from baseline (range 50.5%-94.5%), P less than .001.

Limitations

Patients were not followed up beyond 16 weeks.

Conclusion

The addition of topical eflornithine to hair laser treatment decreased hairs and inflammatory papules faster when compared with hair laser therapy alone in the treatment of PFB.

### Whole exome sequencing in alopecia areata identifies rare variants in KRT82 [^1177FXEh]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

KRT82 variants associated with AA pathology

Within the large family of keratins, the hair follicle is composed of subfamilies of keratins (type I and type II) exclusively expressed in the hair follicle; the "soft" epithelial keratins (KRT25–28, KRT71–75) and the "hard" keratins (KRT31–40, KRT81–86) responsible for the keratinization of hair and nails. Interestingly, mutations in type II hard and soft hair keratins (KRT75, KRT81,83,85,86), but not type I hair keratins (KRT25–28, KRT31–40), have reported associations with other genetic hair disorders such as Monilethrix, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and hair ectodermal dysplasia. Specifically, mutations in the 1A and 2B domains of KRT81, KRT83, and KRT86 resulted in Monilethrix, a rare monogenic hair loss disorder (Fig. 2a). The causal role of type II hair keratins in genetic hair diseases validated their important role in hair structure and further strengthened the functional association between AA and KRT82, a type II hair keratin.

Due to the known roles of other type II hair keratin genes in other monogenic hair loss disorders, we next confirmed that our patients were accurately diagnosed with AA, and not a monogenic hair loss disorder misdiagnosed as AA in our cohort. We confirmed accurate AA diagnoses through clinical validation, biopsy immunohistochemistry (IHC), and inflammatory ALADIN gene expression signatures (Fig. 3a–c). In four AA patients with a KRT82 missense variant, IHC of scalp samples revealed interfollicular infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes, a diagnostic feature of AA (Fig. 3b). The ALADIN (Alopecia Areata Disease Severity Index) index utilizes expression profiles of keratin and inflammatory gene signatures to distinguish AA scalp from control. Gene expression data from three patients with a KRT82 variant confirmed an increased inflammatory ALADIN signature, with the patients clustering in the AA cohort and away from controls (Fig. 3c). Using these three methods, we confirmed that diagnosis of AA was accurate, and did not represent a form of a monogenic hair loss disorder.

### Ethnic skin: kids are not just little people [^112JhrbW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are numerous skin conditions that occur commonly in children with ethnic skin, including vitiligo, progressive macular hypomelanosis, pityriasis alba, acne keloidalis nuchae, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and keloids. Though these conditions occur in both children and adults, children may have different patterns of clinical presentation and response to therapy. In caring for such patients, important treatment considerations include side effects of systemic medications and tolerability of invasive procedures. Quality of life is an important measure and should not be compromised by either the skin disease or its treatment.

### Linear white lesion in the oral mucosa [^111mCmbd]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this condition?
A. Topical steroids
B. Smoking cessation
C. No medical treatment necessary
D. Topical retinoids
E. Laser ablation

Answers:
A. Topical steroids – Incorrect. Topical steroids are useful in the treatment of oral lichen planus but they are ineffective in linea alba.
B. Smoking cessation – Incorrect. Linea alba is not caused by smoking. Nicotinic stomatitis is likely to resolve after smoking discontinuation.
C. No treatment is necessary – Correct. Explanation and reassurance are recommended for these patients; every frictional irritant should be removed and sucking, biting, or chewing habits should be discontinued.
D. Topical retinoids – Incorrect. Topical retinoids (both tretinoin and isotretinoin) have been tried with variable success in some oral conditions such as oral lichen planus and oral leukoplakia, but this treatment has never been tried in linea alba.
E. Laser ablation – Incorrect. No surgical intervention including laser ablation is indicated for linea alba, which is a benign condition with no malignant potential.

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types IV, V, and VI with a long-pulsed neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet laser [^1152tsUN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae affects a large number of individuals with coarse curly hair, and present treatment options are suboptimal.

Objective

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a long-pulsed neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae.

Methods

This was a two-phase observational study conducted at a military tertiary medical facility. The study group included 37 patients (skin types IV, V, and VI) referred from primary care physicians with a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae refractory to conservative therapy. In phase I, one treatment with a Nd:YAG laser was performed on a tattooed area of the thigh with 3 light doses. Epidermal tolerance was evaluated, and hair counts were performed 3 months after treatment for each light dose. In phase II, the highest dose tolerated by the epidermis from phase I was applied to a small submental region of skin with an adjacent site as a control. Subsequently, papule counts were performed 90 days after treatment in the laser-irradiated and control areas.

Results

Phase I: When normalized for controls, there was 33%, 43%, and 40% hair reduction on the thigh for the 50, 80, and 100 J/cm² fluences, respectively, after 90 days. Overall, the highest doses tolerated by the epidermis were 50, 100, and 100 J/cm² for type VI, V, and IV skin, respectively. Phase II: Mean papule counts after 90 days were 6.95 and 1.0 for the control and treatment sites, respectively.

Conclusion

Nd:YAG laser treatment may represent a safe and effective option for reducing hair and subsequent papule formation in patients with pseudofolliculitis barbae.

### Pseudofolliculitis cutis: a vexing disorder of hair growth [^115n6buy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis cutis (PFC) is a troublesome and potentially disfiguring cutaneous disorder characterized by a chronic inflammatory response to ingrown hair. Despite a simple precipitating stimulus, ingrown hair, PFC has a relatively complex aetiology that can involve grooming practices, hair type, genetic predisposition and medication history. Curly hair and a single-nucleotide substitution in the gene encoding keratin 75 may act synergistically to increase the risk for developing this condition. PFC is most common in men of sub-Saharan African lineage, but can occur in men and women of many different ethnicities, particularly in body areas where hair is coarse, abundant and subject to traumatic removal. Treatment options for PFC can be divided into three main categories: modifying hair removal practices, managing symptoms with medication, and long-term hair removal with laser therapy. Laser hair removal is safe and effective in most skin types and has become increasingly popular among dermatologists in the treatment of PFC. However, it is imperative that the laser system and parameters are specifically matched to the patient's skin type.

Question 3: What is the first-line treatment for acute lesions of LCLE?
A. Topical corticosteroids or intralesional corticosteroids
B. Tacrolimus
C. Hydroxychloroquine
D. Oral retinoids
E. Dapsone

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroids – Correct. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids have been the mainstay for LCLE lesions as initial treatment in most cases results in moderate-to-significant improvement of the lesions.
B. Tacrolimus – Incorrect. Although topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus are also commonly reported treatments for LCLE, it is more commonly used as a long-term maintenance therapy to avoid the unwanted side effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy.
C. Hydroxychloroquine – Incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine may be effective for long-term therapy in patients for whom topical treatments have failed to reduce symptoms and lesions.
D. Oral retinoids – Incorrect. Oral retinoids are considered second-line therapies. The systemic retinoids have teratogenic effects and long-term risk of hypertriglyceridemia and bone abnormalities.
E. Dapsone – Incorrect. Systemic dapsone is used in cases of refractory lesions; however, it is a less popular alternative because of its side effects.

### Low-fluence 1, 064-nm laser hair reduction for pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types IV, V, and VI [^116UCBVz]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of a 1,064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser using lower than traditional fluences (22–40 J/cm²) for treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB).

Methods

Twenty-two patients with PFB refractory to conservative therapy received five weekly treatments over the anterior neck using a 1,064-nm Nd:YAG laser at 12 J/cm². Pulse duration was 20 ms with 10 mm spot size. Topical anesthesia was not used. Treatments were completed 15 minutes after patient arrival. Patients presented for 2- and 4-week follow-up. Ten evaluators used a Global Assessment Scale (GAS) to assess dyspigmentation, papule counts, and cobblestoning by comparing baseline to 4-week follow-up visit photographs. Hair and papule counts were performed on five patients and compared with the GAS. Investigators recorded adverse effects using a visual analog and side effects scale.

Results

Eleven patients demonstrated 83% improvement on the GAS (p < .01). There was a mean reduction of 59.5% in dyspigmentation (p < .03), 91.2% in papule count (p < .01), and 75.6% in cobblestoning (p < .02). Patients reported 1 out of 10 on both adverse effects scales.

Conclusion

Low-fluence 1,064-nm laser treatment achieved significant temporary reduction in PFB. Subjects noted minimal pain without topical anesthesia.

### Pustular tinea manuum frominfection [^115FMUfY]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

T erinacei is the most common dermatophyte isolated in hedgehogs, with infection rates of 20% to 47%. Other than hedgehog exposure, other reported exposures include an elephantand direct human-to-human contact by kissing. Immunosuppression use in our patient likely predisposed her to infection after contact with the hedgehog.

Infection typically occurs at the sites of contact — most commonly the hands as in tinea manuum, and less frequently as tinea facei, and tinea kerion barbae. They may present as an erosive inflammatory vesiculopustular eruption, or scaling eczematous plaques mimicking eczema. Infection in hedgehogs may be asymptomatic or may present with scaling and loss of quills.

Diagnosis is confirmed by culturing the fungus on agar plates and DNA sequencing. Topical antifungals are rarely adequate, and systemic treatment options include terbinafine and itraconzole. The animal ideally should be treated as well.

Such zoonotic infections are rare and, as in our patient, the inoculating event may be only determined after isolation of the fungus. An index of suspicion is important, especially with the increasing number of exotic domestic pets.

### Ethnic equity implications in the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^117MMW6G]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

One major issue facing the health care system in the United States is the disparity in health care management of diseases that affect minority patient populations. Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is very common in Black men. It presents as skin-colored to erythematous, follicular or perifollicular papules and pustules predominantly on the neck and chin. The most definitive treatment for PFB is cessation of close shaving. However, many Black men are forced to comply with "clean-shaven" policies in the workforce. For those who are able to obtain medical waivers, there is significant time and costs associated with this, especially if they must wait to receive this waiver from a dermatologist. If primary care providers are able to identify the disease and spread awareness of its legitimacy, it may be easier for patients to receive the necessary waivers and may encourage employers to reflect on the ethnic equity of this practice. Our professional support can help reduce stigma and lead to improvements in the physical and psychological health of this historically mistreated population.

### Differential diagnoses of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis: considerations as regards one case [^112n4XTq]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Pseudolymphomatous folliculitis is a rare type of lymphoid hyperplasia with a benign curse, characterised by unique or multiple violet erythematous lesions in the shape of a dome that can be relapsing, ubicated on face, scalp and trunk. It resembles other types of hyperplasias, benign as well as malignant, that is clinically hard to distinguish, and it is required a histopathological and immunohistochemical differential diagnosis to be able to distinguish its treatment effectively. In this report, we present a case of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis localised on the right infraorbital region, with its clinical histological and immunohistochemical characteristics, including a table of differential diagnoses, their treatment and monitoring for 5 years.

### An unusual ala12Thr polymorphism in the 1A α-helical segment of the companion layer-specific keratin K6hf: evidence for a risk factor in the etiology of the common hair disorder pseudofolliculitis barbae [^115DUfM6]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a common hair disorder characterized by a pustular foreign body inflammatory reaction that is induced by ingrown hairs of the facial and submental (barbea) regions after regular shaving. It occurs predominantly in black males, while it is rather rare and usually far less severe in Caucasian males. Black individuals have a higher propensity of developing PFB due to their genetic predisposition for curly hair which inherently possesses a much higher risk of growing back into the skin than straight or wavy hair. The PFB process is, however, not gender dependent nor restricted to the face, but can occur in any skin region once regular shaving, plucking, or other traumatic means of hair removal are instituted. Through a family study and a large-scale investigation of randomly sampled PFB-affected and -unaffected individuals, this study demonstrates that an unusual single-nucleotide polymorphism, which gives rise to a disruptive Ala12Thr substitution in the 1A alpha-helical segment of the companion layer-specific keratin K6hf of the hair follicle, is partially responsible for the phenotypic expression and represents an additional genetic risk factor for PFB.

### Biopsychosocial impact of keloids on quality of life [^116CFxnJ]. JAAD Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Visibility

Keloids have been reported to affect most parts of the body, including areas not easily concealed by clothing. Surprisingly, keloids located in visible areas were not consistently associated with a globally reduced QoL. With that said, visible lesions were associated with higher subjective scores of relationship sensitivity (feeling uncomfortable with the opposite gender, feelings of inferiority, and concerns of being criticized), depression, and anxiety than nonvisible keloids, in part due to the perceived greater need for concealment strategies and coping mechanisms.

Age and gender

Although keloids may affect patients of all ages, lesions are more frequently present in younger patients aged between 10 and 30 years, which was reflected in the demographics of patients enrolled in keloid QoL studies. In one study, younger patients reported more significant reductions in QoL than older patients, with the highest negative impact on QoL noted between ages 16 and 35 years. Contributing to the decreased QoL, one study found an association with the recurrence of keloids and younger age. Presently, there is no study investigating the longitudinal impact on QoL in these patients.

With respect to gender, several studies found no significant difference in keloid QoL impairment between men and women. Another study found that women undergoing surgical treatment for keloids experienced more preoperative pruritus than men. However, enrolled women largely outnumbered men in many of the study populations, which may have skewed these findings. The transgender patient population faces unique QoL considerations, as keloids forming near operative sites of gender-affirming surgery can contribute to gender dysphoria. Similarly, facial keloids in individuals with pseudofolliculitis barbae have a negative impact on transgender identity. Additional studies are needed to fully assess the impact on QoL in this population.

### Follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color: presentation and management [^115Yh4gu]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Skin of color, also known as ethnic skin, is described as skin of individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, Native-American, Middle Eastern, and Pacific Island backgrounds. Differences in hair morphology, hair grooming, cultural practices, and susceptibility to keloid scarring exist within these populations and have been implicated in hair, scalp, and skin disorders. Acne keloidalis (AK), central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (DCS), pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), traction alopecia (TA), and keloids are the most prevalent follicular and scarring disorders in skin of color. They have been associated with disfigurement, permanent hair loss, emotional distress, and decreased quality of life. Hair grooming practices, such as the use of chemical relaxers, heat straightening, and tight braiding and weaving can cause scalp irritation and follicular damage and are linked to the pathogenesis of some of these conditions. Consequently, patient education and behavior modifications are integral to the prevention and management of these disorders. Scarring disorders are also of concern in ethnic populations. Keloid scarring is more prevalent in individuals of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. The scarring alopecia CCCA is almost exclusively seen in patients of African descent. Therapeutic regimens such as intralesional corticosteroids, surgical excision, and laser therapy can be effective for these follicular and scarring disorders, but carry a risk of dyspigmentation and keloid scarring. Ethnic skin and hair may present unique challenges to the clinician, and knowledge of these differences is essential to providing quality care.

### Differential diagnoses of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis: considerations as regards one case [^116Guo6X]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The lesions are localised in the facial region, especially on the cheek, nose, forehead and eyelid. In some cases, the lesions can happen on the scalp and upper trunk. In most of the cases, it is asymptomatic; nevertheless, mild symptomatology can appear, such as pain or itchiness. Its clinical presentation is characterised by a solitary nodule, erythematous or violet, in the shape of a dome, quick-growing, that can reach 3 cm of diameter. In most cases, the rash is isolated, but it can show an eruptive pattern with multiple lesions. During the dermatoscopy, prominent yellowish follicular and perifollicular patches have been observed, red follicular spots and arborizing 'treelike' vessels, although these are not findings specific of this illness. Histologically, a nodular dense or diffuse lymphocyte infiltrate has been observed, with many histiocytes and dendritic cells, localised from the dermis to the hypodermis, which surround and infiltrate the pilosebaceous unit deforming its walls. A characteristic is the formation of granulomas by histiocytes. In some cases, there can be the presence of plasma cells and eosinophils. The infiltrate is usually separated from the epidermis by a grenz zone. It has been used the term of 'follicular invasion' when the lymphocyte infiltrates bursts and destroys the epithelium of the follicles. Two types of follicular invasion can be recognised: in one of them, the follicles are destroyed. Finally they disappear, and, in the other one, the pilous follicles do not show any damage, but they are irritated and show hyperplastic changes with irregular forms on the follicle wall. Our case had both presentations: the pilous follicles, hyperplastic and irritated, with irregular forms and invasion with the destruction of its structure. Typically in the pseudolymphomatous folliculitis, changes on the pilous follicle are identified, they consist of irregular hyperplasia of the epithelium with deformation of the wall and, sometimes, with erased epithelium and delineated by a variable lymphocyte infiltrate. These changes in the follicle are known as 'follicle activation'. The immunohistochemistry reported a mixed population of B CD20 positive lymphocytes and T CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes, with a predominance of T cells 3:1, the protein CDa1 positive and S100 positive in perifollicular dendritic cells, typical features of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis. The expression of the PD-1 marker in T lymphocytes has been reported. The proliferation index (Ki67) was positive from 15% to 20%, the Ki67 can be variable as it is reported on the study by Granados-Lopez et al in which they got a rank of Ki67 from 6% to 40% in their study with 19 patients. There is not a restriction of chains κ/λ. Although the pseudolymphomatous folliculitis behaves like benign hyperplasia, it is necessary the differentiation of the malignant cutaneous lymphoma and related pathologies through histological and immunohistochemical studies. The differential diagnosis, according to the case reports, includes cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, small and medium-sized pleomorphic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, cutaneous low-grade follicular lymphoma, follicular mycosis fungoides, granulomatous rosacea and other cutaneous pseudolymphomas (table 2). The first-line treatment is the excisional biopsy. The use of antimalarials, methotrexate, triamcinolone acetonide, tacrolimus 0.1% and cyclosporine have been reported with a variable success rate, these treatments can be an option in residual or multiple lesions. The use of intralesional corticosteroid is recommended when the excision cannot be completed, having good outcomes. In some cases, a spontaneous remission has been reported after the incisional biopsy. Although there are no reports of the pseudolymphomatous folliculitis that progresses to a malignant lesion, some authors recommend close monitoring for a period of 6–12 months because of the probability of spontaneous recurrence. In our study, we followed up for the 5 next years without showing any recurrence of the disease.

### The medical and surgical therapy of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^1148jJyb]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder seen mainly in individuals with curly hair. This condition is seen most frequently in black men who shave their beards but may also be seen in women of all races who wax or shave the axillary and pubic skin. The etiology of PFB is multifactorial, and heretofore a cure has been considered impossible for those desiring a clean-shaven face. The following article serves to discuss the current medical and surgical therapies available for this condition. Medical treatments for this condition include various combinations of topical antibiotics, corticosteroids, and retinoids. In the surgical arena, laser therapy has revolutionized the treatment of PFB and has enabled cure for the first time for those plagued by this disorder and for whom a beardless face is acceptable.

Question 3: What is the treatment of choice in patients with extensive skin involvement from this disease?
A. Topical pimecrolimus
B. Oral retinoids
C. Narrow-band ultraviolet B therapy
D. Topical tretinoin
E. Ketoconazole cream

Answers:
A. Topical pimecrolimus – Incorrect. Topical pimecrolimus has shown no benefit in the treatment of EKV but can be used to treat ichthyosis linearis circumflexa.
B. Oral retinoid – Correct. Treatment of EKV is symptomatic and depends on the severity and extent of hyperkeratosis. Topical management with keratolytic agents such as lactic acid, urea, α hydroxy acids and tretinoin might be sufficient for mild disease. Systemic retinoids such as acitretin and isotretinoin are the treatment of choice for extensive EKV.
C. Narrow-band ultraviolet B therapy – Incorrect. Narrow-band ultraviolet B therapy has shown no benefit in the treatment of EKV but can be used to treat ichthyosis linearis circumflexa.
D. Topical tretinoin – Incorrect. Topical tretinoin helps in mild cases of EKV but not in severe or more extensive EKV.
E. Ketoconazole cream – Incorrect. Ketoconazole cream has shown no benefit in the treatment of EKV but can be used to treat cutaneous dermatophyte infections.

### Shave frequency and regimen variation effects on the management of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^113ykkKu]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is an inflammatory condition of the face with a clinical presentation of papules in the beard area with occasional pustules or hypertrophic scarring, all of which develop in response to shaving. Prevalent in African American men, a limited amount of data have been published on the shave outcomes as they relate to clinically measurable responses and patient satisfaction scoring. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a daily shaving regimen and advanced shaving products on exacerbation of lesions and symptoms in patients with PFB.

Methods

Ninety African American men were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups shaving 2 to 3 times per week with standard products (control group), shaving daily with standard products (daily standard group) or shaving daily with advanced products (daily advanced). The number of pustules, papules, ingrown hairs, and investigator's assessment of severity and subjective symptoms of itching and burning/stinging were assessed at baseline, week 6, and week 12. The response to treatment was also assessed by the investigator and the subject at weeks 6 and 12. Secondary measures including questionnaires regarding baseline shave practices were also correlated with outcomes variables.

Results

There were no significant differences noted between the 3 groups for papule (P = 0.32) or pustule (P = 0.46) count for the 12-week study. However, there was a significant mean papule reduction from baseline detected for both the control and daily advanced groups. In addition, compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in ingrown hairs for the control group, and a directional reduction in ingrown hairs for the daily advanced group. There were significant group differences between the control group and both daily shaving groups, with the control group seeing significantly fewer ingrown hairs (P = 0.005 for control vs daily standard group and P = 0.04 for control vs daily advanced group). There were no significant group differences among the 3 groups for investigator-graded severity (P = 0.43) and response to treatment (P = 0.51). There was a significant perceived improvement in the response to treatment (P = 0.007) and itching (P = 0.002) for the daily advanced group vs the control group.

### Acne keloidalis nuchae: a role for low-dose radiotherapy [^112peJa8]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 39-year-old Pacific-Asian-American man developed AKN beginning in the nape of his head at the age of 10 with subsequent spread to his entire scalp. This spread coincided with the development of excessive scalp folds — cutis verticis gyrata (CVG). His symptoms included significant pain, swelling, and discharge of pus and blood. Examination revealed inflamed plaques with tufted hair involving most of the scalp, sparing all CVG fold recesses (Fig 1, A) except the inferior occipital CVG fold, which exhibited multiple fibrotic-looking AKN papules (Fig 1, C). He had bitemporal AKN masses with a discharging sinus on the left temporal mass (Fig 1, B). Additionally, he had severe cystic acne, rhinophyma, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. We performed additional tests (X-rays and insulin growth factor level and thyroid function tests) to rule out pachydermoperiostosis, acromegaly, and thyroid disease. A bacterial culture of purulent discharge revealed Staphylococcus aureus, for which the patient was treated with ciprofloxacin.

### Common dermatologic conditions in skin of color [^114YDTbK]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Individuals with skin of color represent a diverse population of racial and ethnic backgrounds, including but not limited to Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian American or Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino, and Middle Eastern or North African. Dermatologic health disparities exist in part because of systemic racism and are exacerbated by inadequate physician training and a lack of high-quality research on skin diagnoses that disproportionately affect people with skin of color. These conditions, which include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, keloids, dermatosis papulosa nigra, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and acne keloidalis nuchae, are usually diagnosed clinically and not associated with an underlying systemic disease. They can have significant impacts on mental health and quality of life and are often underdiagnosed or undertreated in skin of color. Hydroquinone 4% is considered the standard treatment for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Standard treatment for keloids includes combination intralesional therapy with triamcinolone and fluorouracil. If treatment is preferred for dermatosis papulosa nigra, options include scissor excision, cryotherapy, curettage, electrodesiccation, and laser therapies. Shaving cessation is the best initial treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae using the long-pulse Nd: YAG laser on skin types V and VI [^116wqYb9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a foreign body inflammatory condition that is caused by in-grown hairs of the face and body. An effective treatment to alleviate this condition without the risk of side effects has yet to be found.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the Lyra 1064-nm long-pulse ND:YAG laser in the treatment of PFB on skin types V and VI.

Methods

Twenty subjects (12 males and 8 females) were given two treatments approximately 3 to 4 weeks apart and were assessed by objective papule/pustule and hair counts at 1, 2, and 3 months after final treatment. Laser treatments with the Lyra Nd:YAG laser were applied onto 2x2-cm regions on the upper and lower mandible and neck regions. Contralateral controls were used to assess overall effectiveness. Subjective evaluations were also obtained from both subjects and investigators. Assessments of any abnormal side effects caused by laser treatment, including dyspigmentation and/or scarring, were also evaluated.

Results

A reduction in the quantity of papules/pustules and hairs when compared with baseline data was statistically significant for treatment of PFB in the mandibular and neck regions at the 1-, 2-, and 3-month follow-up evaluations. Subject evaluations ranged from satisfied to very satisfied. Side effects included transient hyperpigmentation, transient hypopigmentation, mild erythema, and itching.

Conclusions

The use of the 1064-nm long-pulse Nd:YAG laser for the treatment and management of PFB on skin types V and VI is both safe and effective, with positive results lasting for up for to 3 months after two treatments.

### Novel cutaneous eruptions in the setting of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor therapy [^115PQNVw]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have proven instrumental as adjunctive therapies in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic malignancies. While these drugs are generally well tolerated, a wide range of cutaneous eruptions have been reported. A retrospective analysis of drug eruptions secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitors found that 33 of 103 (32%) were specifically due to nivolumab and 35 of 103 (34%) were due to pembrolizumab.

Novel PD-1 inhibitor associated cutaneous eruptions from our investigation include scleredema and pseudolymphomatous tattoo reaction. Scleredema is a sclerotic, cutaneous mucinosis that most often occurs in the setting of diabetes mellitus, infection, or monoclonal gammopathy. The patient in case 1 lacked these risk factors, supporting the notion that pembrolizumab was the culprit medication. Fixed drug eruption is a cutaneous eruption that characteristically recurs in the same location with reexposure to the culprit drug. The patient in case 2 lacked exposure to other common culprit drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, antimalarial, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and barbiturates. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma refers to lymphocyte-rich infiltrates which simulate cutaneous lymphomas. Causes can include infections and foreign agents such as tattoo dye. While the patient in case 3 had this tattoo for many years, her eruption appeared 2 months after nivolumab initiation and resolved upon drug discontinuation, supporting that this was likely a pseudolymphomatous tattoo reaction to nivolumab. Post-herpetic granulomatous dermatitis has been reported both weeks and months after initiation of nivolumab which is in accordance with the time course noted in case 4. The extragenital lichen sclerosus in case 5 has also been reported in a patient with uveal melanoma on nivolumab who was also noted to have previously experienced melanoma-associated leukoderma related to nivolumab.

### The role of ingrown hairs in persistent kerion of children: a clinical study [^115K4M4W]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tinea capitis, an infection of the hair, follicles, and surrounding skin caused by dermatophytes, occurs with notable frequency in children, including those who are not immunocompromised, with a particular prevalence among preschool‐aged children. Although the spectrum of pathogens varies significantly with geography and over time, tinea capitis continues to be a global public health issue, particularly in developing countries where sanitation and nutrition may be inadequate. Kerion, a severe inflammatory form of tinea capitis, can result in scarring alopecia and extensive tissue damage, in addition to common symptoms such as erythema, scaling, and abscess formation.

Persistent kerion exhibits more extensive involvement and increased severity in the infrequently reported cases of tinea capitis that are refractory to treatment, and managing cases resistant to systemic antifungal agents poses a significant challenge. In this process, ingrown hairs may play an important role. Ingrown hairs, also named pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), can act as foreign bodies to cause local inflammations. The erythema papulopustular lesions mainly involves the beard, neck, submental, and groin areas. In fact, ingrown hairs can occur in any area where traumatic hair removal has been performed, but reports of scalp involvement are rare, especially in infections. Clinical practice in our patients suggested that ingrown hairs might be a contributing factor to the prolonged duration and suboptimal outcomes in persistent cases of tinea capitis, particularly in kerion. Further research into the cause and progression of this condition could enhance prevention and treatment strategies for tinea capitis that is unresponsive to conventional therapies.

This prospective study evaluated persistent kerion cases among children with tinea capitis at our hospital, documenting six instances that showed limited improvement with standard antifungal therapy and were subsequently treated effectively with ingrown hair removal. The study also discussed the potential role of ingrown hairs in superficial fungal infections affecting the hair.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^115dNzcg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ringworm

Background

Ringworm or "tinea" is a type of skin infection caused by several different species of fungus. A ringworm infection can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), the body (tinea corporis), the hands (tinea manuum), the feet (tinea pedis or "athlete's foot"), the nails (tinea unguium), the groin or inner thighs (tinea cruris of "jock itch"), and the beard area (tinea barbae). Typical symptoms include red, itchy skin, a ring-shaped rash, and hair loss.

Ringworm spreads by contact with personal items from someone whohas a ringworm infection, such as towels, clothing, or hair care items, or surfaces that are contaminated with the fungus. It also can spread by contact with an infected dog or cat.

Treatment for ringworm depends on where the infection is on the body. Over-the-counter topical medication can treat infections on the skin, but a prescription medication taken by mouth is used to treat infections on the scalp. There are rare reports of infections that are resistant to antifungal medicines.

Recommendations

Allow entry of individuals who have ringworm infection once they have begun treatment for the infection. A rash should not be not used as a reason for excluding someone who has begun treatment, as a ringworm rash may persist for several weeks.
Refer guests who develop a rash while staying at the facility for medical evaluation by their primary care physician or licensed clinician.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^116N4ddV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Five trials reported this outcome in 356 participants (range 1 to 5 weeks). Taken together, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low.

We combined parent or participant judgements with investigator assessments in two within‐participant trials (Meenan 1963 in children with unspecified disease severity; Portnoy 1969 in participants with unspecified age and disease severity; 64 participants), and pooled the data (Analysis 1.7). Results favoured moderate over mild‐potency topical corticosteroid. Three additional parallel‐group trials in 292 participants (263 from parallel‐group trials and 29 from a within‐participant trial), summarised in Analysis 1.9, were also in favour of moderate topical corticosteroid (Jorizzo 1995; Rossi 2002; Roth 1978a).

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Five trials reported on local adverse events (Bagatell 1983; Haribhakti 1982; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; Roth 1978a), that included 446 participants; 362 from the parallel‐group trials and 84 from the within‐participant trials (range 2 to 5 weeks). Taken together, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low.

Skin thinning and related signs

Four trials that compared moderate and mild topical corticosteroid of two to five weeks' duration assessed skin thinning and related signs; no cases were reported (Bagatell 1983; Haribhakti 1982; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; 417 participants). No cases were reported in a subgroup of 36 participants treated for up to 25 weeks in Jorizzo 1995.

Local site reactions

Four trials that compared moderate and mild topical corticosteroid of two to five weeks' duration reported the number of participants who experienced local site reactions (Bagatell 1983; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; Roth 1978a; Analysis 1.10). Some trials described adverse events as "brief" and "slight". The trial with the largest number of participants that reported local site reactions was Bagatell 1983 (4/127 with moderate topical corticosteroid and 3/122 with mild topical corticosteroid).

Skin infections

A three‐week trial that compared moderate (127 participants) and mild (122 participants) topical corticosteroid found no cases of folliculitis (Bagatell 1983).

Other adverse events are described under 'Unspecified adverse events (safety)'.

### Modified superlong pulse 810 nm diode laser in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae in skin types V and VI [^111TZzvo]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Laser hair removal is a well-established therapy for pseudofolliculitis barbae, but there have been few studies on the use of a very-long-pulse 810 nm diode laser for this condition.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of a modified 810 nm superlong-pulse diode laser (Palomar Medical, Burlington, MA, USA) in the treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) in subjects with type V and VI skin.

Methods

Thirteen patients were treated three times at 2-week intervals on one side of their neck with varying fluences. They were evaluated for (1) reduction of shaving bumps and (2) pain tolerance on the treated versus the untreated side.

Results

There was a statistically significant improvement in shaving bumps. The treatment side showed a baseline PFB lesion count of 22.5 (± 20 SD), which decreased to a mean of 5 (± 5 SD) (p < .05). The control baseline mean count was 27.6 (± 22 SD) and at the end of the study was 15 (± 12 SD) (p = .13). Pain was rated at 2.5 of 10 for subjects treated both with and without anesthetic. The margin of safety was greater in type V compared with type VI skin.

Conclusion

A modified 810 nm superlong-pulse diode laser is both effective and well tolerated in the reduction of shaving bumps, especially in patients with type V skin.

### Multifocal alopecia of the scalp, axillae, and body [^115n3dri]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Pseudopelade of Brocq – Incorrect. Pseudopelade of Brocq is a rare cicatricial alopecia presenting with discrete, asymmetric, and nonscaly patches of alopecia. No significant inflammation is seen on histopathology.
B. Frontal fibrosing alopecia – Incorrect. Frontal fibrosing alopecia, a variant of lichen planopilaris, is a form of cicatricial alopecia clinically characterized by band-like alopecia of the frontal scalp with associated eyebrow thinning.
C. Alopecia areata – Incorrect. Alopecia areata is a nonscarring alopecia with peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate on histopathology.
D. GLPLS – Correct. A variant of lichen planopilaris, GLPLS classically presents as a triad of multifocal cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, nonscarring alopecia of the axillae and/or groin and keratotic follicular papules of the trunk and extremities. Histologic findings can include a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with necrotic keratinocytes, perifollicular fibroplasia, and follicular dilatation with plugging.
E. DLE – Incorrect. DLE is a clinical and histologic mimicker of GLPLS. The presence of keratotic follicular papules and nonscarring alopecia on the trunk, lack of conchal bowl involvement, histopathologic findings, and negative antinuclear antibody all contributed to favoring a diagnosis of GLPLS over DLE in this case. While both GLPLS and DLE may show hyperkeratosis, follicular dilatation and plugging on histopathologic examination, basement membrane zone thickening and mucin deposition are features of DLE that were not seen in this case.

### Defining pseudofolliculitis barbae in 2001: a review of the literature and current trends [^111RmU7u]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a chronic inflammatory and potentially disfiguring condition most often seen in men and women of African American and Hispanic origin who have tightly curled hair and who shave or tweeze hairs frequently. The etiology is multifactorial. The shape of the hair follicle, hair cuticle, and the direction of hair growth each play a role in the inflammatory response once the hair is shaven or plucked and left to grow. This reaction often produces painful, pruritic, and sometimes hyperpigmented papules in the beard distribution. The result is an unappealing cosmetic appearance, often with emotionally distressing consequences for affected individuals. The diagnosis is made clinically. Currently, prevention and early intervention are the mainstays of therapy. Many treatment options are available; however, none has been completely curative. In this review, the history, incidence, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, dermatopathology, prevention, and treatment of PFB, including the most current surgical options, will be discussed. In addition, new data on patients with PFB from the Skin of Color Center will be presented.

### Differential diagnoses of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis: considerations as regards one case [^115Ko4fc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Pseudolymphomatous folliculitis is a rare form of cunateous lymphoid hyperplasia, characterised by dense infiltration of lymphocytes, accompanied by hyperplastic pilous hair follicles. There is no sex predominance and a wide range of age has been reported. The etiopathogenesis is unknown. Some theories have been proposed, like the existence of an antigen localised in the follicle, that might produce an exacerbated immune reaction. Supporting this theory, there is the presence of dendritic cells S100 and CDa1 positive in dense perifollicular clusters, suggesting a targeted process caused by an antigen that resides inside the follicle and its spontaneous remission after a biopsy that results in the elimination of the antigen in the lesion. Four cases have been reported with the previous history: one with insect bites precedents, two with trauma precedents and another one with the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%) [^115KDSXL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Primary skin infections: Impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections: Infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial super-infections of fungal or viral infections. Please Note: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. Gentamicin Sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. If a water-washable preparation is desired, the cream is preferable. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream has been used successfully in infants over one year of age, as well as in adults and children.

### Pseudofolliculitis barbae: a review of current treatment options [^114i2PoN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the disease process and wide variety of treatment options for psuedofolliculitis barbae (PFB), or razor bumps. PFB is caused by hair follicles penetrating the skin and causing an inflammatory response. PFB can occur to anyone who shaves, and is more likely in those with curly hair. PFB can cause significant hyperpigmentation and scarring, more noticeable in darker skin types. PFB can be treated with a variety of topical, systemic, or light/laser therapies. Minimal progress has been made in treating PFB in recent years, partially due to the success of well-established current treatments discussed in this review. The most effective treatments involve a multifaceted approach including behavioral changes in shaving habits as well as the use of topical therapies.

Including this patient, six patients with BD have existed over four generations in the proband's family (figure 1). Patient 2, the 43-year-old mother of the proband, had also suffered from recurrent oral ulcers from the age of 8 years. She had been diagnosed as having BD due to recurrent oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis when she was 20 years of age. Colchicine treatment was unsuccessful. At 28 years of age, entero-BD was diagnosed based on gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic findings of intestinal ulcers, and responded to prednisolone (45 mg/day) and was thereafter controlled by low-dose steroids. Patient 3, the 71-year-old grandmother of the proband, had suffered from recurrent oral ulcers from the age of 8 years. Oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis with fever manifested frequently, but were resolved by low-dose glucocorticoids. Patient 4, a 42-year-old maternal aunt of the proband, had experienced oral ulcer from the age of 10 years. She had been diagnosed as having BD based on recurrent oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis, which responded poorly to a single dose of colchicine. Patient 5, an 18-year-old maternal female cousin of the proband, had experienced recurrent episodes of self-resolving oral and genital ulcers, EN-like lesions and pseudofolliculitis, since the age of 12 years. Patient 6, the proband's maternal great-grandmother, had died at 88 years of age. She had also suffered from recurrent oral and genital ulcers, and indurated erythaema accompanied by fever, from elementary school age, in spite of colchicine treatment. A history of genital ulcers could not be ascertained. None of the patients had exhibited ocular lesions of BD.

### Laser and light-based aesthetics in men [^115HiW7K]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Men represent an important evolving segment of the cosmetic market. With the growing acceptability of cosmetic procedures along with societal and workplace pressure to maintain youthfulness, men increasingly seek the advice of aesthetic practitioners. Despite this so-called "Menaissance", there is a paucity of published literature regarding laser and light treatments of male skin. Herein the differences in male cutaneous physiology are addressed, followed by a review of light-based treatment of conditions largely unique to male skin, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and rhinophyma. Next, the publications related to laser treatment of male skin specifically are examined. We conclude with a discussion of personal observations derived from clinical experience with laser and light-based treatments in men.

### Review of treatments for pseudofolliculitis barbae [^1167UeEW]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by follicular and perifollicular papules and pustules primarily affecting the beard and neck area. PFB is a condition that predominantly affects patients with skin of colour. The objective of this paper is to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and presentation of PFB, and assess the most recent evidence-based treatment options and recommendations for PFB. This is important to increase the quality of care given to target patient populations and to address the prominent disparity in healthcare management of patients with skin of colour. A literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed and Cochrane Library. The key term 'pseudofolliculitis barbae' was used. Search parameters were set to search from 1987 to the present. Results were further narrowed by limiting the literature review to published observational studies, case studies, case series, randomized control trials and case-control studies. Effective treatment for PFB requires a multifaceted approach that targets various aspects of the pathogenesis. Current treatments include preventive measures, antibiotics, corticosteroids, keratolytics, chemical depilatories and/or laser treatments. Topical therapies are currently the mainstay treatment. However, laser hair removal has become a potential long-term treatment option, and additional studies are warranted to understand its long-term efficacy and permanency.

Pediatric BS group criteria and 16 (69.6%) fulfilled International Behçet's Study Group criteria. No cases of familial history of BD were recorded. During disease course, oral aphtous ulcers (100%), genital ulcers (91%) and pseudofolliculitis lesions (47.8%) prevailed among the mucocutaneous signs, while the most common major organ-related manifestations were vascular and ocular involvement, with 7 (29.2%) cases uveitis including 3 (12.5%) cases of retinal vasculitis. Panuveitis (75%) was the predominant type. Vascular, ocular and joint involvement were significantly higher in males (p < 0.001, p = 0.021 and p = 0.034, respectively). Although erythema nodosum (8.7%) and cardiac involvement (4.3%) were more common in males, the difference was not significant. Genital ulcers, pseudofolliculitis and gastrointestinal involvement were similar in two groups. Concerning the therapeutic approaches, conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) were the most frequently prescribed medication (91.3%), followed by colchicine (60.9%) and azathioprine (52.3%).

Conclusion: Our results are in line with what has been described in the literature. Ocular, vascular and joint manifestations had a higher frequency in pediatric males. This highlights importance of multidisciplinary monitoring to achieve better outcomes and avoid complications.

2.3 Study population

The patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) codes. The study included patients with at least one diagnosis claim of AA anytime during the index period with continuous enrollment (one claim [AA/non‐AA] in the post‐index period). Patients with the diagnosis of trichotillomania, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, tinea capitis, tinea barbae, scarring alopecia, unspecified nonscarring hair loss, pseudopelade, and folliculitis decalvans were excluded from the study.

The patients included in the study were further stratified into subcohorts based on their diagnosis and selected prescription medicines, following the diagnosis of AA. The subcohorts are described as: (i) mild AA: patients with an AA diagnosis code for other AA (L63.8) or AA, unspecified (L63.9), and those who were prescribed topical nonsteroids (minoxidil, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), topical steroids (hydrocortisone acetate, mometasone furoate, clobetasol propionate, hydrocortisone, neomycin sulphate, gramicidin, nystatin, triamcinolone acetonide, miconazole nitrate, prednicarbate, clotrimazole, betamethasone valerate, allantoin, coal tar, hydrocortisone, clioquinol+hydrocortisone acetate, fluocinonide/gentamicin sulphate, hydrocortisone 17‐butyrate, crotamiton/hydrocortisone), intralesional triamcinolone, nontraditional treatments, or other treatments were categorized as having mild disease; (ii) moderate‐to‐severe AA: patients with a diagnosis code for alopecia universalis (L63.0) or alopecia totalis (L63.1) or ophiasis (L63.2) and patients with a diagnosis code for other AA (L63.8) or AA, unspecified (L63.9), and those who were prescribed any immunomodulators (cyclosporine, methotrexate, ruxolitinib, azathioprine, ixekizumab, sulfasalazine, JAK inhibitors, dupilumab, apremilast), oral steroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, betamethasone, fludrocortisone acetate, cortisone acetate), systemic nonsteroids (dapsone), finasteride, systemic antihistamines (only fexofenadine and ebastine) phototherapy, or platelet‐rich plasma; and (iii) others: patients with a diagnosis code for AA (L63) and not captured in the mild and moderate‐to‐severe disease cohorts.

### Persistent carbuncle on the chin of an older man [^113VmFuX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This case illustrates an unusual presentation of OSCC. A similar case documented a persistent, inflammatory facial mass positive for Streptococcus milleri that was secondary to an underlying intraoral malignancy. Compared with the current case, the patient was found to have OSCC that had invaded through the mandible and presented as an erythematous skin lesion colonized with flora more characteristic of the oral cavity. The patient presented initially with an exquisitely painful skin lesion that progressed to numbness of the lower lip. In the current case, the patient initially reported only mild tenderness but later experienced persistent numbness of the lower lip and chin. The numbness was likely due to an invasion of the inferior alveolar nerve by the tumor and portends a worse prognosis.

As our patient did not present initially with an intraoral mass, the differential diagnosis for the facial lesion was broad and included infection, inflammatory processes, and cutaneous malignancy. Given the clinical appearance, infectious processes such as bacterial or herpetic folliculitis, as well as Majocchi granuloma, were considered. Possible inflammatory lesions included a complex inflamed epidermoid cyst, rosacea, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. Suspicion of a cutaneous malignancy, however, was higher on the differential given the persistence of the lesion over time, resistance to antibiotic therapy, numbness of the skin over the lesion, and extensive smoking history. Furthermore, a biopsy was prompted by the fact that Proteus mirabilis is a normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. The morphology of the SCC, together with p16 positivity, led to the discovery of the OSCC. This case illustrates the importance of having a high index of suspicion for OSCC in the setting of a persistent carbuncular lesion of the chin that is associated with unusual bacteria, shows resistance to appropriate antibiotic therapy, and presents with pain or numbness.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^116ThiuK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — microbiologic testing is addressed as follows: Routine microbiologic testing is not recommended in the evaluation and management of patients with acne, but those who exhibit acne-like lesions suggestive of Gram-negative folliculitis may benefit from microbiologic testing. Microbiologic testing of acne lesions is largely unnecessary because it does not affect management, and successful antibiotic treatment may not result from a reduction of bacterial numbers. The prime situation where microbiologic testing is useful in patients with acne is in evaluating for Gram-negative folliculitis, which is typically diagnosed via culture of the lesions, and is generally treated with isotretinoin or an antibiotic to which the bacteria are sensitive. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infections may appear similar to acne and should be considered in the differential, particularly in cases of acute eruptions; a swab culture may be helpful in these cases.

### Facial hair shaving behavior and skin problems of shaved areas of males [^115HmXfL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unwanted facial hair is a common problem and requires different grooming regimens or treatments. Shaving beard hair can cause undesirable skin effects, such as irritation, razor burn, razor nick, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. This study explores male behaviors related to shaving facial hair and the consequential effects on the shaved skin. A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted on 340 healthy men. Most of the participants were manual shavers. Approximately one-third of the manual shavers prepared their skin for shaving, compared to 13% of the electric shavers. The most common shaving-related skin problems were irritation and dryness, razor burn, razor nicks, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. The shaving-related skin problems resulted from individual skin conditions and their shaving techniques. Appropriate skin preparation should be undertaken before shaving, and post-shaving care products should be used to avoid problems.

### Pseudofolliculitis barbae… [^116XiiH6]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

It is relatively common in people who have naturally curly hair and occurs in up to 60% of Black men. It can also rarely affect women. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is caused when hairs curve back and either re-enter or grow under the skin after shaving. This is more likely in people with naturally curly hair. This leads to a reaction resulting in painful inflammation and scarring. Pseudofolliculitis barbae typically occurs in the beard area, but may also occur in the armpits, groin, or other areas of shaving. You may have PFB if you frequently develop skin-colored or red bumps in areas of shaving. Over time, these bumps can become darker and turn into scars. The best treatment is to avoid shaving; however, this may not always be possible. Using a razor designed for sensitive skin can be helpful, as it prevents a close shave. Trimming with an electric razor set to a high setting is another alternative. Some people have success using over the counter chemical hair removers.

These should be used with caution, as they can be very irritating and even lead to permanent discoloration of the skin. It may be beneficial to perform a test spot using a small amount of cream on a small area of skin to see how your skin reacts. Do not attempt to pluck hairs, as this increases the chances of the new hair regrowing into the skin. When you begin shaving, shave with short strokes in the direction of the hair growth, avoid shaving over the same area multiple times, and do not stretch the skin while shaving. After you have finished shaving, rinse off your face and then apply a cool compress to the shaved areas followed by an aftershave. It is important to keep your blade in a cool, dry place and not to reuse the same blade more than 5 times. In some situations, hair removal with lasers may be appropriate and work by destroying the hair at its roots, preventing the hair from regrowing.

These treatments should be discussed with and performed by a medical expert, such as a dermatologist, and can be costly if not covered by insurance. If you have performed these techniques and continue to experience PFB, please see a dermatologist. There may be additional therapies, such as prescription creams and cleansers, that can provide symptom relief. A physician may also provide you with a medical letter should one be required to excuse you from shaving for work.

### Multifocal alopecia of the scalp, axillae, and body [^1113Kj4p]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case summary

A 29-year-old man presented with a year of nonpruritic eruption with associated hair loss. Scalp and beard examination demonstrated scattered thin pink to violaceous papules coalescing into plaques with patchy scarring alopecia (Fig 1). On the body, there were eruptions of follicularly based keratotic violaceous papules (Fig 2), whereas on the suprapubic skin and bilateral axillae there were brown to violaceous thin papules and plaques with nonscarring alopecia. Conchal bowls were clear. He denied systemic symptoms, arthralgias, or family history of autoimmune disease. Antinuclear antibody and treponemal stain were negative. A biopsy supported the diagnosis (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pseudopelade of Brocq
B. Frontal fibrosing alopecia
C. Alopecia areata
D. Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS)
E. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)

### Dermatologic conditions in skin of color: part II. disorders occurring predominately in skin of color [^117KCrSy]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Several skin conditions are more common in persons with skin of color, including dermatosis papulosa nigra, pseudofolliculitis barbae, acne keloidalis nuchae, and keloids. Dermatosis papulosa nigra is a common benign condition characterized by skin lesions that do not require treatment, although several options are available for removal to address cosmetic concerns. Pseudofolliculitis barbae occurs as a result of hair removal. Altering shaving techniques helps prevent lesions from recurring. In acne keloidalis nuchae, keloidal lesions are found on the occipital scalp and posterior neck. Early treatment with steroids, antibiotics, and retinoids prevents progression. A key part of the management of keloids is prevention. First-line medical therapy includes intralesional steroid injections. The distinct structure of the hair follicle in blacks results in hair care practices that can lead to common scalp disorders. For example, chemical relaxers decrease the strength of hair and may cause breakage. Better patient education, with early diagnosis and treatment, often leads to better outcomes.

### Differential diagnoses of pseudolymphomatous folliculitis: considerations as regards one case [^1172LJp2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pseudolymphomatous folliculitis (PLF) is a rare disease of cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, with a low index of clinical suspicion. We present the clinical case of a 19-year-old male patient, with a solitary violet erythematous nodule of 6 months of evolution, located in the right infraorbital region, without presenting another symptomatology. Histopathological examination showed a lymphocytic infiltrate that surrounds the hair follicles, sebaceous and sweat glands that focally destroy their basement membrane. PLF was diagnosed based on histological and immunohistochemical studies. In the multiple studies and case reports, the variability of the initial clinical diagnosis never corresponds to PLF, becoming a pathology with a low suspect index.

### Evaluation of efficacy and safety of chemical peeling and long-pulse Nd: YAG laser in treatment of pseudofolliculitis barbae [^114jv9Wp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) presents as chronic inflammation of the beard area that affect males but also females may affect if have coarse hair. Its treatment can be challenging. Laser-assisted hair removal causes miniaturization of hair shafts which are the principal contributors to inflammation in PFB. Also chemical peeling is used in treatment of PFB. To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of long pulsed Nd:YAG laser vs chemical peeling in the treatment of PFB. Twenty male patients with PFB were divided randomly into two groups. Group A treated by long pulsed Nd: Yag laser and group B treated by chemical peeling, all were subjected to treatment until complete clearance or maximum five sessions. Clinical assessment of skin lesions was done at baseline, end of sessions, follow-up at 3 months after end of therapy by counting of papules. Subjective evaluations were also obtained from both subjects and investigators. Assessments of any abnormal side effects caused by laser treatment or by chemical peeling were also evaluated. A reduction in the quantity of papules/pustules when compared with baseline data was statistically significant more in laser group than peeling group for treatment of PFB in the mandibular and neck regions at the end of session and follow-up evaluations. Subject evaluations ranged from satisfied to very satisfied. Side effects of chemical peeling included transient hyperpigmentation, mild erythema, and burning and side effects of laser included pain. Both therapy are effective and safe in the treatment of PFB but laser therapy more effective than peeling therapy.
