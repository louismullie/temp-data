## Question

Tim buys a book of esoteric words. He learns 10 words from it a day. In 2 years the book has increased the number of words he knows by 50%. How many words did he know originally?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many words Tim knew originally, given that he learns 10 new words per day from a book and that after 2 years his vocabulary has increased by 50%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of new words learned over 2 years. Then, I should verify the relationship between the new words and the original vocabulary size. Next, I will set up the equation and solve for the original number of words. Finally, I should double-check the calculation and consider whether any assumptions might affect the result, like leap years or retention, even though the problem is framed as a straightforward percentage increase scenario.

> Let me first confirm the time frame and daily rate. Two years is 365 days times 2, which equals 730 days, and at 10 words per day, that means Tim learns 10 × 730 = 7,300 new words over 2 years. Wait, let me verify the multiplication: 10 × 700 is 7,000, and 10 × 30 is 300, so 7,000 + 300 = 7,300 words. That checks out.

> Now, I need to translate the percentage increase into an equation. The problem states the book increased his vocabulary by 50%, which means the 7,300 new words equal 50% of his original vocabulary. In other words, 7,300 = 0.50 × original_words. Hold on, I should verify the wording: "increased by 50%" implies the gain is half of the starting amount, so the equation is correct as stated.

> Next, I should solve for the original number of words. Dividing both sides by 0.50 gives original_words = 7,300 ÷ 0.50 = 14,600. Let me double-check that division: 7,300 divided by 0.5 is the same as 7,300 multiplied by 2, which is indeed 14,600. So, Tim originally knew 14,600 words.

> I should confirm the logic one more time. If he started with 14,600 words and added 7,300, his new total is 14,600 + 7,300 = 21,900 words. The increase of 7,300 relative to 14,600 is 7,300 ÷ 14,600 = 0.50, which is exactly a 50% increase. The math is consistent with the problem statement.

> But wait, what if someone considers leap years or assumes some words are forgotten? The problem is phrased as a simple percentage increase without accounting for leap years or retention loss, so introducing those would complicate beyond the intended scope. Given the straightforward wording, the most faithful answer is 14,600 words originally.

---

Tim originally knew **14,600 words**. Here's how we got there: he learns 10 words/day, so in 2 years (730 days) he adds 7,300 words. Since this represents a 50% increase, the original vocabulary must be 7,300 ÷ 0.5 = **14,600 words**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let **x** be the original number of words Tim knew.

- **Words learned per day**: 10
- **Number of days in 2 years**: 365 × 2 = 730
- **Total words learned in 2 years**: 10 × 730 = 7,300

The 7,300 new words represent a 50% increase, so:

7,300 = 0.5 × x

Solving for x:

x = 7,300 ÷ 0.5 = **14,600**

---

## Verification

Original vocabulary: 14,600 words\
New vocabulary: 14,600 + 7,300 = 21,900 words\
Increase: 7,300 ÷ 14,600 = 0.5 = 50%

---

Tim originally knew **14,600 words**.

1.3.3 Vocabulary Size

Children's current vocabulary size is closely related to the specific words they are likely to know, and this connection may be due to several factors. First, children with larger vocabularies tend to process and recognize words more quickly and accurately than children with smaller vocabularies (Marchman, Fernald, and Hurtado). Second, words are not learned randomly as there is semantic organization in a child's lexicon and vocabulary learning builds on itself: Children with larger vocabularies have denser and more interconnected semantic networks and they can use the words they know to facilitate the processing of new and known words (e.g. incorporating words that share perceptual features or semantic overlap more easily; Beckage, Smith, and Hills; Borovsky et al; Borovsky). Third, many words assessed in looking paradigms are from the CDI, a closed list of common words that children eventually learn almost entirely. Therefore, the more words a child is reported to know, the higher the likelihood that any randomly selected word from the CDI will also be known. For all of these reasons, when comparing two hypothetical children, both 24 months old — one with a vocabulary size in the ∼10th percentile (70 words) and another in the ∼90th percentile (500 words) — it would be reasonable to believe that a child with a larger vocabulary would be more likely to know a later‐acquired word like "zipper", or any other particular word, than a child with a smaller vocabulary.

In sum, children's early vocabularies can be highly variable in size and content, with child‐level factors like age, experience (whether in terms of total speech quantity or relative language exposure), and total vocabulary size each potentially predicting children's word knowledge, whether assessed via CDI or looking‐while listening.

### Language clearly matters; methods matter too [^9f166080]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Over two decades ago, the "30-million-word" gap rose to prominence after work by Hart & Risley (1995) suggested that children from families with low socioeconomic status (SES) heard fewer words than their peers from families with higher SES during their first 4 years of life. Recent research challenges the magnitude and even existence of this gap. However, due to methodological limitations, we know very little about the presence, magnitude, and settings in which there may be a word gap. Moreover, causal evidence is also limited. I highlight why it is critical for the field to have a more precise understanding of the nature of the word gap (or lack thereof) and potential avenues for better evaluating this phenomenon.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^27b38a52]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 9 — psychologists strive to be familiar with current knowledge about normal and disease-mediated cognitive changes in older adults — emphasizes that one of the greatest challenges is knowing how to attribute subtle observed cognitive changes to normal developmental shifts versus an underlying neurodegenerative condition, that several moderating and mediating factors contribute to and confound age-associated changes within and across individuals, and that psychologists' knowledge about cognitive changes in older adulthood is critical to their ability to provide services. Application indicates that most cognitive changes older adults experience as part of normal aging are mild and do not significantly interfere with daily functioning, that for most older adults some abilities remain relatively stable into late life while others change beginning decades earlier, that the vast majority continue to engage in longstanding pursuits, interact intellectually, solve real-life problems, and achieve new learning, and that functions better preserved with age include aspects of language such as vocabulary and general semantic knowledge and other skills relying primarily on stored information, while psychologists aim to inform themselves about this process.

### Cognate beginnings to bilingual lexical acquisition [^035da62e]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

The foundations of word learning are in place at an early age. At 6 months, infants start directing their gaze to objects when hearing their labels (Bergelson & Swingley; Tincoff & Jusczyk,), and shortly after caregivers start reporting some words as acquired by their infant in vocabulary checklists (e.g. Fenson et al.). Most research on early word acquisition relies extensively on data from monolingual children and is oblivious to the fact that a substantial proportion of the world population acquires more than one language from an early age (Grosjean). Previous work on bilingual vocabulary acquisition pointed to bilingual toddlers knowing, on average, fewer words in each of their languages than their monolingual peers, and to both groups knowing a similar number of words — if not more words — when the bilinguals' two languages are pooled together. Hoff et al. found that English‐Spanish bilingual toddlers in South Florida (United States) knew fewer words in English than monolinguals did, but both groups knew a similar total amount of words when both English and Spanish vocabularies were counted together. Other studies have provided converging evidence that bilinguals know a similar or even larger number of words than monolinguals when the two languages are aggregated (Gonzalez‐Barrero et al; Pearson & Fernández). Recently, more detailed analyses of the words included in bilinguals' lexicons have shown insights into the underlying mechanisms.

### The science of learning: breaking news [^776f132a]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

We begin with a paradox. On one hand, not nearly enough is known about exactly how learning takes place in the brain, although exciting new results are emerging thanks to improved brain imaging and a greater focus on neuroscience by government and universities. But this research is just beginning, and a much larger effort and investment are needed to answer even the most basic questions. On the other hand, more than enough is already known about what best promotes learning to motivate and drive educational reform for years to come. This is a report from the front lines of both research and educational implementation. This information should prove of use to anyone — teachers, students, parents, patients, and health practitioners — who is concerned about how best to improve formal or informal teaching and learning, to help people remember complex instructions, or to change unhealthy habits and practices.

Word Production Best‐Fitting Model. Examination of coefficients in the best‐fitting model (Table 2) suggest that, when other predictors were held constant, being reported to produce a tested item predicted a non‐significant 3% increase in target looks (compared to the 9% increase in the produces_word‐only model). Standardized effect size estimates suggest that age had the largest effect on looking‐while‐listening performance, followed by produces_word, and then vocabulary_size (see Table 2). The standard error for produces_word was much larger than for the other two predictors, suggesting that produces_word was a more variable predictor. The fixed effects of produces_word, age, and vocabulary_size, cumulatively explained 6% of the variance in children's performance on this task and together with the random effects accounted for 17% of the variance in their performance (see Figure 4). Notably, the magnitude of the effects in this model were similar and the model was not significantly different to that of an age + vocabulary_size model which omits produces_word (see Appendix D for model effects).

2.5 Cognitive evaluation

At year 30, participants completed six cognitive tests. Global cognition was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Episodic memory was assessed with the delayed recall task of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), a word list task. Executive functioning was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a measure of processing speed and the Stroop test, a measure of interference and the letter fluency, which assesses lexical retrieving ability. Language was evaluated with the categorical and phonemic verbal fluency, which assess the ability to generate words within a specific semantic and phonemic category, respectively. Raw scores for each measure were converted into z‐scores with higher z‐scores reflecting better performance.

2.6 Brain structure measurements

At year 30, brain MRI was obtained including structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in 3T MR scanners (Philips 3T Achieva/2.6.3.6 platform in Birmingham; Siemens 3T Tim Trio/VB 15 platform in Minneapolis; Siemens 3T Tim Trio/VB 15 platform in Oakland) using standardized protocols. Acquisition parameters have been described in detail elsewhere. White matter hyperintensities were estimated from the sagittal 3D fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1, and T2 sequences using a supervised learning–based multi‐modal lesion segmentation technique, which was trained on manually delineated ground‐truth segmentation labels (see Launer et al.for a detailed description). Volumetric measurements for normal and abnormal (with white matter hyperintensities) tissues were calculated within each region of interest (ROI), as well as in larger anatomical regions obtained by grouping single ROIs within a hierarchical representation.DTI images were used to calculate maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) using standard methods. We examined total gray matter volume; gray matter volume within inferior frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes; and hippocampal gray matter volume, each corrected for intracranial volume (ICV; consisting of total brain volume plus cerebrospinal fluid) to account for variation in head size. We examined mean white matter FA values across the brain (total FA) as well as white matter FA by lobe, with mean white matter FA values within a particular lobe averaged across the left and right hemispheres. All the FA measures were extracted from the white matter only, not from gray matter nor whole brain. All brain structure outcomes were converted to z‐scores (using means and standard deviations from all participants who had these data), with higher z‐scores reflecting larger gray matter volumes and higher FA.

### How to read a scientific research paper [^aaad1254]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Reading is the most common way that adults learn. With the exponential growth in information, no one has time to read all they need. Reading original research, although difficult, is rewarding and important for growth. Building on past knowledge, the reader should select papers about which he already holds an opinion. Rather than starting at the beginning, this author suggests approaching a paper by reading the conclusions in the abstract first. The methods should be next reviewed, then the results — first in the abstract, and then the full paper. For efficiency, at each step, reasons should be sought not to read any further in the paper. By using this approach, new knowledge will be obtained and many papers will be evaluated, read, and considered.

### Promoting replicability in developmental research through meta-analyses: insights from language acquisition research [^2a040de4]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

We find no strong linear link between‐participant age and sample size on the level of meta‐analyses (Table 1). However, effect sizes and consequently power increase with median participant age. Most saliently, the only three meta‐analyses with power over 80%, pointing and vocabulary, gaze following, and online word recognition typically test participants older than 1 year.

Seminal Articles as Basis for Sample Size Planning

As Table 1 shows, experimenters only rarely include a sufficient number of participants to observe a given effect — assuming the meta‐analytic estimate is accurate. It might, however, be possible that power has been determined based on a seminal article to be replicated and expanded. Initial reports tend to overestimate effect sizes (Jennions & Møller, 2002), possibly explaining the lack of observed power in the subsequent literature.

For each meta‐analysis, we extracted the oldest article and the largest effect size reported therein and re‐calculated power accordingly, using the median sample size of the same meta‐analysis (see Table 2). The largest effect size per article was chosen because many seminal studies contain at least one null result in a control condition that delineates the limitations of a given phenomenon (e.g. that older children succeed at a task that their younger peers fail). Thus, it is unlikely that the researchers following up on that work aim for the median or mean effect size.

Table 2
For Each Meta‐analysis, Largest Effect Size Cohen's d and Derived Power Based on the Seminal Article Along With the Difference Between Power Based on Meta‐analytic and Seminal Article Effect Size

In some cases, such as native and nonnative vowel discrimination, as shown in Table 2, sample size choices are in line with the oldest report. The difference in power, noted in the last column, can be substantial, with native vowel discrimination and phonotactic learning being the two most salient examples. Here, sample sizes match well with the oldest report and studies would be appropriately powered if this estimate were representative of the true effect. In four meta‐analyses, neither the seminal article nor meta‐analytic effect size seem to be a useful basis for sample size decisions. Since these numbers are based on the largest effect of a seminal article, all power estimations (but also differences in meta‐analytic effect sizes) would be smaller, meaning that sample sizes are less appropriate than implied by the column denoting power based on the seminal article in Table 2.

### Two-year-olds' visual exploration of response options during memory decisions predicts metamemory monitoring one year later [^42f5675f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Use of ignorance expressions

Time 1 use of ignorance expressions was assessed via parental report. During the laboratory visit we had parents report how frequently their toddler used the phrase "I don't know" in typical, everyday conversations on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never/not yet) to 4 (often).

General vocabulary

Time 1 general vocabulary was assessed with MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory-II language questionnaire. This is a questionnaire filled out by the parent which asks about their toddlers' vocabulary, grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and comprehension. For this study, we used the toddlers' vocabulary score, resulting from a parent identifying and marking which of 100 words their toddler could express. The vocabulary score was calculated by summing the number of words identified by the parent and creating a proportion score by dividing by the total number of known words by the total number of words on the list (i.e. 100). This variable was not originally listed on our pre-registration. However, we deemed it important to account for it when assessing the relation between children's mental state language and metamemory monitoring.

Time 1 procedure

Toddlers participated in 3 sessions spaced about a week apart and after each session they received a book for their participation. Before data collection for each session, the experimenter played with the child outside of the testing room for about 5 minutes in order to build rapport and increase comfort. During Session 1, parents completed demographic and vocabulary questionnaires and reported on their toddler's use of ignorance language. Additionally, the toddlers completed the passive viewing memory task. During Session 2, the eye-tracker version of the memory task was administered and during Session 3, the touchscreen version of the memory task was administered. The touchscreen task was always administered in the third session because pilot testing revealed that toddlers were more likely to reach forward to touch the eye-tracker if they underwent the touchscreen task first which interfered with eye movement data collection.

### Language experience in the second year of life and language outcomes in late childhood [^b863b0b6]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Quantity of talk and interaction in the home during early childhood is correlated with socioeconomic status (SES) and can be used to predict early language and cognitive outcomes. We tested the effectiveness of automated early language environment estimates for children 2 to 36 months old to predict cognitive and language skills 10 years later and examined effects for specific developmental age periods.

Methods

Daylong audio recordings for 146 infants and toddlers were completed monthly for 6 months, and the total number of daily adult words and adult-child conversational turnswere automatically estimated with Language Environment Analysis software. Follow-up evaluations at 9 to 14 years of age included language and cognitive testing. Language exposure for 3 age groups was assessed: 2 to 17 months, 18 to 24 months, and ≥ 25 months. Pearson correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted.

Results

Conversational turn counts at 18 to 24 months of age accounted for 14% to 27% of the variance in IQ, verbal comprehension, and receptive and/or expressive vocabulary scores 10 years later after controlling for SES. Adult word counts between 18 and 24 months were correlated with language outcomes but were considerably weakened after controlling for SES.

Conclusions

These data support the hypothesis that early talk and interaction, particularly during the relatively narrow developmental window of 18 to 24 months of age, can be used to predict school-age language and cognitive outcomes. With these findings, we underscore the need for effective early intervention programs that support parents in creating an optimal early language learning environment in the home.

### Neural correlates of second-language word learning: minimal instruction produces rapid change [^e05b61b0]. Nature Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

Adult second-language (L2) learning is often claimed to be slow and laborious compared to native language (L1) acquisition, but little is known about the rate of L2 word learning. Here we report that adult second-language learners' brain activity, as measured by event-related potentials (ERPs), discriminated between L2 words and L2 'pseudowords' (word-like letter strings) after just 14 h of classroom instruction. This occurred even while the learners performed at chance levels when making overt L2 word-nonword judgments, indicating that the early acquisition of some aspects of a new language may be overlooked by current behavioral assessments.

CLL-TIM ensemble composition: base-learners, variables and feature encodings.

CLL-TIM is composed of 28 base-learners: 20 model the composite outcome, 5 model CLL treatment outcome and 3 model infection as a first event. Base-learners include 13 XGBoost, 7 Random Forests, 4 Extra Trees, 2 Elastic Network and 2 Logistic Regression models. a Distinct variables used in CLL-TIM and b features that these variables are encoded into. Each variable may have multiple feature encodings (right panel in b) and can hence represent multiple features in the ensemble model. For instance, the variable Haemoglobin is encoded into four features; the mean, minimum and variability of the test result and the number of days since the last test. These four features were calculated on patient look-backs of 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years. In total, the feature encodings selected for 84 variables in CLL-TIM resulted in a set of 228 features (Supplementary Data 1). For visualization purposes, here we show a condensed representation with only variables that were used by at least 10% of CLL-TIM's base-learners (left panel in a). CLL-TIM models: rates of change, variability, average values and extremities in the results of several routine lab tests; recentness of lab tests and the number of tests taken (modeling doctor's decisions); several encodings representing the recentness and distribution of infection dates; counts of rare pathology codes (i.e. those found in < 1% of the CLL training cohort) and inflammation events (pathology diagnoses).

### The algorithmic origins of counting [^c1a15201]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

The study of how children learn numbers has yielded one of the most productive research programs in cognitive development, spanning empirical and computational methods, as well as nativist and empiricist philosophies. This paper provides a tutorial on how to think computationally about learning models in a domain like number, where learners take finite data and go far beyond what they directly observe or perceive. To illustrate, this paper then outlines a model which acquires a counting procedure using observations of sets and words, extending the proposal of Piantadosi et al. (2012). This new version of the model responds to several critiques of the original work and outlines an approach which is likely appropriate for acquiring further aspects of mathematics.

### Modeling rapid language learning by distilling Bayesian priors into artificial neural networks [^a2ebb0f7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Testing out-of-distribution generalization

One remarkable aspect of human language acquisition is that we learn rules for which our experience gives little or no direct evidence. Consider the following sentences. In English, a declarative sentence, such as (1a), can be converted to a question by replacing one of the phrases in the sentence (the banker) with who and moving it to the start of the sentence, as in (1b). There are exceptions to this general rule: it is ungrammatical to form a question of this sort when who corresponds to a word inside a conjunction, as is the case in (2b). Though situations that would give rise to (2b) are rare in standard conversation, English speakers reliably learn this constraint.
a. The judge and the spy will visit the banker. b. Who will the judge and the spy visit?
a. The judge will visit the spy and the banker. b. *Who will the judge visit the spy and?

The evaluation set that we have used so far is a sample of naturally-occurring text. Therefore, for many linguistic phenomena, this evaluation set likely contains few sentences for which capturing that phenomenon is important. As a consequence, a model's performance on this evaluation set does not tell us whether the model has learned the phenomena that linguists typically focus on.

To test whether models have learned particular linguistic phenomena, prior work, has proposed an evaluation paradigm based on minimal pairs — pairs of sentences that highlight the rule being investigated. For example, if a learner recognizes that sentence (1b) is better-formed than (2b), that is evidence that the learner has learned the constraint on questions discussed above. The neural networks that we consider in this work are next-word prediction models, which assign a probability to every possible sequence of words. Therefore, we can apply minimal pair evaluations to our models by seeing which sentence in the pair is assigned a higher probability by the model. We use four datasets of minimal pairs, described in "Methods". Each dataset targets a number of linguistic phenomena, such as the question constraint described above. For this analysis, we return to the setting where both the standard and prior-trained networks achieved the best perplexity (namely, training on the full dataset with a hidden layer size of 1024).

### More than a 100 years after flexner: are we achieving expertise through medical education? [^6b9a3155]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Broadly, attaining expert performance has a least 5 key components:

Professional development should occur in a culture that pursues a "learning orientation" (also known as "mastery orientation"). Simultaneously, the prevailing culture must reduce its "performance orientation" since this only encourages the goal of looking good in the eyes of others. Performance-oriented individuals usually will not risk looking bad. Put another way, a learning orientation prioritizes improving, even at the cost of occasional failure (which in due time pays off), whereas a performance orientation prioritizes looking good. Individuals can become more learning-oriented over both the short-and long-term. Incremental self-improvement focuses on the elements of a challenging task, looking for ways to improve even when things are going well, using effort and strategy as normal components of improving and appreciating that errors and failure, although not the goal, are very potent learning tools.
Strategies leading to higher performance should be used. The strategy of deliberate practice leads the way. Additional strategies include: (a) reflective reasoning(involving structured reanalysis of case findings such as listing symptoms of a diagnosis that are expected but are not present or listing symptoms that are present but not accounted for by the diagnosis); (b) mastery learning(ensuring correct task performance where any aspect that is missing, or done sub optimally, is practiced repeatedly until success is achieved); (c) spacing for better retention and performance(inserting time between related learning sessions where the total learning time is kept constant - for example, a single 60-minute learning session could be changed to 3 20-minute sessions each separated by a day or more); (d) retrieval(the active recall of information at some time after it was initially learned - the longer the interval between successful retrievals the more durable is the learning); (e) feedback to enhance learning(feedback is only effective at improving performance when it directs the learner to alter an aspect of what they are doing such that it becomes more effective - praise, although pleasant to give and receive, does not typically result in improved performance); (f) comparing and contrasting to enhance transfer(finding all the commonalities and differences between topics; for example, listing the similarities and differences between septic and hemorrhagic shock would help identify the fundamental similarities and differences between them which would lead to a more effective diagnosis with a new and somewhat different manifestation of either); (g) teaching to enhance metacognition (metacognition is the process of realizing when you do, or do not, know or understand something).
Obstacles that interfere with high performance should be avoided. Working memory capacity (WMC) is used by the brain when we actively think, pay attention, process information, and learn. This processing capacity is extremely limited in humans (the typical person can only hold 7 numbers in their mind at a time) and is sufficiently vulnerable that simply walking along a prescribed path while learning words will result in less learning compared to learning while sitting. This limitation can be optimized by training a task to a level of automaticity which then reduces the involvement of WMC to complete the task. In turn, this leaves more WMC available to attend to other cognitive processes. Additional performance limitations include (a) cognitive biases and heuristics(biases are cognitive errors made when processing information; heuristics are cognitive shortcuts used to make quick and easy decisions); (b) dysfunctional thinking dispositions (a variety of thinking dispositions can reduce optimal decision making and performance. For example, the "need for cognition" is the tendency to engage in, and enjoy, effortful cognitive activity. Those with a high need for cognition perform better on intellectual tasks". Actively Open-Minded Thinking" is another disposition that is favorably, or unfavorably, linked to normatively rational thinking when is high or low, respectively).
Coaching or a structured curriculum is needed to ensure that components 1 to 3 above are followed and to provide the right environment. Mentors in the medical profession seldom dedicate themselves to coaching a junior colleague the way a coach of an elite athlete would dedicate themselves to improving the performance of an athlete. Prior studies have shown that physician self-assessment is poor and sometimes it is even inversely related to performance. In essence, physicians need to receive frequent, timely and actionable feedback from knowledgeable others that they will listen to.
The learner must be persistently motivated to achieve increasing levels of performance. Significant motivation and self-discipline are needed to stay on the path of incessant improvement. Motivation is fostered through autonomy, relatedness to important others, and success in attaining goals. Implementation intentions have been shown to help individuals reach goals that require self-discipline.

### Vocabulary interventions for second language (L2) learners up to six years of age [^d1828772]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Second language (L2) learners are a heterogeneous group. Their L2 skills are highly varied due to internal factors (e.g. cognitive development) and external factors (e.g. cultural and linguistic contexts). As a group, their L2 vocabulary skills appear to be lower than their monolingual peers. This pattern tends to persist over time and may have negative consequences for social interaction and inclusion, learning, and academic achievement.

To examine the immediate and long-term effects of second language (L2) vocabulary interventions targeting L2 learners up to six years of age on vocabulary and social-emotional well-being. To examine the associations between L2 vocabulary interventions and the general characteristics of L2 learners (e.g. age, L2 exposure, and L1 skills).

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was December 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of vocabulary interventions for L2 learners up to six years of age with standard care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 1. receptive and 2. expressive L2 vocabulary (both proximal and distal), and 3. mean length of utterance (MLU; which is a measure of potential adverse effects). Our secondary outcomes were 4. L2 narrative skills, 5. L1 receptive vocabulary (both proximal and distal), 6. L1 expressive vocabulary (both proximal and distal), 7. L1 listening comprehension, 8. L2 grammatical knowledge, 9. L2 reading comprehension (long-term), and 10. socio-emotional well-being (measured with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire).

Main Results

We found 12 studies involving 1943 participants. Two studies were conducted in Norway, seven in the USA, and single studies conducted in Canada, China, and the Netherlands. Ten studies were conducted in preschool settings, with a preschool teacher being the most common delivery agent for the intervention. The interventions were mainly organised as small-group sessions, with three or four children per group. The mean dosage per week was 80 minutes and ranged from 24 to 120 minutes. The studies commonly applied shared book reading (reading aloud with the children), with target words embedded in the books. Standard care differed based on the setting and local conditions in each country or (pre)school. In some studies, the comparison groups received vocabulary instruction in preschool groups. Compared to standard care, the effect of L2 vocabulary interventions varied across outcome measures. For vocabulary measures including words that were taught in the intervention (proximal outcome measures), the intervention effects were large for both receptive L2 vocabulary (i.e. understanding of words; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.30; 4 studies, 1973 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and expressive L2 vocabulary (i.e. expressing or producing words; SMD 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.17; 6 studies, 1121 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, due to some concerns in the overall risk of bias assessment, substantial heterogeneity, and wide CIs, we have limited confidence in these results. For language measures that did not include taught vocabulary (distal outcome measures), the intervention effects were small for receptive vocabulary (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.55; 6 studies, 1074 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably made little to no difference to expressive vocabulary (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.23; 7 studies, 960 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was little to no intervention effect on L2 listening comprehension (SMD 0.19, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.68; 2 studies, 294 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence was uncertain, and the interventions probably increased L2 narrative skills slightly (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.59; 2 studies, 487 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Only one study reported data on MLU, and we were unable to examine the effect of intervention on this outcome. The level of certainty of the evidence was downgraded mainly due to inconsistency and imprecision. We were unable to draw conclusions about socio-emotional well-being, or conduct the planned subgroup analyses to examine the second objective, due to lack of data.

Authors' Conclusions

Findings from this review suggest that, compared to standard care, vocabulary interventions may benefit children's L2 vocabulary learning but have little to no effect on their listening comprehension, though the evidence is uncertain. Vocabulary interventions probably improve the children's storytelling skills slightly. Due to the limited number of studies that met our inclusion criteria and the very low- to moderate-certainty evidence as a result of inconsistency and imprecision, implications for practice should be considered with caution. This review highlights the need for more high-quality trials (e.g. RCTs) of vocabulary interventions for L2 learners, particularly studies of learners outside the USA.

### Narrative thinking lingers in spontaneous thought [^9ce4c328]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Incidental list-learning

Participants were presented with a list of 268 words, one at a time. The word list was manually curated to convey the gist of the original Carver story (seefor the full list). Each word was onscreen for 1 s before it was replaced with two buttons, which participants used to make a forced-choice decision. The decision depended on the participant's randomly-assigned condition: Italic, Tangible, Theme or Story. The depth with which participants encoded the words in the list was manipulated from shallow (Italic) to deep (Theme/Story), while holding the word list itself constant. Participants in the Italic condition decided whether each word was italicized or not (button labels: Italic or Normal). Sixty-seven of the words were italicized, which was approximately 25% of the total list. For the Tangible condition, participants decided whether or not each word was something concrete that could be touched or inhabited (button labels: Tangible or Intangible), again with 25% of words as targets. For the Theme and Story conditions, participants were informed that the list of words they would see was not random – but instead constructed to have a hidden meaning. In the Theme condition, participants were told that the majority of words (75%) would share a common theme, while a subset of the words (25%) would be unrelated decoys. Specifically, participants were instructed that theme words would "feel like they share something with one another, like they belong in the list". In the Story condition, participants were told that the majority of words (75%) would be ordered in such a way that they could tell a story, while a subset of the words (25%) would be unrelated decoys. Participants were instructed that a story "takes place somewhere", has "characters who have their own thoughts, feelings and emotions", and follows "these characters through a series of situations that affect their lives". In the Theme and Story conditions, participants had to decide whether each word was a decoy (button labels: Decoy or Theme; Decoy or Story, respectively). To help participants develop a sense of which words belonged to the hidden theme or story, the first 15 words in the words list all belonged to the story or theme. These words were presented in blue lettering, to make them more distinctive. Participants in the Story and Theme conditions were instructed that font colour indicated that a word was not a decoy, while participants in the Italic and Tangible conditions were instructed to make their decisions irrespective of font colour. Decoy words were pseudorandomly interspersed within the list with an average of 6.01 (SD = 3.47) story words between consecutive decoys. Across all conditions, participants received feedback for each decision in the form of a checkmark or an X that appeared above the button they selected for 500 ms, followed by another 500 ms of a blank screen before the onset of the next word. The decision portion of each trial was self-paced.

### Three-to four-year-old children rapidly adapt their predictions and use them to learn novel word meanings [^fd7daffe]. Child Development (2019). Medium credibility.

Adults create and update predictions about what speakers will say next. This study asks whether prediction can drive language acquisition, by testing whether 3- to 4-year-old children (n = 45) adapt to recent information when learning novel words. The study used a syntactic context which can precede both nouns and verbs to manipulate children's predictions about what syntactic category will follow. Children for whom the syntactic context predicted verbs were more likely to infer that a novel word appearing in this context referred to an action, than children for whom it predicted nouns. This suggests that children make rapid changes to their predictions, and use this information to learn novel information, supporting the role of prediction in language acquisition.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^6fa945e4]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Early reading aloud in infancy — experimental evidence suggests that beginning in infancy is associated with enhanced development, including vocabulary and skills across domains, and an early start may fuel sustained improvements in language and preliteracy skills when integrated into daily routines and occurring more frequently. Proposed mechanisms in younger (preverbal) children include exposure to a wider range of word sounds, words, and syntax, teaching via labeling and pointing, stimulation of joint attention, emotional nurturing and responsiveness, and reinforcement of reading routine. At present, no structured approach to shared reading with infants and preverbal toddlers akin to dialogic reading has been formally studied, though one has been recently proposed (acronym SHARE/STEP; Table 2).

### No association between gain in body mass index across the life course and midlife cognitive function and cognitive reserve – the 1946 British birth cohort study [^ab86cee4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood cognitive ability, which was treated as a potential confounder in this study, was measured when participants were 8 years old. Their teachers or a trained carer assessed their verbal and nonverbal ability by administering the following tests: (1) 60-item nonverbal picture logic and intelligence; (2) reading comprehension, consisting of 35 sentences to be completed by choosing an appropriate word; (3) pronunciation of 50 words; and (4) vocabulary based on the same 50 words. An overall cognitive score was derived summing the standardized individual test results. The 35 standard items of the Watts Vernon Reading Test (sentence completion) was used at age 26 years to assess verbal ability, with an additional 10 items of increased difficulty to avoid a ceiling effect (maximum score = 45).

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^acc370c4]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Evidence for benefits of shared reading — skill building details that there are 4 major stages typically involved in children's learning to read: first, joy, comfort, and affection become associated with reading when parents make time to read, share, and talk about books as children reach for, touch, explore, and even taste their books; second, decoding is the next step, when children learn letters and their sounds and begin to string them together into words while developing phonological and phonemic awareness; third, developing fluency is the next skill level, when children begin to read smoothly and with prosody; and fourth, comprehension and expansion of the child's vocabulary is the highest level skill in reading, when children master understanding of the printed word and can draw inferences, follow story lines, agree or disagree with authors, and interpret and expand.

### Judging words by their covers and the company they keep: probabilistic cues support word learning [^54332a7e]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical learning may be central to lexical and grammatical development. The phonological and distributional properties of words provide probabilistic cues to their grammatical and semantic properties. Infants can capitalize on such probabilistic cues to learn grammatical patterns in listening tasks. However, infants often struggle to learn labels when performance requires attending to less obvious cues, raising the question of whether probabilistic cues support word learning. The current experiment presented 22-month-olds with an artificial language containing probabilistic correlations between words' statistical and semantic properties. Only infants with higher levels of grammatical development capitalized on statistical cues to support learning word-referent mappings. These findings suggest that infants' sensitivity to correlations between sounds and meanings may support both word learning and grammatical development.

Neurobiology of reading and the "reading network" — developmental timing and brain organization are summarized: Reading, in an evolutionary timescale, is described as a relatively new cultural invention, with literacy development founded on skills that develop before school in the first years of life as part of "emergent literacy". There is no genetically programmed brain network for reading; instead, brain areas and networks that evolved for more primary purposes, including language and vision, as well as attention and executive functions, must be recruited and integrated to form a "reading network".

### Word and nonword repetition in bilingual subjects: a PET study [^2b1306a0]. Human Brain Mapping (2006). Low credibility.

Learning a specific skill during childhood may partly determine the functional organization of the adult brain. This hypothesis led us to study brain activation patterns using positron emission tomography (PET), in which we compared word and nonword repetition in 10 right-handed native English-speakers (L1) who were proficient in their second language, French (L2), which was learned after the age of 5 years. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the H₂¹⁵O intravenous bolus method with intersubject averaging and coregistration of magnetic resonance and PET images. A comparison of CBF changes when repeating words in L2 with those seen when repeating words in (L1) demonstrated that the pattern of CBF was similar across the two conditions, with several significant CBF differences in the vicinity of the left insular cortex, ventral premotor region, and in the striatum. We hypothesize that these regions are activated when subjects are required to repeat known words, showing increased activity when there are increased articulatory demands imposed by speaking L2. Comparisons of nonword repetition in L1 and L2 revealed increased activity for L2 in the left ventral premotor region and in the cerebellum; rCBF increases were also observed in these regions in both L1 and L2 with increased number of syllables and increased articulatory complexity, suggesting a role for these regions in the complex motor control needed for the production of novel sequences.

### Bigger versus smaller: children's understanding of size comparison words becomes more precise with age [^0deb687f]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, these results show that children do learn the meaning of different comparative words on different trajectories. In particular, some previous work (Layton & Stick; Smith & Sera,) showed that children, from quite early on, know the meanings of both positive and negative polarity words, while other work (e.g. Bishop & Bourne,) suggested that negative polarity words are learned later. Our findings are consistent with the idea that children's initial understanding of the meaning of these comparative words is incomplete, with only some of the key features that define the word meaning present initially and that the other key features are acquired later (Clark). In all of the words, children reliably built structures that differed from the baseline structures in size, indicating that the children had encoded that the words referred to size changes. However, younger children also tended to treat these words as synonymous with bigger, increasing the size of the structures, even when asked to make them smaller or shorter. One alternative possibility we considered was that some children might have ignored the experimenter's instructions, and instead just engaged in a more general block‐building game (which typically involves making things bigger), but this is unlikely in light of the supplementary analyses that showed different rates of bigger structures for smaller and shorter, and overwhelming confirmation of their own (larger) structures as smaller/shorter when asked a confirmation question. This suggests that they gradually acquired the polarity distinction, where the meaning of the word captured whether the size change was an increase or a decrease. Finally, the dimension attribute was acquired last, with children initially treating bigger and taller as synonymous, tending to increase in the same dimension that was greater in the baseline structure. With bigger, we found no evidence that one dimension was biased over the other (i.e. children built structures that increased in the X‐dimension and the Y‐dimension, with no clear changes across age). This is in contrast to some previous work (Bausano & Jeffrey; Maratsos,) showing that children between the ages of 3 and 5 years switch to encode bigger as more likely to refer to an increase in height. Our results revealed that children's interpretations of bigger did not change across 3‐ to 8‐year‐olds. Children gradually acquired the dimensional attribute of taller, specifically building structures with greater height, regardless of the baseline structure. These findings are consistent with previous work showing a protracted development of other relational words, with the meanings becoming more precise with age. Children between the ages of 3‐ and 5 years gradually learn the meaning of the words middle and between, with no 3‐year‐olds knowing either word, most 5‐year‐olds knowing the word between and less than half of 5‐year‐olds knowing the more precise middle, with most treating middle and between as synonymous (Simms & Gentner). Similarly, 3‐year‐olds initially treat the quantifiers more and less as synonymous, referring to increases in quantity (Donaldson & Balfour,) and it is not until several years later that less is reliably encoded as a decrease (Palermo). Our findings are consistent, with a gradual refinement of the meanings after 3 years of age.

### Unsupervised word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science literature [^c2839cb4]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases 1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing 3–10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings 11–13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.

### Who would you like to be when you grow up? [^622b3c1d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

In February 2005, the Annals of Internal Medicine, a highly respected journal, published a systematic review of 59 manuscripts covering a total of 62 samples that reported on the relationship between medical knowledge/healthcare quality and years in practice/physician age. The implication of the data presented is that throughout their careers, physicians fail to upgrade their knowledge to keep pace with new information. I strongly believe that an important-if not the most important-component of continuing education relevant to clinical practice is accessing and reading the literature of this profession and related disciplines.

### Inferring experimental procedures from text-based representations of chemical reactions [^4cc1201d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In order to improve the training performance of the computational models, we restrict the allowed values for two types of properties. The first property relates to the specification of compound names in action sequences. Whenever possible, we use tokens representing the position of the corresponding molecule in the reaction input, allowing the computational models to focus more on relevant instruction patterns instead of trying to learn the naming conventions of molecules. We allow the use of reagents that do not appear in the chemical equation only when they are part of a list of commonly used reagents (reported in the Supplementary Data 1). The second property relates to numerical values for temperatures and durations. The success of reactions does not depend on the exact values for these experimental conditions, as long as they lie within adequate ranges. As a consequence, these values are often reported inaccurately. An example is the commonly reported reaction duration overnight. The term has little meaning from a quantitative perspective and only indicates the execution of an unattended reaction outside of working hours. The same applies when reporting reaction temperatures. The specification of wide intervals is often a sign of an uncontrolled process, putting aside the systematic errors connected to the use of different measuring devices. Therefore, we tokenized predefined ranges for temperatures and durations and used these tokens during the training process instead of the exact (noisy) reported values. The predicted procedure steps will contain the optimal tokens corresponding to predefined ranges. At inference time, the tokens can be replaced by actual numerical values in a straightforward manner. These two modifications simplify the design and improve the performance of all computational models, as they remove the necessity to learn the vocabulary and syntax of compound names, durations, or temperatures. Also, they reflect the fact that ranges of durations and temperatures are usually as adequate as precise values.

### Understanding systematic reviews and meta-analyses [formula: see text] [^a0b57635]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews should be distinguished from narrative reviews. In the latter, an editor asks an expert to sum up all of the information that is known about a particular topic. However, the expert is under no constraints regarding what he or she does, or does not, choose to include in the review. As a result, his or her bias can influence the final message. A systematic review, which may or may not be written by experts, typically asks a narrower question, and then answers it using the entirety of the medical literature. The systematic review process includes computer searches to identify the pertinent literature, a statement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for identified studies, a list of items of interest to extract from each study, a method to assess the quality of each study, a summary of the evidence that has been found (which may or may not involve attempts to combine data), a discussion of the evidence and the limitations of the conclusions, and suggestions for future research efforts. If the data are combined, that process is called meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, an estimate of the reliability of each study is made, and those that appear to be more reliable are weighed more heavily when the data are combined. While systematic reviews depend on a more preplanned method and thus, unlike narrative reviews, contain sections on method, they can be easily read once the reader becomes familiar with the vocabulary.

### Larger and more instructable language models become less reliable [^dafdb73e]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Benchmarks and factors of difficulty

For the generality of our analysis, we selected five distinct benchmarks to reduce confounding factors as much as possible: simple numeracy ('addition'), vocabulary reshuffle ('anagram'), geographical knowledge ('locality'), basic and advanced science questions ('science') and information-centric transformations ('transforms'). These represent core skills (numerical, linguistic and knowledge) and more diverse ecologically valid scenarios, with some of them having extremely simple formulations and others requiring deep understanding of the information presented, as well as the integration of data from multiple sources. Closed-ended questions are typical of LLM research, such as those found in the 'science' benchmark, but gradually more open-ended tasks ('addition', 'anagram', 'locality' and 'transforms') better represent a wider and more realistic use of LLMs.
Addition. This benchmark involves sums, prompting the LLMs by asking for the result of adding two addends (such as '3 + 7 = '). The examples in our analysis range from 1- to 100-digit additions. Because language models can not only memorize small additions but also generalize to cope with any combination of larger digits, this task is appropriate for analysing difficulty trends. With respect to the difficulty of 'addition', the number of digits and carry operations affect human performance on addition tasks.
Anagram. The use of anagrams as a way of assessing aspects of problem solving dates back to 1916 (ref.), and researchers have been using anagrams to examine a variety of phenomena, such as the cognitive processes involved in problem solving. An 'anagram' task is a word puzzle in which the participant or model is presented with a jumbled string of letters, and the objective is to find a word that can be formed using all the letters given. The examples in our analysis range from 3-letter words to 20-letter words. This task involves letter manipulation and good recall from an extensive vocabulary. One peculiar element of this task is that it is easy to verify. The difficulty of anagrams is mostly influenced by the frequency of the letters and the word, the number of letters and the degree of rearrangement required.
Locality. This benchmark contains questions relating to geographical knowledge, inspired by some cognitive models of distance estimation. The examples in our analysis ask questions about the location and size of cities in relation to each other, by giving an input city and a randomly generated distance (d, ranging from 1 to 1,000 km). The LLM is asked to identify the most populous city (the target city) in a radius of d km from the input city. This task requires geographical knowledge and reasoning. For this benchmark, potential human difficulty factors could be the city or country popularity, their population and so on.
Science. This benchmark integrates multiple-choice questions from basic science as collected by OpenBookQA, complemented with more advanced science questions from Google-proof Q&A (GPQA). They represent tasks that LLMs are likely to encounter in educational, academic and research settings, some of which require considerable time to solve. The included questions are Google-proof. The 'science' benchmark, thus, includes questions of varying levels of difficulty, as determined by human judgement, providing a lens through which to examine their handling of complex, data-rich tasks in specific domains.
Transforms. This benchmark includes a comprehensive set of information-centric transformation tasks based on real-world scenarios. It focuses on domains that are most prevalent in the use of LLMs today, and ensure that there is a ground truth for evaluation. We integrate not only many data-formatting tasks — a well-studied area in LLMs — but also new tasks about world knowledge, information retrieval, advertising, administration, coding, scheduling and retailing. The outputs for 'transforms' may require extensive elaboration of the input (hundreds of characters) to form a correct answer, which can also be hundreds of characters long. The aim was to simulate, as closely as possible, the complexity and depth of real-world questions in a controlled experimental setting. For task difficulty, given the heterogeneity, the main factors are as general as character and word counts, and the Levenshtein distance between input and output as a proxy of transformation effort.

### Music education for improving reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia [^f7b6fefa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dyslexia (or developmental dyslexia or specific reading disability) is a specific learning disorder that has a neurobiological origin. It is marked by difficulties with accurate or fluent recognition of words and poor spelling in people who have average or above average intelligence and these difficulties cannot be attributed to another cause, for example, poor vision, hearing difficulty, or lack of socio-environmental opportunities, motivation, or adequate instruction. Studies have correlated reading skills with musical abilities. It has been hypothesized that musical training may be able to remediate timing difficulties, improve pitch perception, or increase spatial awareness, thereby having a positive effect on skills needed in the development of language and literacy.

Objectives

To study the effectiveness of music education on reading skills (that is, oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and spelling) in children and adolescents with dyslexia.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases in June 2012: CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 4 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 22), CINAHL (searched 7 June 2012), LILACS (searched 7 June 2012), PsycINFO (1887 to May Week 5 2012), ERIC (searched 7 June 2012), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (1970 to 6 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Sciences and Humanities (1990 to 6 June 2012), and WorldCat (searched 7 June 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of studies. We did not apply any date or language limits.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials. We looked for studies that included at least one of our primary outcomes. The primary outcomes were related to the main domain of the reading: oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and spelling, measured through validated instruments. The secondary outcomes were self esteem and academic achievement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (HCM and RBA) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy to determine their eligibility. For our analysis we had planned to use mean difference for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals, and to use the random-effects statistical model when the effect estimates of two or more studies could be combined in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

We retrieved 851 references via the search strategy. No randomized controlled trials testing music education for the improvement of reading skills in children with dyslexia could be included in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence available from randomized controlled trials on which to base a judgment about the effectiveness of music education for the improvement of reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia. This uncertainty warrants further research via randomized controlled trials, involving a interdisciplinary team: musicians, hearing and speech therapists, psychologists, and physicians.

7 Method

7.1 Participants and Procedure

Participants (n = 1159) came from the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS), a prospective, longitudinal study following children (51.8% male) and their families beginning at 6 months of age. Families were recruited from health clinics in two southeast regions of Norway between 2006 and 2008. In Norway, child health clinics are public, free, and attended almost universally. Eligibility criteria included having a child who was 5 months old at the time of recruitment and at least one parent being proficient in Norwegian (i.e. did not require a translator). A comparison of BONDS families with population statistics for births in Norway during the same period showed that the sample was comparable to the Norwegian population with some exceptions: within BONDS, there was a higher percentage of mothers with a university or college degree (58%) compared to the general population (50%), more firstborn children (47% vs. 42%), fewer mothers from outside Europe (6% vs. 12%) and fewer single mothers (5% vs. 11%; see Nærde et al.for additional details). The BONDS study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Norwegian Social Sciences Data Services (approval numbers S‐06067; 2009/224a).

Assessments took place annually between child ages 12 to 48 months, in addition to an initial assessment when children were 6 months, in which both parents participated. Due to financial constraints and to reduce participant burden and dropouts, alternate parents (i.e. mothers or fathers) were targeted for annual assessments. Families were included in the present study if the mother had completed the 24‐month assessment (n = 881 mothers) and/or the father had completed the 36‐month assessment (n = 624 fathers), both of which included a series of parent–child interaction tasks from which observations of parental sensitivity were drawn. Although parents were encouraged to participate in all parts of the assessments, they were retained in the study even if they chose not to participate in the observational assessments at a given time point. Reasons for not participating could include not wanting to be observed, perceived burden related to bringing the child to the lab, or difficulties scheduling around work. Parents were compensated for their participation at each assessment, and children received a small gift following the test session.

### School readiness [^f9440518]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

School readiness — early academic competencies at kindergarten entry: In 1998, two-thirds recognized their letters and 29% recognized beginning sounds; 94% recognized single numerals and shapes and could count to 10, and 58% could count beyond 10, recognize sequence patterns, and use nonstandard units of length to compare objects. Of those children, 37% demonstrated strong print familiarity skills, and performance on math, reading, and general knowledge items increased with the level of their mothers' education and was higher for children from 2-parent families.

### Two-year-olds will name artifacts by their functions [^fce56aaf]. Child Development (2000). Low credibility.

Do young children take functional information into account in naming artifacts? In three studies of lexical categorization, 112 children 2 years of age learned new names for novel artifacts with novel functions and then extended the names to new objects. The objects were designed to have functions that were causally related in simple and compelling ways to perceptible aspects of their physical structure. Despite only minimal opportunity to familiarize themselves with the objects, children generalized the names in accordance with the objects' functions. This result obtained even when children had to discover the functions of the named objects on their own (Experiment 2) and when all the test objects had some discernible function (Experiment 3). Two-year-olds name by function when they can make sense of the relation between the appearances and the functions of artifacts.

Data collection and generation

We first describe how the examples were collected or generated, and then the 15 prompt templates that were used for each of them.
Addition. We randomly generate 5,000 instances, in which each addend is sampled uniformly from 1 to 100 digits. We then remove those instances for which f hrm > 50 to prevent instances with similar or identical numbers of digits in both addends from dominating the upper difficulty bins. This is because, for example, if the difficulty is the harmonic mean, the bins with f hrm > 90 would be dominated by instances in which both addends have very high numbers of digits (that is, at least 82 digits). A similar phenomenon also occurs with other difficulty levels, but with the previous criterion considered, the problem is well mitigated. This results in a final sample of 3,142 instances.
Anagram. We use the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus, containing the frequency of more than 300,000 most commonly used single words on the Web in English. From this corpus, we randomly choose up to 100 English words with 3–20 letters, resulting in a total of 1,570 words. There are fewer than 1,800 instances because there are fewer than 100 English words with 17–20 letters. Then, we shuffle the order of letters randomly to map these words into 1,570 anagrams. We make sure the resultant permutation is not the same as the original word.
Locality. We use the World Cities Database, which provides an up-to-date database of the cities and towns globally. From this database, we first exclude cities with non-unique names across the globe. Next, we remove cities with more than one word or non-standard letters in the 26-character Latin alphabet (for example, Buenos Aires or Chŏngjin) to enhance the quality and ease of the response-scoring method. After the previous selection procedure, we seek to form a final sample that covers instances with different difficulty levels (or bins) as equally as possible. Thus, we perform binning on the difficulty function (f pop) to produce 100 bins in which we extract up to 50 instances from each bin randomly, resulting in a total of 2,341 instances. Again, there are fewer than 5,000 instances because some bins contain fewer than 50 instances.
Science. This benchmark is built by integrating multiple-choice questions from educational settings: OpenBookQAand GPQA. OpenBookQA is a collection of multiple-choice questions in basic science, based on 1,329 established facts. We randomly sampled 1,000 questions from OpenBookQA. To complement the benchmark with more advanced science questions, we included GPQA — a dataset containing 546 graduate-level questions written by domain experts that challenge LLMs to demonstrate a deep understanding of biology, physics and chemistry. We exclude two lengthy questions that exceed the context window limit for some of the models that we analyse.
Transforms. This benchmark includes a comprehensive set of information-centric transformation tasks based on real-world scenarios. We integrate many data-formatting questions from a data-wrangling datasetand from a 'natural instructions' dataset, manually regenerating or adapting some of them. We also also introduce new tasks about world knowledge, information retrieval, advertising, administration, coding, scheduling and retailing, reflecting a wide range of real user interactions with language models. The benchmark integrates 73 different tasks, with 10 instances each, totalling 730 items.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^3ff543f0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Health literacy — developing written materials for patients — Develop written materials, keep the messages simple, and limit the number of messages (the general guideline is four main messages). Focus on action with specific recommendations based on behavior (eg, "Take a warm-water bath two times a day"). Use the active voice instead of the passive voice, use familiar language and avoid jargon, and use visual aids, such as drawings or models, for key points. Use at least a 12-point type size to make the messages easy to read and leave plenty of white space around margins and between sections.

### Symbolic metaprogram search improves learning efficiency and explains rule learning in humans [^4aa0b5e1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Each observation identifies a simple pattern produced by aligning shared structure in the data. Putting them together leads to the rule: elements 3, 2, 1, the number 4, then elements 5 and 7. While this rule explains the data, it seems unusual. We can nevertheless model it as the program:It again uses λ to create a function binding xs, (λ xs.). Working from the inside out in the remaining expression, (take 7 xs) takes the first seven elements, (cut 6.) removes the sixth, (replace 4 4.) replaces the fourth with a 4, and (swap 3 1.) swaps the first and third. Composing a few simple operations represents an unlikely concept that can still be learned from sparse data.

Like other classic domains such as numerical functions – and Boolean functions, list functions might superficially seem abstract and focused on a narrow corner of human cognition, but they are well suited to empirical study and modeling of how people learn rules. Numbers and sequences both have a long and productive history in the study of human learning. List functions are in fact particularly useful for testing the sorts of program-learning models of concept learning which have now been deployed to explain rule-learning in dozens of domains. They provide a general and well-controlled setting where problems vary widely in difficulty and algorithmic content (the domain is Turing-universal) and can be tested easily in humans and machines. Indeed, many bear a strong resemblance to everyday tasks such as sifting out junk mail (filtering); counting the books on a shelf (folding separate items into a composite result); alphabetizing a list of names (sorting by a criteria); and decorating a tray of cupcakes (mapping a transformation over a collection of items). Being analogous, however, does not mean that we claim that the tasks are equivalent. In more naturalistic cases, it seems likely that context-specific knowledge effectsaid learning, but our results (including the replication described in Supplemental Note 8) show that in this domain, as in many others, people can rapidly acquire and apply rules from sparse data. Human performance on our task in particular is far above chance and remains interesting in its own right.

Step 3: Familiarize yourself with the ML methods used. The next step is to understand the ML methods that the authors have used to solve the problem. Many papers will provide a brief overview of the methods used (in clinical or applied journals), but it is important to have a good understanding of the underlying concepts. It is critical to familiarize yourself with some of these terminologies presented in Table 1. There are many papers that explain these terminologies in a very simple manner. It is also important to understand the key issues in building ML (Figure 1) models and what the authors did to address these at each step.

Table 1.
ML terminologies

Figure 1.
Steps to build a machine learning model. Problem formulation: The first step is to clearly define the problem that you want to solve. This involves defining the inputs and outputs of your model, as well as the type of problem you are trying to solve (classification, regression, clustering, etc). It is important to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve before you start building a model. Data collection: Once you have formulated the problem, the next step is to collect the relevant data. This may involve scraping data from websites, downloading data sets from public repositories, or collecting data through surveys or experiments. It is important to collect enough data to train your model and validate its performance. Data preparation: After collecting the data, you will need to clean and preprocess it. This involves removing any irrelevant data, dealing with missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for ML algorithms. It also includes dividing the data set into training, validation, and test cohorts. This step can take a lot of time and effort, but it is essential for building an accurate and effective model. Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming the input variables (features) in a way that will improve the performance of the model. This may involve selecting the most relevant features, transforming them into a different representation (eg, using one-hot encoding), or creating new features based on existing ones. Feature engineering can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Model selection: Once you have prepared the data and engineered the features, the next step is to select a suitable ML algorithm. This involves choosing the type of algorithm (eg, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines) and the specific parameters of the algorithm. This step requires some knowledge of ML and experience with different algorithms. Model training: After selecting the algorithm, the next step is to train the model on the prepared data. This involves feeding the input data into the algorithm and adjusting the model parameters to optimize its performance. This step can take a lot of time and computational resources, especially for large data sets and complex models. Model evaluation: Once the model has been trained, the next step is to evaluate its performance on a separate test set of data. This involves measuring metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the performance of the model. It is important to test the model on data that it has not seen before to ensure that it can be generalized to new data. Model optimization: If the model performance is not satisfactory, then the next step is to optimize the model. This involves tweaking the model parameters, changing the algorithm, or modifying the feature engineering process to improve the model's performance. This step may require several iterations until the desired level of performance is achieved. Model deployment: Once you have built a satisfactory model, the final step is to deploy it in a production environment. This may involve integrating the model into a web application, creating an application programming interface for other developers to use, or deploying it as a stand-alone application. It is important to ensure that the model is well documented and tested thoroughly before it is deployed.

### Abstract representations of events arise from mental errors in learning and memory [^3228f378]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

At the beginning of each experiment, subjects were provided with the following instructions: "In a few minutes, you will see five squares shown on the screen, which will light up as the experiment progresses. These squares correspond with keys on your keyboard, and your job is to watch the squares and press the corresponding key when that square lights up". For the 72 subjects that responded to both the modular and lattice graphs in the first experiment, an additional piece of information was also provided: "This part will take around 30 minutes, followed by a similar task which will take another 30 minutes". Before each experiment began, subjects were given a short quiz to verify that they had read and understood the instructions. If any questions were answered incorrectly, subjects were shown the instructions again and asked to repeat the quiz until they answered all questions correctly. Next, all subjects were shown a 10-trial segment that did not count towards their performance; this segment also displayed text on the screen explicitly telling the subject which keys to press on their keyboard. Subjects then began their 1500-trial experiment. For the subjects that responded to both the modular and lattice graphs, a brief reminder was presented before the second graph, but no new instructions were given. After completing each experiment, subjects were presented with performance information and their bonus earned, as well as the option to provide feedback.

### Development and evaluation of prompts for a large language model to screen titles and abstracts in a living systematic review [^36f2523d]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

At the outset of this work, we did not know how much data would be needed to develop and refine the prompts. For supervised machine learning, it is usual to take most of the records (80–90%) for training the model, leaving a much smaller subset for testing. A potential benefit of using the LLM is that a new model does not need to be built, and a much smaller proportion of the data is used for developing prompts. This potentially leaves a much larger proportion of available data to be used to test prompt performance.

We therefore developed a workflow to incrementally develop and test prompts before final testing (see figure 1). To begin with, all bibliographic records were considered part of the 'test' dataset, which was reserved to test prompt performance. Data to develop and refine prompts were removed at random from the test dataset and placed in the 'development' dataset — and not replaced. After an initial batch of 45 records for initial experimentation, these records were removed in batches of 200. In the first batch of 200, we oversampled from records that had been 'included' at the title and abstract stage by humans, as the prevalence of relevant records was low, and we needed to develop prompts that found them reliably. We therefore randomly selected 50 relevant records and 150 irrelevant ones in the first batch of 200. Thereafter, we sampled at random, yielding a 'relevant' prevalence rate of 17%.

Cognitive Outcome Measures

Four cognitive measures were collected at Wave 6:

1) Orientation in time: a four-point measure assessing knowledge about the day of the week and the date (day, month, and year). Each question received a binary score (correct/incorrect) and the total score spanned between 0 and 4;
2) Verbal long-term memory — learning: the Word list learning test developed by the United States-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS;) was used by presenting orally a list of 10 words to participants and then asking them to recall as many items as possible immediately after the reading (immediate recall, score 0–10);
3) Verbal long-term memory — retrieval: approximately after 5 min, during which participants completed other tasks, they were asked to recollect as many words as they could from the original list (delayed recall, score 0–10);
4) Fluid intelligence: assessed by means of the Number Series test, a test developed to investigate quantitative reasoning in the HRS. In each trial, participants are given a series of numbers with one missing and to be identified based on the numerical pattern of the series. All participants complete a first block including three series of increasing difficulty. Subsequently, each participant is asked to complete another block (of three series) characterized by a level of difficulty calibrated based on the score obtained in the first block (0–3). The final score spanned between 0 and 15.

Word pair learning

Participants performed three rounds of word pair learning. During each of the first two rounds, all 60 pairs were presented on the screen in randomized order, with the text written in capital letters. Each pair appeared for 4 s with a 2 s ISI. For each pair, the cue word was presented on the left and the target word on the right. During the first round, participants were asked to make a judgement about how related the cue and the target word pairs were on a scale of 1−4, with 1 meaning "not related" and 4 meaning "very related". The second round was structured the same as the first, but participants were asked to judge how likely it would be for those two words to appear on the same page of a book or magazine on a scale of 1–4, with 1 meaning "not at all likely" and 4 meaning "very likely". These judgements allowed for incidental encoding and encouraged the relational processing of the words in each pair. Relatedness judgements are described in Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1.

In the final learning round, 30 of the pairs underwent retrieval practice (testing) and the other 30 were restudied. Participants were instructed that if they saw the cue and target words together (just as they had in the prior two rounds) their task was simply to type the target word into the answer box; if they saw the cue word accompanied by four question marks ("?") their task was to attempt to recall the target word and type it into the answer box. If they could not remember the target word, participants were encouraged to take a guess, or they could leave the box blank. Asking participants to type the paired words in the restudy condition, rather than having them make an additional relatedness judgement as in the first two learning rounds, allowed us to match the behavioral response with that of the testing condition (i.e. typing a word). This also served to reduce the differences between behavioral responses in the restudy condition and the final test, where all pairs would be probed by asking the participant to type a word. The learning condition manipulation was randomly interleaved; although this interleaved design necessitates task switching within the learning opportunity block, there was no statistically significant difference in final recall accuracy between trials where the participant switched between testing and restudying and those where learning condition was consistent across consecutive trials (see Supplementary Note 1 for more detail).

Health literacy definition and determinants — Health literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services they need to make appropriate health decisions". In general literacy is described as having "three components: 1) print literacy (writing and reading), 2) oral literacy (listening and speaking), and 3) numeracy (using and understanding numbers)". The abstract notes multiple contributors to understanding, including "cultural factors, a physician's health knowledge and communication skills, the demands of the situation, the environment in which the health information is being conveyed, and time constraints".

### Generative artificial intelligence, patient safety and healthcare quality: a review [^4481b285]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

It is easy to understand how a regression model can quantify the relationship between two numbers (it is just math), but how does that work with words? It turns out that is also just math. These models operate in something called an embedding space. Getting an intuition for what this means can really help understand how these models work. A pivotal paper, typically referred to as word2vec ('word to vector'), helped propel language modelling forward. Imagine the following: take a large set of documents and chop them up into individual words. Randomly put those words into a space. Let us imagine for a minute that it is a three-dimensional space, even though in the paper, they used a few hundred dimensions. Each word would be represented by only three numbers: X, Y and Z, the coordinates of where it is in the space. Next, we are going to do a prediction task like the one shown in figure 1A. But every time we see a word, we are going to substitute in its three numbers (X, Y and Z), and we will try to predict the next word's three numbers from what we have got so far (or maybe we will try to guess two words in the future, or three in the past, etc). When we start, almost all of our predictions are going to be spectacularly inaccurate, because we started with the words in a random location. So, whenever we miss, we will move our words around (changing their X, Y and Z values as we do) and see if our predictions will get a little better. Then we will repeat that again and again, until we stop seeing improvement in the prediction. In the end, we will be left with our words in an embedding space, and each word's position will be determined by the semantic structure of the documents that the model trained on. Each word is defined by its set of numbers (X, Y and Z in our example), and this makes it possible to do math on words.

### Prescribing assistive technology: focus on children with complex communication needs: clinical report [^8b48d26e]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Assistive technology for children with complex communication needs — speech-generating devices (SGDs) and symbol/vocabulary displays are described, including device levels and design features. SGDs produce voice output by using either digitized recordings of natural speech or the creation of synthesized speech, and high-tech devices usually feature a dynamic display that changes with input so that many levels of symbols, words, or lengthy messages can be stored for quicker retrieval, which improves both the variety of potential vocabulary items and independence in communication. Symbols are displayed in categories (emotions, objects, actions, people, concepts) and can appear as words, drawings, or photographs. The needs of the child should dictate the features necessary for system and vocabulary recommendations. With these devices, the user selects a symbol, triggering changes in the set of symbols displayed; symbols are typically placed in a grid, with size and number dependent on visual abilities, communication and cognitive skills, and motor control after a comprehensive augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) evaluation. Visual scene displays (VSDs) have emerged; rather than a single symbol, a VSD can represent a natural life event, can be static or dynamic through preprogrammed videos, and may require programming by a familiar communication partner or professional. A figure notes that mid-tech spoken word devices allow the user to select from a limited set of options, whereas high-tech devices have a dynamic display and be upgradable to allow new words and more complex sentences, and that single-use AAC devices and tablet applications are commercially available.

Analysis plan

The data from paper coding sheets were input into a spreadsheet by trained coders. This included demographic information, trial information (e.g. trial number, word used, experiment structure), and the structures participants built and their responses to the experimenter's questions. The participant structures were drawn or explained on the sheet, and we quantified them with the total number of blocks, and the maximum number of blocks in the X, Y, and Z‐dimensions. The dimensions were defined with respect to the participant and are depicted in Figure 1c. The X‐dimension was the axis parallel to the tabletop and the participant (e.g. four blocks lined up in a row from left to right is four blocks in the X‐dimension). The Y‐dimension was defined as height (e.g. four blocks stacked on top of each other in a column is four blocks in the Y‐dimension). The Z‐dimension was defined as parallel to the tabletop, but perpendicular to the X‐dimension along the table (e.g. four blocks lined up in a flat row going away from the participant is four blocks in the Z‐dimension). Because we used comparative words, their meaning is defined with respect to a baseline reference (i.e. the structure built by Experimenter 1). Thus, we also described the participant's structure with reference to how each dimension differed from that baseline structure (i.e. whether the participant's structure decreased, did not change, or increased in each dimension). The initial baseline structure was either Long (four blocks lined up in a row; 4 blocks in the X‐dimension, 1 block in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension) or Tall (1 block in the X‐dimension, 4 blocks in the Y‐dimension, and 1 block in the Z‐dimension; see Figure 1). Most trials (89% of the final dataset) consisted of shapes that were easy to define in terms of the number of blocks in each dimension (e.g. a series of blocks lined up in a horizontal row; a series of blocks stacked in a single column). In the remaining cases, children built more creative structures (e.g. a row of blocks horizontal with an extra column of more vertical blocks at the end; pyramids). Each trial was coded independently by at least two research assistants to ensure proper data entry and agreements of interpretation of the number of blocks in each dimension. Trials where there was uncertainty about the structure were excluded.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^75c9a882]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patient–physician communication — system actions and clinician practices — Much of the available patient-centered education materials are written at a level of literacy above what would be expected for many adults, and tools and methods accessible to all patients, including those with limited health literacy, should be developed to disseminate health-related information. Personnel at all tiers of the medical system and in all settings where patients interact with that system must learn to communicate with patients in a way that takes into account each individual's unique circumstances and abilities for comprehending health-related information, and understanding the unique capabilities and limitations inherent to each patient will make the information provided more accessible. It probably is most beneficial to tailor oral methods of communication with the assumption of low or limited literacy, each member of the medical team should be equipped with the appropriate training and resources to guide every patient through the health care system with appropriate resources to determine that the patient actually comprehends the information, and interpreters should be used for patients who do not speak fluent English or who prefer to communicate in another language.

Bogstaveprøve 2 ['Letter test 2']

This test has been widely used in the Danish school system. The test consists of two subtests assessing simple letter-sound knowledge and vowel identification, respectively. For the purpose of the present study, only the first subtest will be administered to assess standard letter-sound knowledge. The subtest will be administered strictly according to the manufacture's description. The subtest consists of 20 items (preceded by two practice items). Each item consists of a picture followed by five letters. The participants will be instructed to identify the first letter of the word illustrated by the picture. The word is read aloud by the instructor. Participants will be told to use a red pencil to mark the letters and use a blue pencil to mark if a mistake is made. The score is the number of items correct.

Ordlæseprøve 1 ['Word reading test 1']

As for letter test 2, this test is widely used in the Danish school system and will be administered strictly according to the manufacture's description. The test consists of 78 items (preceded by two practice items) and evaluates word reading accuracy as well as efficiency. In each item participants have to select one of four pictures that corresponds to a printed word. Words increase in length from two to four letters. Participants solve as many items as possible within a time limit of 4 min. Every minute children will be asked to change pencil color in order to monitor their progression throughout the test. The score is the number of correctly solved items (efficiency) and percentage of correctly solved items (accuracy).

Knowledge of trained letter-sound correspondences

To evaluate the children's knowledge about letter-sound correspondences trained in the intervention and control period, a simple multiple-choice test has been constructed. The test consists of 15 trials. In each trial, a sound corresponding to a standard or a conditional pronunciation of a letter is said out loud by the assessor. Children are instructed to identify the correct letter matching the sound from a row of four letters. Before the test trials, children will be provided with one practice trial. The 15 sounds represent both standard and conditional pronunciations of the letters a, e, o, r, u and v (Table 2). Results are numbers of correct letter-sound correspondences.

2.3.2 Search

The Self‐Ordered Search task assesses visuospatial working memory (Owen, Downes, Sahakian, Polkey, & Robbins). A set of squares in random positions within an invisible five‐by‐five grid is displayed on the screen. Participants click on squares, which "open" to reveal whether there is a "token" inside. After a token is found, it is hidden within another square, and the participant must locate it again. Within any trial, a square will never be used to hide a token more than once and the number of tokens that must be found in each trial equals the number of squares in that trial. Participants must avoid squares in which they have already discovered a token and squares they have already searched while looking for the current token. If they re‐click a previously discovered or searched square the trial ends and the next trial begins with one less square in the grid. If they find all tokens without making an error, a new trial begins with one extra square in the grid. The round begins with four squares and ends after three errors have been made. Their final score is equal to the maximum level they achieved. As this task is not timed, the number of runs completed during a 30‐min period depended on participant performance.

2.3.3 Grammatical Reasoning

Grammatical Reasoning is based on Alan Baddeley's 3‐min grammatical reasoning test (Baddeley,) and assesses verbal reasoning. On each trial, a written statement regarding two shapes is displayed on the screen, and the participant must indicate whether it correctly describes the shapes pictured below. The participant has 90 s to complete as many trials as possible. A correct response increases the total score by one point, and an incorrect response decreases the score by one point.

2.3.4 Spatial Span

Spatial Span is based on the Corsi Block Tapping Task — a tool for measuring spatial short‐term memory capacity. Sixteen purple boxes are displayed in a grid. A sequence of randomly selected boxes turn green one at a time (900 ms per green square). Participants must then repeat the sequence by clicking boxes in the same order. Difficulty is varied dynamically: correct responses increase the length of the next sequence by one square, and an incorrect response decreases the sequence length. The test finishes after three errors. The score is the length of the longest sequence successfully remembered.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^c0ef243e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

The role of the obstetrician–gynecologist in addressing health literacy — Tailor speaking and listening skills to individual patients, speak slowly and clearly, repeat vital information, and organize information into two or three short components. Ask open-ended questions using the words "what" or "how" to start the sentence and use medically trained interpreters when necessary. Check for comprehension by asking patients to restate the health information in their own words. Tailor health information to the intended user and, when developing health information, make sure it reflects the target group's age, social and cultural diversity, language, and literacy skills. Because of the potential effect of health literacy on patient outcomes, obstetrician–gynecologists should take the appropriate steps to ensure that they communicate in an understandable manner so patients can make informed decisions about their health care.

### Reorganizing the lexicon by learning a new word: Japanese children's interpretation of the meaning of a new word for a familiar artifact [^df0774aa]. Child Development (2002). Low credibility.

This research investigated how children interpret the meaning of a new word associated with a familiar artifact. The existing literature has shown that syntactic form-class information plays an important role in making this kind of inference. However, this information is not available to Japanese children, because Japanese language does not have a grammatical distinction between count nouns and mass nouns, proper nouns and common nouns, or singular and plural. In Study 1, 12 three-year-old monolingual Japanese children were tested to examine whether they interpreted a new noun associated with a familiar artifact to be a material name or a new label for the object. They interpreted the new word as a new category label for the object, rather than as a name for the material. How children related the new category to the old familiar one was then examined in Studies 2 and 3. The results of Study 2, in which 24 three-year-olds participated, showed that children could flexibly shift between two interpretations using shape information. When the named object had a typical shape for the familiar category, they mapped the new word to a subordinate category. In contrast, when the shape of the named object was atypical, they mapped the new word to a new category that was mutually exclusive to the familiar category by excluding the named object from the familiar category. In Study 3, 12 three-year-olds were tested to examine relative importance of shape and functional information in this inference process. The results of the three studies suggest that children flexibly recruit clues from multiple sources, but the cluesare weighed in hierarchical order so that they can determine the single most plausible solution in a given situation when different clues suggest different solutions.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^9901601f]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Health literacy and asthma — impact and mitigation notes increasing recognition of the impact of low health literacy on health outcomes, including in asthma, defines health literacy as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, and states that low health literacy is associated with reduced knowledge and worse asthma control; in one study, low numeracy among parents of children with asthma was associated with higher risk of exacerbations, and interventions adapted for cultural and ethnicity perspectives have been associated with improved knowledge and significant improvements in inhaler technique; suggested ways to reduce the impact of low health literacy include ordering information from most to least important, speaking slowly and using simple words, simplifying numeric concepts, framing instructions effectively, confirming understanding using the 'teach-back' method, asking a second person to repeat the main messages, paying attention to non-verbal communication by the patient, and making patients feel comfortable about asking questions.

### Selecting appropriate toys for young children in the digital era [^835d140f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Electronic media exposure and play with toys — prevalence and developmental impacts include that "A 2013 study revealed that 38% of US children younger than 2 years and 80% of 2 to 4 year-old children11,46 have used a mobile electronic media device; this has more than doubled when compared with data collected in 2011.4,11,32" and "More recent data presented in 2015 suggests that 96.9% of children have used mobile devices, and most started using them before 1 year of age.47" The increase in screen time "has taken place in association with a decrease in play, including both active play and play with toys", and "screen time directly interferes with both play activities and parent-child interactions", with "even educational media… typically watched without caregiver input". Virtual toys "are increasingly designed to emulate and even replace physical toys", which "potentially increases known risks of electronic media exposure, such as the promotion of aggressive behavior49 and obesity.50" The page states "there is presently no evidence to suggest that possible benefits of interactive media match those of active, creative, hands-on, and pretend play with more traditional toys", and reports that during play with electronic toys "there were fewer adult words, fewer conversational turns, fewer parental responses, and fewer productions of content-specific words than during play with traditional toys or books".

### Extracting accurate materials data from research papers with conversational language models and prompt engineering [^66b29262]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Stage (A) is the first prompt given to the model. This first prompt is meant to provide information whether the sentence is relevant at all for further analysis, i.e. whether it contains the data for the property in question (value and units). This classification is crucial because, even in papers that have been extracted to be relevant by an initial keyword search, the ratio of relevant to irrelevant sentences is typically about 1:100. Therefore elimination of irrelevant sentences is a priority in the first step. Then, before starting Stage (B), we expand the text on which we are operating to a passage consisting of three sentences: the paper's title, the sentence preceding the positively classified sentence from the previous prompt, and the positive sentence itself. This expansion is primarily useful for making sure we include text with the material's name, which is sometimes not in the sentence targeted in Stage (A) but is most of the time in the preceding sentence or title. While in some cases the text passage built this way may not contain all the information to produce a complete datapoint, for example if the materials name is mentioned earlier in the text or in a subsection where samples are described, we found this to be a relatively rare occurrence. While technically expanding the passage to ensure extraction of complete datapoints is possible, we found that operating on as short of a text passage as possible results in the most accurate extraction, and the small gain in recall from expanding the text passage was not worth the cost of loss of precision of overall extraction. That said, tuning of the text selection approach to different LLMs and/or target properties could likely achieve improvements in some cases.

### The reliability and clinical validation of automatically-derived verbal memory features of the verbal learning test in early diagnostics of cognitive impairment [^50556f5f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The current study evaluated the reliability and clinical validity of ASR technology compared with the clinical scoring of the 15-VLT in a memory clinic setting. Our results show that the ASR of the commonly used total immediate recall and delayed recall were comparable to the clinical retrieved scores with good reliability (based on) for total immediate recall and excellent reliability for delayed recall. The higher ICC of the delayed recall can be explained by the difference in range between both measures (total immediate recall 0–75 versus delayed recall 0–15 words), resulting in a lower probability of error in the delayed recall. Note that we have to take the wide confidence intervals into account which indicates that further investigation is warranted and that current results should be optimized for individual diagnostic purposes. Our results showed that in 9.5% of participants, the ASR missed more than 14 words in the total immediate recall, and in 5% of participants, the ASR missed more than 4 words in the delayed recall. Looking into those cases in more detail, we determined that words were missed by the ASR when participants recalled words very quickly and without pauses between words, or spoke very quietly. In a posthoc analysis, we analyzed how many words were mentioned in the first 10 seconds of each of the 5 immediate trials. We found that about half of the recalled words were mentioned in the first 10 seconds. Interestingly, looking at the ICC for each immediate recall trial and group individually, we saw that the ICCs per trial for the group with MCI/dementia stayed quite stable compared to the group with SCD, for which trial 1 starts with a high ICC but declines to a lower ICC for all the residual trials (See Supplementary Table 2 for post-hoc results). Thus, by increasing the total number of recalled words with each trial and listing them quickly after the start of the recall phase, we see that the ICC decreases with each subsequent trial. In general, this could indicate that the ICC depends on the number of words recalled: the higher the word count the lower the ICC. Accordingly, we reason that participants who are instructed to recall words find it easier to recall them as quickly as possible so as not to forget words, possibly resulting in mumbling and recalling words without pausing in between. Additionally, some individuals might enumerate some words not intended to increase their total word count, but rather to invoice the order of words they learned, i.e. a learning efficiency strategy related to attention and learning. The ASR might see these as repetitions when in reality they were not. In general, we expected that these effects interfere more with the ASR in the SCD group, which is confirmed by a lower ICC for the SCD group compared to the MCI/dementia group. However, these noise effects may be less applicable to delayed recall. Delayed recall is characterized as a measure of consolidation, thus reducing immediate recall strategies. To improve and mitigate such limitations of the ASR technology in the future, recall instructions should be optimized to emphasize that participants should speak clearly and separate recall words with small pauses in-between. Note that this in itself might be challenging by interfering with recall strategies, especially in individuals with cognitive impairment.

### Emotional quality of early education programs improves language learning: a within-child across context design [^0c369b4c]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Effect of changes in emotional support on (a) verbal comprehension and (b) understanding directions given the average level of emotional support across the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Regions of significance, where dependent on average emotional support changes in emotional support have a significant influence on the outcome, are indicated by grey rectangle. Dashed line indicates two standard deviations above and below average change in emotional support. Density plot at top of figure is the distribution of changes in emotional support from 100 imputed data sets

Figure 2b presents the interaction effect for understanding directions. The effect was statistically reliable when CLASS‐ES increased by 0.84 (within two standard deviations), but the contrasting average groups (average less than 4.65 or greater than 5.83) were only informed by 0.59% and 0.35%, of observations, respectively. Likewise, the left side of the interaction was statistically reliable when CLASS‐ES declined by −0.91 (within two standard deviations), but only informed by 2.33% and 2.54%, of observations, respectively. Thus, given the seemingly sporadic contrasting interaction shape and small number of observations we considered this interaction unreliable.

Supplementary analysis: Categorical thresholds

Re‐estimating step 3 models with categorical cut‐points for CLASS supported the results from continuous models. Specifically, when children changed from rooms in the lowest 25th percentile of emotional support to those above the 75th there was an increase in verbal comprehension (β = 1.25 [95% CI: 0.33–2.16]). This reflects a threshold of 5.88, above which emotional support influenced verbal comprehension. This is higher than the 5.26 revealed in step 4, highlighting that the continuous interaction revealed thresholds with more nuance. There were also increases in concept formation when instructional support went to the 25th to 50th percentile (β = 1.25 [95% CI: 0.33–2.16]), and increases in verbal comprehension when classroom organization went up to the 25th to 50th percentile (β = 1.25 [95% CI: 0.33–2.16]), however, as these cut‐points were not along an increasing continuum of effects (e.g. unreliable for children with quality > 75th percentile) it suggests they are sporadic. See Table S31 for distribution of categorical coding, Table S32 for key results, and Tables S33–S47 for full model results.

### Literacy promotion: an essential component of primary care pediatric practice: technical report [^1da6005f]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Enhancing shared reading quality: dialogic reading — Dialogic reading is described as an approach for preschool-aged children that enhances parent–child verbal and social-emotional interaction using structured prompts, with testing across various book types including wordless books, and with reported benefits spanning language, phonological awareness, comprehension, narrative, attention, socio-emotional skills, and relational factors. It involves specific types of verbal prompts and responses represented by PEER/CROWD (Table 13). Cited benefits include caregiver-child bonding and interest in reading and enjoyment, and these accrue in a dose-dependent fashion and are also seen at younger ages and for those at risk for reading difficulties.

### Preschool children's mapping of number words to nonsymbolic numerosities [^72dde74c]. Child Development (2005). Low credibility.

Five-year-old children categorized as skilled versus unskilled counters were given verbal estimation and number word comprehension tasks with numerosities 20–120. Skilled counters showed a linear relation between number words and nonsymbolic numerosities. Unskilled counters showed the same linear relation for smaller numbers to which they could count, but not for larger number words. Further tasks indicated that unskilled counters failed even to correctly order large number words differing by a 2: 1 ratio, whereas they performed well on this task with smaller numbers, and performed well on a nonsymbolic ordering task with the same numerosities. These findings provide evidence that large, approximate numerosity representations become linked to number words around the time that children learn to count to those words reliably.

### Effect of digital game intervention on cognitive functions in older adults: a multiple baseline single case experimental design study [^05d05fc0]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measure

The Brain Assessment instrument was used to assess specific and global cognitive functions. Brain Assessment consisted of five subsets, as follows. (1) Memory of numbers: participants were instructed to memorize numbers consisting of three to nine digits, and repeat them using the numeric keypad in ascending and descending order. (2) Memory of words: participants were instructed to memorize five target words. After a short distraction task, 10 words, half of which belong to the target word, were presented in turn. Participants reported whether each word was included in the target word. (3) Mental rotation test (MRT) to assess visuospatial ability: a target block diagram was displayed. One of the four rotated choices was different from the target. Participants chose which option was different. (4) N-back test to assess working memory: a series of numbers appeared, and participants performed the addition of the present and some antecedent numbers. (5) Judgment task: participants were instructed to identify changes in the presented Figs. 2 and 3. Cognitive scores were calculated for each subset and total of each subset, allowing the state of the participant's cognitive status to be assessed. Cognitive score is calculated as (raw score) – (mean of the raw score)/(standard deviation of the raw score) × 10 + 50. Higher cognitive score indicates higher cognitive function (by the same age and sex [mean and standard deviation are based on data from 5,000 subjects]). The validity and reliability of this measure have been confirmed. The time required for each item was 2 min (a total of 10 min for five items), and the target age group was 40–90 years old. Each task is randomly assigned, and the results are not fed back, so the effect of learning through repetition is minimal. Each participant underwent the Brain Assessment individually using a tablet connected to the Internet. Assessments were conducted at the same time each week. During the study period, the survey was conducted approximately once a week from the time of participant selection to the end of follow-up (16 times in total). The total cognitive score in the Brain Assessment indicated global cognitive function, and was determined by the results of each cognitive score (five subsets) in the Brain Assessment. Therefore, the primary outcome of the intervention was assumed to be the cognitive score for each subset in the Brain Assessment, and the secondary outcome was assumed to be the total cognitive score in the Brain Assessment.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Symbolic metaprogram search improves learning efficiency and explains rule learning in humans [^9e0f937c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Experimental procedure

We report the results of a behavioral experiment involving human participants. Our procedure complies with all relevant ethical regulations and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where the study was conducted. Participants provided informed consent and received a flat fee of $7.50 for participating plus a $0.01 bonus for each correct response. This study was not preregistered.

Supplementary Fig. 1 shows a representative display from the behavioral paradigm. Participants agreed to play a guessing game with the computer and began by reviewing the game's instructions. After a short comprehension check, participants completed 110 trials — 10 rounds of 11 trials each, with the current round clearly indicated onscreen. In each round, the computer selected one of the 250 list functions as a rule for transforming input lists into output lists. Functions were selected uniformly at random for each participant; neither the experimenter nor the participant knew the functions being tested at the time of the experiment. Each function took a list of natural numbers as input and returned a list of natural numbers as output. Lists could include the numbers 0–99 as elements and contain 0–15 elements. To help participants learn the rule, the computer presented a series of trials. To begin each trial, the computer would show a novel input list and ask the participant to predict the output associated with the input by typing their predicted response into the text box. Participants were told that their job was to guess the rule and use it to correctly respond to as many of the computer's queries as possible. Participants were required to type in the entire list and had to do so without typos for their response to be considered correct. After each prediction, the computer revealed the correct output, ending the trial. The input, output, and participant prediction remained on screen for the rest of the experiment to reduce working memory load; participants could review it on any future trial, including those in subsequent rounds. The paradigm thus encouraged online learning in an attempt to reduce long-term memory demand and more accurately measure trial-by-trial generalization. Progress indicators at the bottom of the screen informed participants of their performance and the number of remaining trials. At the end of each round, the computer asked participants to enter a natural language description of the rule they thought the computer had been using. The experiment ended with a brief demographical survey. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications.

### Auditory-motor adaptation and de-adaptation for speech depend more on time in the new environment than on the amount of practice [^0fcdfd5a]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sensorimotor adaptation is critical for learning and refining voluntary movements. One common assumption is that the number of practice trials fully determines the amount of adaptation. It is possible, however, that for some tasks the sensorimotor system continues to learn during the time in-between executed movements as long as there is no evidence that the environment has changed. The amount of time spent in the altered environment (total exposure time) then would be more important than the number of practice movements performed during that time. In the current study, we investigated adaptation and de-adaptation as a function of practice trials versus exposure time using speech articulation as the model system. Four separate groups of 14 participants read out loud monosyllabic words at a rate of either 18 words per minute or only 6 words per minute during the adaptation and de-adaptation phases of a speaking task with formant-shifted auditory feedback. The data demonstrate that both auditory-motor adaptation and de-adaptation depend more on exposure time than amount of practice. COIN model simulations suggest that this common effect is consistent with de-adaptation constituting active re-learning of the unaltered environment rather than forgetting of the learned behavior.

### Cognitive performance in dialysis patients-"when is the right time to test? " [^c099248e]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

RBANS

The RBANS is a brief, individually-administered test measuring cognitive function across five domains: attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Performance in each domain is measured by the subtests (12 in total) described below, which are combined to yield five scaled "index scores" gauging function in the respective domains. These five index scores are in turn combined to yield a composite score referred to as the "total scale score". Stimuli are contained in a wire-bound, easel-type booklet, making the test easily portable and allowing for bedside administration. Total administration time is 20–30 min. Normative information from the manual for the index and total scores is based on 540 healthy adults who ranged in age from 20 to 89 years.

The battery was designed to be amenable to the construction of multiple equivalent forms, and there are different, equivalent versions of the RBANS available for test-retest use.

The domains comprise the following subtests:
Immediate Memory

List Learning: immediate recall of a 10-item list of words.
Story Memory: a 12 item story, read aloud for immediate recall over two trials.

2 Visuospatial/Constructional

Figure Copy: copying a geometric figure of 10 parts.
Line Orientation: a 10 item line orientation test.

3 Language

Picture Naming: 10-line drawings which the subject must name
Semantic Fluency: the total number of examples generated for a given semantic category within 60 s.

4 Attention

Digit Span: analogous to digits forward on the WAIS. There are two strings of digits in each item, each pair increasing in length from 2 to 9 digits. The second string of a given length is only read if the first string is failed.
Coding: numbers rather than symbols were chosen for the response in order to avoid the possible detrimental effect of a constructional apraxia on performance.

5 Delayed Memory

List Recall: free recall of the words from the List Learning task.
List Recognition: yes/no recognition testing for memory of the words from the List Learning task.
Story Recall: free recall of the story from the story memory test.
Figure Recall: free recall of the figure from the figure copy subtest.

All subtests of the RBANS were scored according to standardized age-adjusted criteria. Raw scores from the 12 subtests were converted to age- adjusted scaled scores before calculating an index score for each domain. The sum of the index scores was then converted to a total scale score.

### The development of human social learning across seven societies [^58107284]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Experimental procedure

Children, who were naive with respect to the task, were called into a classroom one after another to partake in the experiment. Nothing at this stage was revealed about the aim of the experiment itself. Children received the following instructions in their local language: 'I have brought a box that has three openings. If one throws a ball in the correct hole, a toy is delivered from the box. I show you a movie now in which four different children will show you how to use it. Thereafter, you can use it yourself. Watch closely!'. Children then watched the video demonstrations individually. The video depicted four peers demonstrating how to use the box (Fig. 3). The demonstrators were the same gender as the observer. The video demonstrations during the experiment were non-verbal, yet a supporting narration in the child's local language was presented by the experimenter in sequence according to counterbalance condition: Minority: 'This is [x = pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the yellow hole. This is [x] again, (s)he uses the yellow hole again. This is again [x], (s)he uses the yellow hole again' (i.e. three times same demonstrator, same hole).

Fig. 3
Experimental set-up. Illustration of the apparatus, including the a majority and b minority demonstrations. Upon dropping the ball into the pipe, a reward was automatically released from the apparatus

Majority: 'This is [y = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole. This is [z = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole. This is [a = different pre-determined locally appropriate name], (s)he uses the blue hole'. After the video demonstration, children received a final instruction in their local language: 'Now you can use the box. Beware; you only have this one ball'. The 'choice-box' contained three differently coloured pipes. If a ball was dropped in any one of the pipes, a reward was automatically released from the box. After the child had used the 'choice-box' and received the reward, he/she was thanked and escorted to another room (or outside) in order to minimise the chance for them to communicate with the remaining naive children.

### What counts? Sources of knowledge in children's acquisition of the successor function [^bf36c023]. Child Development (2021). Medium credibility.

Although many U.S. children can count sets by 4 years, it is not until 5½-6 years that they understand how counting relates to number-that is, that adding 1 to a set necessitates counting up one number. This study examined two knowledge sources that 3½- to 6-year-olds (N = 136) may leverage to acquire this "successor function": (a) mastery of productive rules governing count list generation; and (b) training with "+1" math facts. Both productive counting and "+1" math facts were related to understanding that adding 1 to sets entails counting up one number in the count list; however, even children with robust successor knowledge struggled with its arithmetic expression, suggesting they do not generalize the successor function from "+1" math facts.

### Abstract representations of events arise from mental errors in learning and memory [^748e9b84]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Estimating parameters and making quantitative predictions

Given an observed sequence of nodes x 1, …, x t −1, and given an inverse temperature β, our model predicts the anticipation, or expectation, of the subsequent node x t to be. In order to quantitatively describe the reactions of an individual subject, we must relate the expectations a (t) to predictions about a person's reaction timesand then calculate the model parameters that best fit the reactions of an individual subject. The simplest possible prediction is given by the linear relation, where the intercept r 0 represents a person's reaction time with zero anticipation and the slope r 1 quantifies the strength with which a person's reaction times depend on their internal expectations.

In total, our predictionscontain three parameters (β, r 0, and r 1), which must be estimated from the reaction time data for each subject. Before estimating these parameters, however, we first regress out the dependencies of each subject's reaction times on the button combinations, trial number, and recency using a mixed effects model of the form 'RT~log(Trial)*Stage+Target+Recency+(1+log(Trial)*Stage+Recency|ID)', where all variables were defined in the previous section. Then, to estimate the model parameters that best describe an individual's reactions, we minimize the RMS prediction error with respect to each subject's observed reaction times, where T is the number of trials. We note that, given a choice for the inverse temperature β, the linear parameters r 0 and r 1 can be calculated analytically using standard linear regression techniques. Thus, the problem of estimating the model parameters can be restated as a one-dimensional minimization problem; that is, minimizing RMSE with respect to the inverse temperature β. To find the global minimum, we began by calculating RMSE along 100 logarithmically spaced values for β between 10⁻⁴ and 10. Then, starting at the minimum value of this search, we performed gradient descent until the gradient fell below an absolute value of 10⁻⁶. For a derivation of the gradient of the RMSE with respect to the inverse temperature β, we point the reader to the Supplementary Discussion. Finally, in addition to the gradient descent procedure described above, for each subject we also manually checked the RMSE associated with the two limits β → 0 and β → ∞. The resulting model parameters are shown in Fig. 4 a, b for random walk sequences and Fig. 4 g, h for Hamiltonian walk sequences.

### App-based learning for kindergarten children at home (learning4Kids): study protocol for cohort 1 and the kindergarten assessments [^2c3a176c]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample

The first cohort of our sample consists of N = 190 children with their families. Here, N = 60 families were randomly assigned to each of the experimental groups. In addition, N = 35 families were randomly assigned to each of the control groups with and without tablets. N = 114 participating families were recruited through the kindergartens attended by their child. In Germany, most children are enrolled in kindergartens from 2 to 3 years of age until the beginning of formal schooling at the age of 6 and almost all children attend kindergartens five days a week for several hours a day in the last two years before school entry.

We aimed to recruit a representative sample and thus lay a focus on families with a migration background and/or low SES. Here, statistical information from the 'Indikatorenatlas' for Munich was used to identify regions with high rates of unemployment and low income or in which a higher ratio of families with a migration background live (i.e. the child or at least one of the parents were born abroad). Kindergartens in these districts in the greater area of Munich were approached first, as most children attend kindergartens close to their homes and thus many children in these kindergartens will often live in families with lower SES. The project was introduced and explained to kindergarten directors and educators via telephone calls. In participating kindergartens, plain language statements about the project and consent forms were provided to parents in the most commonly used foreign languages of the families (e.g. Turkish, Polish, Russian, Albanian, Romanian, Arabic, Persian (farsi), Spanish, Italian, Vietnamese, and English). In a second step, families from the greater Munich area were contacted via a social media campaign on facebook. Here, potential participants were approached via telephone calls by a market research institute, introducing and explaining the project to interested families. After families signed the consent form, the kindergartens attended by their participating child were contacted and introduced to the project, too. With this approach, N = 71 additional families were recruited. Five additional families were recruited by word of mouth and leaflets distributed in the city. Altogether, the participating children attended N = 111 different kindergartens. In each participating kindergarten, between N = 1 and N = 11 children (and their parents) participated in our study. Descriptive statistics for all study groups are presented in Table 1.

### Quantifying memory deficits in amnestic mild cognitive impairment [^2af7b174]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

ISDA indices were calculated according to the procedure originally described by Wright et al. The ISDA encoding deficit index is a reflection of acquisition across learning trials. It was calculated by determining the number of individual words on the learning phase, which were recalled only once or not at all over the three learning trials, divided by 16 (the total number of items) such that higher scores indicate worse performance. The ISDA consolidation deficit index was calculated as the number of items recalled more than once during list-learning, but not at all during delayed recall trials. This value was divided by the total number of words recalled at least once during learning trials to control for disparities in total word acquisition (range = 0 to 1). The ISDA retrieval deficit index was calculated by summing the individual items that were recalled at least once during list learning and at delayed cued recall divided by the total number of words recalled at least once during learning trials to control for varying levels of acquisition (range = 0 to 1). As ISDA indices are deficit indices rather than performance indices, higher deficit scores indicate poorer performance. Their sensitivity and specificity to aMCI were also calculated. Indeed, the need to report diagnostic test accuracy statistics (sensitivity and specificity) over null hypothesis testing as a way to ascertain the value of the tests has been recently emphasized by Weissberger et al.

### Concerns regarding… [^70dc23c9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Controversy about hyperparameter optimization of various machine learning models

In this study, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not described, even though different combinations of hyperparameters are crucial for model building and validation.

In the field of machine learning, using default hyperparameters may not be suitable for specific datasets. Lack of hyperparameter optimization can prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, leading to less stable performance, high heterogeneity, and insufficient robustness, which negatively affects model building and generalization. Different combinations of hyperparameters significantly impact the predictive efficacy of the model. Failure to adequately perform hyperparameter optimization may result in models that do not achieve optimal predictive efficacy. This causes selection bias in the model and ultimately leads to incorrect decisions.

Machine learning is prone to model overfitting and poor generalization if the built-in hyperparameters are not properly set. Therefore, hyperparameter optimization in the field of machine learning is a scientific, rigorous, and reliable practice.

### Tau, atrophy, and domain-specific cognitive impairment in typical Alzheimer's disease [^1c660585]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Neuropsychological assessment

Cognitive assessment closest to the tau PET scan date was used for this study (median = 15 days). Five neuropsychological tests were selected: the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog), category fluency, letter fluency, and the Trail‐Making Test (TMT).

The AVLT is a 15‐word list learning task, in which individuals learn a list of words over several trials. Different trials were used to calculate immediate recall and late immediate recall. Immediate recall is based on trial 1 + 2 and late immediate recall on trial 4 + 5.

Delayed recall was additionally calculated. This measure was partially based on the AVLT delayed recall after 30 minutes and on the 10‐item word list from the ADAS‐Cog. The latter involves three rounds of learning a list of 10 words and immediate recall, delayed recall (after a 5 minute interval) is completed. Number of errors was recorded and converted to number of correct words (10 – number of errors) to match the AVLT score. Number of words recalled on both of the measures were summarized and transformed into a z score based on the Aβ– controls.

Recognition memory was based on the AVLT. Fifteen studied words along with fifteen foils were determined to be either studied or not on the prior list. To account for incorrect "recognition" of non‐studied items ("false alarms"), a measure of discriminability, d prime (d'), was calculated using a standard formula to convert these values: Hits = (#Hits + 0.5)/(#studied items + 1) and False Alarms = (#FA + 0.5)/(#unstudied items + 1) to avoid undefined values of d'.

The category fluency test is a test of semantic fluency and involves naming as many words of a given category (animal, vegetables) as possible within 1 minute. Letter fluency, a test of lexical fluency, involves naming as many words starting with a given letter ("f") as possible within 1 minute. The total number of correct named words is recorded for fluency measures.

### Biomedical meetings and biomedical journals: vive la difference et vive la compagnie [^f2eb3e2b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Why do we continue to gather to meet to exchange medical knowledge more than 500 years after the invention of the printing press, 100 years after the telephone, and 20 years after the widespread use of email? We, the human race, have been transmitting information by multimedia — voice, face, and body language — into each other's ears and eyes (and noses) in caves around fires, at work, and on the trail, since well over 100 000 years ago. That communication is built on a foundation shared with many other primates and non-primate mammals. The origins of this communication are hundreds of millions of years old. Each newly input bit of this type of communication often needs to be processed immediately and responded to appropriately (food, hug, love, hit, bite, fight, and flight). The brain has had all this evolutionary time to build a complex, rich network of neurons to take it all in immediately, deal with it speedily, and save it for guidance in the future. (Also, 're-play' is not usually a choice.) Writing is only 5000 years old and comes in through only the eyes. (The ears and nose are excluded from these communications.) The earliest surviving paintings, the predecessors of writing, are less than 30 000 years old and are an exclusive product of human evolution. The brain has had less time to build a rich response centre. Re-reading is common. Only in a minority of instances (e.g. STOP sign, High Voltage) is an immediate response demanded. In essence, the two distinct modes of communication complement one another. Vive la difference. Vive la compagnie.

Commentary

We witnessed this complementarity at the recent Laniado Hospital/Bildirici Diabetes Center meeting in Israel. The public presentations from the speaker's platform stirred the minds and souls of the audience. We remember the presenter, we recall the overall message (but not the details), and we were emotionally moved by what we heard. Now we are publishing these papers in a medical journal to use the other mode of communication-the written word (cool, slow, reader's convenience, skip, and re-play). Each alone is good — the two together produce an unexplained but exhilarating synergy and a long-term meld of the warm emotion and cool reason.

### The new NEJM.org [^c1ac412d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Each week, half a million readers access the Journal electronically, and our content is now seen online by about four times as many people as those who see the print edition. This mode of information delivery has expanded tremendously since the Journal first went online in 1996.(1) Not so long ago, electronic publishing was viewed as secondary to print publication, basically as a convenient way to deliver the print version of an article. Today, the electronic presentation of scientific articles has become the version of record, with print becoming only one part of the complete publication, which may include video.
