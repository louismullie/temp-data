## Question

What is the first line of treatment for a patient with dementia who is also depressed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first-line treatment should be for a patient with dementia who is also depressed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing depression from dementia and delirium. Then, I should verify the severity of depressive symptoms and how that guides treatment intensity. Next, I will weigh nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic options and align choices with guideline hierarchies. After that, I need to check medication selection, dosing, and monitoring in the context of dementia. Finally, I will integrate safety, caregiver support, and follow-up planning, and I will double-check where the evidence is strong versus conditional or insufficient.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because depression and dementia frequently overlap and can mimic each other, and delirium must be excluded before labeling dementia. I should screen for depression with validated tools such as PHQ-9 or Geriatric Depression Scale, and I should confirm cognitive impairment with a structured cognitive assessment while also checking for reversible contributors like B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, and medication effects, since treating these can improve cognition and mood and may change management entirely [^116BwVnJ] [^116R1Tee] [^115xWmgY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Depression can be prodromal to dementia, coexist with dementia, or present as pseudodementia, so I need to check the temporal relationship and course of symptoms and, when uncertain, consider a therapeutic trial of antidepressants with reassessment of cognition in 6–8 weeks to help clarify the diagnosis and functional impact, especially in late-onset presentations [^116BwVnJ] [^116R1Tee] [^111Ypc1z].

> Next, I should review severity and functional impact because treatment intensity depends on whether depression is mild, moderate, or severe. I need to ensure I assess suicide risk, dangerousness, and caregiver burden, and I should remember that even subsyndromal depressive symptoms in dementia warrant treatment given their association with disability, quality-of-life impairment, and mortality, so I should not withhold care solely due to incomplete diagnostic criteria [^113RDU2j] [^115H6gWt] [^113hhdDq].

> I will now examine first-line nonpharmacologic strategies, since guidelines consistently prioritize these for neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, including depression. Let me consider problem-solving therapy, behavioral activation, pleasant-events scheduling, and caregiver education and support, and I should confirm that these are feasible in the patient's setting and that the caregiver can implement them, because family caregiver interventions have the strongest evidence base for improving patient and caregiver outcomes in this context [^115fpye1] [^114eqMBP] [^115spjH7].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for psychotherapy in dementia. Recent reviews suggest antidepressants often fail to outperform placebo in dementia, whereas problem adaptation therapy shows efficacy in MCI and mild dementia, and other psychosocial interventions have mixed but promising signals. Given this, I should position psychotherapy as first-line for mild to moderate depression in dementia when available and acceptable, and escalate thoughtfully if response is inadequate [^113xgYVv] [^114eqMBP] [^114M8pJV].

> Now, I need to check when pharmacotherapy is indicated. For moderate to severe depression, for rapid relief needs, or when nonpharmacologic interventions are declined or unavailable, a cautious trial of an antidepressant is reasonable, but I should confirm that we do not medicate depressive symptoms in the absence of a diagnosed depressive disorder, as some guidelines advise against pharmacotherapy without a concurrent depression diagnosis in dementia [^113oh1Pv] [^116xAqPi] [^113hhdDq].

> Let me think about agent selection, because tolerability and drug–drug interactions matter in older adults with dementia. SSRIs are generally preferred due to better tolerability, and among them sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram are reasonable first choices. I should avoid paroxetine because of anticholinergic effects and fluoxetine due to long half-life and interaction potential, and I should start low and titrate slowly with close monitoring for hyponatremia, GI effects, and falls, targeting a 4–6 week trial at a therapeutic dose before declaring failure [^112KbV99] [^113hhdDq] [^116xAqPi].

> I should double-check dosing targets and safety ceilings. Typical starting doses such as sertraline 25 mg daily, citalopram 10 mg daily, or escitalopram 5 mg daily can be increased gradually as tolerated, with attention to citalopram's QT risk at higher doses. If there is no meaningful response after about 6 weeks at a therapeutic dose, I should consider switching to a different SSRI or an SNRI such as venlafaxine or duloxetine, or consider augmentation strategies, while reassessing adherence, diagnosis, and comorbidities before changing course [^112KbV99] [^113hhdDq] [^114qt5A5].

> But wait, what if depression is severe, psychotic, or accompanied by suicidality or profound functional decline. In that case, I need to ensure safety and consider electroconvulsive therapy, which has supportive evidence in geriatric depression and may be lifesaving when pharmacotherapy is ineffective or contraindicated, while coordinating with anesthesia and neurology colleagues given cognitive risks and the need for informed consent and caregiver support [^113hhdDq] [^115DnXxZ].

> Next, I should review the broader care context, because management in dementia must be multidisciplinary and staged. I need to coordinate with primary care, neurology, and social work, monitor for emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms at least every 3–6 months, and provide caregiver education and respite resources, since caregiver depression and burden are common and directly affect patient outcomes and placement risk [^115wE7zr] [^111Wmq6d] [^114CUZ5x].

> I should confirm that we are not inadvertently worsening symptoms with other medications. I need to review anticholinergic burden, benzodiazepines, and other psychotropics, and consider deprescribing when appropriate, because minimizing harmful medications can improve cognition, mood, and safety in dementia, and this should be done collaboratively with caregivers and documented clearly [^117A5kHa] [^116SvTBJ] [^1127b1FK].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For a patient with dementia and comorbid depression, I should first confirm the diagnosis and exclude reversible causes, then tailor treatment to severity: start with nonpharmacologic interventions such as problem-solving therapy or behavioral activation plus caregiver support for mild to moderate depression, and consider an SSRI such as sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram for moderate to severe depression, treatment resistance, or when psychotherapy is not feasible, with slow titration, close monitoring, and a plan to reassess efficacy and safety at 4–6 weeks and adjust accordingly, escalating to ECT if severe, life-threatening, or refractory [^115fpye1] [^114eqMBP] [^112KbV99] [^113hhdDq].

---

The first-line treatment for depression in dementia is **nonpharmacologic interventions** — especially caregiver education, behavioral activation, and problem-solving therapy — because they are safe, effective, and guideline-preferred [^115fpye1] [^114eqMBP]. If depression is moderate to severe or persists after nonpharmacologic care, **SSRIs** (sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram) are the first-line pharmacologic option due to favorable tolerability; start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for side effects and interactions [^112KbV99] [^116xAqPi]. Avoid **TCAs** and **paroxetine** because of anticholinergic effects and cognitive risks [^113hhdDq] [^112KbV99]. Combine nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments for optimal outcomes, and reassess regularly to adjust the plan [^115wE7zr] [^116AhpfN].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions (first-line)

Nonpharmacologic interventions are the **preferred first-line approach** for managing depression in dementia because of their safety, efficacy, and alignment with patient-centered care principles [^115fpye1]. These interventions focus on improving mood, reducing caregiver burden, and enhancing quality of life [^117NhGu8].

Key nonpharmacologic interventions include:

- **Caregiver education and support**: Providing caregivers with education, training, and support significantly reduces caregiver burden, improves patient outcomes, and enhances quality of life [^114CUZ5x] [^114Z2r3p].

- **Behavioral activation**: Encouraging participation in pleasurable activities and social engagement effectively reduces depressive symptoms and improves mood [^notfound].

- **Problem-solving therapy**: Particularly beneficial for patients with executive dysfunction, this therapy helps patients and caregivers develop coping strategies and address specific problems contributing to depression [^114eqMBP].

- **Environmental modifications**: Creating a supportive and stimulating environment can reduce stressors and improve mood [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions (second-line)

Pharmacologic treatment is considered when **nonpharmacologic interventions are insufficient** or when depression is moderate to severe. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the **preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment** because of their favorable safety profile and tolerability [^112KbV99] [^116xAqPi].

Recommended SSRIs include:

| **Medication** | **Starting dose** | **Titration** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sertraline | 25 mg/day | Increase by 25 mg every 2–4 weeks | 150 mg/day |
| Citalopram | 10 mg/day | Increase by 10 mg every 2–4 weeks | 40 mg/day |
| Escitalopram | 5 mg/day | Increase by 5 mg every 2–4 weeks | 20 mg/day |

---

These medications should be **started at low doses**, titrated slowly, and monitored closely for side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, hyponatremia, and falls [^116xAqPi]. Avoid tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and paroxetine due to anticholinergic effects and cognitive impairment risks [^113hhdDq] [^112KbV99].

---

## Combined treatment approach

Combining nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions is often the **most effective strategy** for managing depression in dementia. This approach addresses both psychological and biological factors, leading to improved mood, functioning, and quality of life [^115wE7zr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess treatment effectiveness, side effects, and disease progression. Clinicians should reassess patients every 3–6 months and adjust treatment plans accordingly [^111Wmq6d] [^115wE7zr].

---

## Conclusion

The first-line treatment for depression in dementia is **nonpharmacologic interventions**, including caregiver education, behavioral activation, and problem-solving therapy. If depression persists or is severe, SSRIs are the preferred pharmacologic option. A combined approach and regular monitoring are essential for optimal outcomes.

Mildly impaired patients with Alzheimer's disease — initial management and treatment should prioritize symptomatic therapies and safety assessments. Patients with early Alzheimer's disease should be offered a trial of one of the three available cholinesterase inhibitors approved and commonly used for the treatment of cognitive impairment (i.e., donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), after a thorough discussion of their potential risks and benefits. Given the possible risks of long-term high-dose vitamin E and selegiline and the minimal evidence for their benefit, they are no longer recommended. Mildly impaired patients should be evaluated for neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depressed mood or major depression, which may require pharmacological or psychotherapeutic intervention, and patients with moderate to severe major depression who do not respond to or cannot tolerate antidepressant medications should be considered for ECT. Mildly impaired patients should also be carefully assessed for suicidality, even if they are not obviously depressed, and may be interested in referrals to local research centers for participation in clinical trials of experimental agents for early Alzheimer's disease. Support groups for patients and families with mild Alzheimer's disease exist in many communities.

### What do we know about pseudodementia? [^111Ypc1z]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis

Diagnosing pseudodementia in older adults poses challenges due to several factors.

First, the ageing process itself brings about cognitive and brain function changes, making it challenging to distinguish between age-related changes and initial indications of depression or dementia. Second, diagnosing pseudodementia becomes more complex as symptoms of depression and various progressive neurological conditions frequently overlap in older individuals. Lastly, it is entirely possible for an individual to concurrently experience both genuine dementia and depression, further adding to the complexity of diagnosis.

Due to the complexities involved, diagnosing pseudodementia often requires a thorough and comprehensive evaluation. Medical professionals prioritise ruling out dementia and other cognitive issues before exploring alternative potential causes. This meticulous approach may take some time to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

Distinguishing between depression and other conditions in older adults is supported by careful screening of both depressive symptoms and cognitive status, which may be complemented by a neuropsychological assessment that provides information regarding the nature of cognitive impairments and current patient status for future comparisons (baseline). The information is useful in diagnosis and management.

A diagnosis of depression rather than dementia is first considered when there are symptoms such as delirium of ruin, high levels of anxiety, significant hypochondriacal worries and a previous depressive episode. However, individuals with depression may express concerns regarding memory problems and experience distress related to this. When assessed using neuropsychological tests, they typically demonstrate satisfactory performance in memory-related tasks. On the other hand, individuals with dementia often deny having memory problems or minimise their importance, and show impairment in neuropsychological tests.

Antidepressants for depression in dementia — because as many as one-half of such persons do develop dementia within 5 years, caution is urged in ruling out an underlying early dementia in patients with both affective and cognitive symptoms, particularly when the first episode of depression is in old age. When treatment for depression is being considered, patients should be evaluated for conditions that may be causing or contributing to the depression, and clinical consensus supports a trial of an antidepressant in acutely clinically significant, persistent depressed mood in patients with dementia. SSRIs may be preferred because they appear to be better tolerated than other antidepressants, and when a rapid response is not critical a very gradual dosage increase may increase the likelihood that a therapeutic dosage will be reached and tolerated; after prolonged use, medications should be withdrawn gradually whenever possible, in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Treatment of depression may also reduce other neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with depression such as aggression, anxiety, apathy, and psychosis.

Depression and related symptoms in dementia — diagnostic criteria and treatment thresholds — The presence of depression has been associated with higher rates of disability, impaired quality of life, and greater mortality, and the best approach to diagnosing depression in the context of dementia is not yet clear because provisional criteria for depression of Alzheimer's disease have been proposed but not yet validated. The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance Consensus Statement Panel reported that the diagnostic criteria for depression in individuals with dementing disorders must be revised and recommended that the criteria take into account the instability and fluctuation of symptoms over time, the reduction in positive affect or pleasure, and the inclusion of irritability, social withdrawal, and isolation as indicators of depression. Until criteria for depression in dementia are established, patients should be carefully evaluated for any of the symptoms of depression outlined in DSM-IV-TR, and even those with depressive symptoms who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression should be considered as candidates for depression treatment. The presence of neurovegetative symptoms, suicidal ideation, and mood-congruent delusions or hallucinations may indicate a need for more vigorous and aggressive therapies (such as higher medication dosages, multiple medication trials, or ECT), and one goal of treating depression in dementia is to maximize cognitive functioning.

How is dementia diagnosed?

The role of primary care

General practitioners are often the first point of contact for patients who are worried that they may have dementia. The role of primary care is to exclude a potentially treatable illness or reversible cause of the "dementia" — for example, depression, vitamin B 12 deficiency, or thyroid disturbance; refer for specialist assessment, especially those with unusual symptoms (neurological, psychiatric, or behavioural changes) or those with major risk factors (for example, important medical comorbidities, psychosocial problems, harm to self); and ensure patients who have mild cognitive impairment (objective cognitive loss not affecting function and daily living activities) are followed up in primary care, and, if their symptoms become more severe, re-referred for specialist assessment.

Initial assessment should include a careful history from both the patient and the main carer, with particular emphasis on disturbance of cognitive function and activities of daily living. A physical examination should be undertaken to look for any focal neurological signs and exclude any visual or auditory problems. Baseline investigations and a brief cognitive assessment, using one of the many tools available (box 2), should also be carried out before referral to secondary care.

The mini-mental state examinationhas traditionally been recommended as the brief cognitive assessment tool of choice, although copyright restrictions are influencing its use in practice. The tools listed in box 2 have been found to be as clinically and psychometrically robust as the mini-mental state examination; a clock drawing test may be added to the assessment if it is not already incorporated into the tool. The Addenbrooke's cognitive examination, especially the revised version, has superior diagnostic accuracy to the mini-mental state examination but takes about 25 minutes to complete and has better accuracy in moderate to high prevalence settings. No one brief cognitive assessment tool is more accurate than another and all are inadequate for assessing early or subtle changes, with scores affected by factors such as education. Mini-mental state examination scores are used to indicate the severity of Alzheimer's disease: mild, scores 21–26; moderate, scores 10–20; moderately severe, scores 10–14; severe, scores less than 10.

Depression masquerading as dementia is probably the most common differential diagnosis and should always be considered; however, they can coexist and depression may precede dementia. If suspected, a trial of antidepressants may be indicated, with reassessment of the individual's capabilities and cognitive function 6–8 weeks later.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Clinical Question Do cholinesterase inhibitors improve function in persons with mild, moderate, or severe dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, and is one cholinesterase inhibitor better tolerated or more effective than the others. Evidence-Based Answer Cholinesterase inhibitors produce a small benefit on several cognitive and noncognitive function scales. Although data for patients with severe dementia are sparse, there is no evidence to suggest a difference in effectiveness among patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia. Compared with placebo, adverse reactions are significantly more common in treatment groups. Limited evidence suggests donepezil is better tolerated than rivastigmine. There is no consistent evidence to suggest treatment reduces health care costs or prolongs time until institutionalization.

1. Cochrane Abstract Background.

Since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor in 1997, most clinicians, and probably most patients, would consider the cholinergic drugs donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine to be first-line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Objectives. To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine in patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. Primary Results. The results of 13 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for six months with donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for persons with mild, moderate, or severe dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average −2. 7 points, in the midrange of the 70-point Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for Cognition.

1 Although their benefit is modest, cholinesterase inhibitors remain first-line treatment for Alzheimer's disease and should be titrated as tolerated to target dosage. Rivastigmine is started at a dosage of 1. 5 mg twice daily and titrated over one to three months to 6 mg twice daily. The costs of one month's supply of the target dosages are $166, $175, and $188, respectively. 5 When Alzheimer's disease becomes moderate to severe, memantine, an.

Postdiagnostic support

Postdiagnostic support and follow‐up, including a care plan, should be individualized based on the patient's underlying disease and needs. Follow‐up may have different objectives, such as to ensure adequate care and treatment, diagnostic clarification (watchful waiting with assessment after 6 or 12 months), and counseling. Neuropsychological testing will usually be important in connection with this and should always be considered. In patients where the underlying condition is likely to be nonprogressive (e.g. depression, alcohol abuse, cerebrovascular disease), the need for follow‐up will vary accordingly. In patients with MCI, competency may be preserved. Therefore, follow‐up may not have to be preplanned, but could be in the form of instructions to the patient to seek medical attention if he or she has concerns regarding progression or if a caregiver observes progression. One caveat in this regard is that physicians may have difficulty in evaluating clinical competency [60], warranting caution, although most patients with MCI would usually have appropriate capacity.

The setting for follow‐up will depend on the objectives, the underlying condition, and local organizations for dementia care. For patients with an underlying neurodegenerative condition, follow‐up should be multidisciplinary and include specialist physicians with expertise of MCI and dementia. Where there are diagnostic uncertainties, patients may require follow‐up in more specialized centers at least for some time, after which a watchful waiting approach with renewed referrals to a specialized center in case of progression may be arranged.

Management of patients with MCI should be based on a holistic, multidisciplinary approach depending on the underlying cause. It is important to highlight that despite the lack of a disease‐modifying therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, management of symptoms and comorbidities, medically and otherwise, is possible. This includes medical treatment of depression, management of behavioral symptoms, awareness and management of possible seizures, review of medication, advice on brain‐healthy living (e.g. physical and mental activity, social interaction, smoking cessation, healthy eating, low intake of alcohol, sleep hygiene, and correction of visual and hearing problems), and treatment of modifiable risk factors as has been recommended [12]. Psychosocial support should also be offered to the patient and caregiver. It is important to include the patient in this planning to be a resource for their own well‐being. Importance of the chain of care (e.g. communication of diagnostic conclusions to dementia nurses or other physicians who will follow‐up with the patient) should be stressed.

### Diagnostic journey and management of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia: a multinational, real-world survey [^1158ufXw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient treatment and management

Pharmacologic treatment was initiated in half (49.0%) of all patients by neurologists and in 22.4% of patients by PCPs following a diagnosis (Table 5). The median [IQR] time from diagnosis to physician-reported start of first line treatment was 2.4 [0.0, 21.9] weeks. Most patients were treated at first line with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (79.0%), including donepezil (52.7%), rivastigmine (7.4% oral; 14.1% patch) and galantamine (5.7%). As part of first-line treatment, NMDA antagonists were prescribed to 29.4% of patients (29.2% memantine, 0.3% ifenprodil) and antidepressants to 27.8% of patients. First-line use of NMDA antagonists was particularly high in patients in the US (47.2%) and first-line use of antidepressants was high in France (45.4%).

Table 5.
Treatment initiation in patients with a current MCI or AD dementia diagnosis.

Across disease severities, 79.4% of patients with MCI at initial diagnosis received acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as part of their first line treatment, this was 84.2% for AD with mild dementia, 72.6% for AD with moderate dementia and 71.7% for AD with severe dementia. For NMDA antagonists, this was 25.4%, 23.2%, 43.3% and 43.3% of patients, respectively.

Aducanumab was initiated as a first line treatment for 1.3% of all US patients included in the survey.

Subgroup analysis

A subgroup analysis was performed on the 2952 patients with a MCI or AD with mild dementia diagnosis, as this is the group most likely appropriate and eligible for ATTs.

Patient clinical and demographic characteristics for this subgroup are presented in. Symptoms prompting initial consultation are shown inand the patient journey is presented in. Diagnostic tests were predominantly behavioral/cognitive assessments, informant reports, or non-AD specific blood tests. AD biomarker testing was uncommon in the diagnostic assessment (1). Patients were predominantly prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (80.9%) or anti-depressants (23.7%) as first-line treatment (2). Physician-reported delays to diagnosis in patients with a current MCI or AD with mild dementia diagnosis are reported in 3.

### A common challenge in older adults: classification, overlap, and therapy of depression and dementia [^111NDBgg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Late-life depression is frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Depressive symptoms are often associated with or even precede a dementia syndrome. Moreover, depressive disorders increase the risk of persistence for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Here, we present both the current state of evidence and future perspectives regarding the integration and value of clinical assessments, neuropsychological, neurochemical, and neuroimaging biomarkers for the etiological classification of the dementia versus the depression syndrome and for the prognosis of depression relating to dementia risk. Finally, we summarize the existing evidence for both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of depression in demented patients. There is an urgent need for large-scale collaborative research to elucidate the role and interplay of clinical and biological features in elderly individuals with depressive disorders who are at elevated risk for developing dementia. To overcome barriers for successful drug development, we propose the introduction of the precision medicine paradigm to this research field.

Anticipatory/predeath grief

The guideline emphasises the grief-like experiences which a person living with dementia may experience. These may be in relation to the progressive loss of personal identity which can result in mourning for their previous self; reflections about their death; loss of their plans for the future; and loss of social roles, relationships and competencies. In much of the evidence considered, it is noted that the perspectives of people with dementia have typically been researched alongside their family members or carers, rather than being considered in their own right.

For carers of people with dementia, there is encouragement for professionals to enquire sensitively about the topic of grief. Holistic assessment of caregivers is recommended to inform management strategies that will enable them to cope with their caring responsibilities and daily tasks. Increasing severity of illness and transitions of care, such as moving-in to long-term care, are associated with worsening of predeath grief experiences among carers. There is also an association between predeath grief in carers and depression, and the guideline highlights the need to avoid misdiagnosis. While depression and predeath grief may co-exist, treatments may not be effective for both aspects, and the distressing and disabling nature of predeath grief should be recognised in terms of the negative impact on individual wellbeing. Similarly, good practice statements explain that grief should not preclude a carer from receiving treatment for depression.

Figure 5 summarises key recommendations in how to support and manage the needs of carers with predeath grief. Health and social care professionals should receive guidance and training on the assessment and support of predeath grief for carers of people with dementia. Approaching assessment, support and management should focus on carers and family units, as well as people with dementia, and could include coping skills for loss and grief.

Dementia — differential diagnosis considerations include that age-associated memory changes are modest and not associated with functional impairment or depression, and memory impairment occurs in both delirium and dementia, but a new diagnosis of dementia cannot be made when delirium is present. Delirium is characterized by a reduced ability to maintain or shift attention appropriately, fluctuating cognitive deficits, and impaired level of consciousness, whereas the deficits in dementia tend to be stable or progressive and level of consciousness is unaffected; the onset of delirium may be acute and its course is often time limited. Other conditions include amnestic disorder (memory impairment without significant impairment in other cognitive domains), mental retardation with onset before age 18 years and significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning which may not include memory impairment, and schizophrenia where cognitive impairment tends to be less severe and occurs against a background of psychotic and behavioral symptoms. In elderly persons, major depressive disorder may present with reported memory impairment, difficulty concentrating, and reduced intellectual abilities; depression versus progressive dementia may sometimes be distinguished by the course and onset of symptoms and by response of cognitive symptoms to depression treatment, yet even when symptoms resolve with antidepressants more than 50% of patients go on to develop dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

Further trials of medications that treat depression as homogenous across dementia subtypes and stage of disease are likely to be ineffective. An alternative approach to understanding depression in dementia is to view it as a complex system of interacting depressive symptoms, which differ across dementia subtypes and stages of disease. Utilising this approach would promote tailored interventions for specific symptoms with greater importance at different stages of disease, development of depressive-symptom-network markers for each condition to guide interventions and diagnosis, and provide some mechanistic insights into the causes of depression.

### Management of depression in older adults: a review [^1127b1FK]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Depression in older adults is a common psychiatric disorder affecting their health-related quality of life. Major depression occurs in 2% of adults aged 55 years or older, and its prevalence rises with increasing age. In addition, 10% to 15% of older adults have clinically significant depressive symptoms, even in the absence of major depression.

Observations

Depression presents with the same symptoms in older adults as it does in younger populations. In contrast to younger patients, older adults with depression more commonly have several concurrent medical disorders and cognitive impairment. Depression occurring in older patients is often undetected or inadequately treated. Antidepressants are the best-studied treatment option, but psychotherapy, exercise therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy may also be effective. Psychotherapy is recommended for patients with mild to moderate severity depression. Many older patients need the same doses of antidepressant medication that are used for younger adult patients. Although antidepressants may effectively treat depression in older adults, they tend to pose greater risk for adverse events because of multiple medical comorbidities and drug-drug interactions in case of polypharmacy. High-quality evidence does not support the use of pharmacologic treatment of depression in patients with dementia. Polypharmacy in older patients can be minimized by using the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (STOPP/START) criteria, a valid and reliable screening tool that enables physicians to avoid potentially inappropriate medications, undertreatment, or errors of omissions in older people. Antidepressants can be gradually tapered over a period of several weeks, but discontinuation of antidepressants may be associated with relapse or recurrence of depression, so the patient should be closely observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Major depression in older adults is common and can be effectively treated with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychological therapies and exercise may also be effective for mild-moderate depression, for patients who prefer nonpharmacological treatment, or for patients who are too frail for drug treatments.

Dementia — suicidal ideation screening and management notes that all patients (and their caregivers) should be asked about the presence of wishes for death, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, as well as a history of previous self-injury or suicide attempt. It is a particular concern in patients who are clinically depressed but can also occur in the absence of major depression. Interventions to address suicidal ideation are similar to those for patients without dementia and include psychotherapy; pharmacotherapy; removal of potentially dangerous items such as medications, guns, or vehicles; increased supervision; and hospitalization, and factors affecting the choice of intervention include the nature and intensity of the suicidal ideation or behavior and the capacity and support system of the patient.

Site-specific issues — home care for dementia: The majority of Americans with dementia reside in the community, although as many as 90% will receive long-term care during their lifetimes, and providing care at home can also have adverse emotional effects on caregivers. Depressive disorders are common in caregivers, with an estimated 30% of spousal caregivers experiencing a depressive disorder and the prevalence among adult children ranging from 22% to 37%. Multifaceted family interventions that provide emotional support, focus on specific behavior problems, and include careful monitoring of pharmacological treatment have demonstrated efficacy in reducing caregiver depression, caregiver burden, and rate of nursing home placement. The use of home health aides, day care, and respite care may provide stimulation for patients and needed relief for caregivers. End-of-life care is extremely demanding, with many family caregivers reporting high levels of depressive symptoms while caring for relatives with dementia; however, within 3 months of the death, caregivers experience significant declines in depressive symptoms.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Psychiatric disorders and dementia — Psychiatric symptoms are common early features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementia (ADRD), and in one study of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database of cognitively unimpaired persons who later developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, there were nearly 2000 participants and more than half had depression or irritability symptoms prior to cognitive impairment; given that core depressive symptoms include difficulty thinking, concentrating, and decision making, a patient presenting with such symptoms should always be evaluated for other symptoms of depression and this diagnostic possibility should be considered, and neuropsychological assessment or dementia subspecialist assessment may be helpful. The guideline notes that the causal direction of the association between psychiatric disorders and dementia remains unclear, and that new-onset psychiatric symptoms in older adults may represent early symptoms of a disease that will ultimately become obvious as dementia due to AD or ADRD; although not yet clinically validated, risk algorithms are being developed to support individualized prognostication in patients with MCI. The Lancet Commission focused their 2020 meta-analysis on seven studies with a 10- to 14-year follow-up period after a diagnosis of depression, summarizing their findings as supporting mid-life depression as a modifiable risk factor for dementia and stating that the effect of medication and therapy for depression in reducing the risk of dementia suggests the importance of treating depression because it might reduce the risk of dementia in the future; it is also recognized that the diagnosis and treatment of depression in older adults is often more complex than in younger adults, and a majority of individuals older than age 80 with cognitive impairment harbor more than one type of brain pathological change.

### Management of late-life depression in the context of cognitive impairment: a review of the recent literature [^113xgYVv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Evidence regarding the treatment of late-life depression is not necessarily generalizable to persons with a neurocognitive disorder and comorbid depression. Thus, this article reviews recent evidence that pertains to the treatment of depression in older adults with neurocognitive disorders, and synthesizes and critically analyzes this literature to identify methodological issues and gaps for the purpose of future research.

Recent Findings

Controlled trials and meta-analyses examining depression treatment in neurocognitive disorders, published between 2015 and 2019 (N = 16 reports), can be divided into those addressing pharmacotherapy, psychological and behavioral therapy, and somatic therapy. The evidence generally does not support benefit of antidepressant medication over placebo in treating depressive disorders in dementia. No pharmacological studies since 2015 have examined antidepressant medication in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Problem adaptation therapy demonstrates efficacy for depression in MCI and mild dementia. Other psychological and behavioral interventions for depressive symptoms in dementia demonstrate mixed findings. The only somatic treatment trials published since 2015 have assessed bright light therapy, with positive findings but methodological limitations. Psychological, behavioral, and somatic treatments represent promising treatment options for depression in neurocognitive disorders, but further studies are needed, particularly in participants with depressive disorders rather than subclinical depressive symptoms. Little is known about the treatment of depression in patients with MCI, and rigorous identification of MCI in late-life depression treatment trials will help to advance knowledge in this area. Addressing methodological issues, particularly the diagnosis and measurement of clinically significant depression in dementia, will help to move the field forward.

Dementia — agitation and aggression definition, contributors, and initial step describe that "Agitation" is an umbrella term that refers to a range of behavioral disturbances, including physical aggression, combativeness, threatening behavior, persistent or intermittent psychomotor hyperactivity, and disinhibition, and these behaviors pose a particular problem for patients cared for at home, especially by frail spouses. Agitation is more likely to occur later in the course of dementia and often has multiple causes, and new or worsened agitation can result from an occult general medical problem, medication side effects, untreated or undertreated pain, constipation, depression, psychotic symptoms, or delirium. Thus, the first priority is a careful medical evaluation.

### Concordance with clinical practice guidelines for dementia in general practice [^115gifRR]. Aging & Mental Health (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dementia is said to be under-recognized and sub-optimally managed in primary care, but there is little information about actual processes of diagnosis and clinical care.

Aim

To determine general practitioners' concordance with clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients with dementia.

Design

Unblinded, cluster randomized pre-test-post-test controlled trial involving 35 practices in the UK.

Methods

Patients with a diagnosis of probable or confirmed dementia were identified in practices, and permission sought from the older person and/or their carer to study the medical records of these patients. Medical records were reviewed using a data extraction tool designed for the study and based on published guidelines, and unweighted scores for diagnostic concordance and management concordance were calculated.

Results

We reviewed 450 records of patients aged 75 and over with a diagnosis of dementia and found that: only 4% of cases were identified first in secondary care; two-thirds of those identified in primary care were referred immediately; about one-third identified had informant history and blood tests documented at the Index consultation and one-fifth underwent cognitive function testing.

Discussion

The records analysed in this study came from a period before the Quality Outcomes Framework and show that the documentation in primary care of the diagnostic process in dementia syndromes is good, although there were significant gaps, particularly around depression case-finding. Information about management processes were less evident in the records.

Older adult depression and comorbidity — clinical implications include co-occurrence with chronic medical conditions and links to cognitive decline. Depression in older adults typically co-occurs with other chronic medical disorders, amplifying disability, and enhancing care for depression was related to lower levels of pain as well as higher quality of life and functional status among older adults with comorbid depression and arthritis. Depression in older adults either coexists with or foreshadows the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, and a meta-analysis found a link between depression in older adults and risk of dementia, including both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, with risk particularly high for vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease.

In some instances, the MCI syndrome is due to a disease where disclosing a diagnosis of MCI may not be as relevant. For example, patients with depression may experience cognitive impairment as well as depressive symptoms. It may not facilitate the patients' management or understanding of the underlying depression causing the cognitive impairment if the patient is diagnosed with MCI. Instead, cognitive impairment may be better explained to the patient as a part of depression. However, this will vary from patient to patient, and in some patients with depression, it may be relevant to disclose a diagnosis of MCI due to depression. When disclosing a diagnosis of MCI, terms such as a form of mild dementia, predementia, or no dementia should be avoided, as this may cause confusion with regard to the diagnosis and may be associated with negative connotations, because not all patients with MCI will progress to dementia [11].

The physician may be uncertain with regard to the interpretation of biomarkers due to a conflicting biomarker pattern, unusual clinical presentation, or a complex medical history. Uncertainty may also stem from a lack of knowledge on the part of the physician [20]. Knowledge of and experience with MCI and dementia is essential to mitigate such situations, and together with the complexity of the diagnostic disclosure procedure underline the importance of an experienced physician carrying this out.

A plan for follow‐up should be presented along with the diagnosis. Depending on the underlying causes and diagnostic uncertainty, follow‐up may include additional diagnostic tests and may be carried out in less‐specialized settings and with variable frequency.

Prebiomarker sampling counseling

Biomarkers relevant to the underlying cause and prognostication of MCI may include a number of biological measures. In the present context we refer to investigations beyond structural imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), neuropsychological assessment, and blood samples, which includes cerebrospinal fluid sampling and positron emission tomography imaging. It is important to highlight that, like dementia, the cause of MCI may potentially be reversible, such as tumors or vitamin deficiency, and further progression may be preventable (e.g. with vascular risk factors), and thus all biomarkers may hold important clues to the diagnosis. Another common and treatable cause is depression [37], an important differential diagnosis for the physician to consider. For these reasons and because the delineation of MCI from dementia may be difficult, withholding diagnostic procedures in individual patients because they have MCI as opposed to dementia may not be appropriate. For biomarkers of AD pathology, appropriate use criteria have been published [38, 39].

INTRODUCTION

The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was coined in the 1980s [1] and brought to the attention of a wider audience as a diagnostic entity from the mid‐1990s and onward using operational diagnostic criteria [2, 3, 4, 5]. With advancing understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the MCI label is used in two ways, as an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome based on clinical and neuropsychological criteria (i.e. MCI in its original sense) and as a clinical diagnosis of a certain stage of AD (i.e. MCI due to AD). This development became possible by the incorporation of biomarkers for AD [6, 7, 8] into the diagnostic framework, although the clinical presentation of MCI may be caused by many other disorders.

A patient with MCI will display a syndrome consisting of cognitive impairment but preserved activities of daily living, and a proportion of patients will have evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative brain disorder and progress to dementia. However, the outcome and course of MCI varies considerably dependent on the underlying cause. Population‐based studies have demonstrated that a large proportion of patients with MCI will remain stable or revert back to normal cognition, although estimates vary from study to study [9, 10, 11]. This underlines the difficulty in prognostication. Given the fact that MCI may be caused by very different underlying diseases, spanning from nonprogressive potentially reversible disorders, such as depression, to progressive and ultimately deadly neurodegenerative diseases, careful diagnostic evaluation is paramount to identify the underlying etiology. These considerations were also part of the reasons for a recent American Academy of Neurology Guideline recommending serial cognitive assessments in patients with MCI [12].

### Differential diagnoses and assessment of depression in elderly patients [^114QzqgF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Depression in the elderly contributes to decreased quality of life and increased mortality from both suicide and medical illnesses, yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in these patients. Physicians should be aware of the varying presentations of depression in older adults and differentiate late-life depression from other psychiatric diagnoses. Thorough medical and cognitive assessments are necessary to determine whether late-life depression is due to underlying medical causes and neurologic diagnoses such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Depression rating scales, cognitive screening instruments, and structural and functional neuroimaging studies may be implemented as the situation requires. Greater recognition and more aggressive treatment of depression in older patients are needed.

Section 1: Systematic medical follow‐up in dementia

Background for systematic medical follow‐up in dementia

Many patients with dementia are not followed by a medical doctor after initial diagnosis or may only be followed regularly for less than a year. Although no disease‐modifying treatment is available for any of the neurodegenerative dementias, adequate management of associated medical conditions may reduce the burden of disease and functional decline [17, 18, 19]. In patients with dementia, some guidelines recommend that patients should be followed by a specialist (e.g. neurologist or psychiatrist or geriatrician) [20]. However, many patients with dementia may never see a specialist [21]. Lack of insight and autonomy, an early and prominent symptom in many patients with dementia [22], may diminish the ability to make decisions about treatment [23] and is also associated with caregiver burden [24]. Cognitive and non‐cognitive symptoms of dementia may constitute some of the barriers which impair access to medical care for patients with dementia [25].

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^114sNXnu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### What should we know about dementia in the 21st century? A Delphi consensus study [^112KeJaJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Symptoms and progression

The expert group agreed that dementia affects people across multiple domains. Important symptoms that should be recognized include behavioural changes, memory impairments, and difficulties with executive functioning. The expert group agreed that communication with a person with dementia is possible even in later stages of the condition. The international literature has established an evidence base for the symptoms of dementia across a spectrum of cognitive, functional, behavioural, psychiatric, and physical domains that interrupt daily life of a person with dementia. Recognition of symptoms of the condition is important for timely diagnosis and an assessment of the underlying pathology, which may affect treatment and management of the condition. The focus on communication and the capacity for people with dementia to retain the ability to comprehend and interact (including non-verbal communication) is supported in the literature and reflects experts' views that communication, in varying degrees and types, is possible (though often difficult) even as dementia affects a range of domains and manifests with complex and challenging symptoms. The capacity for continued communication has important implications for the provision of person-centred care and the maintenance of close relationships in the later stages of the condition.

Diagnosis and assessment

With regards to diagnosis and treatment, the expert group regarded prevalent typologies and co-existing conditions to be important for understanding the condition. The expert group agreed that Alzheimer's disease is currently the most prevalent form of dementia. They also contended that a person with dementia should be assessed to determine whether they are experiencing co-existing and treatable physical and psychiatric symptoms, including depression, pain, and delirium. Alzheimer's disease is acknowledged as the most common form of dementia internationally, accounting for more than two thirds of diagnosed cases. It is important for caregivers and health professionals to recognize the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the context of their professional practice and amongst the spectrum of diseases that cause dementia in order to understand symptomatology and provide more effective treatment and care that is aligned with the expected course of the condition. People with dementia can have a reduced quality of life resulting from factors including unrecognized pain, depression, and delirium. If a person with dementia cannot express themselves in a way that is comprehensible to their care giver, or if a care giver is not attuned to the signs and symptoms of co-existing and treatable medical and psychological conditions, then reduced quality of life may result. An understanding of the potential consequences of co-existing conditions and the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease may prompt increased vigilance among carers and health professionals and result in better care for people experiencing dementia.

Dementia describes when a person has cognitive limitations that impede function. Persons with kidney disease are unduly impacted by dementia: up to 87% of the dialysis population has cognitive impairment. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis and management of dementia, including the role of cerebrovascular disease and other risk factors. We review the available screening tools for the diagnosis of dementia. We discuss how the diagnosis of dementia differs from the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and also detail how delirium and depression can mimic dementia. In terms of treatments for dementia, we highlight 4 components. First, we describe pharmacologic treatments for the management of dementia, including the cholinesterase inhibitors N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists as well as the newer antiamyloid antibody drugs for Alzheimer dementia. Second, we discuss the importance of nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of dementia, especially exercise. Third, we review approaches for the behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with dementia, including potential medication management. Fourth, we highlight the essential and valuable role of caregivers in both the diagnosis and management of dementia. We conclude with key considerations about the impact of dementia for persons receiving dialysis and the role of dementia in kidney transplant evaluation.

Noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia (aggression, agitation, depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, apathy, disinhibition) affect individuals with dementia nearly universally across dementia stages and etiologies. NPS are associated with poor outcomes for individuals with dementia and caregivers, including excess morbidity and mortality, greater healthcare use, and earlier nursing home placement, as well as caregiver stress, depression, and difficulty with employment. Although the Food and Drug Administration has not approved pharmacotherapy for NPS, psychotropic medications are frequently used to manage these symptoms, but in the few cases of proven pharmacological efficacy, significant risk of adverse effects may offset benefits. There is evidence of efficacy and limited potential for adverse effects of nonpharmacological treatments, typically considered first line, but their uptake as preferred treatments remains inadequate in real-world clinical settings. Thus, the field currently finds itself in a predicament in terms of management of these difficult symptoms. It was in this context that the University of Michigan Program for Positive Aging, working in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Center for Innovative Care in Aging sponsored and convened a multidisciplinary expert panel in Detroit, Michigan, in fall 2011 with three objectives: to define critical elements of care for NPS in dementia; to construct an approach describing the sequential and iterative steps of managing NPS in real-world clinical settings that can be used as a basis for integrating nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches; and to discuss how the approach generated could be implemented in research and clinical care.

### Advances in management of neuropsychiatric syndromes in neurodegenerative diseases [^112KbV99]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

In cases of severe depression when the patient is suicidal or when other NPS cluster together (e.g. agitation or/and aggression) or in situations of high risk of self- harm or self-neglect, general guidelines for treating depression in the geriatric population should be considered. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recommends a trial of an antidepressant to treat clinically significant, persistent depressed mood in patients with dementia, and SSRIs are preferred because of their favorable safety profile. Sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram in low doses are the most appropriate first-line agents. Other SSRIs like fluoxetine and paroxetine are not recommended as a first-line SSRI due to uncertain efficacy or unfavorable (mostly anticholinergic) side effects. The dose might be incrementally increased, if tolerated, to a maximum of 150 mg of sertraline or 40 mg of citalopram per day with close monitoring of side effects. Although improvement should occur within 4 to 6 weeks at the target dose, a longer period may be required to reach full effect.

If patients do not respond to the SSRI, switching to a different agent or augmenting treatment with a second agent should be considered. Following the "therapeutic metaphor" mentioned above, an atypical antipsychotic in a small dose is appropriate for patients who have psychotic symptoms or agitation along with depression. An anticonvulsant in smaller doses (the best evidence is for carbamazepine) might be considered as additional therapy to an antidepressant if there is moderate or severe agitation.

Switching antidepressants to a different class (as opposed to augmentation) is recommended in cases with severe side effects induced by the initial medication. Preferred second-line agents are SNRIs such as venlafaxine or duloxetine or antidepressants with a mixed pharmacology (mirtazapine, bupropion). Evidence for benefit from use of non-SSRI antidepressants specifically for depression in AD is lacking. Tricyclic antidepressants are generally not recommended due to anticholinergic side effects.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

### Antidepressant medications in dementia: evidence and potential mechanisms of treatment-resistance [^114M8pJV]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Depression in dementia is common, disabling and causes significant distress to patients and carers. Despite widespread use of antidepressants for depression in dementia, there is no evidence of therapeutic efficacy, and their use is potentially harmful in this patient group. Depression in dementia has poor outcomes and effective treatments are urgently needed. Understanding why antidepressants are ineffective in depression in dementia could provide insight into their mechanism of action and aid identification of new therapeutic targets. In this review we discuss why depression in dementia may be a distinct entity, current theories of how antidepressants work and how these mechanisms of action may be affected by disease processes in dementia. We also consider why clinicians continue to prescribe antidepressants in dementia, and novel approaches to understand and identify effective treatments for patients living with depression and dementia.

Formulation and implementation of a treatment plan — site of care and visit frequency in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias emphasizes a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach with cautious change management and regular review. The treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is inherently multidisciplinary and multimodal, and choice of specific treatments begins with the establishment of a specific diagnosis and an assessment of the symptoms being experienced by that patient; a multimodal approach is often used, combining behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions as available and appropriate. When multiple agents or approaches are being used and problems persist (or new problems develop), it is advisable, if possible, to make one change at a time so that the effect of each change can be assessed, and the continuing utility of interventions must be regularly reevaluated. The site of treatment for an individual with dementia is determined by the need to provide safe and effective treatment in the least restrictive setting, and approximately two-thirds of patients with dementia live at home and receive care on an outpatient basis. The frequency of office or facility visits is determined by a number of factors, including the patient's clinical status, the likelihood that new problems will arise, and the need for specific monitoring of treatment effects; another factor is the reliability and skill of the patient's caregivers, particularly regarding the likelihood of their notifying the clinician if a clinically important change occurs. Most dementias are progressive, and symptoms change over time.

### Assessment and management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^115fpye1]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of inappropriate behaviors. One or more of these symptoms will affect nearly all people with dementia over the course of their illness. These symptoms are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, and they lead to a myriad of poor patient health outcomes, healthcare problems, and income loss for family care givers. The causes include neurobiologically related disease factors; unmet needs; care giver factors; environmental triggers; and interactions of individual, care giver, and environmental factors. The complexity of these symptoms means that there is no "one size fits all solution", and approaches tailored to the patient and the care giver are needed. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be used first line, although several exceptions are discussed. Non-pharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base involve family care giver interventions. Regarding pharmacologic treatments, antipsychotics have the strongest evidence base, although the risk to benefit ratio is a concern. An approach to integrating non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments is described. Finally, the paradigm shift needed to fully institute tailored treatments for people and families dealing with these symptoms in the community is discussed.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia in family practice [^115yCM97]. Aging & Mental Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Improving quality of care for people with dementia is a high priority. Considerable resources have been invested in financial incentives, guideline development, public awareness and educational programmes to promote earlier diagnosis and better management.

Objectives

Evaluating family physicians' concordance with guidelines on diagnosis and management of people with dementia, from first documentation of symptoms to formal diagnosis.

Method

Analysis of medical records of 136 people with dementia recruited by 19 family practices in NW London and surrounding counties.

Results

Practices invited 763 people with dementia to participate, 167 (22%) agreed. Complete records were available for 136 (18%). The majority of records included reference to recommended blood tests, informant history and caregiver concerns. Presence or absence of symptoms of depression, psychosis, other behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and cognitive function tests were documented in 30%-40% of records. Documentation of discussions about signs and symptoms of dementia, treatment options, care, support, financial, legal and advocacy advice were uncommon. Comparison of these findings from a similar study in 2000–2002 suggests improvements in concordance with blood tests, recording informant history, presence or absence of depression or psychosis symptoms. There was no difference in documenting cognitive function tests. Immediate referral to specialists was more common in the recent study.

Conclusion

Five years after UK dementia guidelines and immediately after the launch of the dementia strategy, family physicians appeared concordant with clinical guidelines for dementia diagnosis (other than cognitive function tests), and referred most patients immediately. However, records did not suggest systematic dementia management.

### Diagnostic journey and management of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia: a multinational, real-world survey [^113mA71T]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges of timely diagnosis

Many patients in the current study were diagnosed at a stage beyond MCI, reflected by a mean MMSE score of 22.0 at initial consultation and a score of 21.6 at initial diagnosis. This indicates a crucial need for reducing the time to diagnosis and increasing rates of timely detection. Yet, physicians face challenges to making a timely diagnosis, including delays to initial consultation, the variation in initial symptom presentation by patients, resource and capacity constraints, time pressures on routine appointments, and healthcare financing policies. In the current study, over half of specialists reported that patients delayed seeking help due to lack of awareness and/or stigma, and just under half reported that a key barrier is a lack of understanding about what is part of normal aging. There is a need to address the negative impacts of AD stigma, and interventions to tackle this at the individual, societal, and institutional level have been proposed including interactive contact-based approaches, targeted education, and person-centered care. Variation in symptoms and lack of routinely available testing, the availability of HCPs to interpret results or simply patients' reluctance to undergo diagnostic tests were also reported as key barriers to timely diagnosis. Taken collectively, these results show that significant barriers exist to timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with MCI and AD with mild dementia.

Neuropsychiatric assessment in dementia — prevalence, monitoring, and target symptoms: Ninety percent of patients with dementia develop a neuropsychiatric or behavioral symptom during the course of the disease, so it is important for the psychiatrist to periodically assess for noncognitive psychiatric symptoms and for progression of cognitive decline, with regular monitoring to detect new symptoms and adapt treatment. In Alzheimer's disease, depression is reported more commonly early in the illness, whereas delusions and hallucinations are more common in the middle and later stages, and it is particularly important to look for the emergence of such symptoms after a medication dose has been lowered or discontinued. Ongoing assessment should address depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, aggressive behavior, disinhibition, sexually inappropriate behavior, anxiety, apathy, and disturbances of appetite and sleep; cognitive symptoms that almost always require assessment include impairments in memory, executive function, language, judgment, and spatial abilities, and it is often helpful to track cognitive status with a structured mental status examination while watching for practice effects if the same instrument is used repeatedly.

Position statement

Our study reinforces the importance of having multidisciplinary teams involved in the care of patients with cognitive complaints, especially in the field of FCD. Given that FCD is a likely common cause for cognitive symptoms, continuous work is required to improve screening and diagnostic workflow. In an era when efforts to improve diagnostic specificity of neurodegenerative conditions are increasing, this should also apply to the non‐neurodegenerative field. Namely, further positive diagnostic signs and diagnostic decision tools to support clinicians in differentiating FCD from other causes of cognitive impairment are needed to enable earlier diagnosis and increase specificity. Variability in the framing of early stages of SCI/MCI and FCD, with competing conceptual models, underscores the need for better guidance and efforts to produce standardised diagnostic approaches. Importantly, identifiable clinical characteristics that enabled diagnostic formulation of a reasonably consistent diagnosis among these experts merit further consideration and clearer classification, and should be further validated and operationalised, including in settings with less expertise in cognitive neurology. Neuropsychology can be very informative both in diagnosis and treatment of FCD, particularly in cases where history and bedside testing are incongruent; however, there is a lack of consensus and regional variability regarding how and when this should be used. Given the complexity of cognitive syndromes, an FCD diagnosis needs careful consideration, particularly in the presence of comorbidities such as sleep disorders, fatigue, mood disorders and anxiety. It should not be a 'dustbin diagnosis' for everything that is not neurodegeneration. However, clinical experience and published reports of improvement in patients with FCD who underwent various treatments support the need for better awareness about this condition and the establishment of an accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning. Further studies are needed to understand the trajectory of FCD and its relationship with other conditions such as depression and anxiety, FND and neurodegeneration. Moreover, contemporary views admit that FCD and neurodegeneration are not mutually exclusive, both because FCD can occur in the prodromal stage in a subset of patients, and AD pathology can coexist with FCD as an incidental finding as we age. So, further work is required to improve the early separation of these diagnostic entities and identify those individuals who might be at a hypothetical higher risk of future neurodegeneration. The growing knowledge on FCD allows for effective communication of the diagnosis, mechanistically informed discussions about prognosis, and incorporation of education elements and other strategies such as behavioural activation in treatment plans. This study also emphasises the striking need for evidence‐based interventions for FCD that might improve prognosis and influence decisions about follow‐up, so we encourage future research which can inform such interventions. Non‐neurodegenerative cognitive syndromes have been traditionally overlooked and under‐researched but require further attention, especially given the growing numbers of people attending memory clinics with non‐neurodegenerative causes for memory symptoms.

### Depression in Alzheimer's disease: epidemiology, mechanisms, and management [^112rUbjV]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Depression occurs with a high prevalence of up to 50% in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and increases the caregivers' burden. Depression symptoms can precede clinical diagnosis of AD for years or occurs around the onset of AD, although the etiology and pathologic mechanism of depression in AD pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we provide an overview on recent studies, indicating that genetic factors, neuroanatomic changes, vascular risk factors, and the imbalance of neurotransmitters might contribute to depressive symptoms in AD. Tau pathology and amyloid-β accumulation also correlate with depression in AD. In addition, the alteration of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory pathway, and neurotrophin deficiency are the possible biological mechanisms linking depression and AD, and might become the potential targets for AD treatment. Current data support that antidepressants are promising to alleviate the symptom, though the efficacy is controversial. Moreover, antidementia medication and non-pharmacological interventions can be potential choices. In this review, we describe the prevalence and clinical course of depression in AD, analyze the underlying mechanisms, and discuss the possible management strategies for depression in patients with AD.

### Optimising diagnosis and post-diagnostic support for people living with dementia: geriatricians' views [^116gJJtn]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Identifying symptoms of dementia and receiving a diagnosis as early as possible can provide those diagnosed and their families with more opportunities to learn about the condition and organise appropriate support. However, in Australia there is an average of 3.1 years between first noticing dementia symptoms and receiving a confirmed diagnosis. While consumers report wanting to know as soon as possible if they had dementia, some research has shown that only half of patients who receive positive dementia screening results wish to receive further assessment. This discrepancy highlights the importance of considering individual consumer preferences in obtaining a diagnosis. As opposed to early diagnosis, timely diagnosis refers to delivery of a diagnosis at the right time for an individual, taking into consideration their circumstances and preferences.

Increased expectations on providers to improve timeliness of a diagnosis of dementia may lead to less thorough symptom assessment and inaccuracies in diagnosis. Given symptoms of dementia overlap with other conditions such as depression, there is potential for either missed dementia diagnoses (i.e. false negatives), or misdiagnosis of other conditions as dementia (i.e. false positives). Missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis can deprive the individual and their families of opportunities to obtain needed dementia-specific support and care, place unnecessary burden on the individual diagnosed and their families, and may lead to inappropriate management of the underlying condition. Therefore the drive to increase timeliness of diagnosis should be accompanied by strategies to improve diagnostic accuracy. Several patient, provider and system level barriers exist to obtaining a timely and accurate diagnosis, including patients' reluctance to acknowledge symptoms, lack of training and confidence among health care providers to accurately diagnose dementia, and lack of accessibility of specialist providers in less populated areas.

Changing needs of people with dementia

The progressive nature of dementia provides the framing for the final Guideline chapter, which makes recommendations around palliative care approaches and future care planning. Transitions of care, such as hospital discharge or moving-in to long-term care, provide important triggers to review, update or initiate care planning that captures needs and wishes, including care and support plans.

Palliative and end-of-life care approaches

A key challenge when supporting people with dementia is around definitions of end-of-life, as distinct from the broader framework of palliative and supportive care. Palliative care is conceptualised as on-going from diagnosis to end of life. The evidence considered leads to a key recommendation that existing measures to define end of life in people with dementia, based on cognition and ambulatory function, may be ineffective and may not recognise unmet needs at end of life. This is an important consideration for healthcare professionals who are advised to focus on the needs of the individual rather than defined disease stages. Furthermore, dementia is recognised as a common cause of death, and education should be available for families and carers to understand how this occurs.

Some recommendations are reproduced from the NICE guideline on dementia:

▪ From diagnosis, offer people living with dementia flexible, needs-based palliative care that takes into account how unpredictable dementia progression can be.
▪ For people living with dementia who are approaching the end of life, use an anticipatory healthcare planning process. Involve the person and their family members or carers (as appropriate) as far as possible, and use the principles of best-interest decision-making if the person does not have capacity to make decisions about their care.

Transitions between care settings

Holistic, person-centred approaches should be considered when people with dementia transition between care settings. This includes identifying unmet needs such as depression, physical decline (evidenced by falls or walking and balance issues) and problems with basic activities of daily living. Having identified unmet needs, there is an opportunity to set person-centred goals and make care plans to address these needs and signpost to or link with appropriate services that offer support. It is recognised that transitions into long-term care often occur when a person is in the more advanced stages of their illness and their involvement in goal-setting may be more challenging. Early discussions are recommended to identify an individual's expected needs, goals and plans to support their transition when the time arises.

### Effectiveness of a specific care plan in patients with Alzheimer's disease: cluster randomised trial (PLASA study) [^113j1Ved]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Several authoritative groups have published consensus guidelines for the care of patients with Alzheimer's disease and suggested regular follow-up, with evaluation and management of behavioural disturbances, psychoses, and depression; active monitoring and support of the caregiver's emotional and physical health; and consideration of treatment with specific drugs. The guidelines are based mostly on the scientific literature. They also include some empirical guidelines; for example, on the frequency of follow-up assessments. However, the literature reveals some serious deficits in the quality of patient management in clinical practice.

Randomised trials of interventions aiming to improve outcomes for patients with dementia are few, and those that do exist have reported limited impacts in primary and residential care. Because of the multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease, comprehensive, guideline based interventions for dementia care would seem to be a well suited approach. Some questions remain, however, about the setting in which follow-up and comprehensive assessments should be carried out (primary care versus memory clinics), as well as the feasibility and real impact of these guidelines. To our knowledge, no large scale interventional studies integrating a comprehensive, guideline based, intervention for care of patients with dementia in memory clinics have been carried out to date.

We carried out a cluster randomised trial at national level to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive specific care plan in decreasing the rate of functional decline in community dwelling patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease compared with usual care in memory clinics.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treatment-resistant depression in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11458W9n]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the leading global cause of disability, affecting around 13% of older people, of whom a third meet the criteria for treatment resistance. Mental disorders (most commonly depression and anxiety) account for 10.6% of disability-adjusted life years among older adults. Antidepressant use by older people with depression is increasing, but the condition remains under-recognised and undertreated, and is more commonly resistant to treatment in this age group. Globally, around a quarter of deaths from suicide (27.2%) are among people aged 60 years or over. Depression may increase the risk of developing dementia.

The Food and Drugs Association defines treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as 'inadequate response to at least two antidepressants, where there was an acceptable treatment trial and adherence'. This definition does not account for psychological treatment, effective at treating late life depression. Lifestyle, such as dietary changes, can also be useful adjuncts to therapy. People with TRD have lower quality of life, activity impairment and use more healthcare resources than people with non-resistant depression and the general population.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) therapeutic guidelines for depression (NG222)unresponsive to initial treatment recommend increasing the dose, switching agents, adding psychological therapies or augmenting treatment with antidepressant medication, second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, electroconvulsive therapy, lamotrigine or triiodothyronine (liothyronine). Nuñez et al compared the efficacy of augmentation agents in TRD, finding the strongest evidence for atypical antipsychotics, thyroid hormones, dopamine compounds and lithium. Additional NICE guidelines support the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression.

Most evidence underpinning TRD therapeutic guidelines derives from research with younger adults, but optimal treatment of depression in older and younger populations may differ. Higher rates of physical and cognitive comorbidity, greater likelihood of polypharmacy and age-related pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes that increase susceptibility to side effects mean that specific guidelines for clinicians treating older adults with TRD are of value.

### The identification, assessment and management of difficult-to-treat depression: an international consensus statement [^111YRew7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many depressed patients are not able to achieve or sustain symptom remission despite serial treatment trials - often termed "treatment resistant depression". A broader, perhaps more empathic concept of "difficult-to-treat depression" (DTD) was considered.

Methods

A consensus group discussed the definition, clinical recognition, assessment and management implications of the DTD heuristic.

Results

The group proposed that DTD be defined as "depression that continues to cause significant burden despite usual treatment efforts". All depression management should include a thorough initial assessment. When DTD is recognized, a regular reassessment that employs a multi-dimensional framework to identify addressable barriers to successful treatment (including patient-, illness- and treatment-related factors) is advised, along with specific recommendations for addressing these factors. The emphasis of treatment, in the first instance, shifts from a goal of remission to optimal symptom control, daily psychosocial functional and quality of life, based on a patient-centred approach with shared decision-making to enhance the timely consideration of all treatment options (including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, neurostimulation, etc.) to optimize outcomes when sustained remission is elusive.

Limitations

The recommended definition and management of DTD is based largely on expert consensus. While DTD would seem to have clinical utility, its specificity and objectivity may be insufficient to define clinical populations for regulatory trial purposes, though DTD could define populations for service provision or phase 4 trials.

Conclusions

DTD provides a clinically useful conceptualization that implies a search for and remediation of specific patient-, illness- and treatment obstacles to optimizing outcomes of relevance to patients.

Future research needs in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — priority areas include evaluation and assessment improvements, such as better detection and evaluation of dementia in the prodromal and early stages; identification of specific biomarkers and refinements in imaging techniques to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning; earlier and more accurate detection of noncognitive symptoms; more accurate assessments of potentially dangerous behaviors such as driving; development of more clinically meaningful outcome measures, more refined neuropsychological tests, functional assessments, and wider use of "hard" endpoints such as institutionalization and mortality; pharmacologic advances with medications that improve cognition or halt progression, including agents that prevent plaque deposition, inhibit beta and gamma secretase, remove plaque and insoluble amyloid fragments, and prevent the formation of and remove neurofibrillary tangles (tau deposition), along with neuroprotective, neurotropic (nerve cell growth factors and cell transplants), and antioxidant approaches; medications that directly enhance cognition by activating intact cognitive systems; targeted therapies for other dementing disorders and efforts to prevent stroke and decrease its destructive effect on brain tissue as important avenues for prevention; optimal pharmacological treatment of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms (psychosis, agitation, depression, sleep disturbance) with a critical need for well-designed, randomized, controlled trials given reliance on small uncontrolled studies; and further study of psychosocial, psychotherapeutic, and behavioral interventions, with particular importance of randomized controlled trials or alternatives, including that one aspect of dementia care that deserves further study is the rehabilitation model.

### Adapted problem adaptation therapy for depression in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia: a randomized controlled trial [^1168PABb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Depression in people with dementia is common, frequently severe and associated with reduced quality of life and functioning and increased institutionalization. We chose eight sessions for the trial for reasons of cost and potential scalability and because England's National Institute for Health and Social Care Excellence guideline for treatment and management of depression in adultsrecommends eight‐session psychological interventions for depression, though for more severe depression and depression comorbid with other problems, at least 16 sessions are recommended. Although adapted PATH did not show efficacy at the trial's 6‐month primary outcome point, small numerical benefits in mood and quality of life close to the end of the eight sessions of therapy suggest that future trials should examine longer treatment periods as well as potential benefits of combining adapted PATH with antidepressants, along with other components of comprehensive dementia care management.

Psychosocial treatments in dementia — behavior, emotion, cognition, and stimulation oriented approaches share goals and expected effects. These more specific psychosocial treatments for dementia can be divided into behavior oriented, emotion oriented, cognition oriented, and stimulation oriented, and although these treatment approaches differ, they share the broadly overlapping goals of improving quality of life and maximizing function in the context of existing deficits. Because these treatments generally do not provide lasting effects, those that can be offered regularly may be the most practical and beneficial; these treatments are generally delivered daily or weekly, and the choice of therapy is generally based on the patient's characteristics and preference, availability of the therapy, and cost. Behavioral techniques and interventions are in wide clinical use with patients who have difficult-to-manage behavioral problems; there is some evidence for modest benefits of such therapies, particularly while the intervention is ongoing, but additional well-designed clinical trials are needed, and there is also some evidence that behavioral interventions can reduce patients' depressive symptoms. Stimulation-oriented treatments are often included in care; they provide environmental stimulation recognized as part of humane care, and modest efficacy data exist that support their use for improving mood and reducing behavioral disturbances. Emotion-oriented treatments are often used to address issues of loss and to improve mood and behavior; although there is modest research support for the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy for improvement of mood and behavior, none of these modalities has been subjected to rigorous scientific testing. Cognition-oriented treatments may provide mild short-term improvements in selected domains of cognition, but such improvements, when achieved, are not lasting.

Development and implementation of a stage-specific treatment plan — the treatment of dementia varies through the course of the illness, because symptoms evolve over time, and although many symptoms can and do occur throughout the illness, certain symptoms are typical of the broad stages. This outline of stages conforms most to the typical course of Alzheimer's disease, but it does not apply as well to other types of dementias, particularly the frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders. The following sections provide general recommendations for treating patients in three stages of illness (mild, moderate, and severe) and specific recommendations for the implementation of selected psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments.

### Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis [^113qyo7V]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Several factors modified the association between depression and the risk of all-cause late-life dementia. For late-life depression, a shorter follow-up duration was linked to a stronger association with dementia risk, suggesting that depressive symptoms occurring closer to dementia onset may reflect prodromal features of dementia. Only two late-life study utilised a geriatric depression measure, which may more accurately represent the experience of late life depression including social withdrawal, apathy, and boredom without measuring overt somatic or physical symptoms.

These findings have significant implications for clinical practice and public health, highlighting the importance of managing depression across the life-course. Our results support the inclusion of depression in population attributable risk models for the global burden of dementia. Considering regional disparities in depression prevalence and dementia incidence in the Global Burden of Disease studies, targeted efforts are essential in areas with the highest needs. While the 2024 Commission shifted focus toward midlife depression, our findings suggest that late-life depression remains a critical period of dementia risk, and thus, identification and intervention for depression is required at both life stages. For individuals with depression, opportune access to effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, such as psychological therapies, may mitigate the risk of progression to dementia. Our findings suggest that although depression emerging near dementia onset may partly reflect prodromal changes, it nonetheless represents a potentially modifiable risk factor, as timely and effective intervention could mitigate the progression of cognitive decline. Future research should therefore prioritise controlled intervention studies to evaluate whether depression treatment reduces dementia risk, complemented by standardised longitudinal investigations incorporating neuroimaging and biomarker assessments to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this association. Moreover, research is also needed to test whether interventions that promote physical activity and other lifestyle changes as strategies to support mental health treatment and recovery can support dementia risk reduction.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^115kXpU8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Mental health and neurocognitive screening recommendations for persons living with HIV and chronic pain emphasize routine assessment with validated tools and follow-up thresholds: Clinicians should fully review a patient's baseline mental health status for modifiable factors that can impact successful pain management, and all patients should be routinely screened for depression with the following 2 questions about the past 2 weeks regarding being bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless and by little interest or pleasure in doing things, with a follow-up question asking if help is wanted when either answer is affirmative. The patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is recommended as a screening tool in clinical settings without access to trained mental health professionals; psychiatric follow-up is recommended for a score that is ≥ 10 (88% sensitivity and 88% specificity for major depression). All patients should be screened for comorbid neurocognitive disorders prior to and during use of long-term opioid therapy, and it is recommended that all patients with chronic pain have a full neuropsychiatric evaluation with history, physical, and use of the HIV dementia scale or an equivalent to document baseline capacity.
