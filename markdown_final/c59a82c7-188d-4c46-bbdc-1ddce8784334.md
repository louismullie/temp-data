## Question

What is the normal range for HOMA-IR values?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a "normal" HOMA-IR range and how to interpret HOMA-IR values across populations and contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the HOMA-IR formula and the physiological assumptions embedded in it. Then, I should verify population-specific "normal" ranges from large cohorts and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine how thresholds vary by age, sex, puberty, and ethnicity. After that, I need to check how clinical context shifts cutoffs, including metabolic syndrome, PCOS, obesity, and pregnancy. Finally, I should review assay variability and practical limitations before synthesizing a cautious, clinically usable interpretation framework [^117Beop1] [^11137G2Q].

> Let me first confirm the calculation and the model's intent. HOMA-IR is typically calculated as fasting insulin (µU/mL) multiplied by fasting glucose (mmol/L) divided by 22.5, or equivalently as fasting insulin (µU/mL) times fasting glucose (mg/dL) divided by 405, and it assumes steady-state fasting physiology with hepatic glucose output and basal insulin secretion in balance; higher values reflect greater insulin resistance, whereas lower values reflect greater insulin sensitivity [^117QNGwV] [^112rkR4Q] [^113x1qEs].

> Wait, let me verify the "physiological normal" anchor. The original model was calibrated so that a HOMA-IR near 1.0 corresponds to normal insulin sensitivity in a healthy reference state, but this is a theoretical construct and real-world distributions vary by population and assay, so I should not over-interpret 1.0 as a universal cutoff without context [^112rkR4Q] [^1142kCaR].

> Next, I should review adult population data to anchor "normal" ranges. In a large Iranian population-based study of healthy adults, the mean HOMA-IR was 2.11 ± 0.99 with a 2.5–97.5 percentile spread of 0.66–4.50, suggesting that values around 0.7–2.1 sit within a typical distribution in that cohort; I need to keep in mind that this is population-specific and not a diagnostic standard [^112wzt1r]. In a Spanish adult cohort, when cut points were derived to identify metabolic syndrome rather than percentiles alone, optimal thresholds were around 2.05 overall, with sex-specific values of about 1.85 in men and higher in women, reinforcing that "normal" depends on the clinical question and population [^116esCCZ].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and adolescent data because puberty alters insulin sensitivity. In pre-pubertal European children, median HOMA-IR ranges from roughly 0.4–0.5 at ages 3–4 to about 1.4–1.7 by age 10–11, with girls generally higher than boys, illustrating a physiologic rise with age even in healthy, normal-weight children [^114QMKfg]. In adolescents, transient pubertal insulin resistance peaks around Tanner III, and population-based thresholds at the 95th percentile are commonly cited around 3.0–3.2, with sex-specific peaks higher in boys than girls in some cohorts, and with mean values peaking around ages 12–13 and declining thereafter; I should double-check that these are weight-status–stratified where possible, as obesity shifts distributions upward [^116gSmpw] [^115a8Duo] [^1136Ry5f].

> I need to ensure I account for ethnicity and geography. Asian cohorts, including Chinese children and Korean adolescents, tend to show somewhat lower HOMA-IR distributions than Western cohorts at a given age and BMI, yet the pubertal surge and obesity effect remain consistent; this means that a "normal" value in one region may not translate identically to another without local reference data [^11774sdY] [^115a8Duo] [^1147SKNp].

> Let me consider clinical context next, because thresholds should align with the outcome of interest. For identifying metabolic syndrome in adults, several studies converge on HOMA-IR values around 2.0–2.6 as optimal, balancing sensitivity and specificity, which is lower than percentile-based cutoffs that often sit near 3.0–3.5; this is a good reminder that percentile norms are not necessarily risk-based cut points [^116esCCZ]. In PCOS, lean-control 95th percentiles around 3.16 are commonly used, and an optimal metabolic-risk threshold near 2.64 has been proposed, again lower than a purely percentile-based definition [^115dXKq2]. In obesity research, fasting insulin above about 74 pmol/L (roughly 12 µU/mL) has been used to flag insulin resistance, which typically corresponds to HOMA-IR values above about 2.5–3.0 depending on fasting glucose, illustrating how phenotype-specific criteria can refine interpretation [^112JPMMz].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or has diabetes. During pregnancy, HOMA-IR naturally rises, and in gestational diabetes cohorts, quartile-based severity bands often start around 1.29, with higher ranges indicating greater insulin resistance and different therapeutic implications; this means that "normal" in pregnancy is not comparable to nonpregnant states, and trimester-specific references are needed [^116uybJa] [^115rMptz]. In type 2 diabetes, HOMA-IR is both higher and more variable biologically, so single measurements carry more uncertainty and change over time must exceed biological and analytical variation to be meaningful [^113jAzMc].

> I should confirm assay and methodological limitations before concluding. Insulin assays vary substantially across laboratories, with inter-assay differences of 15–20% or more for HOMA-IR estimates, and preanalytical factors such as sample type and pulsatility can further affect results; therefore, comparing values across platforms or studies is risky without harmonized methods, and clinical decisions should ideally rely on lab-specific reference intervals or standardized assays when possible [^117Beop1] [^113ypTFk] [^11137G2Q]. Short-term within-person variability for HOMA-IR is about 30%, so a change of roughly 2.3 units is needed to exceed the 95% minimum detectable change, which argues for caution when interpreting small differences from a single sample [^114iPKiC].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, population-aware interpretation. For healthy, nonpregnant adults in many cohorts, HOMA-IR values roughly between 0.7 and 2.1 sit within the typical distribution, with values below about 1.0 often reflecting good insulin sensitivity, though this is not a universal diagnostic boundary; values above about 2.5–3.0 are commonly used to flag insulin resistance in research and some clinical contexts, but risk-based thresholds for metabolic syndrome or cardiometabolic risk are often lower, around 2.0–2.6 depending on the population and purpose [^112wzt1r] [^116esCCZ] [^115dXKq2]. In children and adolescents, medians rise from about 0.4–0.5 in early childhood to 1.4–1.7 by late pre-puberty, with pubertal peaks around 3.0–3.5 at the 95th percentile and higher in boys than girls in some datasets; obesity shifts distributions upward, so weight-status–specific percentiles are essential [^114QMKfg] [^11774sdY] [^1136Ry5f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal cutoff. There is no globally accepted "normal" HOMA-IR range because distributions vary by age, sex, puberty, ethnicity, assay, and clinical context; therefore, interpretation should be anchored to local reference populations, the specific clinical question, and, when possible, longitudinal trends within the same assay platform, while recognizing that HOMA-IR is a surrogate of basal hepatic insulin resistance and not a direct measure of whole-body sensitivity [^1147SKNp] [^113x1qEs] [^116y7zYA].

> Finally, I should double-check practical guidance. For individual patient care, avoid over-reliance on a single HOMA-IR value; integrate it with fasting glucose, HbA1c, BMI/waist, lipids, and blood pressure, and consider repeating fasting insulin if results are unexpected or discordant with phenotype, ideally using the same laboratory and ensuring a true fasting state; in pediatrics, professional guidelines caution against routine insulin or HOMA-IR testing for obesity management decisions, underscoring that HOMA-IR is best used as a research or adjunctive tool rather than a standalone diagnostic test [^116svJYu] [^112iX3wH] [^11483PJN].

The normal HOMA-IR range is **0.5–1.4** in healthy adults, with values < 1.0 indicating optimal insulin sensitivity and > 2.9 indicating significant insulin resistance [^1142kCaR]. Cutoffs vary by population and method: **2.5** is commonly used in adults [^115jpVzd], **2.6–3.2** in adolescents (higher during puberty) [^11774sdY] [^115a8Duo], and **1.29–2.89** in gestational diabetes, reflecting pathophysiologic heterogeneity [^116uybJa]. HOMA-IR should be interpreted in clinical context, as assay variability [^117Beop1] and population differences limit universal thresholds [^1147SKNp].

---

## Normal HOMA-IR range in healthy adults

- **Normal range**: 0.5–1.4 in healthy adults [^1142kCaR].
- **Optimal sensitivity**: < 1.0.
- **Significant resistance**: > 2.9.

## Population-specific HOMA-IR cutoffs

| **Population** | **Homa-ir cutoff** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 2.5 | Common clinical threshold [^115jpVzd] |
| Adolescents (pubertal) | 2.6–3.2 | Higher during puberty [^11774sdY] [^115a8Duo] |
| Gestational diabetes | 1.29–2.89 | Pathophysiologic heterogeneity [^116uybJa] |
| PCOS (lean controls) | 1.82 (75th percentile) | Population-specific [^115dXKq2] |
| PCOS (lean controls) | 3.16 (95th percentile) | Population-specific [^115dXKq2] |

## Factors influencing HOMA-IR values

Several factors influence **HOMA-IR values**, including:

- **Age**: Increases with age, especially after 50 [^116Veunn].
- **Sex**: Men generally have higher values than women [^112wzt1r].
- **Ethnicity**: Varies by population [^1147SKNp].
- **BMI**: Strongly correlated with insulin resistance [^1154W75Y].
- **Puberty**: Transient insulin resistance during puberty [^116gSmpw].
- **Assay variability**: Different insulin assays affect results [^117Beop1].

---

## Clinical implications of HOMA-IR values

HOMA-IR is a useful **surrogate marker** of insulin resistance and is associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^112WRgWK]. It is widely used in clinical practice and research to assess insulin resistance and guide interventions [^117DmPaj].

---

## Limitations of HOMA-IR

Despite its widespread use, HOMA-IR has **limitations**:

- **Assay variability**: Insulin assays are not standardized [^117Beop1].
- **Population variability**: Cutoffs vary by population [^1147SKNp].
- **Limited sensitivity**: May not detect early insulin resistance [^115qqeNv].
- **Not for individual diagnosis**: Not recommended for routine clinical diagnosis [^112uS9Az].

---

The normal HOMA-IR range is **0.5–1.4**, but cutoffs vary by population and context. Clinicians should interpret HOMA-IR within the patient's demographic and clinical context, recognizing assay and population variability.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" for polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. It is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) offers insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be provided in different units.

For fasting glucose, you can use:

- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

For fasting insulin, the options are:

- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are given in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = (fasting insulin in uIU/mL * fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.
- Scores of 3 or more reflect severe insulin resistance.

These interpretations help contextualize how the body's insulin management might be impacting health, signaling the potential risk for conditions associated with insulin resistance.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^112By7wv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) is a feature of disorders such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and is also implicated in obesity, hypertension, cancer or autoimmune diseases. Insulin resistance (IR) has been proposed, more than a primary cause, as a sort of final common pathway for negative environmental factors, which interact with the individual genetic background to cause metabolic and hemodynamic alterations and is associated with inflammation.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition is widely used as a practical tool to describe a cluster of clinical signs (central obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism, and elevated blood pressure) that regardless of cause, identifies individuals at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and DM2. The worldwide prevalence of these factors has risen dramatically in recent decades.

The Homeostasis Model Assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) has proved to be a robust tool for the surrogate assessment of IR. However, there is great variability in the threshold HOMA-IR levels to define IR. Population based studies for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of IR had been conducted in different geographic areas. Table 1 shows the cut-off values, as can be seen in most of cases the cutoff point's determination were made on the percentile criterion (80 or 90 according to studies) of values in the general population. However, no studies have examined the ability of proposed cutoff points to identify risk of clinically relevant outcomes. In addition, in these studies the results have been reported without taking into account the possible effects of covariates on test results. However, it is well known that a biomarker's performance and, by extension, its discriminatory capacity can be affected by covariates.

### Insulin resistance in euglycemic cirrhosis [^112rkR4Q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

IR measurement

IR was assessed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment method for the evaluation of IR (HOMA-IR). HOMA was first developed in 1985 by Matthews et al. It is a method used to quantify IR and β-cell function from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin concentrations. HOMA is a model of the relationship of glucose and insulin dynamics that predicts fasting steady-state glucose and insulin concentrations for a wide range of possible combinations of IR and β-cell function. HOMA-IR = (glucose × insulin)/22.5; insulin concentration is reported in μU/L and glucose in mmol/L. The constant of 22.5 is a normalizing factor; i.e., the product of normal fasting plasma insulin of 5 μU/mL, and the normal fasting plasma glucose of 4.5 mmol/L typical of a "normal" healthy individual = 22.5. Value of HOMA-IR more than 1.64 implied the presence of abnormally high IR. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as an alternative surrogate marker of IR, computed as 1/ [log insulin (μU/mL) + log fasting blood sugar (FBS) (mg/dL)]. Value < 0.35 is suggestive for IR. QUICKI is an empirically-derived mathematical transformation of FBS and plasma insulin concentrations that provides a consistent and precise index of insulin sensitivity with better positive predictive power. HOMA-β a parameter reflecting the insulin secretion ability of pancreatic β-cells, was calculated as [360 × insulin (μU/mL)]/FBS (mg/dL) -63]. Estimation with the help of HOMA-β model parallels equally with that of the euglycemic clamp method (r = 0.88).

Statistical analysis

HOMA calculator 2.2 was used to calculate the HOMA IR and HOMA-β values while QUICKI values were calculated with a scientific calculator. Parametric data are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables as percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used for the comparison of dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Whenever more than 2 continuous variables were present, ANOVA one-way analysis was used for calculating the P values. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Spearman and Pearson's coefficient correlation were used to compare the regression coefficient between the two groups. All data were analyzed using the SAS 8.0 statistical package.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^11774sdY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to assess the association between the degree of insulin resistance and the different components of the metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and adolescents. Moreover, to determine the cut-off values for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at MS risk.

Methods

3203 Chinese children aged 6 to 18 years were recruited. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was identified by a modified Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) definition. HOMA-IR index was calculated and the normal reference ranges were defined from the healthy participants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to find the optimal cutoff of HOMA-IR for diagnosis of MS.

Results

With the increase of insulin resistance (quintile of HOMA-IR value), the ORs of suffering MS or its related components were significantly increased. Participants in the highest quintile of HOMA-IR were about 60 times more likely to be classified with metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile group. Similarly, the mean values of insulin and HOMA-IR increased with the number of MS components. The present HOMA-IR cutoff point corresponding to the 95th percentile of our healthy reference children was 3.0 for whole participants, 2.6 for children in prepubertal stage and 3.2 in pubertal period, respectively. The optimal point for diagnosis of MS was 2.3 in total participants, 1.7 in prepubertal children and 2.6 in pubertal adolescents, respectively, by ROC curve, which yielded high sensitivity and moderate specificity for a screening test. According to HOMA-IR > 3.0, the prevalence of insulin resistance in obese or MS children were 44.3% and 61.6% respectively.

Conclusions

Our data indicates insulin resistance is common among Chinese obese children and adolescents, and is strongly related to MS risk, therefore requiring consideration early in life. As a reliable measure of insulin resistance and assessment of MS risk, the optimal HOMA-IR cut-off points in this cohort were developed with variation regarding puberty. HOMA-IR may be useful for early evaluating insulin resistance in children and teenagers and could have a long-term benefit of preventive and diagnostic therapeutic intervention.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^112UwMeJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for healthy reference population

The mean, standard deviation and HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for a healthy reference population according to gender, age and pubertal status are given in Table 3. HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for the total of healthy reference population (normal-metabolic subjects) is 3.0. We find no significant gender difference in HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile. In prepubertal stage, HOMA-IR cut-off value from 95th percentile is 2.6 and so are 3.2 in the pubertal period. Insulin sensitivity reduces in Tanner stage V and almost completely recovered by pubertal completion. The similar result is found in different age ranges. When age is below 10, most of children are in prepubertal stage, the HOMA-IR cut-off value from 95th percentile is 2.1. However, the HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile is rapidly increased to 3.2 when age is up 10 years and most children go into puberty.

### The assessment of insulin resistance in man [^113x1qEs]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance exists when a normal concentration of insulin produces a less than normal biological response. The ability to measure insulin resistance is important in order to understand the aetiopathology of Type 2 diabetes, to examine the epidemiology and to assess the effects of intervention.

Methods

We assess and compare methods of measurement and have undertaken a literature review from 1966 to 2001.

Results

Quantitative estimates of insulin resistance can be obtained using model assessments, clamps or insulin infusion sensitivity tests. There is considerable variation in the complexity and labour intensity of the various methods. The most well-established methods are the euglycaemic clamp, minimal model assessment and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). No single test is appropriate under all circumstances.

Conclusions

There are a number of well-established tests used to measure insulin resistance: the choice of method depends on the size and type of study to be undertaken. Although the so-called 'gold-standard' test, the euglycaemic clamp, is useful for intensive physiological studies on small numbers of subjects, a simpler tool such as HOMA is more appropriate for large epidemiological studies. It is important to be aware that most techniques measure stimulated insulin resistance whereas HOMA gives an estimate of basal insulin resistance. Caution should be exercised when making comparisons between studies due to variations in infusion protocols, sampling procedures and hormone assays used in different studies.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^116gSmpw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Although HOMA-IR is wildly used in population-based studies, many factors involved in the inconsistencies of HOMA-IR should be stressed. Firstly, it is expected to be different in prepubertal and pubertal children as we show in this study. A transient insulin resistance develops in children during puberty. This insulin resistance emerging during pubertal maturation is accepted as a physiological condition rather than pathologic. Some cross-sectional studies have shown that insulin resistance increases with the onset of puberty, makes a peak at Tanner stage 3 and recedes to prepubertal levels at the end of puberty. Longitudinal studies have found a 30% decrease in insulin sensitivity between Tanner stages I and V. However, this decrease was found to return to normal at the end of puberty. In our study, while no difference for gender was detected in HOMA-IR cut-off values, it was higher in the pubertal period than that in the prepubertal period. A similar result was found in the different age phases; the HOMA-IR threshold is rapidly increased when children reach the age of 10 years, when most commence puberty. Therefore, it is important that, in the evaluation of insulin resistance in children and adolescents, different threshold values should be used according to puberty stage or age. Secondly, Different cut-off points might be selected to optimize sensitivity versus specificity depending on the study purpose. We defined a HOMA cutoff point for diagnosis of MS of 1.7 in prepubertal stage yielding a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 67% in the ROC curve. In pubertal population, the HOMA cutoff point of 2.6 produced a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 67%. A screening test requires high sensitivity and moderate specificity, whereas a diagnostic test requires a much higher specificity. In our study, the 95th percentile of HOMA-IR for normalsubjects in prepubertal stage was 2.6 and the sensitivity and the specificity of this point in the ROC analysis are were 54% and 85% respectively. The 95th percentile of HOMA-IR for pubertal adolescents of 3.2 leaded to a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 80%. Due to the fact that our sample size was large, we are able to propose precise cut-off limits based on the results of this study. This may be useful for different purposes, such as early intervention or early diagnose of insulin resistance in clinic. Thirdly, HOMA-IR is a function of both insulin and glucose, and glucose is included in the unified criteria of MS. However, insulin assays have not yet to be standardized and assessment methods differ between laboratories. This makes comparison with different studies difficult.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^116HcHhe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We propose the addition of the components of MetS analysis as a criterion to establish the cut-off points of HOMA-IR to define IR instead of using a percentile of the population distribution. The consideration of the attendant risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases to establish this cut-off point would increase its clinical utility in identifying those patients in whom the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors imparts an increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk.

In summary, with the increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes, the study of IR and body composition has become an important area of research in developed countries and a central public health task.

The effect of age and gender on the ability of HOMA-IR to identify subjects with cardio metabolic risk phenotype should be taken into account in the estimation of their values in different populations. The threshold HOMA-IR levels to define IR must be modified by age in non-diabetic women.

### Insulin resistance in adolescents [^116o4PW3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the relationship of other body mass index (BMI) ranges with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), a surrogate marker for insulin resistance in adolescents.

Study Design

Cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of 1837 nondiabetic, nonpregnant 12 to 19 year old persons from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002. The main outcome measurement of insulin resistance was calculated as HOMA-IR > 3.16.

Results

Having a BMI ≥ 75th percentile is associated with a high HOMA-IR levels. As the BMI percentile increases, the odds of high HOMA-IR levels increase (BMI percentile 75–84.9, OR 4.277, 95% CI 2.090–8.752; BMI percentile 85–94.9, OR 4.299, 95% CI 2.158–8.563; BMI ≥ 95th percentile, OR 17.907, 95% CI 11.360–28.228).

Conclusion

Adolescents with BMI percentile of 75 to 84.9, which represents approximately 1.2 million US adolescents, have not previously been identified as having higher HOMA-IR levels.

### Prevalence of insulin resistance in Korean women with polycystic ovary syndrome according to various homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance cutoff values [^115dXKq2]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the various homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cutoff values in a large population of healthy controls and to evaluate the prevalence of IR in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Case control study.

Setting

Reproductive endocrinology center.

Patient(S)

Women with (n = 699) and without PCOS (n = 572).

Intervention(S)

Blood tests.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The upper 75th and 95th percentiles of HOMA-IR in lean controls (n = 522) and the HOMA-IR cutoff that indicates metabolic risk in all participants.

Result(S)

HOMA-IR cutoffs of 1.82 and 3.16 were defined as above the 75th and 95th percentiles in lean controls, and the prevalence of IR in patients with PCOS was 60.7% and 24.5%, respectively. The optimal HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was 2.64; thus, metabolic risk was increased at a lower level of HOMA-IR compared with the 95th percentile cutoff. At HOMA-IR cutoff of 2.64, 34.8% of patients with PCOS had evidence of IR. Metabolic features significantly differed between patients with PCOS with and without IR, and patients with PCOS without IR showed similar or more favorable metabolic features compared with controls. Overweight/obese patients are the most high-risk group, but lean patients also showed a similarly elevated prevalence of IR as overweight/obese controls. A positive correlation was observed between BMI and HOMA-IR in both patients and controls, but the magnitude was significantly greater in patients than in controls.

Conclusion(S)

Although IR is common in women with PCOS, it does not seem to be universal, and patients without IR had reassuring metabolic features.

HOMA-IR thresholds associated with cardiometabolic risks

In both genders, HOMA-IR gradually increased with increasing number of parameters derived from metabolic syndrome definition. HOMA-IR of 3.6 for girls and of 4.4 for boys were identified as cut-off values that corresponded to increased cardiometabolic risks defined as a presence of three components of metabolic syndrome (Table 2). These HOMA-IR values represent the 84.0 and 87.0 percentile in girls and boys of general population, respectively.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^116esCCZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance has been associated with metabolic and hemodynamic alterations and higher cardio metabolic risk. There is great variability in the threshold homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels to define insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to describe the influence of age and gender in the estimation of HOMA-IR optimal cut-off values to identify subjects with higher cardio metabolic risk in a general adult population.

Methods

It included 2459 adults (range 20–92 years, 58.4% women) in a random Spanish population sample. As an accurate indicator of cardio metabolic risk, Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), both by International Diabetes Federation criteria and by Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, were used. The effect of age was analyzed in individuals with and without diabetes mellitus separately. ROC regression methodology was used to evaluate the effect of age on HOMA-IR performance in classifying cardio metabolic risk.

Results

In Spanish population the threshold value of HOMA-IR drops from 3.46 using 90th percentile criteria to 2.05 taking into account of MetS components. In non-diabetic women, but no in men, we found a significant non-linear effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR. In non-diabetic men, the cut-off values were 1.85. All values are between 70th-75th percentiles of HOMA-IR levels in adult Spanish population.

Conclusions

The consideration of the cardio metabolic risk to establish the cut-off points of HOMA-IR, to define insulin resistance instead of using a percentile of the population distribution, would increase its clinical utility in identifying those patients in whom the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors imparts an increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk. The threshold levels must be modified by age in non-diabetic women.

### Limited value of the homeostasis model assessment to predict insulin resistance in older men with impaired glucose tolerance [^113w1p8f]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin resistance (IR) in older individuals is associated with risk factors for coronary artery disease. The glucose clamp measures IR directly, but the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR, referred to here as HOMA-IR, is based on fasting glucose and insulin and is less invasive and labor intensive. This method requires validation in the elderly.

Research Design and Methods

We assessed the validity of HOMA-IR as an index of IR by comparing it to glucose infusion rates (GIRs) measured by a glucose clamp (600 pmol x m(-2) x min(-1)) in 45 obese men (61 ± 8 years of age, mean ± SD) with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 21) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n = 24). We also evaluated relationships between body composition, exercise capacity, and IR.

Results

Subjects with NGT had lower BMI (28 ± 3 vs. 31 ± 3 kg/m2), waist circumference (97 ± 9 vs. 105 ± 9 cm), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.97 ± 0.05), and percent body fat (25 ± 6 vs. 30 ± 6) than subjects with IGT. Subjects with NGT also had lower areas above basal during the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test for glucose (274 ± 95 vs. 419 ± 124 mmol x min/l) and insulin (38,142 ± 18,206 vs. 58,383 ± 34,408 pmol x min/l) and lower HOMA-IR values (2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 4.2 ± 2.6) than subjects with IGT. GIR (micromol x kg(-1) FFM x min(-1)) was higher in subjects with NGT than in subjects with IGT (53 ± 11 vs. 43 ± 14). HOMA-IR correlated with GIR in subjects with NGT (r = -0.59), but not in subjects with IGT (r = -0.13). GIR correlated with VO2max in subjects with NGT (r = 0.58) and IGT (r = 0.42), but with WHR only in subjects with NGT (r = -0.53). HOMA-IR correlated with VO2max (r = -0.57) and waist circumference (r = 0.54) in subjects with NGT, but with percent body fat in subjects with IGT (r = 0.54).

Conclusions

These findings indicate that HOMA-IR should not be used as an index of IR in older individuals who may be at risk for IGT, and suggest that lifestyle changes that increase VO2max and decrease body fat may reduce IR in older people.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^114pJ9CN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood obesity has experienced an important increase all over the world. It has been associated with the rising prevalence of many metabolic complications, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and high blood pressure. Many of them are already present during childhood and tend to persist into adulthood or further develop into metabolic syndrome (MS), and therefore increase the risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Insulin resistance is the primary metabolic disorder associated with obesity and appears to be the primary mediator of MS. Identification of children with insulin resistance has been proposed as a strategy for identifying high-risk children for targeting MS interventions. The gold-standard technique for assessment of insulin sensitivity is the hyperinsulin-emiceuglycemic clamp; and another accepted method is the minimal-model analysis frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT). These tests are invasive, labor intensive, and expensive, which can be used for research purposes only. As a more convenient method to measure insulin resistance, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was therefore developed and widely used in clinical and epidemiologic studies.

In children and adolescents, HOMA-IR has been validated as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance in several studies, showing high correlations with clamp or FSIVGTT measures. However, it is more difficult to define HOMA-IR cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance in youths than in adults, because there is lack of longitudinal evidence in youths for risk prediction of cardiovascular outcomes. Alternatively, in most studies, cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance have been defined based on HOMA-IR distribution in reference population, but due to the influence factors such as puberty development and ethnic difference, values varied obviously from 1.8, 2.5, 3.2, to > 4 according to the different reference population. On the other hand, presence of pediatric MS, as a risk for future CVD, has been considered alternatively for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR, but population-based studies are limited and there even exists debates on how and to what extent IR is associated with MS and its components.

In this context, our study aims are to evaluate the association of IR with each of the components of MS and to determine HOMA-IR cut-off values of different pubertal status regarding the diagnosis of MS based on a large cohort of Chinese schoolchildren. To our knowledge, there is lack of this kind of study in population- based samples of Chinese children.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^11292H7P]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents is progressively increasing around the world. One of the important consequences of obesity is the development of insulin resistance (IR). Insulin resistance is a state in which normal concentrations of insulin produce a subnormal biologic response. This condition has a multifactorial pathogenesis and is associated with hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure and ovarian hyperandrogenism. Those are early state of adult diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, polycystic-ovary syndrome, cardiovascular disease and MS. Although metabolic syndrome has been referred to as the insulin resistance syndrome, the ATPIII criteria do not include either fasting insulin level or the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). There has been debate about the extent to which the metabolic syndrome defines the risk of CVD associated with insulin resistance beyond the risk associated with classic CVD risk factors (obesity, HDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure). Therefore, it would be useful to understand the extent to which the presence of the syndrome is associated with insulin resistance.

In line with previous population-based studies, we found that insulin resistance and MS were significantly associated. HOMA-IR levels were directly related to the number of MS components and the risk of MS increased with rising HOMA-IR percentiles. As the number of MS related components increased, mean BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, FAT%, TG showed a gradually significant increase. Similarly, the mean insulin and HOMA-IR values increased with the number of MS components. From another point of view, we show the ORs of suffering MS according to IR categories. We use the group with HOMA-IR values below the 20th percentile as a reference, and we find that the odds of developing MS (adjusted for gender, age and tanner stage) increase as a function of IR. Participants in the highest quintile of HOMA-IR were about 60 times more likely to be classified with metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile. Although the data are cross-sectional, it is not possible to identify the direction of causality among metabolic syndrome and HOMA-IR, and the relationship between insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome might be different in other samples. Nevertheless, the key implications are that youths with high insulin and HOMA-IR levels have a much greater risk of being classified with metabolic syndrome. Therefore, evaluation of insulin resistance as a pathological or physiological disease as well as early intervention will help control and reduce the currency of relevant diseases.

### Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and the reciprocal index of homeostasis model assessment in normal range weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic patients [^111a9RhP]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and the reciprocal index of homeostasis model assessment (1/HOMA-IR) derived from fasting plasma glucose and insulin level are excellent surrogate indices of insulin resistance in both normal range-weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects.

Research Design and Methods

The association between QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR and insulin resistance index assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (clamp-IR) was investigated in 121 type 2 diabetic and 29 healthy subjects recruited from among 120 (age 55 ± 11, 48 ± 15, and 52 ± 15 years [means ± SD], respectively). Type 2 diabetic subjects were divided into groups of 76 normal range-weight and 45 moderately obese subjects (BMI 21.4 ± 2.3 vs. 27.2 ± 2.2 kg/m(2), P < 0.0001).

Results

QUICKI and 1/HOMA-IR were significantly lower in the moderately obese group than in the normal range-weight type 2 diabetic and healthy groups (n = 120) (QUICKI, 0.338 ± 0.030, 0.371 ± 0.037, and 0.389 ± 0.041, respectively, P < 0.0001; 1/HOMA-IR, 0.50 ± 0.33, 0.92 ± 0.55, and 1.24 ± 0.82, P < 0.0001). QUICKI was strongly correlated with clamp-IR in normal range-weight, moderately obese type 2 diabetic, and healthy subjects (r = 0.641, 0.570, and 0.502, respectively; all subjects, r = 0.608, P < 0.01) and 1/HOMA-IR exhibited correlations comparable to those of QUICKI with clamp-IR (r = 0.637, 0.530, and 0.461, respectively; all subjects, r = 0.589, P < 0.001). In multiple regression models including QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR as an independent variable, the estimation formula accounted for 55% of the variability of clamp-IR for the group of all type 2 diabetic subjects (R(2) = 0.547 and 0.551, respectively, P ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusions

QUICKI and 1/HOMA-IR were highly correlated with clamp-IR, with comparable coefficients in both normal range-weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects. The latter can probably be applied clinically in view of its convenience.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^111yMA7c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of insulin resistance evaluated by different cutoffs of HOMA-IR

The prevalence of insulin resistance among those with ATPIII-defined MS and its related components according to our cutoffs using two different definitions in different pubertal period are given in Table 4. We find that, regardless of the definition used or the puberty status, the prevalence of insulin resistance was substantially higher in children with MS and its related components. For prepubertal children, using a threshold of insulin resistance of HOMA-IR > 1.7, the prevalence of insulin resistance in children with obesity or MS were 67.2% and 86.0% respectively; While using the threshold of HOMA-IR > 2.6, the prevalence of insulin resistance were 39.0% and 53.3%, respectively. Similarly, for pubertal adolescents with obesity or MS, when HOMA-IR > 2.6, the prevalence of insulin resistance were 67.9% and 77.3%, and with a HOMA-IR > 3.4, the values were 46.3% and 59.2%, respectively.

Table 4
Prevalence of insulin resistance (%) according to various HOMA-IR cutoffs in cardio metabolic risk factors

Figure 2 shows the prevalence of insulin resistance stratified by weight status based on different thresholds for defining insulin resistance. HOMA-IR 1.7, 2.6 or 2.3 were based on receiver-operator curve analysis with or without considering pubertal status. HOMA-IR 2.6, 3.2 or 3.0 were defined by above the 95th percentiles in normal-metabolic children and adolescents with or without considering puberty. Regardless of the definition used, the prevalence of insulin resistance was substantially higher in obese children compared with normal weight children. According to HOMA-IR 3.0 (95th percentile of our healthy reference), the prevalence of insulin resistance in obese adolescents was 44.3%.

### Failure of the homeostatic model assessment calculation score for detecting metabolic deterioration in young patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115qqeNv]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify whether the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) test is a suitable method for the identification of metabolic deterioration in normal-weight patients affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Academic clinic and research environment in Cagliari, Italy.

Patient(S)

Forty-nine PCOS normal-weight adolescent subjects, and 50 eumenorrheic, normal-weight, nonhirsute controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI).

Intervention(S)

History and physical examination, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and blood sampling, ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The HOMA score and integrated secretory area under the curve of insulin values (I-AUC) during the OGTT were calculated.

Result(S)

Normal insulin sensitivity was defined as upper control 95th percentile by HOMA values < 65.6, I-AUC at 180 minutes < 16,921, and I-AUC at 120 minutes < 11,817. When applying the calculated I-AUC cutoff, 27 PCOS patients were classified as normoinsulinemic and 22 as hyperinsulinemic, whereas using the calculated HOMA cutoff, only 9 PCOS patients could be classified as insulin resistant (IR). Thirteen of the 40 non-IR PCOS patients presented with hyperinsulinemia; fasting glucose and insulin levels and HOMA scores were not sufficient to identify these subjects. Thus, the HOMA test displayed a low sensitivity (41%) and specificity (100%) in the diagnosis of the metabolic disorder disclosed by I-AUC. Moreover, analysis of I-AUC after 120 and 180 minutes revealed how the shorter evaluation period did not suffice for identification of all hyperinsulinemic subjects, implying an unrecognized condition in 11 of 22 subjects.

Conclusion(S)

In young, normal-weight patients with PCOS, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia is not detectable by HOMA studies. The prevalence of IR was 18% according to HOMA evaluation, whereas hyperinsulinemia was found in 44% of subjects examined by I-AUC. Normal-weight, young PCOS patients should undergo a 3-hour OGTT to detect early metabolic abnormalities.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of insulin resistance: focusing on the role of HOMA-IR and tryglyceride / glucose index [^1147SKNp]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Metabolic Syndrome (MS) prevalence is increasing worldwide in line with the growing prevalence of obesity. The underlying mechanism of MS is insulin resistance which can be diagnosed by measuring Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Triglyceride/Glucose (TyG) Index. This review will focus on comparing studies assessing the HOMA-IR and TyG index cut-off points.

Methods

We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, Scopus, Research Gate, and Google Scholar in the month of October 2020.

Results

There is a high degree of variability in determining threshold levels of HOMA-IR for defining insulin resistance. The distribution of the HOMA-IR varies according to the demographic characteristics of the subjects, such as age, sex, and race, making it difficult to estimate the optimal cut-off point. Another simpler method without requiring the use of insulin assays is TyG Index. Similar to HOMA-IR, the TyG Index cut-off point from existing data shows varying results.

Conclusion

The HOMA-IR and the TyG index are simple and widely used methods for determining insulin resistance. However, an issue that arises is determining the insulin resistance cut-off point for both methods. Further studies are needed to assess the cut-off point of insulin resistance for various ethnicities associated with the risk of developing MS later in life.

### HOMA-IR mean values in healthy individuals: a population-based study in Iranian subjects [^112wzt1r]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Homeostasis Model Assessment-estimated Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is an important indicator of insulin resistance. In this population-based investigation, we sought to report the mean value of HOMA-IR in different subgroups of a large population-based database of Iranian healthy subjects.

Methods

This study recruited adult healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 70 years old to Massoud Medical Laboratory, Tehran, Iran. Fasting insulin was measured by using the Electro Chemiluminescence method using Roche Cobas 6000 e601/602 instrument.

Results

The mean ± SD value of the HOMA-IR index in the studied population was 2.11 ± 0.99 (2.5–97.5% percentiles: 0.66–4.50). In addition, the mean ± SD of HOMA-IR index in male and female groups were 2.351.0 (2.5–97.5 percentile: 0.57–4.37) and 2.05 ± 1.0 (2.5–97.5 percentiles: 0.53–4.35), respectively. Interestingly, it was observed a significant increment for the HOMA-IR index in the male group compared with the female group in all age subgroups (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Our findings showed the mean value of 2.11 ± 0.99 HOMA-IR in the Iranian healthy population. Considering the large sample size in our study, more clinical investigations in terms of ethnicity should be done to provide a precise standardized HOMA-IR index in the Iranian population.

### Biological variation of homeostasis model assessment-derived insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes [^113jAzMc]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Individuals with type 2 diabetes are particularly vulnerable to cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is a major determinant of this increased risk and is a potential therapeutic target. This study was undertaken to establish the natural biological variation of insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

The biological variation of insulin resistance was assessed by measuring insulin resistance at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions in 12 postmenopausal women with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes and in 11 weight- and age-matched postmenopausal women without type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance was derived using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method.

Results

The distribution of HOMA-IR was log Gaussian in the type 2 diabetic study group and Gaussian in the control group. The HOMA-IR in the type 2 diabetic group was significantly greater than that of the control group (mean ± SD: 4.33 ± 2.3 vs. 2.11 ± 0.79 units, P = 0.001). After accounting for analytical variation, the mean intraindividual variation was also substantially greater in the type 2 diabetic group than in the control group (mean 1.05 vs. 0.15, P = 0.001). Consequently, at any level of HOMA-IR, a subsequent sample must increase by > 90% or decrease by > 47% to be considered significantly different from the first.

Conclusions

HOMA-IR is significantly greater and more variable for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this inherent variability needs to be accounted for in studies evaluating therapeutic reduction of HOMA-IR in this group.

### Insulin resistance predicts mortality in nondiabetic individuals in the U.S [^115Y98TQ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin resistance is a suspected causative factor in a wide variety of diseases. We aimed to determine whether insulin resistance, estimated by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), is associated with all-cause or disease-specific mortality among nondiabetic persons in the U.S.

Research Design and Methods

We determined the association between HOMA-IR and death certificate-based mortality among 5,511 nondiabetic, adult participants of the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) during up to 12 years of follow-up, after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, alcohol consumption, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, smoking status, physical activity, C-reactive protein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma total and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides).

Results

HOMA-IR was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.16 [95% CI 1.01–1.3], comparing successive quartiles of HOMA-IR in a linear model and 1.64 [1.1–2.5], comparing the top [HOMA-IR > 2.8] to the bottom [HOMA-IR ≤ 1.4] quartile). HOMA-IR was significantly associated with all-cause mortality only in subjects with BMI < 25.2 kg/m(2) (the median value) but not in subjects with BMI ≥ 25.2 kg/m(2). Subjects in the second, third, and fourth quartile of HOMA-IR appeared to have higher cardiovascular mortality than subjects in the lowest quartile of HOMA-IR. HOMA-IR was not associated with cancer-related mortality.

Conclusions

HOMA-IR is associated with all-cause mortality in the nondiabetic U.S. population but only among persons with normal BMI. HOMA-IR is a readily available measure that can be used in the future to predict mortality in clinical or epidemiological settings.

### Postprandial insulin assay as the earliest biomarker for diagnosing pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk [^117VcLrH]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Fasting insulin response assessments

Multiple-sampled glucose tolerance tests required to produce the Kraft and Hayashi patterns are resource-intensive. This may explain the popularity of fasting measures such as homeostasis modal assessment (HOMA). HOMA was originally developed to assess insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) from fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. This is based on the relationship between basal insulin and glucose concentrations reflecting hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion. Normal pancreatic beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity is considered 100% and normal insulin resistance is 1.0. HOMA variants can be determined either by using the calculations shown in figure 1 or by using HOMA 2 from the online calculator. HOMA2 uses model-derived estimates, which better accounts for variations in glucose resistance and when plasma glucose concentrations are above 10 mmol/L. However, there are numerous flaws to using measures based on fasting insulin as discussed below.

Figure 1
HOMA calculations where glucose is mmol/L and insulin is mU/L.HOMA, homeostasis model assessment; HOMA-β; HOMA to assess pancreatic beta-cell function; HOMA-IR, HOMA to assess insulin resistance; HOMA-S, HOMA to assess insulin sensitivity.

Flaws in using fasting insulin resistance models

There are several flaws with using insulin resistance models that are based on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, including the physiology of insulin secretion and basal levels, the use of insulin resistance as the disease state of concern, and implementation and interpretation of the test itself.

Insulin physiology

Plasma insulin concentrations are labile due to the physiology of insulin release from the pancreas. Insulin is released in a pulsatile manner leading to oscillatory concentrations in the blood. These oscillations have a slow ultradian periodicity (~140 min), which is modulated by a small-amplitude high-frequency oscillation (periodicity 3–10 min). It is hypothesised that the periodic release of insulin prevents downregulation of receptors leading to insulin resistance. Loss of these regular insulin oscillations is considered to be an early indicator of diabetes.

However, these oscillations make a single sample of insulin impractical for clinical practice, as it will be unknown where the insulin levels lie in these periodic cycles. It has been suggested that if fasting insulin concentrations are required, then the average of three samples, taken at 5 min intervals, should be used; however, this rarely is done in clinical practice.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^117Beop1]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — We investigated how β-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma. Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-diabetes, i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18), or type 2 diabetes (n = 67) were recruited. Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody–positive were excluded. HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2).

RESULTS — All glucose values were within model (HOMA) limits but not all insulin results, as 4.3% were < 20 pmol/l and 1% were > 300 pmol/l. β-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-diabetes (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, insulin resistance ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P < 0.0001), respectively. This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically. Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used. β-Cell function differed by 11% and insulin resistance by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator.

CONCLUSIONS — To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^116Veunn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Table 1
Summary of reports (sorted by sample size) on HOMA-IR cut-off in different populations

In a previous study we showed that there are age and gender-specific differences in HOMA-IR levels, with increased levels in women over fifty years of age. On the other hand, the prevalence of cardio metabolic diseases such as diabetes or central obesity rises with age and shows gender differences. All these results suggest the possible effects of both age and gender on the accuracy of HOMA-IR to identify individuals with cardio metabolic risk.

The purpose of the present population-based study was to evaluate the change in defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of IR when cardio metabolic risk factors were considered. We currently assess the influence of age and gender on the performance of HOMA-IR levels to identify cardio metabolic risk in an adult population, to better understand the relationship between insulin resistance and cardio metabolic risk.

### Prevalence of insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome using the homeostasis model assessment [^115u4RuP]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in a large population of patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective, case-control.

Setting

University medical center.

Patient(S)

Two hundred seventy-one PCOS patients and 260 eumenorrheic, non-hirsute, control women.

Intervention(S)

History and physical examination and blood sampling.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Total T, free T, DHEAS, sex hormone-binding globulin, and fasting glucose and insulin levels; homeostatic model assessment values for IR (HOMA-IR) and percent beta-cell function (HOMA-%beta-cell).

Result(S)

Patients with PCOS and controls differed significantly in all parameters studied, except fasting glucose. Because the HOMA-IR and HOMA-%beta-cell values were variably associated with race, age, and body mass index, the HOMA-IR and HOMA-%beta-cell values were then adjusted for these cofounders. After adjustment, 64.4% of PCOS patients were noted to be insulin resistant, and 2.6% had beta-cell dysfunction. Compared with PCOS patients without IR (n = 96), patients with IR (n = 174) were more obese and had higher beta-cell function.

Conclusion(S)

In patients with PCOS, the prevalence of IR was 64% according to the HOMA-IR measurement, after adjustment. Patients with IR were more clinically affected. Although IR is a common abnormality in PCOS, it does not seem to be a universal feature.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^116vTwiT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 15.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). All skewed distributions were log transformed for analysis. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The mean values of variables studied by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Level of significance was accepted as P < 0.05.

Logistic regression generalized estimating equation models were used to predict the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components by quintile of HOMA-IR after adjustment for age, sex and pubertal stage.

Insulin resistance was defined based on a number of different thresholds, including HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for healthy reference population and ROC analysis to find the cutoff of HOMA-IR among subjects with and without metabolic syndrome. ROC analysis is a formal method of assessment for considering trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity at various test cutoffs or thresholds. A test with perfect discrimination has a ROC plot that passes through the upper left corner (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity). The ROC plot for HOMA is closer to the upper left corner, indicating greater overall accuracy of the test. To determine the optimal thresholds, the point on the ROC curve with maximum Youden index [sensitivity-(1-specificity)], and the point with shortest distance value form the point (0, 1) [(1 - sensitivity) 2 + (1 - specificity) 2] were calculated. These are the two most commonly used methods for establishing the optimal cut-off.

In order to provide more information for science research and clinic reference, HOMA-IR cut-offs of different pubertal stage from the 95th percentile for healthy reference population along with their corresponding sensitivity and specificity in ROC curves were also evaluated. The prevalence of insulin resistance stratified by weight status or metabolic syndrome components based on different thresholds was calculated by the χ 2 test.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^11137G2Q]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

HOMA is widely used as a research tool in epidemiological studies in which invasive techniques for modeling such as intravenous glucose tolerance testing are not practical. HOMA is not applicable for individual patient care as insulin results from different laboratories may vary. We have compiled a checklist of procedures to follow when HOMA is used (Table 3). In this study, the first five were fulfilled but only one blood sample was collected. For the original model, three blood samples were collected 5 min apart to account for insulin pulsatility, although HOMA estimates have been published subsequently from one sample in large research or epidemiological studies.

When HOMA estimates from this study are compared with those reported previously, it is important to note that they reflect the population studied, i.e. a small sample size with participants being mostly white Caucasian, being older than those recruited for HOMA (version 2), and having higher BMI. From an analytical point of view, differences in conversion factors quoted for an insulin assay, ranging from 6.0 to 7.46, will also contribute to variation. The HOMA calculator version 2.2 accepts international or molar units for insulin and uses a conversion factor of 6.9 (microunits per milliliter to picomoles per liter). The American Diabetes Association Working Group recommends a factor of 6.0. The study does not address the question of long-term stability of assays as insulin was measured over a very short period using a particular batch of reagents and calibrator.

### Associations of the HOMA2-% B and HOMA2-IR with progression to diabetes and glycaemic deterioration in young and middle-aged Chinese [^114Ro921]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several methods for assessing beta‐cell function and insulin sensitivity. The original Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) model proposed in 1985 was based on a mathematical feedback model first proposed in 1979. It is an estimate of beta‐cell function (%B) and insulin sensitivity (%S) during steady state calculated from fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin levels. The original HOMA model correlates with estimations derived from clamp studies and can be used as surrogates in epidemiological studies and clinical practice. In 1998, the updated HOMA model (HOMA2) was published to adjust for variations due to hepatic and peripheral glucose sensitivity, plasma glucose–insulin relationship for plasma glucose values above 180 mg/dl and plasma pro‐insulin levels. HOMA2 had been recalibrated to a normal population to set the reference value. They can be calculated using fasting C‐peptide (CP) levels instead of insulin, and had been shown to perform better than the original HOMA model in assessing IR or beta‐cell function as well as predicting progression to T2D.

In the late 1990s, we established multiple cohorts to ascertain the natural progression to T2D in Chinese in whom stored samples were available for the measurement of plasma CP levels. We selected subcohorts of young and middle‐aged Chinese to explore the associations of ID and IR estimated by HOMA2 with (1) progression to T2D in participants without T2D from a community‐based cohort; (2) glycaemic deterioration in patients with T2D from a clinic‐based cohort.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^113ypTFk]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated how beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk).

Research Design and Methods

Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma. Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-diabetes, i.e., impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18), or type 2 diabetes (n = 67) were recruited. Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody-positive were excluded. HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2).

Results

All glucose values were within model (HOMA) limits but not all insulin results, as 4.3% were < 20 pmol/l and 1% were > 300 pmol/l. beta-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-diabetes (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, insulin resistance ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P < 0.0001), respectively. This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically. Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used. beta-Cell function differed by 11% and insulin resistance by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator.

Conclusions

To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^11483PJN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — insulin resistance (IR) assessment states that fasting insulin is an optional test to quantify IR by calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or by noting fasting insulin is more than 2 sd above the mean for the laboratory doing the test. HOMA-IR is defined as HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/ml × fasting glucose in mmol/liter) divided by 22.5, and in nondiabetic children HOMA correlates as high as 0.91 with clamp measures. Based on a study of 1,802 adolescents aged 12–19 yr from the 1999–2002 NHANES, a HOMA-IR > 3.49 was recommended as evidence of IR; using that criterion, roughly 46–52% at a BMI in at least the 95th percentile, roughly 11–16% at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and 4% below the 85th percentile were insulin resistant. In Mexican children aged 10–14 yr, similar results were reported with 3, 12, and 47% insulin resistant at BMIs below the 85th percentile, at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and at least the 95th percentile, respectively. The use of any index of IR is complicated by concerns about the lack of standardized measures for the quantification of insulin and the need to be assured that the blood sample is obtained in a truly fasting state.

Type 2 diabetes remission — complications and insulin resistance consensus states that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes are paramount in managing T2D, even in the absence of remission; insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta (homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function) and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance) to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations; and remission of T2D is accompanied by reversal or improvement of insulin resistance.

### Percentiles of fasting serum insulin, glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR in pre-pubertal normal weight European children from the IDEFICS cohort [^114QMKfg]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to present age- and sex-specific reference values of insulin, glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the homeostasis model assessment to quantify insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for pre-pubertal children.

Methods

The reference population consists of 7074 normal weight 3- to 10.9-year-old pre-pubertal children from eight European countries who participated in at least one wave of the IDEFICS ('identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants') surveys (2007–2010) and for whom standardised laboratory measurements were obtained. Percentile curves of insulin (measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR were calculated as a function of age stratified by sex using the general additive model for location scale and shape (GAMLSS) method.

Results

Levels of insulin, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR continuously show an increasing trend with age, whereas HbA1c shows an upward trend only beyond the age of 8 years. Insulin and HOMA-IR values are higher in girls of all age groups, whereas glucose values are slightly higher in boys. Median serum levels of insulin range from 17.4 and 13.2pmoll(-1) in 3- < 3.5-year-old girls and boys, respectively, to 53.5 and 43.0pmoll(-1) in 10.5- < 11-year-old girls and boys. Median values of glucose are 4.3 and 4.5mmoll(-1) in the youngest age group and 49.3 and 50.6mmoll(-1) in the oldest girls and boys. For HOMA-IR, median values range from 0.5 and 0.4 in 3- < 3.5-year-old girls and boys to 1.7 and 1.4 in 10.5- < 11-year-old girls and boys, respectively.

Conclusions

Our study provides the first standardised reference values for an international European children's population and provides the, up to now, largest data set of healthy pre-pubertal children to model reference percentiles for markers of insulin resistance. Our cohort shows higher values of Hb1Ac as compared with a single Swedish study while our percentiles for the other glucose metabolic markers are in good accordance with previous studies.

### Thyroid functions and insulin resistance in pregnant Sudanese women [^1142kCaR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of insulin resistance by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) is a method for assessing β-cell function and peripheral insulin resistance from fasting insulin and fasting glucose concentrations. Matthews et al. first used HOMA-IR to assess IR. It is a mathematical model for assessing insulin resistance.

The HOMA-IR equation is as follows:

Fasting plasma glucose [mg/dL] × fasting insulin [µU/mL] / 405.

The physiological value of the index was 1.0. Higher values are indicative of insulin resistance. Low HOMA-IR indicates good insulin sensitivity. A small amount of insulin is sufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis, while a higher HOMA-IR denotes more IR. The healthy IR range is 0.5–1.4; < 1.0 indicates optimal insulin sensitivity; > 1.9 indicates early IR; and > 2.9 indicates significant IR.

Sample size calculation

A sample size of 127 women was calculated depending on the significant minimum level (0.25) for correlations between the serum insulin, glucose levels, and thyroid function hormones (TSH, FT3, and FT4) variables. This sample had 80% power and a difference of 5% at α = 0.05.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science software for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA, version 22.0). All Continuous variables were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous data were expressed as median (interquartile range), as they were not normally distributed. Spearman's correlation was used to investigate the correlation between HOMA-IR score, insulin levels, plasma glucose, and thyroid profile. A Spearman's correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination were reported. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Assessment of insulin resistance using surrogate markers in patients of metabolic syndrome [^117EgYiy]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance is defined as situation where there is insufficient biological or metabolic response to normal plasma levels of insulin. For precise quantification of insulin sensitivity, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp may be used, but it is expensive, invasive and used mainly in research settings. HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance) and ISI 0,120 (Insulin Sensitivity Index) are indirect markers of insulin resistance. The present study evaluated the usefulness of the surrogate markers for evaluation of Insulin resistance in clinical settings.

Method

This study was carried out on 120 subjects. Of these, 60 subjects presenting with two or more features of metabolic syndrome (Hypertension, Obesity, Dyslipidemia, altered glucose tolerance) were included in the study group. Sixty age and sex matched healthy controls were selected with normal Body mass index. All the subjects underwent a standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. Plasma glucose and serum insulin were estimated using Glucose oxidase and ELISA principle respectively. HOMA-IR and ISI 0,120 were calculated using relevant formulae.

Result

The HOMA-IR values were significantly raised in suspected Insulin resistant subjects (6.74 ± 1.24) as compared to healthy controls (0.82 ± 0.017) (p = 0.001). ISI 01,20 was significantly low in insulin resistant subjects (3.13 ± 0.17) as compared to controls (20.60 ± 0.37) (p < 0.001). Insulin sensitivity index showed a significant negative correlation with HOMA-IR. A significant negative correlation was observed between serum cholesterol, serum LDL-cholesterol and ISI 0,120 indicating that dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome may result from a decrease in Insulin sensitivity.

Conclusion

HOMA-IR and ISI 0,120 are simple, convenient and sensitive estimates of insulin resistance adaptable for use in clinical practice as well as large-scale epidemiological studies.

### Utility of homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function in predicting diabetes in 12, 924 healthy Koreans [^111qt88X]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to other studies, we did not find a lower HOMA-β to be associated with the development of diabetes when individuals had relatively similar glucose concentrations. Indeed, if anything, individuals who developed diabetes tended to have higher HOMA-β, reflecting the inadequacies of the HOMA-β calculation.

In an attempt to understand this fundamental disparity between the current findings and previous studies, we believe it useful to begin by examining the basis of the HOMA-β calculation. The HOMA calculation is derived from a computer-solved model that assumes certain relationships between basal plasma glucose and insulin concentration. Although values of both fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are used to solve the equation, the degree of glycemia is often the major determinant. In Table 1, for example, as glucose increases, insulin concentrations also increase, but HOMA-β declines. In fact, for individuals with IFG-110 to have similar HOMA-β as individuals with NFG, insulin concentrations would have to be ∼120 pmol/l or double the actual insulin concentration.

When examined in this light, it is easy to see why our results differ from others. There have been four prospective studies that have evaluated the role of HOMA-β in predicting diabetes. They all concluded that a lower HOMA-β was predictive of future diabetes. In three of the studies that provided results by diabetes status, baseline glucose was also higher in individuals who developed diabetes. In one of the studies, the baseline glucose was only different by 0.5 mmol/l, and the baseline HOMA-β was not significantly different. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, HOMA-β also did not predict the development of diabetes when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.69–1.26]). However, when they added HOMA-IR to the model, HOMA-β became significant (0.34 [0.21–0.55]). The authors therefore concluded that a higher HOMA-β was protective against the development of diabetes and emphasized the importance of adjusting for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when evaluating insulin secretion. While this has biological basis, it should be noted that HOMA-IR and insulin concentration were nearly perfectly correlated (r = 0.98); therefore, adding HOMA-IR to the model merely adjusts for insulin concentration and isolates the effect of glucose concentration on diabetes risk.

Remission aims and monitoring — Consensus was reached that remission is the optimal outcome for adults with T2D, that remission is a realistic and achievable goal for some, but not all, adults with T2D, and that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes is paramount even in the absence of remission; there was consensus that insulin resistance can be measured using homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and/or homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function (HOMA-beta).

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^116Ya8Tv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The correlation between HOMA-IR and M-clamp had been validated in diverse adult populations. Furthermore, two studies have described the pediatric information on its validation about clamps. Although it is more difficult to define HOMA-IR cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance in youths than that in adults due to lack of longitudinal evidence in youths for risk prediction of cardiovascular outcomes, there were a few studies on HOMA-IR utility in pediatric populations and some methods for defining cutoff values of HOMA-IR. In most studies, cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance have been defined based on HOMA-IR distribution in reference population. Values based on the 95th percentile, lower boundary of the top quintile ortertile of HOMA-IR obtained from population studies or non-obese subjects with no metabolic disorders have been used previously. In other studies, presence of pediatric MS, as a risk for future CVD, also has been considered for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR by using ROC statistical method. Youden index and the distance from the top left corner of the ROC curve are two methods commonly used in previous work to determine the best HOMA-IR cut-off. In our study, the present HOMA-IR cutoff point corresponding to the 95th percentile of our healthy reference children was 3.0 for whole referent and 2.6 for children in prepubertal stage and 3.2 in pubertal period, respectively. The optimal point for diagnosis of MS was 2.3 in total referent, 1.7 in prepubertal stage and 2.6 in pubertal period in ROC curve analysis.

### Longitudinal assessment of insulin sensitivity in pregnancy. validation of the homeostasis model assessment [^111G8CAp]. Clinical Endocrinology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate the use of the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) for measurement of insulin sensitivity in obese women during gestation and the postpartum period.

Design

Three consecutive measurements of insulin resistance (IR) were performed during and after pregnancy to compare the homeostasis model assessment insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-IR) to glucose utilization rates obtained during hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps (G(Rd)).

Patients

Six obese women (mean second trimester BMI = 30.4 kg/m(2)) with normal glucose tolerance were studied during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and once in the postpartum period. Thus, there were a total of 18 measurements for analysis.

Results

Correlations between the rate of glucose disappearance (G(Rd)) (the gold standard) and the HOMA-derived metabolic parameters of insulin sensitivity were significant, with a multiple R(2) of 43.5% (P = 0.003). However, when controlling for variations between patients using dummy variables, we observed that one patient differed from the other five in the relationship between G(Rd) and HOMA-IR. Applying this regression we obtained a R(2) of 72.6% (P < 0.001). When the regression constant was omitted, we observed that the individual trends during pregnancy and postpartum in two patients differed statistically from the other patients between the two assessments, and we obtained a multiple R(2) of 97.3% (< 0.001).

Conclusions

HOMA estimation of insulin resistance is appropriate for use during both the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum in obese women with normal glucose tolerance. It lacks sensitivity for the evaluation of individuals, where more precise measures of insulin sensitivity should be utilized.

Results

Table 2 summarizes anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of the study sample. In the overall data set, the MetS prevalence was 15% for MetS IDF (19.2% in men vs. 12.1% in women, P < 0.0001) and 12.7% for MetS ATPIII (14.9% in men vs. 11.1% in women, P = 0.006). In non-diabetic individuals, but not in diabetic individuals, we found significant differences by gender in components of MetS (data no shown). The percentage of men with positive MetS components of higher triglycerides, blood pressure, and glycemia were significantly higher than women (23% vs. 9.6% (P < 0.001), 32% vs. 19% (P < 0.001) and 21% vs. 13% (P < 0.001)). In contrast, women with positive MetS component of larger waist circumference were significantly higher than men (43.6% vs. 29.8%, ATPIII criteria, P < 0.0001 and 52.7% vs. 35.1%, IDF criteria, P < 0.001).

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^116uybJa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that the degree of insulin resistance at the diagnosis of GDM is a marker of GDM severity and pathophysiological heterogeneity.

HOMA-IR values of ≥ 1.29 at diagnosis may indicate insulin resistance to be the key pathophysiologic mechanism in GDM in the studied population of women. These HOMA-IR values justify aggressive treatment of insulin resistance as a method adequate to the pathophysiologic background of GDM in this population of Caucasian women. Decreased beta-cell function in HOMA-IR values between 1.92–2.89 is associated with decreased insulin secretion. Introduction of insulin treatment in combination with dietary control seems to be more appropriate in treating this subpopulation of women than the administration of oral drugs. HOMA-IR value of > 2.89 suggests an inefficient compensation, thus indicating the need for metformin treatment combined with insulin therapy.

Further studies are needed to resolve the problem of optimal treatment strategies, which still remain controversial in this specific, high risk group of women.

### Update on the effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in humans [^115jpVzd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The comparison of results between research studies into the effects of a physically active lifestyle and/or exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control are problematic due to differences in the methods of assessment of outcome variables. While the precise protocols vary, the general methods for assessing insulin sensitivity/glycaemic control include: (1) measuring fasting insulin concentrations, with elevated fasted (insulin) > 25 mIU/L indicating poor insulin sensitivity, as the pancreas endeavours to compensate for the lack of peripheral insulin sensitivity by secreting greater amounts of insulin, thereby resulting in hyperinsulinaemia; (2) oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), which involves the ingestion of a standard glucose bolus (75 g), followed by blood glucose monitoring for the subsequent 2 hours. Blood glucose concentrations of > 7.8 mmol/L and < 11.0 mmol/L at 2 hours are indicative of impaired glycaemic control, and > 11.0 mmol/L indicates diabetes; (3) hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, in which the participant is infused with insulin at a known rate, creating a hyperinsulinaemic state (~100 µU/ml), while simultaneously blood glucose levels are monitored and adjusted by a variable-rate infusion to maintain glycaemia (5.0–5.5 mmol/L). A high rate of glucose infusion indicates insulin sensitivity as the glucose is being rapidly taken up by the cells of the body, while a low rate of glucose infusion indicates a loss of insulin sensitivity, as the glucose is remaining in the blood rather than being taken up by the cells of the body;(4) hyperglycaemic clamp, in which plasma glucose levels are initially increased to ~125mg/dl above basal values and then maintained at this hyperglycaemic level, through the infusion of glucose. High infusion rates indicate good insulin sensitivity, while low infusion rates indicate insulin resistance (IR).; (5) homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which uses fand is calculated as (glucose mmol/L x insulin)/22.5, with a relatively low score indicating well regulated fasting glucose that is being maintained through relatively low concentrations of insulin, hence good insulin sensitivity, whereas an elevated HOMA-IR value, such as > 2.5 indicates IR. In the updated homoeostatic model, HOMA2-IR, values > 1.5 suggest IR; (6) HOMA-β is a measure of β cell function derived from fasting values using the equation (20 x insulin)/(glucose mmol/L−3.5) %, with this measure indicating the extent to which a deficient β cell function, as opposed to IR, contributes to hyperglycaemia in the fasting state; (7) Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), which is an index of insulin sensitivity, calculated as QUICKI = 1/(log (fasting plasma insulin µU/ml) + log (fasting blood glucose mg/dL)).

### Insulin resistance in obesity can be reliably identified from fasting plasma insulin [^112JPMMz]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Insulin resistance is the major contributor to cardiometabolic complications of obesity. We aimed to (1) establish cutoff points for insulin resistance from euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (EHCs), (2) identify insulin-resistant obese subjects and (3) predict insulin resistance from routinely measured variables.

Subjects/Methods

We assembled data from non-obese (n = 112) and obese (n = 100) men who underwent two-step EHCs using [6,6-(2)H2]glucose as tracer (insulin infusion dose 20 and 60 mUm(-2)min(-1), respectively). Reference ranges for hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were calculated from healthy non-obese men. Based on these reference values, obese men with preserved insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance were identified.

Results

Cutoff points for insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were 46.5% and 37.3μmolkg(-)(1)min(-)(1), respectively. Most obese men (78%) had EGP suppression within the reference range, whereas only 12% of obese men had Rd within the reference range. Obese men with Rd < 37.3μmolkg(-1)min(-1) did not differ from insulin-sensitive obese men in age, body mass index (BMI), body composition, fasting glucose or cholesterol, but did have higher fasting insulin (110 ± 49 vs 63 ± 29pmoll(-1), P < 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (4.5 ± 2.2 vs 2.7 ± 1.4, P = 0.004). Insulin-resistant obese men could be identified with good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (75%) from fasting insulin > 74pmoll(-1).

Conclusions

Most obese men have hepatic insulin sensitivity within the range of non-obese controls, but below-normal peripheral insulin sensitivity, that is, insulin resistance. Fasting insulin (> 74pmoll(-1) with current insulin immunoassay) may be used for identification of insulin-resistant (or metabolically unhealthy) obese men in research and clinical settings.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^115rMptz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first important observation resulting from our study is that significant differences occur in the studied population of women in terms of the severity of insulin resistance evaluated using the HOMA-IR index at the time of GDM diagnosis. According to the International Diabetes Federation criteria, the HOMA-IR cut-off point to differentiate between low and high insulin resistance is 2.38, and HOMA-IR values range from 0.34 to 1.29 in the lowest quartile, whereas in the 4th quartile these values range from 2.89 to 20.39. Such differences in the HOMA-IR indicate a significant pathophysiological variation in the severity of insulin resistance at the diagnosis of GDM in the studied population.

Consistent with our results, several previous studies performed on smaller populations have demonstrated that HOMA-IR index assessed at diagnosis of GDM ranged from 1.6 to 25.

Interestingly 1/4 of the women in our study (the first quartile), exhibited a low degree of insulin resistance, while chronic insulin resistance is present in most of the GDM women, and it progresses in the course of pregnancy.

It is also worth of noticing that the highest rate of insulin resistance (fourth quartile) occurred in 1/4 of our female patients, while most women with this type of diabetes exhibit a mild degree of insulin resistance.

The results of our study clearly indicate a pathophysiological and clinical variation of GDM in respect to HOMA-IR values. The value of HOMA-IR index higher than > 1.29 is associated with a higher value of the pre-pregnancy body mass index, fasting glucose level, insulin level, and severity of GDM. Values of HOMA-IR in the range of 1.92–2.89 are specifically associated with reduced insulin secretion, while values of > 2.89 are additionally associated with a higher HbA1c level and an unchanged beta cell function, suggesting insufficient compensation for metabolic demands. It should be emphasised that there were no statistically significant differences between the HOMA-IR quartiles in terms of age, parity and time of diagnosis of GDM.

### Should insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin secretion (HOMA-β), and visceral fat area be considered for improving the performance of diabetes risk prediction models [^111d3gCU]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study shows that a model with BMI, FPG, and HbA1c effectively identifies those at high diabetes risk. However, adding HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, or replacing BMI with VFA does not significantly improve the model. In clinical and public health practice, consider using readily available BMI, FPG, and HbA1c for diabetes risk prediction, while the incorporation of HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and VFA, which are costlier and more challenging to measure, may not be as advantageous. Further research is required for confirmation.

Metabolic Assessment

Obesity was considered mild if the BMI was 27–30 kg/m 2, moderate if 30–35 kg/m 2, severe if 35–40 kg/m 2, morbid if 40–50 kg/m 2, super obesity if 50–60 kg/m 2, and super, super obesity if the BMI was > 60 kg/m 2.

NGM was defined if the subject had no previous history of prediabetes or diabetes and a fasting serum glucose level < 5.6 mmol/L. IGM was defined if one of the following was true: 1) a history of prediabetes or diabetes, 2) current use of an anti-diabetic medication, or 3) fasting serum glucose level ≥ 5.6 mmol/L.

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to quantify estimates of steady state insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS), and pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-B) as percentages of normal reference populations. The updated HOMA2 model incorporated in a computer program HOMA Calculator v2.2.2 was utilized in this study. The model consists of a number of improvements to the HOMA1 equations with mathematical representations of the tissues and organs involved in glucose regulation. HOMA2 accounts for variations in hepatic and peripheral glucose resistance, increases in the insulin secretion curve for more hyperglycemic states, and introduces the contribution of circulating proinsulin. As HOMA is based on steady state physiology, the HOMA2 model includes limits for glucose 3–25 mmol/L and insulin 20–400 pmol/L. Values outside these limits are considered non-steady state and cannot be assessed.

HOMA2 models could not be calculated for one man with NGM (missing insulin data) and for three women with IGM. One woman was taking exogenous insulin, which precluded use of the HOMA to assess beta-cell function. In two women, the insulin levels were outside limits for HOMA calculators; one insulin value 15.6 pmol/L was below the HOMA lower limit, one value 416 pmol/L was above the upper limit.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^112iWzdV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The AUC in non-diabetic women presents a plateau, with values greater than 0.7, until patients are in their fifties. Recent studies reported marked gender differences with regard to degrees of IR and body composition. The age effect found in non-diabetic women in our study may reflect the effect of menopausal changes (decreased estrogens levels and increased visceral adipose tissue, VAT) on HOMA-IR performance, with a higher utility to identify cardio metabolic risk below age 50.

Insulin resistance increases atherogenesis and atherosclerotic plaque instability by inducing proinflammatory activities on vascular and immune cells. HOMA-IR is a robust surrogate method to estimate IR in epidemiologic or clinical setting. However, there is great variability in their threshold levels; as can be seen in Table 1, usually the cut-off values of HOMA-IR were defined by population-based percentiles criteria. Furthermore, these cut-off values are different according to ethnicity, clinical methods of estimation, and metabolic conditions of populations studied. To increase the clinical utility of HOMA-IR values, we study its ability to classify those individuals with multiple metabolic risk factors. In Spanish population the threshold value of HOMA-IR drops from 3.46 using 90th percentile criteria to 2.05 take into account MetS components.

Our HOMA-IR cut-off levels are relatively low compared to those reported in a study of healthy Italian patients with a value of 2.77, and in a Spanish non-diabetic population, with a value of 3.8. Both studies used the 80th or 90th percentile as cut-off selection criteria. On the other hand, our values are slightly higher than those reported in an Iranian population-based study with 1.77, using YI as cut-off selection criteria, but in this case the value was estimated pooled in men and women.

The prevalence of MetS (15% for IDF and 12.7% for MetS ATPIII) was quite similar to that found in northwest Spain (18.3% for MetS IDF and 15.0% for MetS ATPIII) and in other European population-based studies. On the other hand, it is significantly lower compared with the NHANES study, 23.7%, and SuRFNCD-2007 study, 33.6%, probably because of the higher prevalence of obesity and other metabolic alterations in US and eastern Asia compared to the Spanish population.

### Correction of metabolic acidosis improves insulin resistance in chronic kidney disease [^114WjZVi]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance measurement and HOMA test

Insulin resistance was assessed indirectly by the Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index as suggested by Wallace and coworkers. Briefly, the HOMA index is a mathematical model that allows to calculate insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and evaluate ß pancreatic cell function (HOMA-%B) from fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. It is a simple test, appropriate to perform in large epidemiological studies that nicely correlates with experimental data obtained with direct measurement techniques such as the euglycemic clamp.

To perform the HOMA test, blood samples are drawn twice (30 min apart) in 3 consecutive days. Patients are kept at rest, in a fasting status for at least 8 h before the blood sampling. Tobacco use is forbidden for the 12 h before blood tests. The presented values for HOMA test at baseline and study completion are the mean values of the three consecutive blood samples. For HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B calculation, the following formulas are used:
HOMA-IR = (FPI * FPG)/22.5;
HOMA-%B = (20 * FPI)/(FPG - 3.5)

where FPI stands for fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU/l) and FPG stands for fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) (FPG conversion factor from mg/dl to mmol/l: 10.018).

HOMA-IR estimates of insulin resistance. Normal values are < 0.25. Values greater or equal than 5.5 indicate insulin resistance typical of early stages of Diabetes Mellitus. HOMA-B% estimates ß pancreatic cells function. It's value ranges from 0% (no pancreatic cell function) to 100% (all pancreatic cell functioning). FPI and FPG measurements were performed centrally at P.O. "A Landolfi" – Solofra (AV), Italy, via COBAS 6000 or COBAS C 501 (Roche Diagnostics) and IMMULITE 2000 (Siemens Healthcare Global), respectively.

Study objective and endpoint

Current analyses aim at testing the impact of metabolic acidosis correction in CKD 3b-4 diabetic patients with serum bicarbonate < 24 mEq/l on insulin resistance evaluated via the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) test. The HOMA was performed at study inception and after 12 months of treatment with either oral sodium bicarbonate (treatment group) or conventional therapy for CKD (control group).

### Use of HOMA-IR in hepatitis C [^114Fzf79]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can induce insulin resistance (IR) in a genotype-dependent manner and contributes to steatosis, progression of fibrosis and resistance to interferon plus ribavirin therapy. Our understanding of HCV-induced IR has improved considerably over the years, but certain aspects concerning its evaluation still remain elusive to clinical researchers. One of the most important issues is elucidating the ideal method for assessment of IR in the setting of hepatitis C. The hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp is the gold standard method for determining insulin sensitivity, but is impractical as it is labour intensive and time-consuming. To date, all human studies except for four where IR was evaluated in the HCV setting, an estimation of IR has been used rather than direct measurements of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The most commonly used estimation in the HCV population is the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) which is calculated from a single measurement of fasting insulin and glucose. In this article, we review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and provide guidance on its appropriate as well as inappropriate use in the hepatitis setting.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^111WCAxU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include the use of a large, diverse, and well-characterized population-based sample of adults. We used a novel non-parametric extension of the induced ROC regression methodology to analyze the effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR when predicting the presence of cardio metabolic risk. The induced ROC regression methodology applied in this study is based on first evaluating the effect of covariates on the biomarker in healthy and diseased populations separately, and then computing the covariate effects on the associated ROC curve by deriving the induced form of the ROC curve.

We acknowledge limitations to our approach as well. The cross-sectional nature of our study does not allow us to draw conclusions regarding causality between IR and cardio metabolic risk. Furthermore the small sample size of diabetic patients does not allow us to draw conclusions about the performance of HOMA-IR in identifying cardio metabolic risk in diabetics. More prospective, population-based studies are needed to elucidate these concerns.

### Assessment of insulin resistance in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1137HA4Z]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether serum levels of potential markers could detect insulin resistance (IR) in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

Serum levels of fasting glucose, insulin, intact proinsulin, resistin, and adiponectin were measured in 50 women with PCOS and known homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR values (≥ 2 indicating IR). The women were all younger than 25 years.

Results

Of the 50 women, 49 had undetectable levels of resistin, 50 had intact proinsulin levels within the normal range, and 50 had adiponectin levels of 8.4 ± 3.3 mg/L, just below the normal range. When groups were compared, however, the 26 women (52%) with IR (HOMA-IR values ≥ 2) had significantly higher intact proinsulin levels (3.2 ± 2.0 pmol/L vs 1.8 ± 1.0 pmol/L; P < 0.005) and significantly lower adiponectin levels (7.2 ± 2.9 mg/L vs 9.7 ± 3.3 mg/L; P < 0.01), than the 24 women (48%) without IR.

Conclusion

Serum levels of intact proinsulin, resistin, or adiponectin were not detectors of IR in individual young women with PCOS.

Outcome ascertainment

Insulin resistance (IR)

Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess IR (HOMA-IR = FBS (mmol/L) × Insulin (μU/mL)/22.5). HOMA-IR ≥ 2.17 and 1.85 were determined as criteria for IR for men and women, respectively.

Hyperinsulinemia

Fasting Insulin concentrations ≥ 9.16 and 11.13 are considered as criteria for hyperinsulinemia for men and women, respectively.

Insulin insensitivity

Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) was used to assess Insulin insensitivity (HOMA-S = (1/HOMA-IR) × 100), where HOMA-S ≤ 46.1 and 54.1 are considered as criteria for insulin insensitivity for men and women, respectively.

β-cell dysfunction

It was determined using the Homeostatic Model Assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) as follows:

(HOMA-β = Insulin (μU/mL) × 20/FBS (mmol/L) — 3.5). HOMA-β ≤ 67.1 and 86.2 are defined as criteria for β-cell dysfunction for men and women, respectively.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 20.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Histogram charts and Kolmogorov–Smirnov analysis were used to assess the normality of variables. Participants were categorized according to EDIH and ELIH tertiles cutoff points. Baseline characteristics of individuals were expressed for continuous and categorical variables as mean ± SD or median (25–75) interfertile range (IQR) and percentage, respectively. Trends of qualitative and quantitative variables across tertiles of ELIH and EDIH ratio (as the median value in each tertile) were tested using Chi-square and linear regression. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of 3-year incidence of insulin-related disorders, with IR, hyperinsulinemia, insulin insensitivity, and β-cell dysfunction as dependent variables and the EDIH and ELIH scores as independent variables; odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. All of the regression models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, PA, BMI, energy intake, education level, hypertension, and diabetes. P-values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Furthermore, in an additional step, sensitivity analysis was performed with excluding individuals with a history of diabetes at baseline.

### Insulin sensitivity and albuminuria: the RISC study [^114fjrvC]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Accumulating evidence suggests an association between insulin sensitivity and albuminuria, which, even in the normal range, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We evaluated whether insulin sensitivity is associated with albuminuria in healthy subjects.

Research Design and Methods

We investigated 1,415 healthy, nondiabetic participants (mean age 43.9 ± 8.3 years; 54.3% women) from the RISC (Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease) study, of whom 852 participated in a follow-up examination after 3 years. At baseline, insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, expressed as the M/I value. Oral glucose tolerance test-based insulin sensitivity (OGIS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were determined at baseline and follow-up.

Results

Microalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) was present in fewer than 2% at either study visit. After multivariate adjustments, there was no cross-sectional association between UACR and any measure of insulin sensitivity. Neither OGIS nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up UACR, but in a multivariate regression analysis, baseline M/I emerged as an independent predictor of UACR at follow-up (β-coefficient -0.14; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In healthy middle-aged adults, reduced insulin sensitivity, assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is continuously associated with a greater risk of increasing albuminuria. This finding suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity either is simply related to or might causally contribute to the initial pathogenesis of albuminuria.

### Growth hormone treatment does not to lead to insulin resistance nor excessive rise in IGF-1 levels, while improving height in patients small for gestational age A long-term observational study [^1153LBe3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

In children born small for gestational age (SGA), the relationship between growth hormone (GH) treatment and insulin resistance (IR) has only been investigated for a short period, necessitating a longer observation period. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term (10 years) effect of GH to SGA-children on IR and safety during treatment.

Design

This was a multicenter observational study.

Patients

SGA-children who received GH treatment in Spain (stratified by Tanner-stage and age at GH onset [two groups: ≤ 6 years old or > 6 years old]).

Measurements

The analysed variables (yearly measures) included auxologic, metabolic (insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), height velocity [HV], weight and homeostatic model assessment-IR [HOMA-IR]) and safety data. Data were collected prospectively (since the study approval: 2007) and retrospectively (since the initiation of GH treatment: 2005–2007).

Results

A total of 389 SGA children (369 Tanner-I) were recruited from 27 centres. The mean age (standard deviation) of the children at GH treatment onset was 7.2 (2.8) years old. IGF-1 (standard deviation score [SDS]) and HOMA-IR values tended to increase until the sixth year of GH-treatment, with significant differences being observed only during the first year, while these remained stable in the later years (within normal ranges). Height (SDS) increased significantly (basal: -3.0; tenth year: -1.13), and the maximum HV (SDS) occurred during the first year (2.75 ± 2.39).

Conclusions

HOMA-IR values increased significantly in SGA-children during the first year of GH-treatment, remained stable and were within normal ranges in all cases. Our 10-year data suggests that long-term GH treatment does not promote IR and is well-tolerated, safe and effective.

### Metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population: evidence from NHANES 2001–2018 [^111cSrQ3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique is considered the gold standard for the assessment of IR, but due to its high assay cost and complex procedure, the method is limited to small studies and not used in large epidemiologic investigations. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is widely used in the assessment of IR due to its non-invasiveness and simplicity. However, the assessment efficacy of this model varies by population race and shows some limitations in patients treated with insulin or in patients with β-cell insufficiency. In addition, calculation of HOMA-IR relies on laboratory measurement of fasting insulin levels, which is often difficult to achieve in resource-limited countries, limiting its popularity in daily clinical practice. Therefore, there is a need for a less costly and more readily available indicator to assess IR more broadly and easily. Currently, the alternative indexes of IR commonly used in clinical practice are triglyceride glucose index (TyG index), metabolic score for Insulin resistance (METS-IR), the triglyceride /high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The TyG index is inexpensive to calculate and easy to obtain, and is recognized as a time-saving and relatively simple marker of IR. Multiple studies have shown that it performs consistently or better than HOMA-IR in assessing IR. Therefore, a large number of studies have been conducted to explore the relationship between TyG index and cardiovascular diseases and their prognosis. Some studies have reported that TyG index is significantly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the general population, especially in people under 65 years of age. However, some studies have reported inconsistent results, stating that there is no significant relationship between the TyG index and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. The controversy surrounding the TyG index has somewhat limited its clinical application. In addition, there are fewer studies on other indexes of IR besides the TyG index. The existence of alternative indexes of IR that are better predictors of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality is an issue that needs to be focused on and resolved, which is essential to find the best alternative index of IR and to promote its clinical application.

### Short-term repeatability of insulin resistance indexes in older adults: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^114iPKiC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and triglyceride (TG)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (TG/HDL-C) are insulin resistance indexes routinely used in clinical and population-based studies; however, their short-term repeatability is not well characterized.

Objective

To quantify the short-term repeatability of insulin resistance indexes and their analytes, consisting of fasting glucose and insulin for HOMA-IR and TG and HDL-C for TG/HDL-C.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 102 adults 68 to 88 years old without diabetes attended an initial examination and repeated examination (mean, 46 days; range, 28 to 102 days). Blood samples were collected, processed, shipped, and assayed following a standardized protocol.

Main Outcome Measures

Repeatability was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-person coefficient of variation (CV). Minimum detectable change (MDC95) and minimum detectable difference with 95% confidence (MDD95) were quantified.

Results

For HOMA-IR, insulin, and fasting glucose, the ICCs were 0.70, 0.68, and 0.70, respectively; their respective within-person CVs were 30.4%, 28.8%, and 5.6%. For TG/HDL-C, TG, and HDL-C, the ICCs were 0.80, 0.68, and 0.91, respectively; their respective within-person CVs were 23.0%, 20.6%, and 8.2%. The MDC95 was 2.3 for HOMA-IR and 1.4 for TG/HDL-C. The MDD95 for a sample of n = 100 was 0.8 for HOMA-IR and 0.6 for TG/HDL-C.

Conclusions

Short-term repeatability was fair to good for HOMA-IR and excellent for TG/HDL-C according to suggested benchmarks, reflecting the short-term variability of their analytes. These measurement properties can inform the use of these indexes in clinical and population-based studies.

### Insulin resistance and medial prefrontal gyrus metabolism in women receiving hormone therapy [^116sVz6P]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance (IR) is a putative risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, and has been shown to impede neuronal glucose metabolism in animal models. This post hoc study focused on metabolic changes in the medial prefrontal region, a brain region exhibiting decline years before documented cognitive changes, relative to high or low IR status in a cohort of postmenopausal women at risk for dementia who were randomized to continue or discontinue existing stable hormone therapy (HT) for 2 years. Subjects were dichotomized into high and low IR groups based on the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, which was within clinically normal limits for the group as a whole at both baseline and 2-year follow-up. Results showed that high and low IR groups showed significant differences in metabolic decline of the medial prefrontal gyrus, regardless of HT randomization group. However, HT randomization was predictive of metabolic decline only in women with low HOMA (homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance). Performance in working memory was consistent with observed metabolic changes. These results suggest IR may be an independent moderator of regional metabolic changes, while protective metabolic effects of HT are most apparent in those at low-end range of IR. If replicated in future studies, these findings will help to better understand the interaction between putative risk and protective factors, and further delineate cohort postmenopausal women who may benefit from HT.

### Comparison between HOMA-IR and ISI-gly in detecting subjects with the metabolic syndrome [^113xZbHT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

To verify whether, as index of insulin resistance, ISI-gly (insulin sensitivity index) is more efficient than HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment) or QUICKI (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) in detecting patients with the metabolic syndrome.

Methods

Excluding patients with known diabetes, endocrine, liver and kidney diseases, we enrolled 553 subjects who were screened for metabolic abnormalities. After 5 days of a balanced weight maintenance diet, we performed an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) and measured fasting and 2-h postload blood sugar and insulin, from which we calculated ISI-gly, HOMA-IR and QUICKI, stratifying patients in tertiles. Statistical comparisons were performed for a number of metabolic variables between tertiles of the same index, as well as between tertiles of different indexes presumably expressing identical insulin resistance.

Results

All variables reflecting the metabolic syndrome were significantly more altered in the top as compared to the intermediate and the lowest tertile for HOMA-IR, the opposite for ISI-gly. Comparing homologous measurements of the top tertile of HOMA-IR with the lowest tertile of ISI-gly (presumably expressing identical insulin resistance), fasting glucose and insulin were significantly higher, while 2-h OGTT values were significantly lower. The opposite occurred comparing the lowest HOMA-IR to the highest ISI-gly tertile, the diagnostic predictive values of the latter in detecting metabolic derangements being also higher. Data from QUICKI 1st to 3rd tertiles exactly matched those obtained from HOMA-IR 3rd to 1st tertile.

Conclusions

ISI-gly, which includes postload glucose and insulin concentrations, provides a more accurate estimate of whole-body insulin sensitivity than HOMA-IR or QUICKI, derived from fasting measurements only, thus constituting a more sensitive tool for screening and preventing metabolic abnormalities.

### Insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome in a Chinese population [^112eUJQs]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Our study aimed to investigate glucose and lipid level as well as insulin resistance (IR) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

In a case-control study, 426 patients with PCOS were diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria, and they were conducted in the morning after a 10-h fast. Participants received standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Plasma glucose and insulin levels were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. They also received the lipid evaluation; 95 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles served as controls. Thus, by modifying the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with the use of individual time-course values of glucose and insulin plasma levels, we developed a new assessment method, HOMA-Mx.

Results

In our study, 23.71% of patients had abnormal glucose metabolism. With further impairment in glucose metabolism, the glucose and lipid level gradually increased (P < 0.05), while the impaired glucose regulation (IGR) group showed greater insulin response than a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) group. Compared with healthy controls, both lean and obese PCOS patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) had a higher body mass index (BMI), and higher serum glucose, insulin, and lipid values. Additionally, the insulin value peaked at 30 min and 60 min in the lean and obese groups, respectively. HOMA-M30 proved to be the best predictive parameter (cutoff: 20.36, area under the curve [AUC]: 0.753) for assessment of IR in normal-weight patients and HOMA-IR (cutoff: 32.17, AUC: 0.868) was optimal in obese PCOS patients.

Conclusions

A new assessment method was developed for these groups: HOMA-M30 for lean PCOS patients and HOMA-M60 for obese patients, in order to focus on peak insulin values for early detection of IR.

Normative age- and sex-specific HOMA-IR values in adolescents with normal-weight and overweight/obesity

Subsequently, the 3rd to 97th HOMA-IR percentile values stratified by sex and age in either the group with normal-weight or that with overweight/obesity were identified (Supplementary Table 3–1 and 3–2). In addition, Fig. 2 shows the HOMA-IR percentiles calculated using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves. Tables 3 and 4 present the means and 95% CIs of HOMA-IR values in the group with normal-weight and that with overweight/obesity, respectively. In the group with normal-weight (Table 3), the mean HOMA-IR value peaked at 12–13 years in boys and 11–12 years in girls and started to decrease thereafter. The peak mean HOMA-IR value was higher and earlier in girls than in boys in both datasets. In the group with overweight/obesity (Table 4), although the mean HOMA-IR value peaked at age 12–13 years in boys and at 10–12 years in girls in both datasets, it remained relatively high over a wide age range and decreased thereafter in both sexes and datasets. These findings suggest that both the group with normal -weight and that with overweight/obesity exhibited peak HOMA-IR values during puberty in both sexes and datasets, although the group with overweight/obesity had a relatively higher and wider peak age range than the group with normal-weight.

### Measuring and estimating insulin resistance in clinical and research settings [^116y7zYA]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

The article discusses how to measure insulin resistance in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue in human participants. The most frequently used methodologies to evaluate insulin resistance are described in detail starting from the gold standard, that is, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, to the intravenous glucose tolerance test, surrogate indices based on fasting measurements, or dynamic tests (such as oral glucose or mixed meal tolerance tests). The accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the tests as well as cutoff values are reported.

### Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance closely related to lobular inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115bPg6t]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Insulin resistance (IR) has been established as a major risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) where it exerts effects on plasma glucose homeostasis, cellular anabolism, and organ glucose uptake. Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD.

Methods

Liver biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).

Results

We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135–1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102–1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = 2.995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of liver inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.

### Glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance: prevalence, gender differences and predictors in adolescents [^1136Ry5f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Adolescence, due to transient pubertal insulin resistance (IR), is associated with a higher risk for disturbances of glucose metabolism. The aim of our study was 1) to investigate the prevalence of disturbances of glucose metabolism, 2) to define gender specific homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) thresholds associated with increased cardiometabolic risks and 3) to provide predictors of HOMA-IR.

Methods

The studied cohort consisted of Czech adolescents aged 13.0–17.9 years: 1,518 individuals of general population and three studied groups according weight category (615 normal weight, 230 overweight and 683 obese). The prevalence of IR, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and type 2 diabetes was assessed. Risky HOMA-IR thresholds based on components of metabolic syndrome were investigated. HOMA-IR prediction was calculated taking into account age, blood pressure, multiple anthropometric, biochemical and hormonal parameters.

Results

In general population cohort, the prevalence of IFG and type 2 diabetes was 7.0% and < 0.5%, respectively. Boys regardless of weight presented significantly higher levels of blood glucose and higher prevalence of IFG than girls. Obese boys were found more insulin resistant than obese girls. HOMA-IR thresholds of 3.6 for girls and 4.4 for boys were associated with increased cardiometabolic risks. For both genders, the model of HOMA-IR prediction was composed of age, BMI, ratio of free triiodthyronine to free thyroxine, gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and levels of triglycerides and sex hormone-binding globulin.

Conclusions

The type 2 diabetes in adolescents, including those who were obese, was rarely diagnosed. Obese adolescent boys were at greater risk for IR and for IFG than obese girls. In adolescence, thresholds of HOMA-IR in contrast to predictors were found gender specific.

Insulin resistance — direct and indirect measurement approaches and obesity associations — can be measured directly with insulin suppression test/insulin/glucose clamp techniques; euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies indicate obesity is negatively associated with glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver with strong correlations across tissues; indirect measures include fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, oral glucose tolerance testing, fasting insulin, and calculations such as homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI).

### Cross-sectional investigation of insulin resistance in youths with autism spectrum disorder. any role for reduced brain glucose metabolism? [^115mTiLH]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Sex distribution, age, body weight, and BMI were significantly different (p ranging from 0.001 to < 0.0001) between ASD and healthy youths. Table 1 shows values of anthropometrics, clinical, and biochemical variables of youths with ASD and controls. Figures of patients and controls with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5 unit were reported. Genomic hybridization revealed causative genetic mutation in 4 (7%) ASD patients. Neuropsychological scores were as follows: Griffiths III-GQ 56.2 ± 14.1; IQ 83.6 ± 20; ADOS-2 total score 13.2 ± 5.3; ADOS-2 Comparison score 6.1 ± 1.6.

Table 3 describes predictors of HOMA-IR in the whole population and ASD patients. HOMA-IR was significantly increased by 0.55 units for the ASD status; 0.17 units for year of age, and 0.38 units for being overweight/obese vs. normal weight. Modeling together these variables, in the final model HOMA-IR increased by 0.31 unit for the ASD status, by 0.47 unit for being overweight/obese vs. normal weight and by 0.17 unit for year of age.

In the ASD group, age, BMI classification (normal weight/overweight/obesity), values of BCAAs (i.e. valine, isoleucine, leucine) and triglycerides levels were statistically significant predictors of HOMA-IR. In the final multivariable model age, and values of valine and triglycerides remained predictors of HOMA-IR (Table 3).

### How to transform a metabolic syndrome score into an insulin sensitivity value? [^113v6dyd]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) predicts cardiovascular risk and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of a MetS is defined by the clustering of ≥ 3 out of 5 cardiometabolic criteria (hyperglycemia; hypertension; enlarged waist; low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; and hypertriglyceridemia), each of which is connected with insulin resistance. It is not known whether the severity of MetS, ranked from the sextet of scores range [0/5 to 5/5], is linearly related to reduced insulin sensitivity (IS) and/or lesser hyperbolic product across the glycemic spectrum.

Patients and Methods

A total of 839 adults (54 normoglycemic; 785 with abnormal glucose homeostasis, among whom 711 type 2 diabetes mellitus) had insulin sensitivity assessed together with their cardiometabolic phenotype.

Results

There was a significant gradient according to interval-scale MetS score in insulinemia; body mass index; (visceral) fat; hepatic steatosis; and macroangiopathy. There was an inverse linear relationship between increasing MetS scores and decreased insulin sensitivity, allowing to define an insulin resistance-predicting linear equation: IS (%) = [-15.1×MetS score]+109.4 (R(2) = 0.221). For each MetS category, mean IS values did not significantly differ between groups of patients across the glycemic spectrum. The hyperbolic product (β-cell function×IS) and/or its loss rate were inversely related to MetS severity.

Conclusion

Insulin sensitivity is linearly and inversely related to MetS severity across the 6 scores. This novel way to exploit information intrinsic to the MetS criteria provides an easy and low cost means to quantify insulin sensitivity across the glycemic spectrum. Moreover, a higher MetS score is associated with lesser residual insulin secretion, and faster B-cell function loss. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### TriGlycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio compared with homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance indexes in screening for metabolic syndrome in the Chinese obese children: a cross section study [^115Z3e1h]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Receiver operating characteristics analyses

The TG/HDL-C ratio was a better predictor of MS (acceptable sensitivity and specificity and higher AUC-ROC) than either HOMA1-IR or HOMA2-IR. The cut-off values for MS were: TG/HDL-C ratio > 1.25 (sensitivity: 80%; specificity: 75%), HOMA1-IR > 4.59 (sensitivity: 58.7%; specificity: 65.5%) and HOMA2-IR > 2.76 (sensitivity: 53.2%; specificity: 69.5%). After stratified by age group, puberty stage and sex, the cutoffs of HOMA1-IR changed from 3.58–5.74 while the cutoffs of HOMA2-IR fluctuated from 1.92–2.99. However the cutoffs of TG/HDL-C varied slightly from 1.21–1.53. The Overall AUC-ROC values for the prediction of MS were 0.640, 0.625, and 0.843 by HOMA1-IR, HOMA2-IR and TG/HDL-C respectively. Significant difference of the AUC-ROC values between HOMA-IR and TG/HDL-C was found with a higher sensitivity and specificity. When stratified by age group, gender and puberty stage the AUC-ROC values for the prediction by HOMA-IR were still lower than those by TG/HDL-C.

### Central insulin modulates food valuation via mesolimbic pathways [^111B7zY4]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Insulin groups

Forty-eight normal to overweight non-diabetic volunteers participated in the study and were classified into insulin groups based on insulin sensitivity as defined by the well-established homeostatic model assessment using a cut-off of < 2.0 (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)). Normal insulin sensitivity was identified in n = 28 participants (normal insulin resistance (NIR) 14 male), whereas n = 20 individuals fulfilled criteria for IR (9 male). Normal HbA1C values confirm the exclusion of diabetes in our insulin-resistant participants who are at risk for T2D but in whom elevated insulin release may still compensate for reduced insulin sensitivity (Table 1).

General preference for different kind of foods was comparable in both groups (Supplementary Table 2). Gender, age, overnight fasting time (Supplementary Table 3a), days between scanning sessions and hunger ratings also did not differ between groups (all P > 0.33, n NIR = 28, n IR = 20, t -test). As expected, individuals in the IR group demonstrated enhanced scores in all body measurements and adiposity-related blood values before scanning, that is, showed elevated levels of leptin, c-peptide, insulin and glucose. Fasting glucose levels confirmed fasting state in all participants. Additional analyses on the caloric content of the protocolled last meal before fasting in each participant demonstrated no difference in caloric intake between sessions, groups and regarding group × session interactions (Supplementary Table 3b).

### Trends in HOMA-IR values among South Korean adolescents from 2007–2010 to 2019–2020: a sex-, age-, and weight status-specific analysis [^1154W75Y]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the prevalence of obesity increases, the HOMA-IR value may change. In this study, the proportion of adolescents with overweight/obesity increased in the 2019–2020 dataset compared with the 2007–2010 dataset among South Korean adolescents. Additionally, glucose and insulin levels, as well as HOMA-IR values, were also observed to increase. When stratified by weight status, the mean HOMA-IR values were similar between the two datasets in the group with normal-weight. However, in boys with overweight/obesity, the HOMA-IR values increased from the 2007–2010 dataset to the 2019–2020 dataset, especially during puberty with significant increment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to examine the difference in HOMA-IR values over a 10-year period.

The HOMA-IR value is widely recognized to be significantly influenced by the BMI. Although the relationship between the HOMA-IR value and BMI is much weaker in children than in adults, it has been established that HOMA-IR values are naturally higher in individuals with overweight/obesity than in those with normal-weight, largely due to the close association between IR and obesity, as well as leptin. Accordingly, this study obtained percentile curves for the HOMA-IR values, not only for all subjects but also by stratifying individuals into groups with normal-weight and overweight/obesity. In this study, the means and distributions of HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the group with overweight/obesity than in the group with normal-weight across all ages and sexes.

### Modified quantitative insulin sensitivity check index is better correlated to hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp than other fasting-based index of insulin sensitivity in different insulin-resistant States [^117Y7NHU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Fasting-based index estimates of insulin sensitivity were compared with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (IS clamp) measurements in 148 subjects: normal controls (n = 46), and obese (n = 12), polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 16), first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic (n = 17), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 28), and type 2 diabetic (n = 29) patients. The fasting-based indexes tested included log homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), the revised QUICKI, and a new revised QUICKI using fasting plasma glycerol. In the population studied, at 40 mU/m(2).min (n = 30) revised QUICKI (r = 0.86; P < 0.0001) and QUICKI-glycerol (r = 0.87; P < 0.0001) gave higher correlations with the IS clamp than QUICKI and log HOMA (r = 0.78 and r = -0.78; P < 0.001). For subjects tested at 75 mU/m(2).min (n = 118), comparable correlations were found for all indexes (r > 0.80; P < 0.0001). When studied in subgroups, revised QUICKI and QUICKI-glycerol give significantly higher correlations with the IS clamp than other indexes for lean control subjects studied at 40mU/m(2).min and impaired glucose tolerance subjects. We confirmed, in a large patient population with a wide range of insulin sensitivities, that no single test is superior in all groups of patients. However, QUICKI and revised QUICKI are good indexes that offer correlations similar to or higher than values obtained with log HOMA. Such indexes are simple tools to estimate insulin sensitivity appropriate for epidemiological studies.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^1179c2CR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

AUC values of HOMA-IR by age, gender and diabetes status

The results of the effects of age and gender on the accuracy of HOMA-IR (AUC values) among non-diabetic and diabetic individuals were presented in Table 3. Meanwhile, Figure 1 shows the estimated AUC values by age, with the corresponding 95% point wise bootstrap confidence band in non-diabetic men and women. Regardless of diabetes status, the AUC values of HOMA-IR were slightly higher for MetS ATPIII than MetS IDF (Table 3). The effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR was analyzed in individuals with and without diabetes mellitus separately. As can be seen in Table 3, in non-diabetic women a significant non-linear effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR in identifying MetS, both MetS ATPIII (P = 0.012) and MetS IDF (P < 0.001), was found. The AUC presents a plateau with values greater than 0.7 until 50 years of age. From the age of 50, the AUC decreases progressively. For patients older than 70 years, the bootstrap confidence intervals for the AUC includes 0.5; thus there is no evidence suggesting that HOMA-IR can be used to classify non-diabetic older women with cardio metabolic risk. Table 3 shows the estimated AUC values for ages of 30, 50, and 70 years in our Spanish population. The AUC drops from 0.82 (age 30) to 0.58 (age 70).

### Insulin sensitivity variations in apparently healthy arab male subjects: correlation with insulin and C peptide [^1147P1R3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The glucose disposal rate, as reflected by the M value, was negatively correlated with both fasting insulin level and AUC of the insulin response to OGTT. This illustrates that maintenance of normoglycemia in subjects with low insulin sensitivity requires high insulin secretion. However, the measured insulin level in the peripheral blood reflects both insulin secretion and insulin clearance. Interindividual variations in hepatic clearance of insulin play an important role in determining the level of peripheral insulin.

The difference in HOMA2-IR levels among the three groups was at the limit of significance (p = 0.056). HOMA-IR is a good indicator of insulin resistance in a large cohort that includes a range of euglycemia, pre-diabetes and diabetes. However, in our cohort, all subjects were selected to be normoglycemic by all three criteria: normal fasting blood glucose, normal 2-hour plasma glucose after 75 g glucose challenge and normal HbA1c; in addition, all had BMI below 28. It is therefore plausible that HOMA-IR variations may not be sensitive to reflect different levels of insulin sensitivity in such a homogenous cohort.

### Defining insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps [^11475Cos]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to determine a cutoff point for identifying insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies performed at 120 mU/m(2)·min in a white population and to generate equations from routinely measured clinic and blood variables for predicting clamp-derived glucose disposal rate (GDR), i.e., insulin sensitivity.

Research Design and Methods

We assembled data from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (120 mU/m(2)·min insulin dose) performed at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center between 2001 and 2011. Subjects were divided into subjects with diabetes (n = 51) and subjects without diabetes (n = 116) by self-report and/or fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL.

Results

We found that 75% of individuals with a GDR < 5.6 mg/kg fat-free mass (FFM) + 17.7·min were truly insulin resistant. Cutoff values for GDRs normalized for body weight, body surface area, or FFM were 4.9 mg/kg·min, 212.2 mg/m(2)·min, and 7.3 mg/kgFFM·min, respectively. Next, we used classification tree models to predict GDR from routinely measured clinical and biochemical variables. We found that individual insulin resistance could be estimated with good sensitivity (89%) and specificity (67%) from the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) > 5.9 or 2.8 < HOMA-IR < 5.9 with HDL < 51 mg/dL.

Conclusions

We developed a cutoff for defining insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. Moreover, we now provide classification trees for predicting insulin resistance from routinely measured clinical and biochemical markers. These findings extend the clamp from a research tool to providing a clinically meaningful message for participants in research studies, potentially providing greater opportunity for earlier recognition of insulin resistance.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^115RWBpF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic insulin resistance, exacerbated in the course of pregnancy, is an important pathophysiologic mechanism of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We hypothesise that the degree of insulin resistance, assessed at diagnosis of GDM, is a parameter of its pathophysiologic heterogeneity and/or severity. Thus, it offers potential to open new avenues for the personalization of therapy in affected women.

Methods

1254 Polish Caucasian women with GDM were recruited into the study. The following parameters were assessed in the course of the study: body mass index (BMI), parity, weight gain during pregnancy, glycated haemoglobin, glucose level during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin, insulin resistance and insulin secretion. The severity of GDM was assessed based on insulin use and daily insulin dose during gestation. In order to evaluate insulin secretion and insulin resistance the homeostatic method was used (HOMA-B and HOMA-IR, respectively). We compared all the metabolic parameters and methods of treatment of GDM in women subdivided by quartiles of insulin resistance.

Results

The HOMA-IR in the whole population ranged from 0.34 to 20.39. The BMI, fasting insulin, fasting glucose and insulin dose per day increased along with increasing quartiles (HOMA-IR > 1.29). We observed a decrease of HOMA-B in the third quartile (1.92–2.89) compared with the first quartile (0.34–1.29). Insulin treatment was associated with HOMA-IR (< 1.29 vs. > 2.89), OR: 3.37, fasting glucose (≤ 6.11 vs. > 6.11 mmol/dl), OR: 2.61, age (≤ 30 vs. > 30 y. o.), OR: 1.54, and BMI (< 25 vs. ≥ 25 kg/m2), OR: 1.45. Maximum insulin dose was associated with HOMA-IR, OR: 2.00, after adjustment for family history of diabetes, and 2-h OGTT glucose.

Conclusion

Insulin resistance assessed by the HOMA index at diagnosis is associated with the severity and pathophysiological heterogeneity of GDM. A HOMA-IR > 1.29 points to the major role of insulin resistance, indicating the need for a treatment aimed at improving tissue sensitivity to insulin. A HOMA-IR 1.29–2.89 suggests reduced insulin secretion, which is an indication for the introduction of insulin therapy. A HOMA-IR > 2.89 indicates insufficient compensation for insulin resistance, which suggests the need for a treatment aimed at improving susceptibility of tissues to insulin combined with insulin therapy.

### Use of alternative thresholds defining insulin resistance to predict incident type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease [^112WRgWK]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The performance characteristics of surrogate insulin resistance (IR) measures, commonly defined as the top 25% of the measure's distribution, used to predict incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been critically assessed in community samples.

Methods and Results

Baseline IR was assessed among 2720 Framingham Offspring Study subjects by use of fasting insulin, the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), and the reciprocal of the Gutt insulin sensitivity index, with 7- to 11-year follow-up for incident DM (130 cases) or CVD (235). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio were estimated at 12 diagnostic thresholds (quantiles) of IR measures. Positive likelihood ratios for DM or CVD increased in relation to IR quantiles; risk gradients were greater for DM than for CVD, with no 9th to 10th quantile (76th centile) threshold effects. IR had better discrimination for incident DM than for CVD (HOMA-IR area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: DM 0.80 versus CVD 0.63). The HOMA-IR ≥ 76th centile threshold was associated with these test-performance values: sensitivity (DM 68%, CVD 40%), specificity (DM 77%, CVD 76%), and positive likelihood ratio (DM 3.0, CVD 1.7). The HOMA-IR threshold that yielded > 90% sensitivity was the 6th quantile for DM prediction and the 3rd quantile for CVD. Compared with the ≥ 76th centile threshold, these alternative thresholds yielded lower specificity (DM 43%, CVD 17%) and positive likelihood ratios (DM 1.6, CVD 1.1).

Conclusions

Surrogate IR measures have modest performance at the 76th centile, with no threshold effects. Different centile thresholds might be selected to optimize sensitivity versus specificity for DM versus CVD prediction if surrogate IR measures are used for risk prediction.

### Identification of individuals with insulin resistance using routine clinical measurements [^112Q5gH9]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a treatable precursor of diabetes and potentially of cardiovascular disease as well. To identify insulin-resistant patients, we developed decision rules from measurements of obesity, fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, and blood pressure and family history in 2,321 (2,138 nondiabetic) individuals studied with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique at 17 European sites; San Antonio, Texas; and the Pima Indian reservation. The distribution of whole-body glucose disposal appeared to be bimodal, with an optimal insulin resistance cutoff of < 28 micromol/min. kg lean body mass. Using recursive partitioning, we developed three types of classification tree models: the first, based on clinical measurements and all available laboratory determinations, had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (aROC) of 90.0% and generated a simple decision rule: diagnose insulin resistance if any of the following conditions are met: BMI > 28.9 kg/m(2), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) > 4.65, or BMI > 27.5 kg/m(2) and HOMA-IR > 3.60. The fasting serum insulin concentrations corresponding to these HOMA-IR cut points were 20.7 and 16.3 microU/ml, respectively. This rule had a sensitivity and specificity of 84.9 and 78.7%, respectively. The second model, which included clinical measurements but no laboratory determinations, had an aROC of 85.0% and generated a decision rule that had a sensitivity and specificity of 78.7 and 79.6%, respectively. The third model, which included clinical measurements and lipid measurements but not insulin (and thus excluded HOMA-IR as well), had a similar aROC (85.1%), sensitivity (81.3%), and specificity (76.3%). Thus, insulin-resistant individuals can be identified using simple decision rules that can be tailored to specific needs.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — medications beyond metformin for prediabetes notes that the use of medication beyond metformin in the treatment of individuals with prediabetes is an area of active research and without current consensus, and cites a meta-analysis of 5,655 adults with prediabetes and HF or CKD that found a 20% reduction in progression to new-onset T2DM in the group treated with sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus placebo. It also states that the STEP trial demonstrated improvement in HbA1C, fasting glucose, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) in patients with prediabetes when treated with once-weekly semaglutide versus placebo.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116svJYu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — plasma insulin measurement and insulin resistance: Although commonly obtained, insulin measurements do not add to diagnosis and are not recommended; attempts to diagnose insulin resistance by measuring plasma insulin concentration or any surrogate in clinical settings have no merit because they have no diagnostic value, there is no well-defined cutoff or universally accepted numeric expression, adult studies show fasting insulin explains no more than 5% to 50% of variability in insulin sensitivity and proposed cutoffs vary by 2.5-fold, fasting insulin can be similar in obese youths with normal versus impaired glucose tolerance, and therefore measuring plasma insulin concentrations remains a research tool with no clinical value for evaluation of obesity.

### Detection of insulin resistance by simple quantitative insulin sensitivity check index QUICKI for epidemiological assessment and prevention [^1119zvCh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recently defined simple insulin sensitivity check index QUICKI (Katz et al. 2000) for insulin resistance diagnostics in common clinical and epidemiological practice. Both the QUICKI (1/log insulin + log glycemia in mg/dL) and HOMA (insulin * glycemia in micromol/L/22.5) indexes were calculated from fasting values in 259 adult healthy volunteers and patients, and in 47 healthy and obese children of prepubertal age of both sexes. In adults, a fall in the QUICKI index (mean ± SEM in healthy subjects = 0.366 ± 0.029) as well as an increase in the HOMA index (in healthy subjects 1.57 ± 0.87) corresponded to metabolic and clinical manifestations of insulin resistance in various groups of outpatients. The QUICKI index had lower dispersion variances and the 95% confidence limits displayed a higher discrimination capacity. Patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes, hyperlipidemia typical for insulin resistance, or with combination of these metabolic disorders were characterized by QUICKI index values that were significantly lower than those of healthy volunteers. The QUICKI index in healthy prepubertal children indicated a higher insulin resistance compared to adults (mean 0.339 ± 0.020); an increase in the QUICKI index in obese children with BMI over 25 was not significant, although obese children showed a significant increase of serum leptin and triglycerides and a decrease of HDL-cholesterol. Adult patients with QUICKI index below 0.357 (which is at the lower limit of 95% confidence limits in healthy persons) represented a group with typical manifestations of metabolic syndrome, differing in these parameters significantly from the group of patients of comparable age with a QUICKI index greater than 0.357. The present study suggests suitability of the QUICKI index for diagnosis of insulin resistance in clinical and epidemiological practice. However, a normal QUICKI index range needs to be established for each laboratory with an appropriate control group because of significant interlaboratory variations in insulin determinations and/or possible differences in various populations.
