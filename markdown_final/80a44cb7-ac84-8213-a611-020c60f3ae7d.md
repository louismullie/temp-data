## Question

Is IV toradol okay for small bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate for pain control in small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of small bowel obstruction and how NSAIDs might affect it. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled contraindications and boxed warnings for ketorolac, especially gastrointestinal risks. Next, I will review guideline and expert recommendations specific to bowel obstruction. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits versus harms, including anastomotic leak concerns and opioid-sparing effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with safer alternatives and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Small bowel obstruction involves impaired transit with proximal dilation, ischemia risk, and often requires decompression and careful fluid management; NSAIDs can impair mucosal protection and reduce perfusion, which could theoretically worsen ischemia or perforation risk, so I need to ensure I'm not overlooking that mechanism before recommending ketorolac [^3ca22800].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position. The FDA boxed warning and multiple labels state ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, recent GI bleeding or perforation, and a history of peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding; it also carries a high risk of serious GI adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal and may occur without warning symptoms, so using it in a patient with potential ischemic or compromised bowel is risky [^2cf6532a] [^c2611de5] [^2dd2c734].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether any guideline explicitly addresses NSAIDs in small bowel obstruction. The WSES/Bologna guidelines for adhesive small bowel obstruction emphasize nasogastric decompression, fluids, and supportive care but do not endorse NSAIDs for pain control in this setting, which aligns with a conservative approach given the lack of supportive safety data and the potential for harm [^notfound]. Prehospital guidance similarly advises avoiding NSAIDs in suspected bowel obstruction, reinforcing caution in undifferentiated acute abdominal pain where obstruction is possible [^c4e8d6d2].

> I need to weigh benefits versus harms carefully. Ketorolac has proven opioid-sparing effects in perioperative and acute pain, but in the context of SBO, the potential to exacerbate mucosal ischemia, impair healing, or contribute to perforation outweighs analgesic benefit; moreover, observational data in GI surgery link ketorolac to higher odds of reintervention, ED visits, and readmissions, including anastomotic complications, although causality is debated and some colorectal studies show no association with leak when ketorolac is used selectively, so I should be cautious in extrapolating to SBO where the bowel is already compromised [^13d5bb1a] [^1c750f4c] [^10ccd8ea].

> Let me consider safer alternatives and practical steps. Acetaminophen is a reasonable first-line non-opioid when liver function allows, and if opioids are needed, they should be used judiciously with close monitoring for ileus and constipation; importantly, providing analgesia does not mask clinical findings or delay diagnosis in acute abdominal pain, so pain control should not be withheld when clinically indicated, but NSAIDs like ketorolac should be avoided in suspected or confirmed obstruction [^c4e8d6d2] [^9dea1608].

> I should double-check dosing constraints and duration if someone were to consider ketorolac despite risks. The FDA restricts total ketorolac therapy to 5 days and advises using the lowest effective dose; however, even short courses carry GI risk, and in SBO the risk-benefit calculus is unfavorable, so if used at all, it would require a compelling rationale and vigilant monitoring for bleeding, perforation, and renal effects, which is rarely feasible in the acute SBO setting [^2cf6532a] [^c2611de5].

> But wait, what if the patient is postoperative with an anastomosis nearby? I should confirm that concern. Contemporary colorectal guidance allows selective NSAID use in multimodal regimens but highlights molecule-specific anastomotic leak signals with diclofenac and notes that ketorolac has not consistently shown increased leak risk in elective colorectal cohorts; however, SBO represents a different, ischemia-prone physiology, so extrapolating permissiveness from elective surgery to SBO would be unsafe [^10ccd8ea] [^9a1dbc7d].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. IV ketorolac is not appropriate for small bowel obstruction because of the high risk of serious GI adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, and the absence of supportive safety data in this specific population; guidelines and prehospital protocols advise against NSAIDs in suspected obstruction, and safer non-NSAID strategies should be used for analgesia while definitive management proceeds [^2cf6532a] [^c4e8d6d2] [^9dea1608].

---

IV Toradol (ketorolac) is **generally avoided in small bowel obstruction** because NSAIDs can worsen GI ischemia and increase the risk of perforation [^2cf6532a]. It is not absolutely contraindicated, but **use is reserved for short-term, closely monitored cases** when alternatives are unsuitable and the patient has no GI bleeding, ulcer, or renal impairment. For SBO, **acetaminophen or opioids are preferred** for analgesia, and ketorolac should be limited to the lowest effective dose for ≤ 5 days with close monitoring for GI and renal complications [^c2611de5].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Ketorolac is a **potent NSAID** that inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. However, this mechanism also reduces GI mucosal protection, increasing the risk of GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation — complications that can be catastrophic in SBO [^2cf6532a].

---

## Clinical risks in small bowel obstruction

Patients with SBO are at **increased risk of GI complications** because of ischemia, distension, and compromised mucosal integrity. NSAIDs, including ketorolac, can exacerbate these risks by:

- **Increasing GI bleeding**: NSAIDs can cause serious GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, which can be fatal [^2cf6532a].

- **Impairing wound healing**: NSAIDs may impair intestinal healing, increasing the risk of anastomotic leaks and other complications [^13d5bb1a].

- **Renal effects**: NSAIDs can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with dehydration or pre-existing renal dysfunction, which is common in SBO [^373ea1f3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus **generally advise against NSAID use**, including ketorolac, in patients with SBO. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) emphasize conservative management with nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and careful analgesic selection, typically favoring acetaminophen or opioids over NSAIDs [^0b922082] [^69c399ae].

---

## Situations where IV ketorolac may be considered

While generally avoided, IV ketorolac may be considered in **specific scenarios**:

- **Short-term use**: Limited to short-term use (≤ 5 days) [^2cf6532a] in patients without GI bleeding, ulcers, or renal impairment [^373ea1f3].

- **Alternative analgesics contraindicated**: When acetaminophen or opioids are contraindicated or ineffective.

- **Close monitoring**: Only with close clinical monitoring for GI and renal complications [^92cbfcb2].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

Given the risks associated with ketorolac in SBO, **alternative analgesic strategies** are recommended:

| **Analgesic** | **Advantages** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | - Safe GI profile <br/> - Minimal effect on GI motility | Hepatotoxicity at high doses |
| Opioids (morphine, hydromorphone) | - Effective for moderate to severe pain <br/> - Minimal GI irritation | - Constipation <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Sedation |
| Regional anesthesia (epidural) | - Effective analgesia <br/> - Reduced opioid use | - Invasive <br/> - Not suitable for all patients |

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Studies and clinical experience indicate that NSAID use in SBO is associated with **increased risks of GI bleeding, perforation, and impaired healing**. While specific data on ketorolac in SBO are limited, extrapolation from general surgical populations and NSAID class effects supports caution and avoidance when possible [^13d5bb1a].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If IV ketorolac is used in SBO, **strict monitoring protocols** should be implemented:

- **GI monitoring**: Watch for signs of GI bleeding, ulceration, or perforation [^c2611de5].

- **Renal monitoring**: Monitor renal function closely, especially in patients with dehydration or pre-existing renal impairment [^92cbfcb2].

- **Limit duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible (≤ 5 days) [^2cf6532a].

---

IV Toradol (ketorolac) is **generally avoided in small bowel obstruction** due to the risk of GI bleeding, ulceration, and impaired healing. It may be considered only in select cases with close monitoring and for short-term use, while acetaminophen or opioids are preferred for analgesia.

WARNINGS

(see also Boxed WARNING)

The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine-IV/IM and
ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac
tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

The most serious risks associated with ketorolac tromethamine are:

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with
previously documented peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding. Ketorolac tromethamine
can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding,
ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine,
which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with ketorolac tromethamine.

Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on
NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as
dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The
incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with
increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, ketorolac tromethamine. Do
not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than 5 days. However, even short-term
therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other
factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs
include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer
duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general
health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or
debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating
this population.

### A novel injectable formulation of diclofenac compared with intravenous ketorolac or placebo for acute moderate-to-severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose study [^31e4c17b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Injectable formulations of diclofenac have long been available in Europe and other countries. These formulations use a default dose of 75 mg of diclofenac delivered IV over 30 to 120 minutes or as an IM injection. A novel formulation of injectable diclofenac sodium, Dyloject®, is solubilized with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) so that it can be given IV or IM in a small volume bolus. In this multicenter, multiple-dose, multiple-day, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 3 study, we investigated whether lower doses of HPβCD diclofenac delivered as a small volume bolus would be effective for the management of acute pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery.

Methods

Adults with moderate and severe pain, defined as ≥ 50 mm on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, within 6 hours after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive HPβCD diclofenac, 18.75 mg or 37.5 mg; ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg; or placebo. Patients in all treatment arms received a bolus IV injection every 6 hours until discharged. They were observed for at least 48 h, and for up to 5 days. Rescue IV morphine was available any time, up to a total of 7.5 mg over a 3-hour period. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of pain intensity differences from 0 to 48 hours after study drug initiation.

Results

Three hundred thirty-one patients received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. Over the first 48 hours, both IV HPβCD diclofenac doses, as well as ketorolac, produced significant reductions in pain intensity over placebo (all P < 0.05), as well as significant reductions in the need for rescue morphine administration. Both doses of HPβCD diclofenac, as well as ketorolac, significantly reduced rescue morphine dosages, as compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), and time to rescue morphine administration was significantly increased by treatment with 18.75 mg diclofenac and ketorolac. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 20.2%. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in either diclofenac dose group, whereas only 1 was reported in the ketorolac group.

Conclusions

For patients with acute moderate and severe pain after abdominal or pelvic surgery, repeated 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg doses of HPβCD diclofenac provided significant analgesic efficacy, as compared to placebo. Significant analgesic efficacy was also provided by the active comparator ketorolac. Both HPβCD diclofenac and ketorolac significantly reduced the need for opioids.

### Premedication with intravenous ketorolac trometamol (toradol) in colonoscopy: a randomized controlled trial [^92fd7f4e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a prospective double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial to investigate the effect of ketorolac trometamol (KT) administered intravenously as premedication in colonoscopy.

Methods

One hundred and forty patients undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to receive either 60 mg of KT (KT group (KTG), n = 70) or placebo (normal saline group (NSG), n = 70) intravenously as premedication 30 min prior to procedure. Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) was used as the mode of sedation. Outcome measures included patient self-assessed pain score in a 10-cm unscaled visual analog scale (VAS), endoscopist assessment of patient pain score in VAS, patient's willingness to repeat colonoscopy, administered and demanded doses of PCS, patient satisfaction score in VAS, and hemodynamic changes during and after the procedure.

Results

The mean patient self-assessed pain score (SD) during procedure was significantly lower in KTG than NSG: 5.08 (2.74) vs 6.62 (2.45); p = 0.001. The mean endoscopist assessment of patient pain score (SD) was significantly lower in KTG than NSG as well: 3.99 (2.80) vs 5.28 (2.71); p = 0.006. More patients in KTG were willing to repeat procedure as compared with NSG (80.0%vs 57.1%; p = 0.004). No significant difference was found in the administered and demanded doses of PCS, mean satisfactory scores and hemodynamic changes in both groups. No serious complication related to intravenous (IV) KT was noted.

Conclusions

Premedication with IV KT (Toradol) improves pain control during colonoscopy with no associated serious complications.

(see also Boxed WARNING)

The total combined duration of use of oral ketorolac tromethamine and IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

The most serious risks associated with ketorolac tromethamine are:

Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy.

The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with ketorolac tromethamine. Do not use ketorolac tromethamine for more than five days.

However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^82105c44]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Physicians, when prescribing ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their
patients or their guardians of the potential risks of ketorolac tromethamine
treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE
REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they
develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients
not to give ketorolac tromethamine tablets to other
family members and to discard any unused drug.

Remember that the total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine
tablet and ketorolac tromethamine IV or IM dosing is not to exceed 5 days in
adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric
patients.

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating
therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.
Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that
accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side
effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even
death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients
should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath,
weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing
any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:
Cardiovascular Effects).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and
rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result
in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and
bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the
signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical
advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain,
dyspepsia, melena and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance
of this follow-up (see WARNINGS:
Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Ketorolac tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side
effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in
hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur
without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin
rash and blisters, fever or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and
should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms.
Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type
of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain
or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of
hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper
quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be
instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g.,
difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients
should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine should be
avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

SPRIX is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [see Contraindications (4)].

NSAIDs, including ketorolac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Do not use Sprix in those with active GI bleeding.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue SPRIX until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Use great care when giving SPRIX to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

### A prospective randomized trial of intravenous ketorolac vs. acetaminophen administered with opioid patient-controlled analgesia in gynecologic surgery [^fbeaead2]. Gynecologic Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine which non-narcotic analgesic, acetaminophen (Ofirmev®) or ketorolac (Toradol®), provides better post-operative pain control when combined with an opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. Secondary objectives include comparisons of the rates of ileus, post-operative bleeding, transfusions, and length-of-hospitalization (LOH).

Methods

A prospective, randomized trial of acetaminophen (A) 1-g intravenous (IV) every 6-h or ketorolac (K) 15-mg IV every 6-h from post-operative day 1–3 in addition to an opioid PCA for patients undergoing benign or malignant gynecologic laparotomy procedures was performed. Abstracted data included pain levels via visual analogue pain scales (VAS), amount of narcotic used, hepatic enzyme levels, hemoglobin, urine output, blood transfusions, time to return of flatus and LOH.

Results

One-hundred patients were accrued and underwent 55 benign gynecologic laparotomies and 45 cancer-related laparotomies. VAS pain levels (3.3 K, 3.5 A) and morphine PCA use (79.1 oral morphine equivalents [OME] K vs. 84.5 A) were not different, however dilaudid PCA usage was less by K patients (84.4 OME K and 136.8 OME A, p < 0.001). There was a significant hemoglobin change between the two groups (2.6 g K vs. 2 g A, p = 0.015), however blood transfusions were equal (28% K, 22% A, p > 0.05). Return of flatus was 2.7-days for K vs. 3.4-days for A (p = 0.011) and LOH was not different (4.4-days K vs. 5.1-days A, p = 0.094).

Conclusions

Both intravenous ketorolac and acetaminophen provide similar post-operative analgesia through VAS pain scales and total usage of morphine via PCA pumps. Use of ketorolac with dilaudid PCA was associated with less dependence on dilaudid and a quicker return of bowel function than acetaminophen, however length of stay and transfusion rates were not different.

### Comparison of intravenous ketorolac at three doses for treating renal colic in the emergency department: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^3c6b1950]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is extensively used for the management of renal colic in the emergency department (ED). It has been proposed that ketorolac is used at doses above its analgesic ceiling with no more advantages and increased risk of adverse effects. In this study, we compared the analgesic effects of three doses of intravenous ketorolac in patients with renal colic.

Methods

This noninferiority, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluated the analgesic efficacy of three doses of intravenous ketorolac (10, 20, and 30 mg) in adult patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Exclusion criteria consisted of age > 65 years, active peptic ulcer disease, acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage, renal or hepatic insufficiency, NSAID hypersensitivity, pregnancy or breastfeeding, unstable vital signs, and patients who had received analgesics in the past 24 hours. Pain was recorded every 15 minutes from baseline up to 60 minutes, and the primary outcome was pain reduction at 30 minutes. If patients still required additional pain medications at 30 minutes, they would receive 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate as a rescue analgesic.

Results

A total of 165 subjects enrolled in this study, 55 in each group. The median visual analog scale score in 30 minutes was improved from 90 at baseline to 40 among subjects who were randomized to 30-mg group. This improvement was 40 and 50 mm in 20- and 10-mg ketorolac treatment arms, respectively, with no significant difference between the three doses (p < 0.05). Secondary outcomes showed similar rescue analgesic administration and adverse effects. There was no serious adverse event.

Conclusion

Ketorolac at 10-, 20-, and 30-mg doses can produce similar analgesic efficacy in renal colic.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^f217370e]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the USA over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the USA. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^bae14435]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Narcotics which bind to opioid receptors are prescribed for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. The common side effects associated with opioid administration are well known and include constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, and dizziness. Constipation has been noted to occur with as little as one dose of morphine and may effect up to 95% of patients receiving opioid therapy. Constipation is a potentially serious complication which can result in decreased patient compliance and therefore inferior pain control, hemorrhoid formation, rectal pain, bowel rupture, and potentially death. Less common adverse effects include respiratory depression, reduced gastric motility, bladder dysfunction (eg, urinary retention), immunological depression (both adaptive and innate), hormonal dysfunction (opioid endocrinopathy), sleep disturbances, and CV complications (eg, vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia). Over time, tolerance, hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity), and addiction or physical dependence can develop. It is generally recommended that opioids be used in conjunction with other analgesic approaches (pharmaceutical and otherwise) and for the shortest time possible. Thus, limiting use of opioid analgesics by any means can increase overall patient safety in the hospital setting. Multiple meta-analyses clearly demonstrate that members of the NSAID drug class confer an opioid sparing effect which is a safety benefit when opioid-associated AEs and the potential for addiction are considered. The extent of the reduction in narcotic use by any given NSAID would be dependent on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the extent of preexisting central sensitization (duration of pain) and the pain level experienced by the patient – even under sedation. Thus, when assessing the extent of morphine sparing reported by a clinical trial, the minimum baseline pain score (eg, VAS) required for eligibility must be taken into account. Due to the nature of the approved indications for IV ibuprofen, clinical studies enroll subjects with mild to moderate pain and above (ie, VAS ≥ 30 mm, 100 mm scale). Alternatively, studies of IV diclofenac or ketorolac focus on moderate to severe pain and exclusively enroll subjects with a baseline VAS of ≥ 50 mm. Thus, the extent of morphine sparing cannot be compared between the two clinical programs. Alternatively, the conclusion which can be made is that despite the inclusion of a portion of patients with lower baseline pain scores (who may never require narcotics), the use of IV ibuprofen prior to and during surgery is consistently associated with reductions in narcotic use across studies – up to a 74% reduction when integrated into multimodal pain management regimens (P < 0.001). This is a substantial reduction when considered as an absolute value and even more so when the potential dilution of the morphine-sparing effect by inclusion of patients with lower baseline pain is considered.

### Perioperative single dose ketorolac to prevent postoperative pain: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^85f5b62c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Preventive analgesia using non-opioid analgesic strategies is recognized as a pathway to improve postoperative pain control while minimizing opioid-related side effects. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug frequently used to treat postoperative pain. However, the optimal dose and route of administration for systemic single dose ketorolac to prevent postoperative pain is not well defined. We performed a quantitative systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of perioperative ketorolac on postoperative analgesia.

Methods

We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. A wide search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of a single dose of systemic ketorolac on postoperative pain and opioid consumption. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Effects of ketorolac dose were evaluated by pooling studies into 30- and 60-mg dosage groups. Asymmetry of funnel plots was examined using Egger regression. The presence of heterogeneity was assessed by subgroup analysis according to the route of systemic administration (IV versus IM) and the time of drug administration (preincision versus postincision).

Results

Thirteen randomized clinical trials with 782 subjects were included. The weighted mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) of combined effects showed a difference for ketorolac over placebo for early pain at rest of -0.64 (-1.11 to -0.18) but not at late pain at rest, -0.29 (-0.88 to 0.29) summary point (0–10 scale). Opioid consumption was decreased by the 60-mg dose, with a mean (95% CI) IV morphine equivalent consumption of -1.64 mg (-2.90 to -0.37 mg). The opioid-sparing effects of ketorolac compared with placebo were greater when the drug was administered IM compared with when the drug was administered IV, with a mean difference (95% CI) IV morphine equivalent consumption of -2.13 mg (-4.1 to -0.21 mg). Postoperative nausea and vomiting were reduced by the 60-mg dose, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.49 (0.29–0.81).

Conclusions

Single dose systemic ketorolac is an effective adjunct in multimodal regimens to reduce postoperative pain. Improved postoperative analgesia achieved with ketorolac was also accompanied by a reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting. The 60-mg dose offers significant benefits but there is a lack of current evidence that the 30-mg dose offers significant benefits on postoperative pain outcomes.

### An analysis of harms reporting in systematic reviews regarding ketorolac for management of perioperative pain [^f126f059]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Owing to the frequent perioperative use of ketorolac tromethamine and its ability to minimise postoperative opioid requirements, it is important to continually reassess harms associated with its use. Our primary objective was to investigate the extent of harms reporting in systematic reviews (SRs) on ketorolac for perioperative pain.

Methods

In May 2022, we conducted a search of major databases, MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), Embase, Epistemonikos, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify eligible SRs on ketorolac for perioperative pain. Screening and data extraction were performed in masked, duplicate fashion. A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) was used to appraise the methodological quality of included SRs. Corrected covered area (CCA) was calculated to determine overlap of primary studies between SR dyads.

Results

A total of 28 SRs evaluating 630 primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven SRs (7/28, 25%) reported no harms and 17 SRs (17/28, 60.7%) reported ≤ 50% of harms items. A significant association was found between completeness of harms reporting and whether harms were specified as a primary outcome (P < 0.001). No other associations were statistically significant. Regarding methodological quality, 22 SRs were appraised as 'critically low' (22/28, 78.6%), 5 as 'low' (5/28, 17.9%), and 1 as 'high' (1/28, 3.6%). One SR dyad had a CCA > 50% but neither reported harms.

Conclusions

The extent of harms reporting in systematic reviews was inadequate. Given the importance that systematic reviews have on guiding perioperative decision-making, it is essential to improve the completeness of harms reporting.

### Efficacy of non-opioid analgesics to control postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis [^799ccce4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of postoperative pain remains a significant issue, including providing adequate pain control beyond immediate postsurgical recovery. Poorly managed acute postoperative pain may have a significant impact on clinical and economic outcomes and is a consistent risk factor for persistent or chronic postoperative pain. Opioid analgesics are the foundation of treatment for moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain and are among the most effective agents for the management of pain in many settings. However, opioids are associated with the potential risks of opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs), (such as respiratory and gastrointestinal related events) and abuse or dependence, which can significantly increase the cost of medical care.

Multimodal pain management guidelines have been developed that provide guidance on reducing opioid monotherapy and the doses of opioids used to treat acute pain, while still providing effective pain management This approach involves the administration of various opioid and non-opioid agents that act on different sites, resulting in a synergistic and additive effect. The goal of multimodal pain management is to reduce ORADEs and their costs, as well as the risks of opioid abuse or dependence.

Non-opioid pharmacologic therapies for potential use in the multimodal regimen include acetaminophen and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recent practice guidelines have recommended that unless contraindicated, all patients should receive around-the-clock treatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs as part of multimodal analgesia for post-operative pain management. When NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen are included in treatment regimens with opioids for pain relief, an opioid-sparing effect has been demonstrated. Intravenous use of NSAIDs can achieve a faster onset of action and peak plasma concentrations compared to oral treatment regimens. Parenteral formulations of ketorolac and ibuprofen were the only IV NSAIDs currently approved for postoperative pain management in the United States (US) at the time this study was conducted. Studies have found that ketorolac reduces opioid consumption by 25–45% and provides additional benefits such as improving bowel function after colorectal surgery and epidural pain after cesarean delivery. Intravenous ibuprofen is approved for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. Another non-opioid analgesic, acetaminophen, has an onset of action of 15 min when given as IV which is faster than the oral formulation and is associated with opioid-sparing effects.

### Single-dose intravenous ketorolac for acute postoperative pain in adults [^6434dd3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain is common and may be severe. Postoperative administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces patient opioid requirements and, in turn, may reduce the incidence and severity of opioid-induced adverse events (AEs).

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose intravenous ketorolac, compared with placebo or an active comparator, for moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS on 20 April 2020. We checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blind trials that compared a single postoperative dose of intravenous ketorolac with placebo or another active treatment, for treating acute postoperative pain in adults following any surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was the number of participants in each arm achieving at least 50% pain relief over a four- and six-hour period. Our secondary outcomes were time to and number of participants using rescue medication; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and for any other cause; and number of participants experiencing any AE, serious AEs (SAEs), and NSAID-related or opioid-related AEs. For subgroup analysis, we planned to analyze different doses of parenteral ketorolac separately and to analyze results based on the type of surgery performed. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 12 studies, involving 1905 participants undergoing various surgeries (pelvic/abdominal, dental, and orthopedic), with 17 to 83 participants receiving intravenous ketorolac in each study. Mean study population ages ranged from 22.5 years to 67.4 years. Most studies administered a dose of ketorolac of 30 mg; one study assessed 15 mg, and another administered 60 mg. Most studies had an unclear risk of bias for some domains, particularly allocation concealment and blinding, and a high risk of bias due to small sample size. The overall certainty of evidence for each outcome ranged from very low to moderate. Reasons for downgrading certainty included serious study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. Ketorolac versus placebo Very low-certainty evidence from eight studies (658 participants) suggests that ketorolac results in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over four hours compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.37). The number needed to treat for one additional participant to benefit (NNTB) was 2.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 3.7). Low-certainty evidence from 10 studies (914 participants) demonstrates that ketorolac may result in a large increase in the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief over six hours compared to placebo (RR 3.26, 95% CI 1.93 to 5.51). The NNTB was 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.7). Among secondary outcomes, for time to rescue medication, moderate-certainty evidence comparing intravenous ketorolac versus placebo demonstrated a mean median of 271 minutes for ketorolac versus 104 minutes for placebo (6 studies, 633 participants). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low-certainty evidence from five studies (417 participants) compared ketorolac with placebo. The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.00), that is, it did not demonstrate a difference between groups. Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with placebo (74% versus 65%; 8 studies, 810 participants; RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19; number needed to treat for an additional harmful event (NNTH) 16.7, 95% CI 8.3 to infinite, moderate-certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low-certainty evidence from eight studies (703 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and placebo (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.03). Ketorolac versus NSAIDs Ketorolac was compared to parecoxib in four studies and diclofenac in two studies. For our primary outcome, over both four and six hours there was no evidence of a difference between intravenous ketorolac and another NSAID (low-certainty and moderate-certainty evidence, respectively). Over four hours, four studies (337 participants) produced an RR of 1.04 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.21) and over six hours, six studies (603 participants) produced an RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.19). For time to rescue medication, low-certainty evidence from four studies (427 participants) suggested that participants receiving ketorolac waited an extra 35 minutes (mean median 331 minutes versus 296 minutes). For the number of participants using rescue medication, very low-certainty evidence from three studies (260 participants) compared ketorolac with another NSAID. The RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.40), that is, there may be little or no difference between groups. Ketorolac probably results in a slight increase in total adverse event rates compared with another NSAID (76% versus 68%, 5 studies, 516 participants; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.23; NNTH 12.5, 95% CI 6.7 to infinite, moderate-certainty evidence). Serious AEs were rare. Low-certainty evidence from five studies (530 participants) did not demonstrate a difference in rates between ketorolac and another NSAID (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.99). Only one of the five studies reported a single serious AE.

Authors' Conclusions

The amount and certainty of evidence for the use of intravenous ketorolac as a treatment for postoperative pain varies across efficacy and safety outcomes and amongst comparators, from very low to moderate. The available evidence indicates that postoperative intravenous ketorolac administration may offer substantial pain relief for most patients, but further research may impact this estimate. Adverse events appear to occur at a slightly higher rate in comparison to placebo and to other NSAIDs. Insufficient information is available to assess whether intravenous ketorolac has a different rate of gastrointestinal or surgical-site bleeding, renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events versus other NSAIDs. There was a lack of studies in cardiovascular surgeries and in elderly populations who may be at increased risk for adverse events.

### Ketorolac in the era of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a systematic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues [^cf108d74]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The recent introduction of oral COX-2 selective NSAIDs with potential for perioperative use, and the ongoing development of intravenous formulations, stimulated a systemic review of efficacy, side effects, and regulatory issues related to ketorolac for management of postoperative analgesia.

Design

To examine the opioid dose sparing effect of ketorolac, we compiled published, randomized controlled trials of ketorolac versus placebo, with opioids given for breakthrough pain, published in English-language journals from 1986–2001. Odds ratios were computed to assess whether the use of ketorolac reduced the incidence of opioid side effects or improved the quality of analgesia.

Results

Depending on the type of surgery, ketorolac reduced opioid dose by a mean of 36% (range 0% to 73%). Seventy percent of patients in control groups experienced moderate-severe pain 1 hour postoperatively, while 36% of the control patients had moderate to severe pain 24 hours postoperatively. Analgesia was improved in patients receiving ketorolac in combination with opioids. However, we did not find a concomitant reduction in opioid side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). This may be due to studies having inadequate (to small) sample sizes to detect differences in the incidence of opioid related side effects. The risk for adverse events with ketorolac increases with high doses, with prolonged therapy (> 5 days), or invulnerable patients (e.g. the elderly). The incidence of serious adverse events has declined since dosage guidelines were revised.

Conclusions

Ketorolac should be administered at the lowest dose necessary. Analgesics that provide effective analgesia with minimal adverse effects are needed.

### Optimizing recovery after laparoscopic colon surgery (ORAL-CS): effect of intravenous ketorolac on length of hospital stay [^9a01f9a4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to determine if intravenous ketorolac can reduce ileus following laparoscopic colorectal surgery, thus shortening hospital stay.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection and receiving morphine patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and either intravenous ketorolac (group A) or placebo (group B), for 48 h after surgery. Daily assessments were made by a blinded assistant for level of pain control. Diet advancement and discharge were decided according to strictly defined criteria.

Results

From October 2002 to March 2005, 190 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Of this total, 84 patients were eligible for this study and 70 consented. Another 26 patients were excluded, leaving 22 patients in each group. Two patients who suffered anastomotic leaks in the early postoperative period were excluded from further analysis. Median length of stay for the entire study was 4.0 days, with significant correlation between milligrams of morphine consumed and time to first flatus (r = 0.422, p = 0.005), full diet (r = 0.522, p < 0.001), and discharge (r = 0.437, p = 0.004). There we no differences between groups in age, body mass index, or operating time. Patients in group A consumed less morphine (33 ± 31 mg versus 63 ± 41 mg, p = 0.011), and had less time to first flatus (median 2.0 days versus 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and full diet (median 2.5 days versus 3.0 days, p = 0.033). The reduction in length of stay was not significant (mean 3.6 days versus 4.5 days, median 4.0 days versus 4.0 days, p = 0.142). Pain control was superior in group A. Three patients required readmission for treatment of five anastomotic leaks (4 in group A versus 1 in group B, p = 0.15). Two of them underwent reoperation.

Conclusions

Intravenous ketorolac was efficacious in improving pain control and reducing postoperative ileus when anastomotic leaks were excluded. This simple intervention shows promise in reducing hospital stay, although the outcome was not statistically significant. The high number of leaks is inconsistent with this group's experience and is of concern.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^84754691]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for," level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident," level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^953edf24]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Prehospital pain management — Recommendation 10 (nitrous oxide versus IV opioids) reports: "No recommendation was made regarding the comparison between nitrous oxide versus IV opioids for the initial management of moderate to severe pain in the prehospital setting," because "The panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding this question." Context notes "Nitrous oxide has been used in the prehospital setting for decades so there is experiential evidence supporting feasibility," and "A retrospective study and review described its use in prehospital care, and suggested that it might be safe enough for use by non-certified or lay persons (30)." Practical constraints include that "The equipment required for administration is somewhat complex and does involve significant acquisition cost relative to opioid administration," and administration "is limited to patients who can understand instructions and cooperate with self-administration" and "is inappropriate in some clinical settings (e.g., bowel obstruction, pneumothorax)."

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^d35a609e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Multimodal systemic analgesia — prophylactic IV acetaminophen as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen reduces incidence of nausea when given before the onset of pain (A1), while the effect of oral acetaminophen on PONV is not well-studied. RCTs and meta-analyses show that perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, intraoperative ketamine may have a morphine-sparing effect in the postoperative period (A1). In patients with postoperative patient-controlled analgesia, IV or intramuscular NSAIDs significantly reduced the risk of PONV and appears to be more effective than IV acetaminophen (A1). Nonselective NSAIDs may be associated with an anastomotic leak in gastrointestinal surgery and their use should be carefully considered.

### Comparison of morphine, ketorolac, and their combination for postoperative pain: results from a large, randomized, double-blind trial [^a17fa963]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses report similar numbers needed to treat for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. Differences in baseline pain intensity among the studies from which these numbers needed to treat were derived may have confounded the results. NSAIDs have an opioid-sparing effect, but the importance of this effect is unclear. Therefore, the authors sought to compare the proportions of subjects who obtain pain relief with ketorolac versus morphine after surgery and to determine whether the opioid-sparing effect of an NSAID reduces the magnitude of opioid side effects.

Methods

The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The authors randomly assigned 1,003 adult patients to receive 30 mg ketorolac or 0.1 mg/kg morphine intravenously. They calculated the proportion of subjects who achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity 30 min after analgesic administration. Further, so long as pain intensity 30 min after analgesic administration was 5 or more out of 10, patients received 2.5 mg morphine every 10 min until pain intensity was 4 or less out of 10. The authors assessed the presence of opioid-related side effects.

Results

Five hundred patients received morphine and 503 received ketorolac. Fifty percent of patients in the morphine group achieved pain relief, compared with 31% in the ketorolac group (difference, 19%; 95% confidence interval, 13–25%). The ketorolac-morphine group required less morphine (difference, 6.5 mg; 95% confidence interval, -5.8 to -7.2) and had a lower incidence of side effects (difference, 11%; 95% confidence interval, 5–16%) than the morphine group.

Conclusions

Opioids are more efficacious analgesics than NSAIDs, although historic data for these two drugs yield similar numbers needed to treat. Adding NSAIDs to the opioid treatment reduces morphine requirements and opioid-related side effects in the early postoperative period.

### Liposome bupivacaine for improvement in economic outcomes and opioid burden in GI surgery: IMPROVE study pooled analysis [^0797b541]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Adults aged 18 years or older who were undergoing open colectomy, laparoscopic colectomy, or ileostomy reversal were eligible for study inclusion. Key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; severe hepatic impairment; a history of drug or alcohol abuse; any concomitant psychiatric, psychological, or other condition that could interfere with study participation; intraoperative use of opioids (other than fentanyl and analogs), any other analgesics (including local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory drugs); or use of alvimopan.

Except for the differences in surgical models, methodology was similar across studies, and has been described in previous publications.–Briefly, patients in each study were enrolled in sequential cohorts (IV opioid PCA cohort first, followed by liposome bupivacaine–based multimodal analgesia cohort). All screening procedures were completed within 2 weeks of surgery. On the day of surgery (study day 1), treatment of patients assigned to IV opioid PCA therapy was initiated as soon as possible after surgery. For patients assigned to multimodal analgesia, a single administration of liposome bupivacaine 266 mg in 0.9% normal saline was injected at the surgical site using a moving-needle technique prior to wound closure. The 266 mg dose of liposome bupivacaine was expanded to a total volume of 40 mL in studies involving open and laparoscopic colectomy procedures, and to a total volume of 30 mL in studies involving ileostomy reversal. Patients in the multimodal analgesia cohort also received a single administration of IV ketorolac 30 mg (or alternative IV nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) at the end of surgery, followed by oral or IV acetaminophen 1,000 mg plus oral ibuprofen 600 mg given every 6 hours (starting with patient tolerance of oral intake) for 72 hours after surgery.

### Sublingual hyoscyamine sulfate in combination with ketorolac tromethamine for ureteral colic: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^6d898690]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of hyoscyamine sulfate in combination with ketorolac tromethamine for the reduction of pain in emergency department patients with ureteral colic.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study at 2 EDs with residency programs in emergency medicine. Patients were at least 18 years old and presented to the ED with an initial history and physical examination consistent with ureteral colic. Patients received a single intravenous dose of 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine given over a 1-minute period with either a single sublingual dose of 0.125 mg of hyoscyamine sulfate or a placebo. If inadequate analgesia was noted after 30 minutes, a standard dose of meperidine could be administered for rescue. All other treatments including intravenous fluids and antiemetics were standardized. The main study outcome was change in visual analog scale pain score from baseline to 30 minutes.

Results

Seventy-two patients were evaluated for inclusion. Thirteen patients who had self-administered pain medications within 4 hours of presentation were excluded before randomization. Sixteen patients who did not have a renal calculus confirmed by either intravenous urogram or helical computed tomography were also excluded from efficacy analysis. There did not appear to be any clinically important differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. The repeated-measures analysis of the remaining 43 patients showed no clinically important difference in pain score using the visual analog scale at any time point. There were no clinically important differences between the 2 study groups for amount of rescue meperidine administered or end-of-study global satisfaction scores.

Conclusion

Hyoscyamine sulfate did not provide any additional pain relief from ureteral colic when administered with ketorolac tromethamine. There was no clinically important difference in change of pain scores at 30 minutes in patients with ureteral colic receiving supplemental hyoscyamine sulfate.

Perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may have a morphine-sparing effect, and in patients using postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), IV or IM NSAIDs significantly reduced the risk of PONV and appear more effective than IV acetaminophen; however, nonselective NSAIDs are associated with anastomotic leak in gastrointestinal surgery and should be used with caution.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^9dea1608]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous NSAIDs versus IV opioids — We suggest either IV NSAIDs or IV opioids for the initial management of moderate to severe pain in the prehospital setting. (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding pain severity at 15 minutes, partial, or full relief of pain, or time to analgesic effect, and the evidence did not demonstrate any clinically significant difference in pain severity at 30 or 60 minutes. The panel expressed concern that there was evidence of significant sub-therapeutic dosing of the NSAID, ketorolac, in the limited data available, and noted a small difference in cost with the intervention (NSAIDs, specifically ketorolac) being more costly than opioids; at least one study suggested that adverse events were more common with morphine, including drowsiness/sleeping and nausea/vomiting. Intravenous NSAIDs, including ketorolac, may be attractive as a first line analgesic in patients who are intolerant or allergic to opioids or who prefer a lower risk of side effects, and the panel noted that ketorolac is already in use in many EMS systems.

### A double-blind randomized clinical trial evaluating the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac versus butorphanol for patients with suspected biliary colic in the emergency department [^acba8b33]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected biliary colic often require intravenous (IV) analgesia. The choice of IV analgesia typically includes opioids and ketorolac. Although ultrasound (US) is the initial diagnostic study in these patients, nondiagnostic scans and a high clinical suspicion may require the patient to undergo hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA). Opioids such as morphine interfere with the HIDA scan and thus may limit its value as an analgesic in the ED for these patients. Analgesics that do not interfere with HIDA scanning include ketorolac and butorphanol, an opioid agonist-antagonist. This study evaluates the efficacy of IV ketorolac compared to butorphanol for the treatment of biliary colic pain in the ED.

Methods

Between June 2005 and February 2007, a convenience sample of patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain suspected to be biliary colic were randomized to receive either 30 mg of IV ketorolac or 1 mg of IV butorphanol. Pain level was assessed using a 1 to 10 "faces" visual analog pain scale initially, as well as 15 and 30 minutes after medication infusion. Side effect profiles and the need for rescue analgesia were also assessed. Patients and clinicians were blinded to the study drug given.

Results

Forty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Both groups had similar demographics and baseline pain scores. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) pain score in the butorphanol group decreased from 7.1 (± 1.7) to 2.1 (± 2.2) after 30 minutes. The mean (± SD) pain score in the ketorolac group decreased from 7.4 (± 2.0) to 3.1 (± 3.3) after 30 minutes. Both groups had similar needs for rescue analgesia. Side effects included dizziness and sedation with butorphanol and nausea with ketorolac.

Conclusions

Although limited by small sample size and convenience sample, this study demonstrates that both ketorolac and butorphanol provide pain relief in biliary colic. Both agents should be considered reasonable options in the ED treatment of biliary colic, especially in patients that may undergo HIDA.

Study design and outcomes

The included studies were identified based on their similar design, patient populations, duration of treatment, and endpoints. Both studies were Phase III trials with a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, multiple-dose, placebo- and active comparator-controlled design. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive HPβCD-diclofenac (Dyloject ™; Hospira, Inc. a Pfizer company, Lake Forest, IL, USA), ketorolac, or placebo, according to a computer-generated random number code. Investigators, clinical staff, and patients were blinded to treatment group assignment. Dose levels of individual study treatments in the orthopedic surgery study were not blinded, however. Patients in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study received 18.75 or 37.5 mg HPβCD-diclofenac (based on randomization), 30 mg ketorolac, or placebo. Patients in the orthopedic surgery study received either 18.75, 37.5, or 50 mg HPβCD-diclofenac, based on the presence of defined risk factors. The standard dose was 37.5 mg; however, patients weighing < 50 kg, aged ≥ 65 years, or with NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk factors, hepatic impairment, or renal insufficiency (based on serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen measures being greater than the upper limit of normal) received the 18.75 mg dose, and patients ≥ 95 kg with no predefined risk factors received 50 mg. Dose adjustment of ketorolac in the orthopedic surgery study was similar. Patients < 65 years old and without renal insufficiency received a standard dose of 30 mg, while high-risk patients received 15 mg.

Study medication was given as an IV bolus injection, with the first dose given ≤ 6 hours following surgery to patients reporting moderate to severe pain on the VAS. The time of first study drug administration was taken as time 0, and subsequent doses were given every 6 hours until discharge or withdrawal/discontinuation. In the abdominal/pelvic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 48 hours following the first study drug dose, and for up to 5 days; in the orthopedic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 24 hours, and for up to 5 days. Safety was monitored throughout both studies by physical examinations, laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, AEs, and evaluation of thrombophlebitis and wound healing (safety data previously reported).

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^10ccd8ea]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be implemented before the induction of anesthesia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B

Multiple studies have demonstrated that minimizing opioids after colorectal surgery is associated with earlier return of bowel function and shorter length of stay. One of the simplest techniques to limit opioid use is to schedule non-narcotic alternatives, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rather than administering them on an as-needed basis. There have been ongoing concerns about the postoperative safety profile of NSAIDs in this setting. However, a 2007 Cochrane review concluded that NSAIDs can cause a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period and should therefore not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function. In addition, experimental and observational clinical studies have shown that NSAIDs may increase the risk of anastomotic leak and subsequent research has demonstrated that this potential effect on anastomotic leak appears to be molecule and class specific; diclofenac has been associated with the highest risk of leak in this setting. In a retrospective cohort study of 856 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, the risk of anastomotic leak was 11.8% versus 6.0% (p = 0.01) in patients receiving diclofenac, but there was no differences in leak rates related to other nonsteroidals. Additionally, two meta-analyses have demonstrated an overall increased risk of anastomotic leak with NSAIDs but no increase in the risk of anastomotic leak with the use of selective NSAIDs (such as cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors). In these studies nonselective NSAID diclofenac use was associated with an increased leak rate (OR 2.79 [1.96, 3.96], p < 0.001 and pooled OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.62–2.50, p < 0.001), while ketorolac and selective NSAIDS were not associated with anastomotic leak. In addition, a large multicenter cohort study in Europe showed no differences in anastomotic leak rate with nonselective NSAIDs.

### Ketorolac for postoperative pain in children [^e46369d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children who undergo surgical procedures in ambulatory and inpatient settings are at risk of experiencing acute pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce moderate to severe pain without many of the side effects associated with opioids. However, NSAIDs may cause bleeding, renal and gastrointestinal toxicity, and potentially delay wound and bone healing. Intravenous administration of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children has not been approved in many countries, but is routinely administered in clinical practise.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of ketorolac for postoperative pain in children.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases, without language restrictions, to November 2017: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 10); MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also checked clinical trials registers and reference lists of reviews, and retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac (in any dose, administered via any route) with placebo or another active treatment, in treating postoperative pain in participants zero to 18 years of age following any type of surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We analyzed trials in two groups; ketorolac versus placebo, and ketorolac versus opioid. However, we performed limited pooled analyses. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE, and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 13 studies, involving 920 randomised participants. There was considerable heterogeneity among study designs, including the comparator arms (placebo, opioid, another NSAID, or a different regimen of ketorolac), dosing regimens (routes and timing of administration, single versus multiple dose), outcome assessment methods, and types of surgery. Mean study population ages ranged from 356 days to 13.9 years. The majority of studies chose a dose of either 0.5 mg/kg (as a single or multiple dose regimen) or 1 mg/kg (single dose with 0.5 mg/kg for any subsequent doses). One study administered interventions intraoperatively; the remainder administered interventions postoperatively, often after the participant reported moderate to severe pain. There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis for either of our primary outcomes: participants with at least 50% pain relief; or mean postoperative pain intensity. Four studies individually reported statistically significant reductions in pain intensity when comparing ketorolac with placebo, but the studies were small and had various risks of bias, primarily due to incomplete outcome data and small sample sizes. We found limited data available for the secondary outcomes of participants requiring rescue medication and opioid consumption. For the former, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo; 74 of 135 (55%) participants receiving ketorolac required rescue analgesia in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) versus 81 of 127 (64%) receiving placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.00, P = 0.05; 4 studies, 262 participants). For opioid consumption in the PACU, we saw no clear difference between ketorolac and placebo (P = 0.61). For the time period zero to four hours after administration of the interventions, participants receiving ketorolac received 1.58 mg less intravenous morphine equivalents than those receiving placebo (95% CI -2.58 mg to -0.57 mg, P = 0.002; 2 studies, 129 participants). However, we are uncertain whether ketorolac has an important effect on opioid consumption, as the data were sparse and the results were inconsistent. Only one study reported data for opioid consumption when comparing ketorolac with an opioid. There were no clear differences between the ketorolac and opioid group at any time point. There were no data assessing this outcome for the comparison of ketorolac with another NSAID. There were insufficient data to allow us to analyze overall adverse event or serious adverse event rates. Although the majority of serious adverse events reported in those receiving ketorolac involved bleeding, the number of events was too low to conclude that bleeding risk was increased in those receiving ketorolac perioperatively. There was not a statistically significant increase in event rates for any specific adverse event, either in pooled analysis or in single studies, when comparing ketorolac and placebo. When comparing ketorolac with opioids or other NSAIDs, there were too few data to make any conclusions regarding event rates. Lastly, withdrawals due to adverse events were vary rare in all groups, reflecting the acute nature of such studies. We assessed the quality of evidence for all outcomes for each comparison (placebo or active) as very low, due to issues with risk of bias in individual studies, imprecision, heterogeneity between studies, and low overall numbers of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the lack of data for our primary outcomes, and the very low-quality evidence for secondary outcomes, the efficacy and safety of ketorolac in treating postoperative pain in children were both uncertain. The evidence was insufficient to support or reject its use.

### Single-dose dipyrone for acute postoperative pain [^4543b49c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The use of dipyrone as an analgesic is controversial. It is used most commonly to treat postoperative pain, colic pain, cancer pain and migraine, and in many countries, eg, Russia, Spain, Brazil, and in many parts of South-America and Africa, it is the most popular non opioid first line analgesic. In others it has been banned (e.g. USA, UK) because of its association with potentially life-threatening blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis. Dipyrone is currently available in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Latin America, Russia, Israel and India.

Objectives

To assess quantitatively the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose dipyrone in randomised trials in moderate to severe postoperative pain. To compare the relative efficacy of dipyrone with other drugs assessed in the same way.

Search Strategy

Published reports were identified from Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library (Issue 3 1999), LILACs and the Oxford Pain Relief Database. Additional studies were identified from bibliographies of retrieved reports. Date of the most recent search: December 1999.

Selection Criteria

The following inclusion criteria were used: full journal publication, clinical trial, random allocation of patients to treatment groups, double-blind design, adult patients, pain of moderate to severe intensity at the baseline assessment, postoperative administration of study drugs, treatment arms which included dipyrone and placebo or active control and oral, rectal, intramuscular or intravenous administration of study drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Summed pain intensity and pain relief data over 4–6 hours were extracted and converted into dichotomous information to yield the number of patients who obtained at least 50% pain relief. This was used to calculate the proportion of patients with, and number-needed-to-treat for, at least 50% pain relief over 4–6 hours. Single-dose adverse effect data were collected.

Main Results

Fifteen studies were included; eight used placebo and seven used an active control (oral dexketoprofen 12.5 mg or 25 mg, oral ketorolac 10 mg, intramuscular pethidine 100 mg or ketorolac 30 mg, intravenous tramadol 100 mg or rectal suprofen 300 mg). In five trials (288 patients) the mean response rate (proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief) for single dose oral dipyrone 500 mg was 73% (range 54% to 87%) and with placebo it was 32% (19% to 41%) in moderate to severe postoperative pain over 4–6 hours. In two studies (113 patients) the response rate with oral dipyrone 1 g was 69% (61% and 77%) and with placebo it was 20% (11% and 25%). In one study (70 patients) the response rate with intramuscular dipyrone 2 g was 74% and with placebo it was 46%. No analyses could be conducted for adverse effects. The response rates in the active controlled trials were similar to those reported in the placebo controlled trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Single-dose dipyrone appears to be of similar efficacy to ibuprofen 400 mg and other analgesics frequently used in the treatment of moderate to severe postoperative pain. The commonest adverse effects were somnolence, gastric discomfort and nausea.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^1d2c60d3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

10. A multimodal, opioid-sparing, pain management plan should be implemented before the induction of anesthesia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

In addition, a large multicenter cohort study in Europe showed no differences in anastomotic leak rate with nonselective NSAIDs.

### Safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate to severe pain following laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^f290b86a]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Material and methods

This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled study in subjects undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to intravenous (IV) doses of placebo, ketorolac every 6 hours (Q6H), meloxicam NIV 7.5 mg Q12H, meloxicam NIV 15 mg Q12H, or meloxicam NIV 30 mg once daily (QD) for up to 48 hours. Each subject was dosed Q6H (with placebo as applicable) to maintain blinding. Subjects were discharged from the study unit 48 hours after the initial dose of study drug and followed as outpatients through Day 28.

Efficacy was assessed by subject reports of PI on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale anchored at 0 for no pain and 100 for worst possible pain. Rescue medication (parenteral morphine 2–6 mg) was available any time after the initial dose of study drug. Missing PI scores were imputed for the efficacy analysis using a 2-hour windowed last observation carried forward (W2LOCF) approach.

Safety was monitored through the reporting of adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and wound site assessments.

The study was expected to enroll 200 subjects; however, the study was terminated for business reasons after 50 subjects enrolled. As a result, the original analyses were limited to disposition, demographics, and safety. Efficacy data were subsequently analyzed post hoc. No formal statistical analysis was performed.

The Aspire Institutional Review Board approved the protocol and the study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practices. All subjects provided written informed consent. Trial registration:(Identifier: NCT01436032).

### Ketorolac use and anastomotic leak in elective colorectal surgery: a detailed analysis [^1c750f4c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent population-level analyses have linked ketorolac use to adverse outcomes. However, its use is also associated with decreased opioids and faster return of bowel function.

Objective

This study aims to assess the association between ketorolac and anastomotic leak. We hypothesize that receiving at least 1 dose of ketorolac will not be associated with anastomotic leak in elective colorectal surgery.

Design

This is a retrospective, observational cohort study of a prospectively collected data base. Anastomotic leak rates and other patient outcomes were adjusted for patient-level factors and then compared via a multivariable logistic regression. A secondary analysis assessed a dose-response association with anastomotic leak.

Setting

This study was conducted at a tertiary care colorectal surgery service.

Patients

Consecutive patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with a nondiverted anastomosis were identified from 2012 to 2016.

Intervention

Exposure was defined as any administration of ketorolac during the perioperative time period.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measured was anastomotic leak.

Results

A total of 877 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 479 (54.6%) were women, and the median age was 55 years. Overall, 566 (64.5%) patients were exposed to ketorolac. In the cohort, 27 (3.1%) patients experienced an anastomotic leak. In an unadjusted analysis, there was no association between ketorolac exposure and anastomotic leak (ketorolac: 3.1% vs no ketorolac: 3.3%; p = 0.84). This persisted in a multivariable model (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.38–2.57; p = 0.98). Neither AKI (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 0.51–20.6; p = 0.21), return to the operating room (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.40–2.85; p = 0.88), nor readmission (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.59–1.80; p = 0.93) was associated with ketorolac use. In a secondary analysis of patients receiving ketorolac, there was no association between total ketorolac dosing and anastomotic leak (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99–1.00; p = 0.20).

Limitations

This study was a retrospective review, and there was a low incidence of anastomotic leak.

Conclusion

Ketorolac exposure was associated with neither anastomotic leak nor other important postoperative outcomes. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A784.

### Ketorolac use and postoperative complications in gastrointestinal surgery [^13d5bb1a]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the association between ketorolac use and postoperative complications.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may impair wound healing and increase the risk of anastomotic leak in colon surgery. Studies to date have been limited by sample size, inability to identify confounding, and a focus limited to colon surgery.

Methods

Ketorolac use, reinterventions, emergency department (ED) visits, and readmissions in adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) operations was assessed in a nationwide cohort using the MarketScan Database (2008–2012).

Results

Among 398,752 patients (median age 52, 45% male), 55% underwent colorectal surgery, whereas 45% had noncolorectal GI surgery. Five percent of patients received ketorolac. Adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, surgery type/indication, and preoperative medications, patients receiving ketorolac had higher odds of reintervention (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.32), ED visit (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.37–1.51), and readmission within 30 days (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05–1.18) compared to those who did not receive ketorolac. Ketorolac use was associated with readmissions related to anastomotic complications (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.36). Evaluating only admissions with ≤ 3 days duration to exclude cases where ketorolac might have been used for complication-related pain relief, the odds of complications associated with ketorolac were even greater.

Conclusions

Use of intravenous ketorolac was associated with greater odds of reintervention, ED visit, and readmission in both colorectal and noncolorectal GI surgery. Given this confirmatory evaluation of other reports of a negative association and the large size of this cohort, clinicians should exercise caution when using ketorolac in patients undergoing GI surgery.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^0b922082]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

The cornerstone of non-operative management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is starvation, stomach decompression using a nasogastric tube and fluid resuscitation. This approach seems uniform for younger and older patients. Non-operative management should further include correction of electrolyte disturbances and nutritional support, especially in the frail older patient to avoid delirium, functional decline and complications as a result of starvation and malnutrition. Non-operative management is effective in approximately 70–90% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction in general. Though it has a significant failure rate, the nasogastric tube remains relevant in the conservative treatment of small bowel obstruction to initially relieve symptoms and avoid aspiration. Triple-lumen long tubes have been claimed superior to nasogastric tubes in terms of failure. A drawback of the triple-lumen tube is the frequent need for endoscopic placement with use of sedatives, which inherits a risk of pulmonary complications in the frail older patient. Additionally, elderly patients often have hyperactive delirium with a higher risk of accidental tube removal.

Starvation treatment can conflict with concurrent treatment of co-morbidities and multiple drug intake. There is surprisingly little evidence to support clinical decision-making on medication during starvation treatment. Clinicians have three options; discontinuing the medication, exempting medication from the starvation regimen, or administering the same or similar drug via other routes, e.g. intravenously. It is generally accepted that medication taken for long-term risk management can safely be discontinued during the course of treatment for small bowel obstruction. Some oral medications can be administered safely with a short period clamping the tube; however, care should be taken in elderly patients with pre-existing dysphagia or neurologic conditions with risk of aspiration of medication. Even though oral ingestion or administering drugs via a tube is often feasible, the uptake of medication is questionable in small bowel obstruction. There is marked paucity in data on complications that might arise from discontinuation or reduced uptake of oral medication in elderly patients with small bowel obstruction. For some medications, alternative routes show different pharmacokinetics with different clinical effects. Well-known examples are beta blockers and benzodiazepines, often prescribed to elderly patients.

NSAID safety and tolerability

Gastrointestinal safety and tolerability

Gastrointestinal complications are among the most common and well-known side effects of NSAID treatment and generally result from inhibition of COX-1.COX-1 is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and mediates the production of mucosal PGs that confer a number of protective effects, including increasing blood flow to the mucosa and promoting mucus and bicarbonate secretion;, inhibition of COX-1 may therefore result in an increased susceptibility for mucosal damage (eg, bleeding). Additionally, COX-2 may promote healing of gastric lesions; thus, inhibition of COX-2 may also play a role in the formation of ulcers.

A recent meta-analysis of data for more than 220,000 patients from 280 placebo-controlled trials of NSAIDs showed that all evaluated NSAIDs (coxibs, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen) increased the early risk of upper gastrointestinal complications (eg, ulcer perforations, bleeding, obstructions) to some extent. There is, however, considerable variability in the risk of gastrointestinal complications between NSAIDs. Results of a 2012 meta-analysis of 28 observational studies showed a low risk (relative risk [RR] < 2) of upper gastrointestinal complications for aceclofenac, celecoxib, and ibuprofen; intermediate risk (RR 2–4) for diclofenac, meloxicam, and ketoprofen, among others; high risk (RR 4–5) for tenoxicam, naproxen, indomethacin, and diflunisal; and the highest risk (RR > 5) for piroxicam, ketorolac, and azapropazone. In keeping with results for individual NSAIDs, drugs that have greater selectivity for COX-2 than COX-1 generally have been associated with a lower risk of upper gastrointestinal complications than other NSAIDs. In the recent meta-analysis of data from more than 220,000 patients, the predicted absolute annual risk of upper gastrointestinal complications was lower for NSAIDs with greater COX-2 selectivity (coxibs and diclofenac) compared with non-selective NSAIDs (Figure 5).

### Effect of perioperative dexamethasone and different NSAIDs on anastomotic leak risk: a propensity score analysis [^e45a743c]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The main limitation of this study is its nonrandomized, retrospective nature. However, since the primary purpose of this study was to investigate the expected detrimental effects of NSAIDs on AL, and we unexpectedly discovered a nonsignificant protective effect of dexamethasone, an observer bias is not very likely. Ketorolac and dexamethasone were administered intravenously with a low risk of false registrations. In the electronically stored medication schedules, not only the ordinations were marked, but also whether they were received or not. However, possible confounding may occur if a patient does not take an oral dose of diclofenac delivered bedside. The main results of the study were not significant, most likely indicating a somewhat undersized study sample. In order to obtain significance based on the differences observed, a 2-fold increase in the number of patients would have been needed. Thus, in the no medication group, the number of patients would have to be increased from 117 to 188, in the diclofenac group from 59 to 187, and in the dexamethasone group from 66 to 108.

A strength of this study is that the electronically stored patient data were completely except from a single patient, and that virtually all patients operated on with intestinal anastomoses during the 3-year period could be retrieved from the data system. Due to the electronic health records and the universal health insurance coverage of all patients in Norway, we are certain to have captured most likely all patients with an AL. A patient with a late presentation of AL may in theory have been managed outside our health region, but the usual practice if such an event would occur is to receive a report from the managing hospital.

The use of NSAIDs for analgesia and dexamethasone to prevent nausea and vomiting was not part of a standard analgesic or antiemetic regimen but instead depended on the personal preferences of the anesthesiologist or surgeon on duty that day, and was therefore most probably randomly administered. Even so, there might have been some degree of selection bias with regard to contraindications against steroids and NSAIDs, such as peptic ulcer disease, asthma, heart, liver, or renal failure. We did not register detailed information about comorbidity in this study, but we did adjust for ASA score, which is a physical status classification system for assessing the fitness of the patient before surgery. The severity of systemic diseases is reflected in this score, and therefore, the use of it as a variable in the propensity score analysis will reduce the selection bias with regard to medicament contraindications among patients with comorbidities.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^7d7de56a]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The median time to GI recovery was shorter in the no-contrast group at 1 day (i.q.r. 1–2) versus 2 days (i.q.r. 1–5) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). The median hospital length of stay was 4 days (i.q.r. 2–7) for the non-contrast group versus 6 days (i.q.r. 3–12) for the contrast group (P < 0.001). Similarly, among patients who underwent surgery, those who received a contrast challenge had a longer median hospital length of stay (13 days, i.q.r. 9–24 versus 7 days, i.q.r. 6–15, P = 0.033, q = 0.4; Supplementary Material S7).

### Alvimopan [^befdb245]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who received more than 3 doses of an opioid (regardless of route) during the 7 days prior to surgery and patients with complete bowel obstruction or who were scheduled for a total colectomy, colostomy, or ileostomy were excluded.

The primary endpoint for all studies was time to achieve resolution of postoperative ileus, a clinically defined composite measure of both upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery. Although both 2-component (GI2: toleration of solid food and first bowel movement) and 3-component (GI3: toleration of solid food and either first flatus or bowel movement) endpoints were used in all studies, GI2 is presented as it represents the most objective and clinically relevant measure of treatment response in patients undergoing surgeries that include a bowel resection. The time from the end of surgery to when the discharge order was written represented the length of hospital stay. In the 6 studies, 1,058 patients who underwent a surgery that included a bowel resection received placebo (not including 157 for total abdominal hysterectomy) and 1,096 patients received alvimopan 12 mg (not including 143 for total abdominal hysterectomy).

The efficacy of alvimopan following total abdominal hysterectomy has not been established. Therefore, the following data are presented only for surgeries that included a bowel resection (i.e., bowel resection or radical cystectomy).

### IV tramadol – A new treatment option for management of post-operative pain in the US: an open-label, single-arm, safety trial including various types of surgery [^6be0bf75]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients must have met the definition of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Class 1, or 2 and were excluded if they have used chronic opioid therapy or had a recent history of substance dependence, or had a seizure disorder or could not be withdrawn from medications that may lower seizure threshold or increase serotonergic tone. Eligible patients underwent elective surgery, including both orthopedic procedures such as knee replacement and hip replacement, and soft-tissue procedures such as abdominoplasty, colon, hernia, breast augmentation, and hysterectomy surgeries. The target enrollment was 250 patients.

Because this was a "real world" study, there were no restrictions on the surgical agents used for induction, neuromuscular blockade, and maintenance of anesthesia and no post-surgical restrictions on hypnotics, sedatives, or anxiolytics. Treating clinicians were allowed to use what they consider as standard-of-care in the U.S. such as propofol, midazolam, lidocaine, fentanyl, and IV acetaminophen. Following surgery, eligible patients received their study drug infusion (IV tramadol 50 mg) at T0 (Hour 0 or first dose), Hour 2, and Hour 4, and then every 4 h for up to 7 days. Following the first dose of study drug, patients were allowed to receive non-opioid pain medication, such as intravenous acetaminophen, celecoxib, ketorolac and bupivacaine-based local blocks, per the treating physician's discretion, if additional pain relief was required. Schedule II opioids were specifically excluded, to assess how IV tramadol, in a multi-modal analgesic setting, would provide satisfactory pain relief after these surgeries.

Patients were to continue study treatment until it was no longer needed; however, some patients consented in advance to remain on treatment for 5 days to allow for collection of safety outcomes over a longer duration of treatment. Patients were housed in a healthcare facility during study medication administration. Upon discharge, patients were given a prescription for pain management at home per the physician's discretion. Pain medications prescribed at discharge included Percocet, oxycodone, oral tramadol, and acetaminophen. A final safety assessment via telephone call was conducted on Day 14 (± 2 days).
