## Question

Best iron rich foods for vegetarians

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best iron-rich foods for vegetarians. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bioavailability challenge of non-heme iron and why vegetarians need more iron. Then, I should identify the highest-yield plant-based iron sources. Next, I will prioritize foods by iron density and practicality. After that, I need to integrate absorption-enhancing strategies and inhibitor avoidance. Finally, I will tailor recommendations by life stage and provide a concise, prioritized list with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the core issue: vegetarians rely on non-heme iron, which is far less bioavailable than heme iron, so they generally need about 1.8 times more dietary iron to meet requirements, and absorption is highly sensitive to enhancers and inhibitors in the same meal [^111d2geM] [^116A11ok] [^116e429Y].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of the bioavailability gap. Mixed diets typically yield 14–18% absorption, whereas vegetarian diets yield roughly 5–12%, and this is why authoritative guidance advises nearly doubling iron targets for those on plant-based diets, especially premenopausal women and children who are more vulnerable to deficiency [^116A11ok] [^111d2geM].

> Next, I should review which plant foods actually deliver the most iron per serving. Legumes, soy products, nuts and seeds, dark leafy greens, and fortified foods consistently rise to the top, with lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, quinoa, and iron-fortified cereals providing the highest iron density among commonly consumed vegetarian options [^notfound] [^114HuQdt] [^111u6qYg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" without considering both quantity and usability. I need to prioritize foods that are both iron-dense and practical to eat regularly, and that can be paired with enhancers. Lentils, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, quinoa, fortified breakfast cereals, and dark leafy greens like spinach and kale are the most reliable staples that meet these criteria [^111u6qYg] [^114HuQdt].

> I will now examine absorption strategies, because iron content alone is insufficient. Vitamin C is the most potent enhancer, so pairing iron-rich plant foods with citrus, bell peppers, strawberries, or broccoli can markedly increase absorption, while calcium, tea, coffee, and phytates inhibit absorption and should be separated from iron-containing meals by about 1–2 hours when feasible [^111d2geM] [^113nbj9r] [^1127wX1w].

> Let me consider preparation techniques that reduce inhibitors. Soaking and discarding soak water for beans and lentils, fermenting soy into tempeh, sprouting seeds and legumes, and choosing leavened whole grains can lower phytate content and improve iron bioavailability, which is especially helpful when these foods are dietary staples [^112HVXqm] [^115YtV7n].

> But wait, what if the client is pregnant, breastfeeding, or raising young children? I should confirm life-stage nuances. Pregnant and lactating women have higher iron needs and should generally receive iron supplementation alongside dietary strategies, infants and young children require iron-fortified cereals or formulas and careful complementary feeding, and adolescents following vegan diets have higher risks of low ferritin and may need supplementation if intake or status is inadequate [^114SHn6o] [^114pF4M5] [^113N7mCs] [^113cfvta].

> I should double-check the role of fortified foods, because they can be decisive. Iron-fortified cereals, plant milks, and some meat alternatives can deliver clinically meaningful amounts of highly bioavailable iron and are particularly useful for children, picky eaters, and those with higher needs or limited dietary variety, though label reading for sugar and processing is prudent [^111u6qYg] [^111XVjpd].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized list while keeping bioavailability front and center. The best vegetarian iron sources, in order of iron density and practicality, are lentils and chickpeas; tofu and tempeh; pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds; quinoa; iron-fortified breakfast cereals; and dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, with the caveat that greens contain oxalates and should be paired with vitamin C and separated from calcium-rich foods when possible [^111u6qYg] [^114HuQdt] [^113nbj9r].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include cashews as a top source, but I should verify. Cashews contain moderate iron and are healthful, yet pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and even sunflower seeds generally provide more iron per serving and are more reliable as iron contributors in a vegetarian diet, so I should rank seeds ahead of cashews for this purpose [^112zjBcn].

> Next, I should review monitoring and supplementation thresholds. Given lower ferritin concentrations and higher deficiency risk in some vegetarians, especially premenopausal women and children, periodic assessment of hemoglobin and ferritin is reasonable, and supplementation should be individualized when deficiency is identified or when dietary intake is unlikely to meet needs despite optimization [^111d2geM] [^113wNYiS].

> Finally, I need to ensure the guidance is actionable and safety-aware. Emphasize variety across legumes, seeds, whole grains, and greens; pair iron sources with vitamin C at meals; separate iron-rich meals from tea, coffee, and calcium supplements; consider fortified foods strategically; and refer to a registered dietitian for individualized planning, especially in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and adolescence [^111u6qYg] [^114QQXSK].

The best iron-rich foods for vegetarians are **legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans), soy products (tofu, tempeh), dark leafy greens (spinach, kale), nuts and seeds (pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, hemp seeds), and iron-fortified cereals**. Because non-heme iron is less bioavailable, **pair these foods with vitamin C** (citrus, bell peppers, strawberries) to enhance absorption, and avoid coffee/tea or calcium-rich foods at the same meal. Vegetarians need about 1.8 times more iron than non-vegetarians, so aim for **18–32 mg/day** depending on age and sex, and consider supplementation if intake is inadequate or deficiency is present [^111d2geM] [^116A11ok].

## Enhancing iron absorption

Non-heme iron absorption is influenced by dietary factors; **vitamin C significantly enhances absorption**, whereas phytates, polyphenols, and calcium inhibit it [^116A11ok] [^113nbj9r].

- **Vitamin C**: Include vitamin C-rich foods (citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli) with iron-rich meals to enhance absorption [^111d2geM] [^113nbj9r].
- **Avoid inhibitors**: Limit coffee, tea, and calcium-rich foods during iron-rich meals [^111d2geM] [^113nbj9r].
- **Cooking methods**: Soaking, fermenting, and sprouting legumes and grains can reduce phytate content and improve iron bioavailability [^112HVXqm].

## Recommended daily iron intake for vegetarians

Because non-heme iron is less bioavailable, vegetarians require approximately 1.8 times the standard intake:

| **Life stage** | **Recommended intake (mg/day)** |
|-|-|
| Adult men | 14 mg |
| Adult women (premenopausal) | 32 mg |
| Adult women (postmenopausal) | 14 mg |
| Pregnant women | 49 mg |
| Lactating women | 28 mg |

## Potential risks of iron deficiency in vegetarians

Vegetarians are at **increased risk of iron deficiency** due to lower bioavailability of non-heme iron [^111d2geM]. Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and impaired cognitive function [^115TJZBu]. Regular monitoring of iron status, especially in high-risk groups (pregnant women, children, adolescents), is recommended [^113WQKxo].

---

## Supplementation considerations

Supplementation may be necessary when dietary intake is inadequate or deficiency is diagnosed. Common supplements include ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate. Vitamin C can be added to enhance absorption, and **every-other-day dosing** may improve tolerability [^1127wX1w].

---

## Practical dietary strategies

- **Balanced meals**: Combine iron-rich foods with vitamin C sources (e.g. lentil soup with tomatoes, spinach salad with citrus dressing) [^111d2geM].
- **Fortified foods**: Regularly include fortified cereals, plant milks, and nutritional yeast in the diet [^111u6qYg].
- **Variety**: Rotate different iron-rich foods to ensure adequate intake and minimize inhibitor exposure [^114mLq9n].

---

The best iron-rich foods for vegetarians include legumes, soy products, dark leafy greens, nuts and seeds, and fortified foods. Combining these with vitamin C and avoiding inhibitors can optimize absorption; **supplementation may be needed** if intake is inadequate or deficiency is present.

### Bioavailability of iron, zinc, and other trace minerals from vegetarian diets [^113WQKxo]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Iron and zinc are currently the trace minerals of greatest concern when considering the nutritional value of vegetarian diets. With elimination of meat and increased intake of phytate-containing legumes and whole grains, the absorption of both iron and zinc is lower with vegetarian than with nonvegetarian, diets. The health consequences of lower iron and zinc bioavailability are not clear, especially in industrialized countries with abundant, varied food supplies, where nutrition and health research has generally supported recommendations to reduce meat and increase legume and whole-grain consumption. Although it is clear that vegetarians have lower iron stores, adverse health effects from lower iron and zinc absorption have not been demonstrated with varied vegetarian diets in developed countries, and moderately lower iron stores have even been hypothesized to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Premenopausal women cannot easily achieve recommended iron intakes, as modified for vegetarians, with foods alone; however, the benefit of routine iron supplementation has not been demonstrated. It may be prudent to monitor the hemoglobin of vegetarian children and women of childbearing age. Improved assessment methods are required to determine whether vegetarians are at risk of zinc deficiency. In contrast with iron and zinc, elements such as copper appear to be adequately provided by vegetarian diets. Although the iron and zinc deficiencies commonly associated with plant-based diets in impoverished nations are not associated with vegetarian diets in wealthier countries, these nutrients warrant attention as nutritional assessment methods become more sensitive and plant-based diets receive greater emphasis.

Iron in vegetarian adults — A systematic review of presumably healthy adults indicated vegetarian, including vegan, dietary patterns may be associated with lower circulating ferritin concentrations compared with nonvegetarian diets, but results were mixed and certainty of evidence was very low, and vegetarian premenopausal women have a high prevalence of iron deficiency. The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements suggests that vegetarians and vegans should consume nearly twice the recommended amount of iron because of low absorption from phytate-rich plant foods, and vegetarians should ingest a variety of iron-rich plant foods along with foods that are a rich source of vitamin C, which enhances absorption, while reducing intake of foods and beverages that are rich in absorption inhibitors (eg, coffee).

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^112FpNTy]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society diet and physical activity guideline — vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns — states that it is reasonable to suggest that vegetarian diets may be beneficial for cancer risk reduction, and many studies of vegetarians indicate a lower risk of cancer overall relative to people who also eat meat, although whether vegetarian diets confer any special benefits over diets that include smaller amounts of animal products than are typically consumed in Western diets is less clear. The available evidence supports the recommendation of a dietary pattern that consists predominantly of foods from plant sources, with limited if any intake of red and processed meats. In addition to a modest level of risk reduction for some forms of cancer relative to a more typical Western dietary pattern with higher levels of meat consumption, vegetarian dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and are generally more affordable. Individuals consuming strict vegetarian diets that omit all animal products, including milk and eggs, referred to as "vegan" diets, need supplementation with vitamin B12, zinc, and iron (or foods fortified with these nutrients), especially for children and premenopausal women, and they should also aim to achieve adequate calcium intake because people consuming vegan diets with relatively low calcium content have been shown to carry a higher risk of fractures compared with people consuming vegetarian or meat-containing diets.

### Is iron and zinc nutrition a concern for vegetarian infants and young children in industrialized countries? [^112HVXqm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Well-planned vegetarian diets are considered adequate for all stages of the life cycle, despite limited data on the zinc status of vegetarians during early childhood. The bioavailability of iron and zinc in vegetarian diets is poor because of their higher content of absorption inhibitors such as phytate and polyphenols and the absence of flesh foods. Consequently, children as well as adult vegetarians often have lower serum ferritin concentrations than omnivores, which is indicative of reduced iron stores, despite comparable intakes of total iron; hemoglobin differences are small and rarely associated with anemia. However, data on serum zinc concentrations, the recommended biomarker for identifying population groups at elevated risk of zinc deficiency, are sparse and difficult to interpret because recommended collection and analytic procedures have not always been followed. Existing data indicate no differences in serum zinc or growth between young vegetarian and omnivorous children, although there is some evidence of low serum zinc concentrations in vegetarian adolescents. Some vegetarian immigrants from underprivileged households may be predisposed to iron and zinc deficiency because of nondietary factors such as chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, overweight, and genetic hemoglobin disorders. To reduce the risk of deficiency, the content and bioavailability of iron and zinc should be enhanced in vegetarian diets by consumption of fortified cereals and milk, by consumption of leavened whole grains, by soaking dried legumes before cooking and discarding the soaking water, and by replacing tea and coffee at meals with vitamin C-rich drinks, fruit, or vegetables. Additional recommended practices include using fermented soy foods and sprouting at least some of the legumes consumed. Fortified foods can reduce iron deficiency, but whether they can also reduce zinc deficiency is less certain. Supplements may be necessary for vegetarian children following very restricted vegan diets.

### Iron bioavailability and dietary reference values [^116A11ok]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Iron differs from other minerals because iron balance in the human body is regulated by absorption only because there is no physiologic mechanism for excretion. On the basis of intake data and isotope studies, iron bioavailability has been estimated to be in the range of 14–18% for mixed diets and 5–12% for vegetarian diets in subjects with no iron stores, and these values have been used to generate dietary reference values for all population groups. Dietary factors that influence iron absorption, such as phytate, polyphenols, calcium, ascorbic acid, and muscle tissue, have been shown repeatedly to influence iron absorption in single-meal isotope studies, whereas in multimeal studies with a varied diet and multiple inhibitors and enhancers, the effect of single components has been, as expected, more modest. The importance of fortification iron and food additives such as erythorbic acid on iron bioavailability from a mixed diet needs clarification. The influence of vitamin A, carotenoids, and nondigestible carbohydrates on iron absorption and the nature of the "meat factor" remain unresolved. The iron status of the individual and other host factors, such as obesity, play a key role in iron bioavailability, and iron status generally has a greater effect than diet composition. It would therefore be timely to develop a range of iron bioavailability factors based not only on diet composition but also on subject characteristics, such as iron status and prevalence of obesity.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1172FW3c]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans — pregnancy iron supplementation guidance indicates that the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services "Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025" recommends that pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant take a supplement with iron when recommended by a clinician, and that women following a vegetarian or vegan dietary pattern should discuss with a clinician whether supplementation of iron, vitamin B12, other nutrients, or some combination thereof is needed.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Vegetarian and vegan diets: benefits and drawbacks [^112F1Gat]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Plant-based diets have become increasingly popular thanks to their purported health benefits and more recently for their positive environmental impact. Prospective studies suggest that consuming vegetarian diets is associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, dementia, and cancer. Data from randomized clinical trials have confirmed a protective effect of vegetarian diets for the prevention of diabetes and reductions in weight, blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but to date, no data are available for cardiovascular event rates and cognitive impairment, and there are very limited data for cancer. Moreover, not all plant-based foods are equally healthy. Unhealthy vegetarian diets poor in specific nutrients (vitamin B12, iron, zinc, and calcium) and/or rich in highly processed and refined foods increase morbidity and mortality. Further mechanistic studies are desirable to understand whether the advantages of healthy, minimally processed vegetarian diets represent an all-or-nothing phenomenon and whether consuming primarily plant-based diets containing small quantities of animal products (e.g. pesco-vegetarian or Mediterranean diets) has beneficial, detrimental, or neutral effects on cardiometabolic health outcomes. Further, mechanistic studies are warranted to enhance our understanding about healthy plant-based food patterns and the biological mechanisms linking dietary factors, CVD, and other metabolic diseases.

### Fortification of condiments and seasonings with iron for preventing anaemia and improving health [^116hf59a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Anaemia and iron deficiency can only be diagnosed by laboratory tests. Anaemia is assessed by measuring haemoglobin concentration and is usually interpreted according to age, sex, pregnancy status, altitude and, if known, smoking status as these factors alter iron needs (WHO 2011a). Iron deficiency is assessed through several biochemical measurements including serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and erythrocyte protoporphyrin. Ferritin is the most used indicator to assess iron status and depletion, and there is a close relationship between the total amount of stored iron and the serum ferritin concentration in normal individuals, although this indicator is affected by inflammation (WHO 2011b). Assessing anaemia by measuring the haemoglobin concentration is a relatively inexpensive and feasible test, even in resource‐poor settings (WHO 2007). Global health actors have recognised addressing anaemia as a priority, and one of the global nutrition targets for 2025 is to reduce anaemia by 50% in women of reproductive age (WHO 2014).

Description of the intervention

Various strategies are employed to prevent and treat iron deficiency and anaemia in different populations. These include dietary diversification to improve iron intake and bioavailability; selective plant breeding or genetic engineering to increase the iron content or to reduce absorption inhibitors in dietary staple crops; oral iron supplementation with pharmacological doses; and fortification of industrially manufactured foods with iron (Hurrell 2010). Maintaining a varied diet that includes foods rich in bioavailable iron ‐ such as animal sources ‐ is often costly and difficult to obtain in resource‐poor settings, and may not be acceptable in vegetarian populations. Oral supplementation is probably the most used strategy, as it often improves micronutrient status quickly by providing the nutrient directly, in tablet, powder, or liquid form. However, despite potential effectiveness, such programmes face prevalent implementation challenges and may not be sustainable.

### Health effects of vegan diets [^114NH8Ew]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Recently, vegetarian diets have experienced an increase in popularity. A vegetarian diet is associated with many health benefits because of its higher content of fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium, and many phytochemicals and a fat content that is more unsaturated. Compared with other vegetarian diets, vegan diets tend to contain less saturated fat and cholesterol and more dietary fiber. Vegans tend to be thinner, have lower serum cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, reducing their risk of heart disease. However, eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies. Micronutrients of special concern for the vegan include vitamins B-12 and D, calcium, and long-chain n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids. Unless vegans regularly consume foods that are fortified with these nutrients, appropriate supplements should be consumed. In some cases, iron and zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^116e429Y]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron physiology, absorption and homeostasis

Most of the iron in the body (> 70%) is present in hemoglobin and only a minor fraction (< 1%) circulates in transferrin, the plasma iron carrier. The transferrin iron pool is small (~3 mg at steady state) but highly dynamic to meet the needs of erythropoiesis (25–30 mg/day). Iron supply to transferrin is maintained primarily by splenic and hepatic macrophages, which clear aged red blood cells and recycle their iron, and to a lesser extent by duodenal enterocytes, which absorb 1–2 mg/day dietary iron. If metabolic needs are unmet, iron stores are mobilized from hepatocytes. As there is no mechanism for iron excretion, dietary iron absorption is essential to compensate for non-specific losses occurring during cell desquamation or bleeding.

It is estimated that only 14–18% of ingested iron is absorbed from mixed diets and 5–12% from vegetarian diets. A reason for this is that Fe²⁺ is oxidized to virtually insoluble (at physiological pH) Fe³⁺. Even though Fe³⁺ can be solubilized in the acidic milieu of the stomach, it cannot be directly transported to enterocytes. Thus, luminal Fe³⁺ needs to be reduced to Fe²⁺ prior to its assimilation via the apical enterocyte transporter DMT1 (Figure 1). This is accomplished enzymatically or with the aid of ascorbate (vitamin C), which is thought to enhance iron absorption. Some dietary components (phytates, polyphenols, fibers, tannins) and common pharmaceuticals (calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) form insoluble complexes with iron and thereby inhibit its absorption.

Heme is a more efficient source of iron; however, the mechanism for heme absorption remains elusive. Internalized heme undergoes enzymatic degradation liberating its iron, which follows the fate of assimilated inorganic iron. Enterocytes release Fe²⁺ to plasma via the basolateral exporter ferroportin. Exported Fe²⁺ is re-oxidized to Fe³⁺ and captured by transferrin for delivery to tissues.

High iron levels or inflammation induce expression of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin in the liver, which inhibits iron absorption by suppressing intestinal ferroportin. Hepcidin also prevents ferroportin-mediated iron efflux from erythrophagocytic tissue macrophages (Figure 2), acting as a negative regulator of iron entry into plasma.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^113zbLve]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Vegetarian diet — plant-based meal plans consisting mostly of foods from plants — is generally associated with weight reduction, reduced risk of heart disease (including heart failure), and beneficial effects on metabolic diseases, some cancers, and possibly all-cause mortality; however, these potential benefits may be negated when plant-based whole foods are replaced by ultra-processed foods, fried foods, and refined carbohydrates; risks include deficiencies of micronutrients and minerals such as vitamin B12 and iron that may require clinical monitoring and nutrient replacement, and patients may benefit from dietitian counseling; encouraged foods include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and seeds.

Potential health risks of vegan and vegetarian diets

Accumulating evidence indicate that some vegetarians, especially vegans who are consuming restrictive diets, are at greater risk of developing haemorrhagic stroke, bone fractures, and a range of vitamin and mineral deficiencies that are particularly dangerous for growing children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Vitamin B12, for example, is an essential vitamin produced by specific strains of soil bacteria that animals ingest when grazing grass. During digestion, large amounts of vitamin B12 are formed and incorporated in the animal's meat, milk, and eggs. Fish and shellfish also contain considerable amount of vitamin B12; for instance, 100 g of clams contain up to 49 µg of vitamin B12. People following strict vegan diets must take a vitamin B12 supplement and/or consume foods supplemented with vitamin B12, including vitamin B12–fortified nutritional yeast, to avoid developing megaloblastic anaemia, a potentially irreversible form of neuropathy, and impaired bone formation. Vitamin B12 in spirulina or other algae is not bioavailable and may even inhibit vitamin B12 metabolism, but vitamin B12 in duckweed is bioavailable. Other potential deficiencies that vegetarians may develop are those from iron and zinc and occasionally riboflavin. These deficiencies are especially important in vegan children, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and those with menorrhagia. Many plant foods contain iron and zinc, but their bioavailability is limited due plant anti-nutrients, such as phytates, tannins, lectins, and oxalates. Cooking, sprouting, fermenting, and processing plant foods with vitamin C rich foods can increase iron and zinc absorption. Dietary calcium deficiency especially when coupled with protein restriction and excessive sodium intake can increase the risk of bone fractures in ethical vegans who do not consume healthy diets rich in calcium- and protein-rich plant foods. Many plants contain calcium, and in some of these, its bioavailability is very high. For instance, 40%–60% of the calcium contained in cabbage, broccoli, or broccoli sprouts is absorbed because of their low oxalate content, against only 31%–32% of the calcium in cow's milk. Legumes, soy products (especially tofu made with calcium sulphate), and figs are also excellent sources of dietary calcium and protein. Regular exercise training, adequate sun exposure, and vitamin D supplementation are also important to promote bone health and prevent fracturesand may play a key role in the protection against certain autoimmune diseases and advanced (metastatic) cancers.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113xmoti]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — vegetarian diet implementation, safety, and evidence rating: The Work Group suggests a referral to an RDN whenever possible for individuals who choose this vegetarian style diet to ensure all potential harms are mitigated. This nutrition intervention strategy might incur nutritional health burdens of adequately maintaining sufficient proteins and balancing essential amino acids, iron, and B-12 levels, and vegan diets are associated with reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, although a thoughtfully planned vegetarian diet can adequately provide essential caloric needs even in younger or more athletic individuals who require higher calorie intake. Additional considerations include the incurred likely higher cost of vegetarian diets and limited availability in certain food desert areas. The evidence is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, with the Work Group's confidence moderate based on the lowest GRADE rating for critical outcomes of glycemic control and weight loss; the body of evidence was limited to one SR of nine RCTs, and intervention duration could be as low as 4 weeks with a median of 12 weeks and an extended range of 74 weeks.

Navigating the vegetarian product marketplace — The global vegetarian product marketplace continues to expand in response to public interest in plant-based options for health, ethical, and environmental reasons, and the global plant-based food market is forecasted to expand from $11.3 billion in 2023 to $35.9 billion in 2033. Plant-based alternative foods and beverages may also provide micronutrients such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, and iron, but these food options may also pose challenges, such as the degree of processing ranging from minimally to highly processed; the high amounts of fat, sodium, added sugar, calories, and, in some cases, saturated fat; and the use of additives that may be problematic for some individuals with allergies or sensitivities; RDNs and NDTRs can provide their clients with a balanced perspective on the pros and cons of incorporating plant-based alternatives, encourage moderation in consumption and label reading for nutrition information, and act as advocates for healthier versions of processed foods.

Recommendations for clinicians and allied health practitioners

For overweight men and women seeking weight loss and cardiometabolic improvement as means of primary and secondary prevention of T2DM, hypertension, and CVD, well-balanced and supplemented vegetarian diets rich in minimally processed plant foods may be an option, especially when coupled with calorie restriction and regular exercise training as recommended in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. Regular fish intake can provide additional cardiovascular health benefits. Additional trials are warranted to determine whether patients with CVD will ultimately benefit from consuming vegetarian and vegan diets and, if so, in what ways. As with any potential therapeutic strategy, the risks and benefits of vegetarian diets must be discussed with patients. There is evidence to suggest that some vegetarians, particularly those who follow restrictive diets such as vegans, may be at greater risk of haemorrhagic stroke and bone fractures if they do not carefully plan their diets and consume fortified plant-based foods or supplements. In addition, vegans and some vegetarians may be at risk of deficiencies in vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B12, riboflavin, iron, zinc, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids. This can be particularly dangerous for pregnant and breastfeeding women and growing children, as these nutrients are crucial for foetal and child development. It is recommended that anyone considering a vegetarian or vegan diet consult with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider to ensure that their diet is nutritionally adequate. Consuming vegetarian diets rich in refined grains, potatoes, high-sodium preserved vegetables, fried goods, sweets, juices, and sweetened beverages can increase the risk of developing T2DM and CVD morbidity and mortality. Finally, in the case of vegetarian diets and cancer, the benefits and risks are not well defined. As a weight loss strategy, this may be an option for some cancer patients, but there are currently no data to suggest that vegetarian or vegan diets in the absence of weight loss and/or changes in physical activity patterns will have a positive impact on cancer outcomes, including either recurrence or the development of metastatic cancers.

### Vegetarian dietary patterns for adults: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [^117HNiLt]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2025). High credibility.

Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics practitioner-client handout on vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns states that these patterns may help prevent heart disease, help with weight loss and maintaining healthy weight, help improve HbA1c in type 2 diabetes, and be as effective as other prescribed diets for lowering blood pressure & blood lipids in adults with heart disease. Quality matters! Risk for CVD, type 2 diabetes and other conditions are lower when plant-based diets are healthy compared to when they are unhealthy. The 7 Principles of Healthy Vegetarian and Vegan Dietary Patterns are: Choose a Variety, Focus on Produce, Consume Protein Regularly, Focus on Fiber, Choose Unsaturated Fats, Ensure Adequate Intake of Micronutrients that may be Limited, and Balance Energy Intake. Key details include: Include a wide variety of unprocessed and minimally processed plant foods including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds; Make vegetables and fruits key features of every meal; Eat protein-rich plant foods at each meal including legumes, soy foods, seitan, plant-based meat alternatives, seeds, and nuts; Opt for fiber-rich whole grains such as quinoa, barley, whole wheat, oats, and brown, black, or wild rice; Incorporate sources of unsaturated fats such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and plant-sourced oils and fats; Ensure daily consumption of essential micronutrients, with attention to those that may be limited in plant-based diets such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, calcium, iron, iodine, and choline; and Eat sufficient calories to support metabolism and physical activity, but do not consume excessive calories which lead to weight gain.

Introduction

Recently, interest in plant-based diets (PBDs) has increased in many global regions. Although formal estimates are lacking, numerous sources indicate that more people are adopting meat-free diets in industrialized countries. Broadly, vegetarian diets exclude meat and fish, whereas vegan diets eliminate all products of animal origin, including dairy and eggs. There are 3 main reasons for their rising popularity: planetary sustainability; improving health, including prevention of noncommunicable disease (NCD); and heightened concern for animal welfare. The first two have been recently reflected in healthy eating recommendations by numerous international health organizations. These issues primarily concern adults, who may then act on them when selecting diets for their offspring. The health effects of vegetarianism and veganism have been evaluated in adults and include lower cardiometabolic risk but increased fracture risk in vegans with low dietary calcium content.

Less evidence is available for children. Atherosclerosis originates in childhood and relates to cardiometabolic risk factors that, along with dietary habits, track into adulthood. Therefore, PBDs in childhood might reduce adult risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, any such benefits must be considered in light of safety in the pediatric population. Vegetarians and vegans restrict intake of whole food groups. This is of particular concern in children, whose nutrient and energy needs are higher relative to body weight and whose growth might be impaired by nutrient deficiencies at sensitive periods of development. Existing data come from studies of heterogeneous design and relate predominantly to anthropometric outcomes and to vegetarian children. Previous work on vegetarian children showed normal growth and a tendency to be leaner compared with omnivores. Evidence on blood micronutrient status for this group is available primarily for iron status, showing wide variation in the prevalence of deficiency. Data on other blood parameters are scant. There are no current informative studies on vegan children other than those < 3 y old when health effects might be less evident.

The sparsity of evidence contributes to inconsistencies between medical and nutrition organizations' statements regarding the safety of meat-free diets in childhood. Given growing global campaigns to encourage PBDs, reliable evidence is urgently needed, so that these diets can help decrease ecological damage while also promoting health in both adults and children. We aimed to evaluate differences in several indicators of health, including growth, body composition, CVD risk, and micronutrient status, along with estimating the prevalence of inadequate serum micronutrient and abnormal cholesterol status in vegetarian or vegan children, relative to an omnivore reference group.

### Nutrient intake in the GEICO multicenter trial: the effects of a multicomponent worksite intervention [^117RAUpm]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Diets high in fiber may also facilitate removal of cholesterol, with favorable effects for individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease. In a 5-year study of patients with heart disease, a low-fat vegetarian diet as a part of a program of lifestyle changes has been shown to reverse atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of cardiac events.

Reported protein intake decreased in the intervention group, but the percentage of energy from protein remained within the range recommended by the Institute of Medicine.

Among micronutrients, the intervention group increased the reported intake of β-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium. As expected, vitamin B 12 from food sources fell in the intervention group. However, participants were asked to take supplemental B 12. For both groups, calcium intake was below the levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine at baseline and again at 18 weeks, and was dropped in the intervention group. In estimating calcium requirements, committees have used varying methods to calculate skeletal accretion and turnover rates, resulting in a considerable worldwide debate about whether currently recommended intakes of calcium are adequate to maximize peak bone mass and to minimize bone loss and fracture risk in later life. However, this may indicate the need for further instruction on plant-based sources of calcium, such as green leafy vegetables and legumes. Reported iron intake increased in the intervention group, reflecting the increased intake of plant-based sources of iron.

The 18-week nutrient intake data indicate that some intervention group participants continued to include some animal products in their diets and consumed more fat than had been recommended. Nonetheless, the two groups diverged markedly in their reported dietary behavior, suggesting that the intervention elicits significant changes even for those participants who do not fully adhere to the prescribed guidelines. As previously reported, these nutrient changes are reflected in improvements in body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, and, for those with diabetes, improvements in glycemic control.

The tendency of plant-based diets to favorably influence nutrient intake and clinical measures related to disease risk raises the question of their sustainability over the long term. A University of Pittsburgh survey of young women who had tried both vegetarian and various calorie-restricted dietsfound that the mean duration of adherence to vegetarian diets was at least 2 years, compared with only 4 months for calorie-restricted diets. In the course of dietary intervention trials, adherence, attrition and eating behavior have been studied, and vegetarian and vegan regimens appear to be generally similar to other therapeutic diets within these parameters.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^114pF4M5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prevention in young children — iron deficiency anemia is usually treated with oral iron; the usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses. According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day, and in children ages 1 to 3 years it is 7 mg per day; nonheme iron may be less well absorbed than heme iron such that the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet. Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods, and iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants; federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and more than 50% of the iron in the US food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

### The effects of plant-based diets on the body and the brain: a systematic review [^113yaMRc]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Similar health dangers can stem from iron deficiency, another commonly assumed risk for plant-based dieters and other risk groups such as young women. A meta-analysis on 24 studies proposes that although serum ferritin levels were lower in vegetarians on average, it is recommended to sustain an optimal ferritin level (neither too low nor too high), calling for well-monitored supplementation strategies. Iron deficiency is not only dependent on iron intake as such but also on complimentary dietary factors influencing its bioavailability (discussed in ref.). The picture remains complex: on the one hand iron deficiency may lead to detrimental health effects, such as impairments in early brain development and cognitive functions in adults and in children carried by iron-deficient mothersand a possible role for iron overload in the brain on cognitive impairment on the other hand. One study showed that attention, memory and learning were impaired in iron-deficient compared to iron-sufficient women, which could be restored after a 4-month oral iron supplementation (n = 118). Iron deficiency-related impairments could be attributed to anemia as an underlying cause, possibly leading to fatigue, or an undersupply of blood to the brain or alterations in neurobiological and neuronal systemsprovoking impaired cognitive functioning.

This leads to the general recommendation to monitor health status by frequent blood tests, to consult a dietician to live healthily on a plant-based diet and to consider supplements to avoid nutrient deficiencies or nutrient-overdose-related toxicity. All in all, organizations such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsand the German Nutrition Society do not judge iron as a major risk factor for plant-based dieters.

Vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns — nutrient risk counseling should include discussing biomarker and bone outcomes and ensuring adequate intake. The page states "reduced bone mineral density and reduced ferritin and iodine biomarker concentrations, and strategies to ensure adequate intake of these essential nutrients should be discussed". It adds that "Vegan clients should also be aware of the potential for increased fracture risk, reduced bone mineral density, and low concentrations of vitamins B12 and D, although available evidence was of low or very low quality". Shared decision making is supported as "Discussions about potential concerns and their associated level of evidence can guide shared decision making between the practitioner and client about how to mitigate risk or treat deficiencies", and "RDNs and NDTRs can use the resources provided in Figure 4 (available at www.jandonline.org) and Figure 5, respectively".

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^117Gqy91]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended daily intake of iron ranges from 7 to 13 mg daily (adapted from EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens) (Table 5). Many factors influence iron requirements, including age, sex and iron status, among others. Children who follow vegetarian or vegan diets require a higher iron intake since non‐heme iron is less bioavailable than heme iron. Cow's milk is low in iron (0.1–0.2 mg per 240 mL) and is, therefore, not suitable for infants. In infants who are not breastfed, the only adequate source of iron is iron‐fortified infant formula. By 6 months of age, the infant's endogenous iron stores will have been used up. Therefore, early introduction of foods rich in iron is recommended during complementary feeding period. Table 6 lists the iron content of selected foods (adapted from Iron Fact Sheet for Health Professionals).

Iron content of selected foods.

6.2.2 Oral iron

Oral iron preparations are relatively inexpensive and easily available but may cause GI side effects such as constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea while also having an effect on the intestinal microbiome.

There are numerous iron preparations, most of them available as over‐the‐counter supplements with or without other vitamins or minerals, which may result in uncertainty for both patients and physicians. Ferrous sulphate is, currently, the most frequently used formulation, whereas ferrous gluconate, ferrous fumarate, and carbonyl iron have also demonstrated efficacy as iron supplements for prevention and treatment of IDA. The elemental iron content of ferrous sulphate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate is 20%, 11.6% and 33%, respectively. Iron polysaccharide combinations are hydrated microspheres remaining in solution over a wide range of pH values, theoretically allowing for improved absorption and tolerability.

### Veganism and paediatric food allergy: two increasingly prevalent dietary issues that are challenging when co-occurring [^114HuQdt]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron

Typical vegan diets often include many iron-rich foods, including lentils, tofu (soy), chickpeas, nuts, seeds and grains. However, unlike iron from animal sources, termed heme iron, which is readily absorbed, non-heme iron from plants has poor bioavailability and lower absorption, due to high phytate and polyphenol levels. Non-heme, plant-based sources of iron must also be consumed in larger portions than heme, animal-based sources of iron, to meet needs. Vegans, as well as vegetarians, require 1.8 times the amount of dietary iron, compared to meat eaters, as a result of poorer bioavailability. Vitamin C may enhance the absorption of non-heme iron. However, many vegan sources of iron, particularly soy, nuts and sesame seeds, are also common food allergens. For children who are not allergic, iron-fortified foods, including packaged cereals, may be an additional source of iron. Through later infancy, iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency, thus highlighting the importance of adequate iron intake. Amongst the very young, infant formulas and cereals are main sources of dietary iron. After age 12 months, iron-fortified formulas are positively associated with serum ferritin levels, independent of socio-economic status and other dietary sources of iron.

But, even in the absence of allergies to common iron-rich vegan foods, careful monitoring of these children may be advised. In a study of infants with cow's milk allergy, but otherwise well, iron deficiency anaemia was identified in 5% of children. More strikingly, a retrospective study from Taiwan provides evidence that the prevalence of cow's milk protein allergy amongst children with iron-deficiency anaemia (serum ferritin < 12 ng/mL) was at least double the prevalence that has been reported in the general Taiwanese population (13.7% vs. 3.4 to 7.7%). Although the study of children with iron-deficiency anaemia was small (N = 51), it points toward an increased risk of iron-deficiency anaemia amongst young children with cow's milk allergy. Notably, although these children were quite ill, as evidenced by failure to thrive, hypoalbuminemia and erosive and hemorrhagic colitis on colonoscopy, none had eosinophila in the lamina propria and all recovered within 7 months of cow's milk elimination and iron supplementation.

### Dietary intakes and nutritional adequacy of Australians consuming plant-based diets compared to a regular meat-eating diet [^116HgpB9]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron intake has been shown to be higher in PBDs compared to RME diets as 80–90% of dietary iron intake is non-haem. Non-haem iron is derived from plant-sources such as beans, legumes, nuts and leafy greens, whereas haem iron is derived from animal sources such as meats and poultry. The amount of iron derived from non-haem food sources is often much higher than that of haem food sources. In this study we observed vegans and LOVs to consume 1–1.5 more daily serves of vegetables 0.5–1 additional serves of legumes and nuts which explains the higher overall iron intake among PBDs. The food structure and bioavailability play a key role when analysing iron adequacy. Haem iron from animal-based food is readily absorbed (20–30% rate), while the absorption of non-haem iron from plant-based foods is less available (1–10% rate). It is for this reason that the Institute of Medicine states vegetarians and vegans require 1.8 times higher dietary iron compared to non-vegetarians. Those following PBDs (vegan, LOV, PV, and SV) in this sample reached this additional requirement which is in accordance with previous literature. When comparing this samples iron intake to the Australian dietary guidelines all groups met the recommended intake for iron and vegans consumed two times the NRV. At current the Australian dietary guidelines do not recommend any additional iron intake for those following PBDs. Bioavailability can also strongly depend on dietary factors and an individual's current iron status. Inhibitors such as phytates, oxalates, fibre, calcium and polyphenols can bind and interfere with absorption of non-heam iron, while vitamin C rich food such a citrus fruits and vegetables can simultaneously enhance absorption. High fibre dietary patterns such as PBDs may lead to an increase consumption of inhibitors which compromise absorption rates. Despite vitamin C intake being comparable across groups, vegans and LOVs tended to have higher intakes compared to RMEs which may play a role in increasing bioavailability of non-haem iron. This may be amplified by use of vitamin C supplements which was reported at a comparable level (13–27% being users). Therefore, it is pivotal to use biochemical measures to ascertain the true iron status of individuals adhering to a PBD.

### Hematological parameters and prevalence of anemia in white and British Indian vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the UK biobank [^114E7kWP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with lower BMI, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol concentrations. At the same time, the long-term exclusion of animal foods may lead to inadequate intakes of some essential nutrients that are not easily obtained from plant sources, especially without fortification, and this may in turn affect hematological parameters. For example, red meat is a good source of heme iron, and poultry and fish also contain heme iron, which is more bioavailable than plant sources of iron; therefore, lack of meat or fish consumption may increase risk of iron-deficiency anemia. Indeed, several small studies reported that vegetarians and vegans had higher rates of anemia and lower hemoglobin or red blood cell counts compared with nonvegetarians. Vitamin B-12 is only present in animal foods; vegetarians, or vegans who exclude all animal foods from their diet, generally have a higher prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency. Vitamin B-12 has a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the maturation of red blood cells, and may play a role in the platelet life cycle. Intake of dietary protein, or specific amino acids, which may be low in vegetarian diets, may also have a role in supporting the immune system, including production or activation of white blood cells. Other nutrients, such as zinc, vitamin A, and riboflavin, which are less bioavailable in plant-based diets, have also been linked to blood cell or hemoglobin production.

There is limited robust evidence on the influence of vegetarian diets on hematological parameters, which might be reflective of anemia or immune status. Here, we examine the associations between varying degrees of animal source food exclusion and hematological indices in a large population-based cohort of ∼500,000 participants in the United Kingdom who self-identified as white British or British Indians.

### Soybean ferritin: implications for iron status of vegetarians [^115e4Uqo]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Meeting the requirement for absorbed iron is difficult for vegetarians, and their iron status often is lower than that of nonvegetarians. Beans contain ferritin in low concentrations, but it is possible to enhance this content by plant breeding or by inserting the gene for ferritin into plants, eg, soybeans. Because each ferritin molecule can bind to thousands of iron atoms, this may be a sustainable means to increase the iron contents of plants. Before such efforts are launched, it is important to determine whether iron in ferritin is bioavailable. This has been assessed in vitro by using human intestinal (Caco-2) cells and in vivo by using radiolabeled ferritin and whole-body counting in human subjects. Dietary factors affecting iron absorption, eg, ascorbic acid, phytate, and calcium, had limited effect on iron uptake from intact ferritin by Caco-2 cells, which suggests that ferritin-bound iron is absorbed via a mechanism different from that of nonheme iron. In an in vitro digestion system, ferritin was shown to be relatively resistant to proteolytic enzymes. Binding of ferritin to Caco-2 cells was shown to be saturable, and the kinetics for binding were characteristic of a receptor-mediated process. In human subjects, iron from purified soybean ferritin given in a meal was as well absorbed as iron from ferrous sulfate. In conclusion, iron is well absorbed from ferritin and may represent a means of biofortification of staple foods such as soybeans.

Micronutrient supplements in practice — indications and vulnerable groups: Micronutrient supplements may be used to help individuals meet a nutrient requirement or to treat a diagnosed deficiency, and may be appropriate when people are restricting energy intake for weight loss/control, not consuming an adequate amount of food to meet energy requirements due to poor appetite or illness, eliminating one or more food groups from their diet on a regular basis, or consuming a diet low in micronutrient-rich foods despite adequate or excessive energy intakes; groups most vulnerable to micronutrient inadequacy are older adults, pregnant women, alcohol-dependent individuals, strict vegetarians and vegans, and those with increased requirements secondary to health conditions or the chronic use of a medication that alter nutrient absorption, metabolism, or excretion.

### Nutritional iron deficiency [^116B2Ldi]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the leading risk factors for disability and death worldwide, affecting an estimated 2 billion people. Nutritional iron deficiency arises when physiological requirements cannot be met by iron absorption from diet. Dietary iron bioavailability is low in populations consuming monotonous plant-based diets. The high prevalence of iron deficiency in the developing world has substantial health and economic costs, including poor pregnancy outcome, impaired school performance, and decreased productivity. Recent studies have reported how the body regulates iron absorption and metabolism in response to changing iron status by upregulation or downregulation of key intestinal and hepatic proteins. Targeted iron supplementation, iron fortification of foods, or both, can control iron deficiency in populations. Although technical challenges limit the amount of bioavailable iron compounds that can be used in food fortification, studies show that iron fortification can be an effective strategy against nutritional iron deficiency. Specific laboratory measures of iron status should be used to assess the need for fortification and to monitor these interventions. Selective plant breeding and genetic engineering are promising new approaches to improve dietary iron nutritional quality.

### Hematological parameters and prevalence of anemia in white and British Indian vegetarians and nonvegetarians in the UK biobank [^115gRwRY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Low or non-meat eaters in the UK Biobank would have little or no intake of heme iron (estimated to be ∼40% of iron from meat sources), which is more easily absorbed than non-heme iron (present in plant foods such as cereals, vegetables, pulses, and fruits). Although vegetarian and vegan diets are usually high in vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption, plant-based diets also contain significant amounts of phytates and tannins, which inhibit non-heme iron absorption. Previous studies showed that vegetarians had lower non-heme and total iron absorption, as well as lower ferritin concentrations, compared with nonvegetarians, despite similar or higher total dietary iron intake (,–). Given the crucial role of iron in hemoglobin synthesis and red blood cell production, it would be expected that compared with regular meat eaters, low or non-meat eaters may have lower levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells and a higher risk of anemia. However, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, low or non-meat eaters were more likely to take iron supplements, as well as multivitamins that may contain iron, which could help prevent or correct anemia. For example, anemia in vegans in the UK Biobank seemed to occur mostly in those who were not taking iron supplements, although numbers were too small to make valid conclusions. In addition, zinc is a catalyst in iron metabolism and is less bioavailable in vegetarian diets, and low serum zinc levels have been associated with anemia. Vegetarians or vegans also tend to have lower intakes of other micronutrients, such as vitamin A or riboflavin, which might also have roles in blood cell or hemoglobin production.

Diet modeling to address iron shortfalls in 1- to 5-y-old (12–60 mo) children. (A) Current mean iron intakes (mg/d) including high-sugar (≥ 18 g/100 g) iron-fortified cereals and processed meat, consumed by 49% and 83% of 1- to 5-y-olds, respectively. (B) Predicted mean iron intakes (mg/d) based on the main milk-feeding scenario: predominantly human milk up to and including age 2 y [human milk (∼440 mL/d) alone for ≥ 1- to < 1.5-y-olds and human milk (∼170 mL/d) in combination with whole cow milk (∼245 mL/d) for ≥ 1.5- to ≤ 2-y-olds] and low-fat cow milk from age 2 y (∼295 mL/d), excluding all high-sugar cereals and processed meat. (C) Predicted mean iron intakes (mg/d) as for (B), but with the addition of low-sugar iron-fortified (< 18 g sugar/100 g; ≥ 12 mg Fe/100 g) cereals 5 d/wk and unprocessed red meat 3 d/wk. 1 For details of current dietary intakes see Tables 1 and 2, and for the main food contributors see Table 3. AR, average requirement; EAR, estimated average requirement; EFSA, European Food Safety Authority; IOM, Institute of Medicine.

Nutrient-driven FBDGs for Irish children

From the diet modeling described here, the following FBDGs were formulated to address nutrient shortfalls in 1- to 5-y-olds in Ireland:

Prolonged breastfeeding to age 2 y is optimal for providing DHA + EPA.
Low-fat cow milk can be used from 2 y owing to the lower content of saturated fat but similar contribution to other nutrient intakes compared with whole cow milk.
Non-vegetarian and lacto-ovo vegetarian food intake patterns are generally comparable in their nutritional contribution, except in the case of DHA + EPA which is limited in vegetarian diets. Furthermore, given the well-recognized poor bioavailability of iron from plant sources, a low-dose iron supplement may be advisable for children consuming vegetarian diets.
A low-dose vitamin D supplement should be recommended for all 1- to 5-y-olds.

### Complementary feeding: a commentary by the ESPGHAN committee on nutrition [^112k6nQo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

This position paper on complementary feeding summarizes evidence for health effects of complementary foods. It focuses on healthy infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these conclusions: Exclusive or full breast-feeding for about 6 months is a desirable goal. Complementary feeding (ie, solid foods and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula and follow-on formula) should not be introduced before 17 weeks and not later than 26 weeks. There is no convincing scientific evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of potentially allergenic foods, such as fish and eggs, reduces allergies, either in infants considered at increased risk for the development of allergy or in those not considered to be at increased risk. During the complementary feeding period, > 90% of the iron requirements of a breast-fed infant must be met by complementary foods, which should provide sufficient bioavailable iron. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron and should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, although small volumes may be added to complementary foods. It is prudent to avoid both early (< 4 months) and late (≥ 7 months) introduction of gluten, and to introduce gluten gradually while the infant is still breast-fed, inasmuch as this may reduce the risk of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and wheat allergy. Infants and young children receiving a vegetarian diet should receive a sufficient amount (approximately 500 mL) of breast milk or formula and dairy products. Infants and young children should not be fed a vegan diet.

### Sustainability benefits of transitioning from current diets to plant-based alternatives or whole-food diets in Sweden [^113euN1d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Plant-based alternatives (PBAs) are increasingly becoming part of diets. Here, we investigate the environmental, nutritional, and economic implications of replacing animal-source foods (ASFs) with PBAs or whole foods (WFs) in the Swedish diet. Utilising two functional units (mass and energy), we model vegan, vegetarian, and flexitarian scenarios, each based on PBAs or WFs. Our results demonstrate that PBA-rich diets substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions (30–52%), land use (20–45%), and freshwater use (14–27%), with the vegan diet showing the highest reduction potential. We observe comparable environmental benefits when ASFs are replaced with WFs, underscoring the need to reduce ASF consumption. PBA scenarios meet most Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, except for vitamin B12, vitamin D and selenium, while enhancing iron, magnesium, folate, and fibre supply and decreasing saturated fat. Daily food expenditure slightly increases in the PBA scenarios (3–5%) and decreases in the WF scenarios (4–17%), with PBA diets being 10–20% more expensive than WF diets. Here we show, that replacing ASFs with PBAs can reduce the environmental impact of current Swedish diets while meeting most nutritional recommendations, but slightly increases food expenditure. We recommend prioritising ASF reduction and diversifying WFs and healthier PBAs to accommodate diverse consumer preferences during dietary transitions.

### Addressing nutrient shortfalls in 1-to 5-year-old Irish children using diet modeling: development of a protocol for use in country-specific population health [^116VatEU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The provision of sufficient vitamin D through foods in this study was particularly challenging, as shown elsewhere. In Ireland, just 29% of children < 5 y old consume vitamin D–fortified foods, whereas only 20% consume vitamin D supplements. The effectiveness of micronutrient-fortified young-child formula products in improving intake and status of vitamin D has been previously reported in the current cohort of Irish children and in other European, and New Zealand and Australian, children. It is noteworthy that current requirements for vitamin D (the EFSA AI and IOM EAR) assume no skin synthesis of vitamin D from sunlight exposure. Irrespective of dietary intakes, however, inadequate vitamin D status in children < 5 y old in Ireland was previously reported to disappear in summer months, a seasonal variation that has also been observed in Danish children, emphasizing the importance of skin synthesis.

As in other HICs, this study highlights fortified cereals, meat, meat products, and DYC as key food sources of iron in the diets of young children. Although current dietary iron intakes were found to be generally sufficient, certain foods contributing to iron (high-sugar iron-fortified cereals and processed meat) were not aligned with best practice guidelines. Diet modeling which excluded all high-sugar cereals and processed meat thus resulted in shortfalls in predicted iron intakes in 1- to 3-y-olds. Iron intake shortfalls in young children are common in HICs, estimated to affect 26% of 12- to 23-mo-olds and 10% of 2- to 5-y-olds, and deficiency can be exacerbated by enteropathogenic infection in LMICs. This is of concern because iron deficiency anemia in young children can impair cognitive development. In addition, although the current results show that lacto-ovo vegetarian and nonvegetarian diets can provide comparable iron intakes, the bioavailability of nonheme iron (i.e. that from plant-based foods) is known to be considerably lower than that of heme iron from a meat-based diet. In the current study, shortfalls in predicted iron intakes among 1- to 3-y-olds were addressed by FUF and DYC or an iron supplement — approaches shown to be effective elsewhere. Given concerns regarding potential adverse effects of iron supplementation, however, targeting only children identified at risk (1- to 3-y-olds at ≤ 25 th percentile level) and using a low-dose supplement seems prudent.

### Veganism and paediatric food allergy: two increasingly prevalent dietary issues that are challenging when co-occurring [^1128XbzH]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Zinc

Zinc, like iron, has poor bioavailability, especially in a vegan diet. Vegan sources of zinc include soy and other legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains as well as fortified cereals. Due to the lower bioavailability of zinc in plant foods, vegans (as well as vegetarians) may require 1.5 times more zinc than meat eaters. Notably, soaking, heating and fermenting zinc-rich plant foods appears to reduce the inhibitory effect of phytate, which contributes to greater absorption of zinc.

Few studies have specifically examined zinc status in vegan vs. omnivore children. Authors of a 2014 review article reported no differences in serum zinc concentrations between young vegetarian, including those following a vegan diet, vs. omnivore children, although some differences may present in adolescence. However, the same authors also note that zinc status amongst vegan children should be monitored, and if necessary, provided with zinc supplements. Finally, as vegan sources of zinc typically include prepackaged, fortified breakfast cereals, legumes and soy, particular attention is warranted when working with vegan children who must avoid these foods due to allergy.

### Commonly consumed protein foods contribute to nutrient intake, diet quality, and nutrient adequacy [^116HRFYC]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The amount of dietary protein needed to prevent deficiency in most individuals is defined in the United States and Canada by the Recommended Dietary Allowance and is currently set at 0.8 g protein·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹ for adults. To meet this protein recommendation, the intake of a variety of protein food sources is advised. The goal of this article is to show that commonly consumed food sources of protein are more than just protein but also significant sources of essential nutrients. Commonly consumed sources of dietary protein frequently contribute substantially to intakes of nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, potassium, dietary fiber, iron, and folate, which have been identified as nutrients of "concern" (i.e., intakes are often lower than recommended). Despite this, dietary recommendations to reduce intakes of saturated fat and solid fats may result in dietary guidance to reduce intakes of commonly consumed food sources of protein, in particular animal-based protein. We propose that following such dietary guidance would make it difficult to meet recommended intakes for a number of nutrients, at least without marked changes in dietary consumption patterns. These apparently conflicting pieces of dietary guidance are hard to reconcile; however, we view it as prudent to advise the intake of high-quality dietary protein to ensure adequate intakes of a number of nutrients, particularly nutrients of concern.

### Addressing nutrient shortfalls in 1-to 5-year-old Irish children using diet modeling: development of a protocol for use in country-specific population health [^114zsR6Q]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessing nutritional sufficiency

The 4-d food patterns developed were inputted, and the nutrient content assessed, using nutrition analysis software (Nutritics Research Edition version 5.61), based on robust food composition data. Where a nutrient shortfall emerged, alternative food patterns providing sufficient intakes were examined to identify key food contributors. These foods were used to remodel the food patterns with nutrient shortfalls on an iterative basis to improve predicted intakes, within the constraints of best practice guidelines for young child feeding and guiding principles for developing FBDGs. The iterative amendments to the food patterns formed the main basis of the nutrient-driven FBDGs developed to address nutrient shortfalls. Supplemental Figure 1 outlines the protocol established to develop such FBDGs in a global context. After the nonvegetarian food patterns were finalized, lacto-ovo vegetarian patterns were modeled by replacing the meat, fish, and poultry with appropriate vegetarian alternatives (eggs, cheese, beans, lentils, tofu), on the main milk-feeding scenario, and adjusted as necessary to meet nutrient targets. The assumptions used for bioavailability of iron (10%), zinc (30%), and calcium (45% for 1–3 y; 30% for > 3 y) were derived from the EFSA, where no differences are applied for vegetarians.

For validation purposes and to confirm that the foods identified for use in the diet modeling based on the NPNS were still commonly consumed foods (i.e. considering that the NPNS was carried out in 2010/2011), a post hoc secondary analysis was undertaken of more recent British data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey of 1.5- to 5-y-old children (2014/2015 and 2015/2016; n = 405). This was considered a suitable approach for validation purposes, given that dietary intakes in the United Kingdom and Ireland are known to be similar.

Identification of under-reporters (URs) in the NPNS cohort has previously been described by Kehoe et al. In summary, basal metabolic rate (BMR) was predicted for each participant from standard equations using body weight (kg) and height (m). Minimum energy intake cutoffs, calculated as multiples of BMR (ratio of energy intake to BMR < 1.28), were used to identify URs (24% of the total sample). URs were not excluded from the current analysis.

### Vegetarian dietary patterns for adults: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [^113QRw53]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2025). High credibility.

Vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns — future research needs include addressing many research gaps regarding the health benefits and concerns of these patterns for adults in preventing, treating, and managing disease. Due to the diverse nature of diet constituents categorized as vegetarian dietary patterns, differentiation by subgroups that are sensitive to cultural, social, and economic contexts is needed, and information on culturally appropriate food choices is needed to develop recommendations reflective of these diets. Additional priorities include determining the extent and impact of novel plant-based food products on disease risk and evaluating the effectiveness of RDNs in improving nutritional outcomes and health status of vegetarians and vegans and those adopting these dietary patterns.

### Growth, body composition, and cardiovascular and nutritional risk of 5-to 10-y-old children consuming vegetarian, vegan, or omnivore diets [^116GAscA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Plant-based diets (PBDs) are increasingly recommended for human and planetary health. However, comprehensive evidence on the health effects of PBDs in children remains incomplete, particularly in vegans.

Objectives

To quantify differences in body composition, cardiovascular risk, and micronutrient status of vegetarian and vegan children relative to omnivores and to estimate prevalence of abnormal micronutrient and cholesterol status in each group.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study, Polish children aged 5–10 y (63 vegetarian, 52 vegan, 72 matched omnivores) were assessed using anthropometry, deuterium dilution, DXA, and carotid ultrasound. Fasting blood samples, dietary intake, and accelerometry data were collected.

Results

All results are reported relative to omnivores. Vegetarians had lower gluteofemoral adiposity but similar total fat and lean mass. Vegans had lower fat indices in all regions but similar lean mass. Both groups had lower bone mineral content (BMC). The difference for vegetarians attenuated after accounting for body size but remained in vegans (total body minus the head: -3.7%; 95% CI: -7.0, -0.4; lumbar spine: -5.6%; 95% CI: -10.6, -0.5). Vegetarians had lower total cholesterol, HDL, and serum B-12 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] without supplementation but higher glucose, VLDL, and triglycerides. Vegans were shorter and had lower total LDL (-24 mg/dL; 95% CI: -35.2, -12.9) and HDL (-12.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: -17.3, -7.1), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, iron status, and serum B-12 (-217.6 pmol/L; 95% CI: -305.7, -129.5) and 25(OH)D without supplementation but higher homocysteine and mean corpuscular volume. Vitamin B-12 deficiency, iron-deficiency anemia, low ferritin, and low HDL were more prevalent in vegans, who also had the lowest prevalence of high LDL. Supplementation resolved low B-12 and 25(OH)D concentrations.

Conclusions

Vegan diets were associated with a healthier cardiovascular risk profile but also with increased risk of nutritional deficiencies and lower BMC and height. Vegetarians showed less pronounced nutritional deficiencies but, unexpectedly, a less favorable cardiometabolic risk profile. Further research may help maximize the benefits of PBDs in children.

ABSTRACT

Background

Plant-based diets (PBDs) are increasingly recommended for human and planetary health. However, comprehensive evidence on the health effects of PBDs in children remains incomplete, particularly in vegans.

### Effects of consuming an iron supplement with a meal containing animal or plant-based meat on indicators of iron status and anemia in women of reproductive age with iron deficiency: a randomized, controlled study [^112SsJL8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Animal meat contains heme iron, which is more bioavailable and better absorbed than non-heme iron found in plants. Animal meat also contains a "meat factor" that stimulates absorption of non-heme iron.

Objective

To determine whether consuming an iron supplement, a source of non-heme iron, with a meal containing animal meat once a day for 8 weeks leads to improvements in iron status in females with iron deficiency compared to those consuming the same iron supplement with a meal containing plant-based meat.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-arm study, non-pregnant women of reproductive age (n = 52; 24 ± 7 y; body mass index 22.9 ± 3.0 kg/m²) with low iron stores (serum ferritin < 25 μg/L) were randomized to consume an iron supplement containing 32 mg elemental iron (from ferrous sulfate) with a lunch meal containing either 4 oz. of 1) beef (Animal) or 2) Beyond Meat (Plant) once a day for 8 weeks. Meals were identical except for the addition of Animal or Plant. The primary outcomes were biochemical indicators of iron status and anemia. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation.

Results

Baseline indicators of iron status and anemia did not differ between groups. Daily consumption of an iron supplement with a lunch meal for 8 weeks improved serum ferritin (main time effect: +10.7 ± 9.6 μg/L, P < 0.0001), transferrin saturation (main time effect: +5.1 ± 18.7%, P = 0.048), soluble transferrin receptor (main time effect: -0.6 ± 1.0 mg/L, P < 0.001), body iron stores (main time effect: +2.8 ± 3.1 mg/kg, P < 0.0001), and hemoglobin (main time effect: +0.5 ± 0.9 g/dL, P = 0.0002) regardless of whether the meals contained Animal or Plant (treatment-by-time interaction: P > 0.05 for all indicators).

Conclusions

Findings suggest that the "meat factor" does not contribute substantially to improvements in iron status in women of reproductive age with iron deficiency when consumed with an iron supplement for 8 weeks.

### Plant-based alternative proteins-are they nutritionally more advantageous? [^111H72Zm]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The transition towards sustainable nutrition as well as the exploration of alternative sources of protein have been at the forefront of thinking in the 21st century. However, further research is required to ascertain if a diet composed of alternative plant-based proteins has similar nutritional advantages to a plant-based diet. This study aims to model the replacement of a diet consisting of animal-based proteins with plant-based alternatives (PBA), in a group of Asians.

Methods

A 4-day food record was collected from 50 individuals residing in Singapore and nutrient profiles were generated for each individual. Food records were analysed, and meat, dairy, and seafood ingredients were substituted gram-for-gram with their PBA. The original and replaced nutrient profiles were compared against each other and the differences in macro and micronutrients were analysed.

Results

A significant increase in carbohydrates, dietary fibre, as well as in micronutrients such as sodium and calcium was observed. Conversely, there was a significant decreased intake in overall energy, protein and fat (p < 0.005).

Conclusions

The significant nutritional impact of substituting animal-based proteins for PBA may present benefits for bone health and individuals on a caloric restriction diet. However, higher sodium levels may be undesirable for individuals with cardiovascular conditions and hypertension, and the low bioavailability of iron in plant-based sources may present issues for iron deficient populations. Bearing some of these key findings in mind, researchers and manufacturers need to consider these when developing alternative protein products to meet consumer demands for palatable and nutritious plant-based products.

### Debunking the vegan myth: the case for a plant-forward omnivorous whole-foods diet [^117BM12z]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Vegan diets are widely promoted as protective against cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, removing all animal foods from a human's diet usually causes unfavorable health consequences. Our hominin ancestors began consuming meat, fish, seafood, and eggs > 2 million years ago. Consequently, humans are genetically adapted to procure nutrients from both plant and animal sources. In contrast, veganism is without evolutionary precedent in Homo sapiens species. Strict adherence to a vegan diet causes predictable deficiencies in nutrients including vitamins B 12, B 2, D, niacin, iron, iodine, zinc, high-quality proteins, omega-3, and calcium. Prolonged strict veganism increases risk for bone fractures, sarcopenia, anemia, and depression. A more logical diet is a plant-forward omnivorous eating pattern that emphasizes generous consumption of natural, unprocessed foods predominantly from plants. To balance this diet, modest amounts of wholesome animal foods, such wild-caught fish/seafood, pasture-raised meat and eggs, and fermented unsweetened dairy should be consumed regularly.

### Vegetarian dietary patterns for adults: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [^1136bDCx]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2025). High credibility.

Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position — vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns may improve cardiometabolic disease and risk factors and align with current population and disease-specific recommendations, but vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns may also increase concerns for some nutrient deficiencies. RDNs should offer vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns as an option for adults who may benefit from and express interest in following these patterns, and RDNs and NDTRs should emphasize consumption of high-quality plant-based foods rather than solely focusing on the avoidance of animal-sourced foods. In all cases, vegetarian and vegan dietary recommendations should be tailored to client values, preferences, lifestyle, and special circumstances, and the Academy advocates for policies and legislation that support equitable access to more plant-based foods in a variety of settings and within clinical care; promoting and facilitating healthy vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns at the population and individual levels is an important mechanism for improving several outcomes associated with cardiometabolic diseases.

### Impact of consuming an environmentally protective diet on micronutrients: a systematic literature review [^111f5fkU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A global move toward consumption of diets from sustainable sources is required to protect planetary health. As this dietary transition will result in greater reliance on plant-based protein sources, the impact on micronutrient (MN) intakes and status is unknown.

Objective

Evaluate the evidence of effects on intakes and status of selected MNs resulting from changes in dietary intakes to reduce environmental impact. Selected MNs of public health concern were vitamins A, D, and B12, folate, calcium, iron, iodine, and zinc.

Methods

We systematically searched 7 databases from January 2011 to October 2022 and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies had to report individual MN intake and/or status data collected in free-living individuals from the year 2000 onward and environmental outcomes.

Results

From the 10,965 studies identified, 56 studies were included, mostly from high-income countries (n = 49). Iron (all 56) and iodine (n = 20) were the most and least reported MNs, respectively. There was one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that also provided the only biomarker data, 10 dietary intake studies, and 45 dietary modeling studies, including 29 diet optimization studies. Most studies sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or intake of animal-sourced foods. Most results suggested that intakes of zinc, calcium, iodine, and vitamins B12, A, and D would decrease, and total iron and folate would increase in a dietary transition to reduce environmental impacts. Risk of inadequate intakes of zinc, calcium, vitamins A, B12 and D were more likely to increase in the 10 studies that reported nutrient adequacy. Diet optimization (n = 29) demonstrated that meeting nutritional and environmental targets is technically feasible, although acceptability is not guaranteed.

Conclusions

Lower intakes and status of MNs of public health concern are a potential outcome of dietary changes to reduce environmental impacts. Adequate consideration of context and nutritional requirements is required to develop evidence-based recommendations. This study was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42021239713).

### Fortification of condiments and seasonings with iron for preventing anaemia and improving health [^1115ZRe4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are prevalent throughout the world and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease (WHO 2009). Iron, vitamin A, and iodine deficiencies affect billions worldwide, with iron deficiency and anaemia being the most prevalent, affecting more than 30% and 15% of global population, respectively (Bailey 2015; WHO 2008; The Micronutrient Initiative 2009). As of 2019, about 1.8 billion people lived with anaemia and iron deficiency remains the leading cause of anaemia in all regions (Safiri 2021). Iron is present in a wide variety of plant‐ and animal‐based foods, but iron in plant‐based diets ‐ common in low‐ and middle‐income countries ‐ is often less well‐absorbed, hindered by dietary compounds such as phytates, tannins or phenols that are present in the same foods. Conversely, meat and meat by‐products are the best sources of bioavailable iron, but they may be inaccessible, culturally inappropriate, or unaffordable to many people.

Anaemia is a multifactorial condition. It is estimated by Safiri 2021 that about 66.1% and 56.8% of cases among males and females, respectively, are caused by dietary iron deficiency (known as iron deficiency anaemia ‐ IDA), although other estimates are lower (Petry 2016; WHO 2014) and vary across regions, age, sex, and the presence of other causes of anaemia. Other causes of anaemia include infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections; inherited disorders of haemoglobin structure; or other nutritional deficiencies such as that of folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A (WHO 2022a). Those with IDA may have inadequate iron intake, inadequate iron absorption or transport within the body, and/or losses of iron associated with disease or life stage (Clark, 2008). In settings with excess burden of other diseases such as HIV, malaria, or hookworm infestations, the chances of anaemia occurrence and complications are increased.

### Dietary micronutrient intakes among women of reproductive age in mumbai slums [^114Xxf87]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Micronutrient deficiencies are a serious public health problem among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO states that malnutrition is directly or indirectly linked to major causes of death and disability worldwide. Over 2 billion people (most of whom live in LMICs) are estimated to be deficient in one or more vitamins and minerals, particularly iron, zinc and vitamin A. In India, iron, vitamin A and vitamin B12 deficiencies are widespread in low-income populations, children and pregnant women. Micronutrient requirements increase during pregnancy. This can exacerbate existing insufficiencies resulting in adverse maternal outcomes. Poor-quality diets before pregnancy may contribute to birth defects, intrauterine growth restriction and infant stunting.

The main direct cause of micronutrient deficiencies is insufficient intakes. Low bioavailability is also a factor for some micronutrients. Intakes are low when access to micronutrient-rich foods and fortified foods is limited, usually because they are expensive, locally unavailable or unacceptable for cultural or religious reasons. Diets in India are often poor quality, carbohydrate rich and lacking in micronutrient-rich foods. 'Animal source' foods are rich in protein, iron and vitamin B12, yet in the state of Maharashtra, fewer than 2% of women reported daily consumption of meat/chicken or fish and 35% never ate them. Vegetarian diets diverse enough to provide adequate micronutrients may not be affordable. Fruit and vegetable intakes in India are often below the recommended five portions per day.

There is a lack of data on micronutrient intakes of women of reproductive age, and important dietary sources, in India. Most research has focused on rural populations, with few studies in urban settings. Investigations have mainly focused on pregnant women; few have studied preconceptional women of reproductive age or compared intakes of adults and adolescents against the respective recommended intakes. Studies typically focus on iodine, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin C, but few have investigated a wide range of micronutrients linked to dietary sources.

The aim of this study is to provide a unique insight into food and micronutrient consumption of a large cohort of women of reproductive age living in Mumbai slums. Our objectives were to (1) describe micronutrient intakes amongst these women; (2) assess the adequacy of these intakes against references; (3) identify important dietary sources of micronutrients.

### Vegan diet and nutritional status in infants, children and adolescents: a position paper based on a systematic search by the ESPGHAN nutrition committee [^115b73vq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Another concern about vegan diets is that both the quantity and quality of dietary protein may be lower than in omnivorous diets. Both the digestibility and essential amino acid content of plant proteins are lower than that of animal proteins. However, purified or concentrated vegetable proteins, for example soy protein, and gluten have high digestibility (> 95%), which is similar to animal proteins. Some intact vegetable products, such as whole cereals and pulses, have a slightly lower protein digestibility of approximately 80%–90%, whereas most other vegetable proteins have an even lower digestibility of 50%–80%. In view of the lower availability of plant protein, the Italian position paper suggests that vegan children and adolescents may need to consume more protein than recommended for omnivores/the general population.

Paediatric Society Statements are summarised in Table 1. The statements were all expert recommendations based on narrative reviews of the evidence. In 2017, a European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) position paper on complementary feeding recommended that all infants old enough to start complementary feeding should receive iron‐rich foods, including meat. The authors also recommended that vegan diets should not be used in infancy/when starting complementary feeding without appropriate medical and dietetic supervision. The literature evaluating whether vegan diets are appropriate for children is limited, not recent and lacking in evidence. This study focuses specifically on vegan diets in paediatric age, as this dietary pattern is the most restrictive within the plant‐based spectrum, is increasing in popularity, and presents unique nutritional challenges that warrant specific attention. The aim of this ESPGHAN Nutrition Committee position paper was to systematically review any new evidence for the effect of a vegan diet on body growth, nutritional adequacy and laboratory biomarkers in infants, children and adolescents, when compared to children on an omnivorous diet. The practicalities of how to properly plan vegan diets for children will be covered in a second part, as a separate manuscript.

Prevalence of abnormal vitamin B-12, hemoglobin, depleted iron stores, and LDL- and HDL cholesterol status

Estimated prevalence and pairwise comparisons of abnormal vitamin B-12, hemoglobin, depleted iron stores, and LDL and HDL cholesterol status in dietary groups are presented in Table 6. For most of these comparisons, the estimated prevalence significantly differed between the vegans and the omnivores. The prevalence of probable vitamin B-12 deficiency was 3% in omnivores, 4% among vegetarians, and 13% in vegans. The prevalence of possible B-12 deficiency was 16%, 19%, and 40% in omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans, respectively. The prevalence of moderate iron deficiency anemia was 0% among omnivores and 2% in both vegetarians and vegans. The prevalence of mild anemia was 0% in omnivores, 7% in vegetarians, and 6% in vegans. There were no children with severe iron deficiency anemia. The prevalence of depleted iron stores (serum ferritin < 15 µg/L) was 12.8% in omnivores, 18.3% in vegetarians, and 30.2% in vegans. The prevalence of abnormal pediatric LDL cholesterol status with high (≥ 130 mg/dL) and borderline high (110–129 mg/dL) LDL cholesterol concentrations was 13% and 17% for omnivores, 6% and 10% for vegetarians, and 0% and 1% for vegans, respectively. The prevalence of low (> 45 mg/dL) and borderline (40–45 mg/dL) HDL cholesterol was 7% and 12% for omnivores, 15% and 19% for vegetarians, and 26% and 24% for vegans, respectively.

### Vegetarian dietary patterns for adults: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [^114yNmZm]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2025). High credibility.

Diet quality in vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns — A growing body of evidence demonstrates the importance of emphasizing diet quality when advising clients about healthy and varied vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns. Individuals can improve and maintain cardiometabolic health through an emphasis on consuming a variety of nutrient-dense whole foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients and moderating intakes of highly processed foods that are often high in saturated fats, sodium, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars. However, even processed plant-based milk and meat alternatives tend to be higher in fiber and lower in saturated fat and cholesterol compared with animal-based products, which can be beneficial to heart health.

Nutritional adequacy

Children on a vegan diet should have regular nutritional counselling from a qualified paediatric dietitian. In settings where dietary support is not available, a public health approach should be adopted to provide clear advice based on evidence‐based research and clinical observation.
Vegan diets in infants, children and adolescents should provide the same age‐appropriate average requirements for energy intake as for the general paediatric population.
Vegan children may need to consume more protein than recommended for the general population in view of the lower digestibility of plant protein compared to animal protein.
The protein intake should be assessed on an individual basis for each child. The quality as well as the quantity of protein should be taken into account to optimise essential amino acid intake.
Foods rich in ALA should be consumed regularly to support adequate omega‐3 fatty acid ingestion. An algal‐based, age‐appropriate DHA supplement with titrated content might be considered in children aged < 2 years.
Nutritional advice should emphasise the intake of iron‐rich foods and nutrients such as vitamin C, which enhances iron absorption in view of the lower bioavailability of plant‐derived iron sources. Families should also be aware that nutrients such as phytates, polyphenols, calcium and oxalic acid inhibit iron absorption.
Iron supplements should be considered in breastfed infants from 6 months and in older children if inadequate nutritional intake.
To guarantee adequate calcium intake when introducing complementary feeding, breastfeeding and/or infant formula should be continued for 12 months or longer until the infant is on a nutritionally complete diet. Nutritional counselling should target calcium‐rich foods, e.g. calcium‐supplemented foods/fluids, and calcium supplements, where needed.
Vegan children should aim to include vitamin B12 fortified foods in their diets, and a daily age‐appropriate vitamin B12 supplement is recommended (see Table S2).
Consider an age‐appropriate vitamin D supplement (see Table S3) since a vegan diet is considered a risk factor for deficiency from birth to 18 years.
In the same way as in the general population, Vitamin D supplements are even more important when there is a lack of skin (arms and face) exposure to sun, in more Northern countries, and/or an indoor lifestyle.
If dietary calcium intake is insufficient, children benefit from a vitamin D and calcium supplement.

### Cardiometabolic effects of omnivorous vs vegan diets in identical twins: a randomized clinical trial [^116wVHvc]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Plant-based diets have gained recent popularity not only for their lower environmental impact compared with an omnivorous dietary pattern but also for their health benefits. The most significant global health crises affecting our generation are noncommunicable diseases and climate change, which are both inextricably linked to diet, and dietary patterns high in plants and low in animal foods can maximize health and environmental benefits. Plant-based diets contain a diverse family of dietary patterns, which encourage a reduced consumption of animal foods. Abundant evidence from observational and intervention studies, indicates that vegan diets are associated with improved cardiovascular health and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, likely because of the higher daily consumption of vegetables and fruits, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and seeds compared with other different types of dietary patterns.

A vegan dietary pattern is typically lower in energy density but higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients compared with other dietary patterns. However, sometimes a vegan dietary pattern can limit specific nutrients, such as vitamin B 12, iron, and calcium. Most studies, examining vegan diets have been epidemiologic examinations, with a few reported clinical studies. A confounding factor to consider in epidemiologic studies is the bias of self-decided vegans who may differ from nonvegans in factors that may influence diet and health. In addition, a poorly formulated vegan diet can include low-quality plant foods, such as refined carbohydrates and added sugars. To address these concerns, we designed a trial to compare the cardiometabolic effects of a healthy vegan diet with a healthy omnivorous diet, exposing both groups to vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. To control for genetic differences that might alter the cardiometabolic effects of diet, we randomly assigned identical twins to follow the 2 diets for 8 weeks.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on anemia in pregnancy, to reduce the incidence and impact of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [^114SHn6o]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 SUMMARY OFRECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SCREENING, DIAGNOSIS, AND PREVENTION OF ANEMIA IN PREGNANCY

1.1 Screening and diagnosis of anemia in pregnancy

All pregnant women should be screened for anemia with a full blood count (FBC) at booking and again at 28 weeks (strong, low). In resource‐limited settings, a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit test can be used for screening (conditional, low).
Anemia in pregnancy is diagnosed if the hemoglobin concentration is less than 11.0 g/dL in all trimesters of pregnancy and during the postpartum period (strong, low).
A hemoglobin concentration cutoff of less than 11 g/dL should be universally adopted in all settings and populations for the diagnosis of anemia in pregnancy (strong, low).
Anemia in pregnancy is classified based on severity as mild (10–10.9 g/dL), moderate (7.0–9.9 g/dL), and severe (< 7.0 g/dL) (conditional, low).

1.2 Iron supplementation and prevention of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy

5 To prevent iron deficiency anemia, all pregnant women should receive a daily oral iron supplementation of 30–60 mg of elemental iron (strong, high). A higher daily dose of 60 mg is recommended in settings where iron deficiency anemia is a significant public health problem affecting 40% or more of pregnant women, and in women at increased risk of iron deficiency, including women with previous anemia, multiple pregnancy, short interpregnancy interval of less than 1 year, and vegetarians (conditional, low).
6 Women who do not tolerate daily oral iron due to side effects should receive intermittent supplementation with 120 mg of elemental iron weekly (strong, high). Intermittent supplementation can also be considered in settings where iron deficiency anemia affects less than 20% of the pregnant population (conditional, low).
7 To maximize absorption, women should be advised to take oral iron in the morning on an empty stomach (1 h before eating or 2 h after), and 1 h before or 2 h after inhibitors of iron absorption such as calcium, proton pump inhibitors, antacids, thyroxine, tea, coffee, milk, soy, and eggs (conditional, low).
8 Administration of vitamin C with oral iron to enhance iron absorption can be considered (conditional, low). Evidence for this is conflicting and more studies are needed to make definite recommendations.

TABLE 3
Crude and adjusted mean differences of vegetarian and vegan children relative to omnivore children in bone, cardiovascular, and body iron status outcomes 1

Table 3 also shows that diet was associated with differences in several CVD risk factors. Overall, vegans had on average lower total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and hs-CRP than omnivores. Further adjustment for presumed mediators (height, fat and lean mass; model 3) only slightly attenuated the magnitude of the differences, except for HDL cholesterol, in which the difference increased. The differences in hs-CRP remained after excluding 3 outlier values (> 1 mg/dL).

Vegetarians, in contrast, had lower average total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, but the magnitude of the difference in relation to omnivores was smaller than that of the vegans. They also had higher average fasting glucose, VLDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Model 3 shows strengthened differences between omnivores and vegetarians in glucose, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. In this model, the difference in total cholesterol in vegetarians attenuated to the null, and HOMA-IR became significantly higher. There was no evidence of differences in insulin concentrations, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis (cIMT), IGFBP-3, IGF-1 concentrations, or molar ratio of IGF-1/IGFBP-3 concentrations or across the 3 diet groups.

Mean differences between diet groups in selected serum indicators of iron status are presented in the last part of Table 3. Vegans had lower concentrations of mean RBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin. Vegetarians did not differ in any of the iron status indicators from the omnivores.

Multiple imputation using chained equations was applied to deal with missing values that affected some explanatory variables (birth weight, gestational age, maternal prepregnancy BMI, average CPM, paternal education and height, religion, FMI, LMI), under the assumption of missing at random.

Separate to the above, in secondary analyses, ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to compute marginal predictions of the prevalence of several categories of inadequate status of vitamin B-12, iron, and cholesterol in the 3 diet groups. Pairwise comparisons of the marginal predictions were used. The ordinal logistic models included the indicators of diet group and confounders identified by the respective DAGs for the corresponding continuous outcomes. Probable and possible vitamin B-12 deficiency were defined as < 148 pmol/L and 148–258 pmol/L, respectively. Iron deficiency anemia was defined, following WHO, as mild [hemoglobin (HBG) 11.0–11.4 g/dL], moderate (HBG 8.00–10.9 g/dL), or severe (HBG < 8 g/dL). Cutoffs for abnormally low serum ferritin concentrations were defined as < 15 µg/L, following WHO, that identified it as depleted iron stores. Pediatric LDL cholesterol values were classified, following the Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents, as high (≥ 130 mg/dL), borderline (110–129 mg/dL), or acceptable (< 110 mg/dL) and HDL cholesterol as low (< 40 mg/dL), borderline (40–45 mg/dL), or acceptable (> 45 mg/dL). The results of complete case (CC) and multiple imputation (MI) analyses were compared. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata release 13.1 (StataCorp). A 2-sided P value of 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance.

### Food, plant food, and vegetarian diets in the US dietary guidelines: conclusions of an expert panel [^111fSjVQ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

We summarize conclusions drawn from a panel discussion at the "Fifth International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition" about the roles of and emphasis on food, plant food, and vegetarianism in current and future US dietary guidelines. The most general recommendation of the panel was that future dietary guidelines, following the lead of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, should emphasize food-based recommendations and thinking to the full extent that evidence allows. Although nutrient-based thinking and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) may help ensure an adequate diet in the sense that deficiency states are avoided, the emphasis on DRIs may not capture many important nutritional issues and may inhibit a focus on foods. More generally, in the context of the conference on vegetarian nutrition, this report focuses on the history and structure of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, on various plant food-oriented recommendations that are supported by literature evidence, and on mechanisms for participating in the process of forming dietary guidelines. Among recommendations that likely would improve health and the environment, some are oriented toward increased plant food consumption and some toward vegetarianism. The literature on health effects of individual foods and whole lifestyle diets is insufficient and justifies a call for future food-oriented research, including expanding the evidence base for plant-based and vegetarian diets. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's role should be carried forward to creation of a publicly accessible icon (eg, the current pyramid) and related materials to ensure that the science base is fully translated for the public.

11 IRON

Iron deficiency anemia is one of the most common health problems in women of reproductive age, affecting over one‐third of pregnant women globally. This anemia results in adverse outcomes such as increased maternal and infant mortality, mental and physical development issues, and impaired cognitive function in newborn babies. Dietary interventions are more effective in the long term for prevention of iron deficiency anemia than supplementation and have advantages in relation to compliance, long‐term acceptability, and cost‐effectiveness. In high‐risk populations however, supplementation may be more effective at reaching guideline‐specified optimal levels of iron in the diet. The FIGO Nutrition Checklist addresses iron intake and anemia screening. In relation to diet, it asks about the intake of meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, and fruit. Of these, red meat and other meat or fish are sources of the highly bioavailable heme iron. Other sources of iron include egg yolks, dark green leafy vegetables, beans, peas, dried fruit, and fortified cereals, although these are predominantly non‐heme iron, which is a less bioavailable form. Consuming iron‐containing foods alongside those with vitamin C, such as citrus juice or fruit or vegetables, may enhance iron absorption. Similarly, those at risk of deficiency should avoid eating foods that will inhibit iron absorption with the iron‐containing food. These include foods that are high in calcium, tannins, or phytates. The recommendations for iron vary between countries, with some including supplementation (Table 2). A morning dose of supplement may promote optimal response and alternate days could be considered to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Effectiveness of provision of animal-source foods for supporting optimal growth and development in children 6 to 59 months of age [^114Srfgv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adequate nutrients early in life promote cognitive development and are critical for proper growth and functioning. The effect of individual nutrients consumed through food is often not the same as consuming the same nutrients in supplementary form due to 'food synergy', the biological and chemical interrelations that occur between nutrients. Animal-source foods, such as eggs, meat, fish, and dairy, are energy dense and contain multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids with high bioavailability. The benefits of animal-source foods may include higher food synergy relative to fortified foods as well as decreasing dependence on external suppliers of fortified foods.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of animal-source foods compared to any other feeding interventions or no intervention in improving growth and developmental outcomes in children aged 6 to 59 months.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 18 other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2018. We also contacted authors and known experts in the field for assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished data, and searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and websites of relevant organizations, for other studies that may not have been captured by our electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any duration, where children between 5 months and 59 months (6 years) of age were provided with an animal-source food (e.g. consumption of milk, meat, or eggs), prepared with any cooking method, compared with any intervention or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Study characteristicsWe included 6 studies that analyzed data from 3036 children aged 5 to 50 months. The studies were conducted in China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, the USA, and Zambia, and lasted between 5 and 12 months. Three studies were funded, in part, by government entities; one study was supported by a nonprofit organization. Two studies did not report a funding source. Three studies compared the effects of feeding an animal-source food with a fortified (iron or iron and zinc), or unfortified cereal; two used a control group with no intervention; one compared a meat-based diet to a dairy-based diet. The types of animal-source foods tested included yogurt, eggs, cheese, lyophilized (freeze-dried) beef product, ground and frozen pork, puréed and jarred beef with gravy or pork, and powdered whey protein. We judged four studies to be at unclear risk of bias overall; three studies because they were funded by an industry with a plausible interest in the outcome of the intervention; and one study because there was insufficient information to assess five of the seven bias 'Risk of bias' domains. We judged two of the six studies to be at high risk of bias overall; one study because there was significant baseline imbalance in length-for-age z scores (LAZ) between groups and evidence of selective reporting; the other study because there there was both a significant baseline imbalance in LAZ and weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) between groups, and a large-scale social media campaign that may have influenced care received at home in the control group. Key resultsAnimal-source foods versus cereal-based foods or no interventionFive studies (2972 children) measured change in linear growth with either height-for-age z scores (HAZ) or LAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in HAZ and LAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. Two studies (2380 children) reported a decline in LAZ in both groups. In one study (1062 children) there was no difference between the groups in the rate of decline; in the other (1318 children) the decrease in LAZ was significantly smaller in the intervention group. Five studies (2972 children) measured weight gain using WAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in WAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. In two studies (2380 children), WAZ decreased in both groups. In one of these studies (1318 children), the decrease in the intervention group was significantly smaller than in the control group. In the other study (1062 children), there was no difference between the groups. Three studies (1612 children) reported impacts on all-cause morbidity, but metrics were inconsistent between studies. One study with yogurt (402 children) reported a significant reduction in duration and incidence of diarrhea and upper respiratory infections in the intervention group. One study with eggs (148 children) reported a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhea in the intervention group, but this may have been due to cultural associations with eggs and gastrointestional problems. There were no other significant differences in fever, respiratory infections, or skin conditions between groups. The third study (1062 children) found no differences between intervention and control groups across morbidity measures. No studies reported data on anemia. Meat-based diet versus dairy-based dietOne study (64 children) measured change in LAZ and WAZ in infants fed either a meat-based diet or dairy-based diet. There was a significant increase in LAZ among infants consuming the meat-based diet and a significant decrease in LAZ among infants consuming a dairy-based diet. WAZ increased in both groups, with no significant difference between groups. The study did not assess all-cause morbidity or anemia. Quality of the evidenceWe rated the quality of the evidence as very low overall due to baseline imbalances between intervention and control groups, high heterogeneity in meta-analysis, and imprecision due to wide confidence intervals and inconsistent direction of effects. We have little confidence in the results; further research is likely to change the estimate of magnitude and direction of treatment effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the limited quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effects of the provision of animal-source food versus cereal products or no intervention on the growth or development of children. More adequately powered trials with deliberately selected animal-source foods are needed.

### Addressing nutrient shortfalls in 1-to 5-year-old Irish children using diet modeling: development of a protocol for use in country-specific population health [^115s92Po]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Shortfalls in predicted iron intakes (relative to the EFSA AR value), modeled to exclude high-sugar fortified breakfast cereals and processed meat, were evident in ≥ 1- to ≤ 3-y-olds (Figure 3 B). Including 30 g of unprocessed red meat 2 out of the 4 d modeled (translating to 3 d/wk) and 20–30 g of low-sugar iron-fortified breakfast cereals (< 18 g sugar/100 g; ≥ 12 mg Fe/100 g) 3 out of the 4 d modeled (translating to 5 d/wk) resolved iron intake shortfalls (EFSA AR) in ≥ 1- to ≤ 3-y-olds, except those at ≤ 25 th percentile growth level (Figure 3C). For these children, an additional 4 mg Fe as either an iron-fortified milk (FUF or DYC) (Table 4) or a supplement (data not shown) resulted in sufficient iron intakes (EFSA AR). Of note, iron intakes in ≥ 1- to ≤ 3-y-olds modeled on the "Follow-up Formula + Fortified drink" scenario (Table 4) and all scenarios modeled for ≥ 4- to ≤ 5-y-olds (Table 5) achieved the EFSA RDA value (7 mg). The lacto-ovo vegetarian scenario provided comparable intakes of iron for ≥ 1- to ≤ 3-y-olds (Table 4) and significantly higher intakes for ≥ 4- to ≤ 5-y-olds (Table 5).

### Maternal diet, nutritional status and infant birth weight in Malaysia: a scoping review [^111JKZLF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Dietary intake of pregnant women in terms of micronutrients

Hamid and colleagues reported earlier that among rural pregnant women, 37% displayed serum vitamin D deficiency in their third trimester, potentially resulting in low vitamin D concentrations in breast milk at birth. Meanwhile, among urban pregnant women, hypocalcemia was shown in 26% women who were mostly deficient in vitamin D levels. Both vitamin D and calcium complement each other and are important in maintaining bone health and reducing preeclampsia risk during pregnancy. It has been demonstrated that pregnant women consuming less than two glasses of milk per day were at higher risk of developing hypocalcemia. Higher intake of dietary vitamin D has been shown to be associated with a lower odds of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. Emphasizing greater intake of vitamin D through diet could help as Malaysian women have been studied to have low sunlight exposure resulting in higher vitamin D deficiency. Hence, efforts to supplement or improve dietary sources of vitamin D are needed as vitamin D has been established to help reduce pregnancy complications.

Multiple reviews have consistently revealed that suboptimal intakes of vitamin D, calcium and iron, are widely prevalent among pregnant women especially in those from low- and middle-income countries. More studies are warranted to explore the role of sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake towards vitamin D status among pregnant women.

The majority of pregnant women in Malaysia were not able to achieve their recommended intake for iron through the diet, which is the same scenario as observed in other countries. This is particularly evident in Indian ethnicity, exposing Indian women to a higher risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy. This could be due to the common practices of vegetarian diet among Indians who do not receive adequate iron-rich foods in their meals. Poverty, low education, and lack of iron-rich sources in food intake are often regarded as reasons to poor dietary intake of iron among women in developing nations. Thus, education on iron-rich food intake and iron supplementation compliance should be emphasized for improved maternal iron status. Previous study demonstrated the effectiveness of Health Belief Model-based educational intervention in improving the compliance to iron supplementation among pregnant women, highlighting the potential of reducing anemia through encouraging preventive healthy behaviours. Currently, there is a lack of studies focusing on obesity with anemia among pregnant women although obesity is an important risk factor for anemia. As such, with the rising trend of obesity in Malaysia, future research should focus on studying the role of obesity in anemia development among pregnant women.

### Dietary intakes and nutritional adequacy of Australians consuming plant-based diets compared to a regular meat-eating diet [^1119GVzB]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Despite the healthful nature of plant-based diets (PBDs) there is potential for nutritional inadequacies. This study aimed to compare dietary intakes and nutritional adequacy in Australians following PBDs compared a regular meat-eating diet.

Subjects/Methods

A cross-sectional study of adults (n = 240) aged 30-75yrs, habitually following dietary patterns for ≥ 6 months; vegan, lacto-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian or regular meat-eater (n = 48 per group). Dietary intakes were assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires and dietitian-administered diet histories. Multivariable regression adjusted for sex, age, BMI, race, energy intake and physical activity.

Results

Compared to regular meat-eaters, vegans and lacto-ovo vegetarians had significantly lower intakes of protein (4–5 EN%), saturated fat (2–4 EN%), trans fat, cholesterol, vitamin B 12, iodine, riboflavin, niacin, sodium, and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA), and higher carbohydrate (5–7 EN%), fibre, vitamin E, folate, magnesium, iron, and n-6PUFA, whereas, pesco-vegetarians and semi-vegetarians had intermediate intakes. Individuals following PBDs consumed significantly more daily serves of vegetables (1–1.5 serves), fruit (1 serve, vegan only), legumes/nuts (0.5–1 serves), and less discretionary choices (0.5–1 serves) compared to regular meat-eaters. All dietary patterns were adequate in protein, exceeded in fat, inadequate in carbohydrate and met recommended serves of fruit and vegetables, but not grains. Inadequate serves were observed for meat/poultry/eggs/beans/nuts among PBDs except pesco-vegetarians, and dairy among semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters. Vegans and lacto-vegetarians were inadequate in vitamin B12, LCn-3PUFA, iodine, and in addition calcium among vegans, iodine in pesco-vegetarians, and LCn-3PUFA in semi-vegetarians and regular meat-eaters.

Conclusion

PBDs, while higher in beneficial nutrients and wholefood groups than regular meat-eaters, may lead to nutritional inadequacies if not planned appropriately.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^1127wX1w]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Impact of vegetarian diet on serum immunoglobulin levels in children [^1125ApoR]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nutrition plays an important role in immune response. We evaluated the effect of nutrient intake on serum immunoglobulin levels in vegetarian and omnivore children.

Methods

Serum immunoglobulin levels and iron status were estimated in 22 vegetarian and 18 omnivore children. Seven-day food records were used to assess the diet.

Results

There were no significant differences in serum IgA, IgM, and IgG levels between groups of children. Serum immunoglobulin levels were lower in vegetarian children with iron deficiency in comparison with those without iron deficiency. In the vegetarians, IgG level correlated positively with energy, zinc, copper, and vitamin B(6) intake. In the omnivores, these correlations were stronger with IgM level.

Conclusions

Despite negligible differences in serum immunoglobulin levels between vegetarian and omnivore children, the impact of several nutrient intakes on IgM and IgG levels differed between groups. Low iron status in vegetarian children can lead to decreased immunoglobulin levels.

### Nutritional and health benefits of dried beans [^115YtV7n]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Dried beans (often referred to as grain legumes) may contribute to some of the health benefits associated with plant-based diets. Beans are rich in a number of important micronutrients, including potassium, magnesium, folate, iron, and zinc, and are important sources of protein in vegetarian diets. In particular, they are among the only plant foods that provide significant amounts of the indispensable amino acid lysine. Commonly consumed dried beans are also rich in total and soluble fiber as well as in resistant starch, all of which contribute to the low glycemic index of these foods. They also provide ample amounts of polyphenols, many of which are potent antioxidants. Intervention and prospective research suggests that diets that include beans reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, favorably affect risk factors for metabolic syndrome, and reduce risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes. The relatively low bean intakes of North Americans and northern Europeans can be attributed to a negative culinary image as well as to intestinal discomfort attributable to the oligosaccharide content of beans. Cooking practices such as sprouting beans, soaking and discarding soaking water before cooking, and cooking in water with a more alkaline pH can reduce oligosaccharide content. Promotional efforts are needed to increase bean intake.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^113nbj9r]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2.1 Dietary strategies

There are two forms of dietary iron: heme iron which is more effectively absorbed and non‐heme iron which has about two thirds of the bioavailability of heme iron. Foods containing heme iron include red meats, poultry and fish whereas non‐heme iron is mostly present in plant‐based foods such as legumes, fortified grains, dark chocolate, nuts, seeds and dark leafy vegetables. About 10%–15% of total dietary iron intake comes from heme iron; however, due to its higher bioavailability, it can contribute to up to 40% of total iron absorbed. Moreover, enhancers and inhibitors of iron absorption also affect the bioavailability of iron. Heme iron and ascorbic acid increase absorption of iron from non‐heme sources, while phytates (grains and legumes), polyphenols (tea and coffee), calcium (dairy products and supplements) and animal protein (milk protein, egg protein and albumin) inhibit its absorption.

Therefore, a dietary strategy to improve iron status may include the consumption of a combination of heme iron‐containing foods and non‐heme iron sources coupled with foods high in ascorbic acid, which enhances non‐heme iron absorption. Foods high in iron absorption inhibitors should be consumed separately from an iron‐containing meal. One study in adult women demonstrated that a 1 h time interval between an iron‐containing meal and tea consumption attenuated the inhibitory effect of the tea. Commonly, a 1–2 h interval between iron‐containing meal and iron inhibitors is considered sufficient to minimise the negative impact of iron inhibitors on iron absorption. Importantly, iron absorption is inversely correlated with iron status. Generally, absorption of heme iron is unaffected by an individuals' iron status, while absorption of non‐heme iron is higher in individuals with decreased body iron stores.

### The absorption of iron from whole diets: a systematic review [^111tU9B8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Absorption factors are required to convert physiologic requirements for iron into Dietary Reference Values, but the absorption from single meals cannot be used to estimate dietary iron absorption.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a systematic review of iron absorption from whole diets.

Design

A structured search was completed by using the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from inception to November 2011. Formal inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and data extraction, validity assessment, and meta-analyses were undertaken.

Results

Nineteen studies from the United States, Europe, and Mexico were included. Absorption from diets was higher with an enhancer (standard mean difference: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.85; P = 0.001) and was also higher when compared with low-bioavailability diets (standard mean difference: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.41; P < 0.0001); however, single inhibitors did not reduce absorption (possibly because of the limited number of studies and participants and their heterogeneity). A regression equation to calculate iron absorption was derived by pooling data for iron status (serum and plasma ferritin) and dietary enhancers and inhibitors from 58 individuals (all from US studies): log[nonheme-iron absorption, %] = -0.73 log[ferritin, μg/L] + 0.11 [modifier] + 1.82. In individuals with serum ferritin concentrations from 6 to 80 μg/L, predicted absorption ranged from 2.1% to 23.0%.

Conclusions

Large variations were observed in mean nonheme-iron absorption (0.7–22.9%) between studies, which depended on iron status (diet had a greater effect at low serum and plasma ferritin concentrations) and dietary enhancers and inhibitors. Iron absorption was predicted from serum ferritin concentrations and dietary modifiers by using a regression equation. Extrapolation of these findings to developing countries and to men and women of different ages will require additional high-quality controlled trials.

### Increasing CO₂ threatens human nutrition [^113MXybn]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Dietary deficiencies of zinc and iron are a substantial global public health problem. An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies, causing a loss of 63million life-years annually. Most of these people depend on C3 grains and legumes as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Here we report that C3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.

### Dietary iron intake, body iron stores, and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hRLth]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Heme iron exists only in meat and meat products, where it occurs in the form of hemoglobin and myoglobin, whereas non-heme iron is present in both plant and animal foods. The regulation of the intestinal iron absorption is crucial because there is no physiologic mechanism for excretion of iron. Although heme iron is not the predominant form of dietary iron, it more readily absorbed than non-heme iron. In addition, absorption of heme iron does not change with increasing dose, is less substantially affected by iron status than non-heme iron, and is not greatly influenced by other components in diet. Therefore, heme iron contributes about 50% of the total bioavailable iron in the typical western diet. In an elderly population of the Framingham Heart Study, non-heme iron was the major source (mean 93%) of iron, yet heme iron intake was significantly and positively associated with serum ferritin concentration, whereas non-heme iron intake did not significantly influence serum ferritin concentration. Similar positive association between heme iron intake and serum ferritin concentration was reported from the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study. Therefore, the distinct effects of heme iron and non-heme iron intake on risk of T2DM that we found in the present study may be, at least partly, explained by the differences in bioavailability of the different iron types and their effects on body iron stores.

### What makes a plant-based diet? a review of current concepts and proposal for a standardized plant-based dietary intervention checklist [^116n1aeH]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Reducing meat and animal product consumption is an effective way to adopt a healthier diet while simultaneously strengthening environmental protection. To promote plant-based eating patterns, however, large and well-designed public health campaigns are necessary. Physicians play an important role in this process as they are often seen as nutrition authorities and are well-positioned to deliver dietary advice and nutritional prescriptions. Another discussion about the value of plant-based nutrition could be a significant barrier to this development. Unfortunately, inconsistent usage of the term "plant-based diet" in the absence of clear definition of the term may exactly lead to such a discussion.

Therefore, it appears of utmost importance that future plant-based dietary interventions declare exactly to which extent animal products were included. A "plant-based dietary intervention" that includes a semi-vegetarian or even an omnivorous diet may lead to "false-negative" results (no health benefits) when compared to a plant-based diet that includes a vegan or lacto-ovo-vegetarian regimen.

Plant-based diets (and vegetarian diets in particular) are nowadays generally perceived in a positive light. Dissonance about the term and its content should be resolved quickly to avoid potentially arising confusion in the general public. Otherwise, there will be a call for additional research examining the beneficial health and environmental effects of diets low (or free) in animal products. This call would inevitably translate into a substantial loss of time in the race against the growing burden of chronic non-communicable diseases and human-made environmental destruction. Thus, the authors of this paper finally argue that the term 'plant-based diet' should only be used in conjunction with a clear definition and a thorough description of its content.

This review has several strengths and limitations that warrant further consideration. The methodology employed in this review included a simple but easily reproducible search strategy with clearly defined in- and exclusion criteria. The outcome-independent search strategy revealed a broad spectrum of different studies. The biggest strength of this review is probably that its findings are of high translational value and highly applicable to future research studies in the field of plant-based nutrition. Our review revealed a problematic trend that requires a fast solution to allow for a better comparison between studies. The provided checklist may serve as an important guide to facilitate this process.

### Trends and drivers of change in the prevalence of anaemia among 1 million women and children in India, 2006 to 2016 [^116cjU35]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Changes in immediate determinants accounted for a low percentage of the overall anaemia reduction from 2006 to 2016. Weekly meat and fish consumption increased by 7–9 pp from 2006 to 2016, an increase that accounted for an estimated 1%–3% anaemia reduction after adjusting for covariates such as household SES and women's education. Given that ~60% of the Indian population does not consume meat and fish, and that even among the non-vegetarian population, meat and fish are consumed sparingly, increased meat and fish consumption would only be a solution in the fraction of the population that consumes and can afford these relatively expensive foods. Dark green leafy vegetables, consumed far more frequently than meat and fish in this population, are a good source of nutrients that may benefit anaemia. However, the daily consumption of dark green vegetables has reduced substantially (16 pp, from 64% to 48%) in the last decade. Moreover, we could not find evidence to suggest that a large-scale intervention to increase dark green vegetable consumption would be effective in terms of reducing anaemia. Since the diet of this population is largely cereal based, cereal fortification and biofortification are important solutions to anaemia, with special consideration to use modern biotechnological methods to both improve micronutrient content and reduce phytate content in cereals. However, iron fortification of wheat provided through public programmes in India has had limited success in reducing anaemia given implementation challenges, including poor distribution channels and poor targeting. Newer fortification legislation in India, which engages a wider network of food manufacturers and the private sector, may have more far-reaching impacts. Both low BMI (undernourished) and high BMI (overweight and obesity) are considered as risk factors for iron deficiency, one known cause of anaemia. In our study, improvement in maternal low BMI contributed to a small proportion of anaemia reduction in their children (2%). Although overweight and obesity has increased in the last 10 years, the data do not support the notion that increasing BMI is associated with increasing anaemia at the population level. This is likely due to the multifactorial nature of anaemia, with iron deficiency only being one factor. Further, while programmes such as the public distribution system deliver foods that provide energy, and therefore may increase BMI, these same foods are not necessarily dense in other nutrients that would reduce anaemia.

### Adherence to the planetary health diet index and correlation with nutrients of public health concern: an analysis of NHANES 2003–2018 [^113235x4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diet, climate change, and human health are closely interrelated. Global dietary shifts are associated not only with increased risk of obesity, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, but also with intensive production methods that contribute to environmental degradation via greenhouse gas emissions, land use change, land degradation, and water pollution. A 2021 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that climate change and its effects on human health are accelerating, and there is a dire need for solutions across a variety of sectors, including the food system.

To better align nutrition and sustainability targets, in 2019, the EAT- Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health introduced the "universal healthy reference diet", also referred to as the Planetary Health Diet (PHD) to reduce the burden of diet-related disease and minimize the environmental impact of feeding human populations. The reference diet provides 2500 kcal/d and adequate macro- and micronutrient intakes and was evaluated against planetary boundaries for 6 key environmental indicators.

In the United States, components of the EAT- Lancet universal healthy reference diet have been compared with components of the Healthy Eating Index — which measures adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) — but only for individual food groups rather than comparing the 2 dietary patterns overall. To the best of our knowledge, no study has applied a diet index based on evidence from the EAT- Lancet Commission to describe the health and sustainability of diets in a nationally representative United States population, nor how adherence to such a diet has changed in recent years, because awareness of the environmental impact of diet has grown.

The EAT- Lancet Commission recommends a dietary pattern high in plant-based foods, including protein foods, and low in animal-sourced products, such as meat, fish, and dairy. The typical United States diet, on the other hand, is characterized by a high intake of animal-sourced foods and a low intake of beans, legumes, and other iron-rich plant sources. Indeed, meat and poultry are the top food sources of dietary iron in the United States.

### Hepcidin and iron status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing induction therapy with vedolizumab or infliximab [^111iL5gV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

This is the first study to focus on changes in hepcidin levels and its regulatory stimuli during induction therapy with 2 different types of biologicals in a well-defined cohort of patients with IBD. However, this study has several limitations. First, data on endoscopic disease activity were not available for all included patients. We had to rely on clinical or biochemical disease activity assessment, which lacked standardized objective substantiation. In addition, at least a third of the study population was pretreated with different doses of local or systemic steroids. Second, due to the retrospective nature of the study, we did not have data on whether patients were receiving iron therapy through their general practitioner or over-the-counter supplements, as well as their dietary intake of iron (ie, whether patients ate a vegetarian or vegan diet). Also, we defined ID at baseline based on ferritin, an acute-phase protein that can be elevated during inflammation, which might have influenced predictive analysis in this study. Third, several measured biomarkers showed concentrations in the lower ranges of the calibration curves (Supplementary Table 2) that could be associated with somewhat lower accuracy, but all reported data were obtained from samples within the dynamic range of the assays and above the detection limits of the assays used. Finally, a larger sample size would have allowed us to establish more reliable subgroup analyses and to adjust for confounding variables more extensively.

Despite the limitations, this study shows that inflammation without ID can increase hepcidin levels, but ID is still the primary determinant of low hepcidin levels, even in an inflammatory state. In addition, this study provides evidence that treating IBD-associated intestinal inflammation will reduce hepcidin levels and, consequently, might improve enteral iron absorption because elevated hepcidin is associated with enteral iron malabsorption in patients with IBD. Interestingly, hepcidin has been shown to predict (non)responsiveness to iron therapy in patient populations beyond IBD. To this date, all biochemical parameters used in routine care and clinical trials to evaluate iron indices are affected by inflammation or show poor diagnostic value, which complicates the interpretation of iron stores and study findings. Hence, prospective studies focusing on iron status based on bone marrow aspirates or oral iron absorption tests are necessary to assess and validate a cutoff value for hepcidin in order to differentiate between ID and functional iron restriction in patients with IBD. In addition, prospective studies should evaluate whether hepcidin can predict response to intravenous or enteral iron therapy that would prove hepcidin useful not only in the diagnosis, but also in the treatment of ID and iron restriction, which could render hepcidin a considerably more valuable biomarker than ferritin.

Calcium in vegetarian and vegan adults — a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated little difference in calcium intake between vegetarians and omnivores with intake near recommended levels; however, intake was significantly lower in vegans. To ensure adequate calcium intake, vegetarians and especially vegans should consume at least 2 to 3 daily servings of calcium-rich foods with good bioavailability, and bioavailability is influenced by phytate and oxalate intake.

### Effects of an enhanced iron dense foods offering in the daily meals served in geriatric institutions on measures of iron deficiency anemia [^113wtaVY]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is common in the elderly and is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The WHO defined anemia as a hemoglobin level lower than 13 g/dl in men and less than 12 g/dl in women. The highest prevalence of anemia was found in geriatric patients and nursing home residents. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of anemia in the elderly.

Iron deficiency anemia evolves when the body-stored iron is low. Iron deficits can be remedied with iron supplements or iron dense foods. However, for rectifying iron deficits, iron dense foods should be preferred. Even more, as it is well established that low oral iron intake and low bioavailability of dietary iron are the prime culprits for the development of iron deficiency anemia. In addition, scientific reference bodies like the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee of the United States emphasize the importance of healthy, food-based dietary patterns.

Iron dense foods can be of plant or animal origin. The bioavailability of iron from plant based foods is broadly discussed since its digestibility is affected by several dietary components like phytic acid or polyphenols, but primarily as iron here is not heme bound. Good sources for plant-based iron are for example lentils, pine seeds, nuts or linseed and oat bran. By contrast, the bioavailability of heme iron of animal-based foods is much better. It is absorbed more readily via integral membrane transporter proteins in the intestinal cells. Heme iron rich foods are meats or meat products like sausages and giblets such as liver.

The reported iron deficit in geriatric patients results from the fact that catering services offers iron dense foods less frequently and if they do, the offered amount is generally not adapted to the nutritional needs of the patients. It is also well documented that a food consumption lower than the recommended daily intake is common in geriatric institutions and therefore the quality of the daily meals should be adapted to the nutritional needs. Particularly as a low food-consumption may cause an imbalance between nutrient intake and dietary requirements. Therefore, beside the failure to absorb iron or an interaction of iron with drugs, an imbalance between iron intake and need may lead to iron deficiencies, to a decreased hemoglobin synthesis and finally to iron deficiency anemia.

### Dietary intakes and nutritional adequacy of Australians consuming plant-based diets compared to a regular meat-eating diet [^112a6abg]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Zinc and iodine are two trace minerals that are typically consumed in lower amounts when following vegan and LOV dietary patterns and their bioavailability is also affected by the presence of inhibitors such as phytic acid. Intake of zinc was adequate and comparable across groups, aligning with a previous cross-sectional study and large observational studies. Noteworthy, in one study LOVs, vegans and PVs males were slightly below recommendations and LOVs males in another study. Additional analyses not shown in results tables of the current study also show all males following PBDs fell just below (5–20%) recommended intakes. The Australian dietary guidelines recommend vegetarians to consume 50% more zinc as majority of plant-based protein-rich foods (also rich in zinc) are absorbed at a lower rate than animal proteins, and this combined with higher consumption of legumes and grains may exceed the phytate zinc ratio (15:1). None of the individuals adhering to a PBD met the additional 50% requirement for zinc.

### Dietary iron intake, body iron stores, and the risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112h8S5P]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, higher heme iron intake and higher body iron stores were significantly associated with a greater risk of T2DM in this meta-analysis of prospective studies. It may therefore be necessary to reconsider the dietary reference values for iron, in particular in countries where most of the population ingest sufficient iron and/or are at risk of iron overload. Dietary total iron, non-heme iron, or supplemental iron intakes were not significantly associated with T2DM risk. Moderately increased ferritin levels may be useful for clinical and public health identification of high-risk groups for T2DM; however, further studies are warranted.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^116WnYAQ]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Vegetarian/vegan and DASH dietary patterns — diabetes mellitus nutrition and supplements: Vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with lower risk of DM and, in persons with DM, have been shown to lower glycemia and improve CVD risk factors, and low-fat vegetarian or vegan diets may be associated with additional improvements in metabolic parameters. The DASH can also be used safely in persons with DM and produce improvements in glycemia, BP, and lipids. In the absence of underlying deficiency, routine supplementation of vitamins and minerals is not necessary; a healthful eating meal plan can generally provide sufficient micronutrients. Metformin administration can cause vitamin B12 deficiency; clinicians should be wary of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in persons on metformin who develop peripheral neuropathy or anemia, and supplementation doses of 1000 μg orally per day can be effective.

### Cardiometabolic effects of omnivorous vs vegan diets in identical twins: a randomized clinical trial [^116vwVjs]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial of healthy, adult identical twins, the 8-week change in LDL-C level — the primary outcome — was significantly lower for twins receiving the vegan diet compared with twins receiving the omnivorous diet. Insulin levels and weight were also significantly lower among the twins on the vegan diet from baseline to 8 weeks. Vegan-diet participants had total lower protein intake as a percentage of calories, lower dietary satisfaction, lower intake of dietary cholesterol, but higher intake of vegetable servings and intake of dietary iron. Vegans had lower intake of vitamin B 12, yet serum vitamin B 12 levels were not statistically different than omnivores at 8 weeks, likely because of preserved stores. Long-term vegans are typically encouraged to take a cyanocobalamin (vitamin B 12) supplement.

Two factors may have limited our opportunity to observe additional differences between the study groups. First, participants in both diet groups were assigned to eat a healthy diet, usually healthier compared with their prestudy dietary pattern demonstrated by increased vegetable intake and decreased refined grains intake. Even the omnivorous participants improved their diet quality during the 8-week intervention (eg, increased vegetables and whole grain intake and decreased added sugars and refined grains). Second, within both groups, potential differences in clinical end point changes may have been blunted because participants were healthy at baseline. For example, participants' mean baseline LDL-C level was 114 mg/dL, leaving minimal room for participants to improve through diet alone. Nonetheless, we observed significant improvements in 3 clinical outcomes (LDL-C, insulin, and weight) among the vegan participants.

Incorporating vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns as part of outpatient care emphasizes collaborative, paced adoption tailored to client interest. The text notes "For individuals who may benefit from and express interest in this option, an RDN can collaborate with them to progressively incorporate more plant-based foods into their daily menus", and "RDNs and NDTRs can make clients aware that vegetarian dietary patterns are more about more than avoiding animal products, and, like all diets, should be planned appropriately to avoid common nutrient deficiencies". Practical counseling includes that "RDNs can take cues from clients about an appropriate pace for introducing new habits (eg, starting with a meatless Monday dinner) and incorporating new foods that appeal to the client (eg, meal alternatives on a breakfast sandwich)", acknowledging that "Clients may be interested in increasing the number of plant-based meals in their diet but may not yet be ready or interested in transitioning to a full vegetarian/vegan dietary pattern", and that "Adapting suggested interventions to clients' needs will allow for a higher likelihood of success and satisfaction".

### Modeled healthy eating patterns are largely constrained by currently estimated requirements for bioavailable iron and zinc-a diet optimization study in French adults [^117MQ2yH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Healthier dietary patterns involve more plant-based foods than current Western diets rich in animal products containing high amounts of bioavailable iron and zinc. Little consideration is given to the bioavailability of iron and zinc when studying healthy eating patterns.

Objectives

Our aim was to determine whether currently estimated requirements for bioavailable iron and zinc limit the identification of healthier dietary patterns.

Methods

Using dietary data from a representative French survey and multicriteria nonlinear optimization, we identified diets that maximize health criteria based on food-based dietary guidelines and concomitantly depart only minimally from the observed diet while complying with all nutrient reference values either strictly (nonflexible optimization) or by allowing bioavailable iron and zinc below the current reference values, but to a limited extent (flexible optimization). Using a comparative risk assessment model, we estimated the resulting impact on cardiometabolic and colorectal cancer mortality/morbidity and changes to iron-deficiency anemia.

Results

Under nonflexible optimization, reference values for bioavailable iron and zinc were the most binding of the 35 nutrient constraints, and modeled diets displayed considerable redistributions within grains and meat. With flexible optimization, modeled diets were healthier as they contained less red meat and more whole-grain products, but would increase iron-deficiency anemia to 5.0% (95% CI: 3.9%, 6.4%). Globally, in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), as the loss due to anemia would represent < 30% of the gain otherwise made on chronic diseases, adding flexibility in the iron and zinc reference values would result in a further 18% decrease in the disease burden from 84,768 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 81,066, 88,470] to 99,689 (95% UI: 95,787, 103,591) DALYs averted.

Conclusions

Currently estimated requirements for bioavailable iron and zinc proved to be critical factors when modeling healthy eating patterns. Considering lower reference values enables the identification of diets that are apparently healthier overall.

Micronutrient interactions — An imbalance of micronutrients can result from the consumption of high-dose or simultaneous nutrient supplements; for example, high-dose iron supplements can decrease zinc absorption and high amounts of zinc can inhibit copper absorption, and the absorption of both heme- and nonheme iron is inhibited by calcium supplements, but the clinical significance of iron status is unclear.
