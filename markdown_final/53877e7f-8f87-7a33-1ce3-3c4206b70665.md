## Question

A 7-year-old boy is brought to the allergy clinic by his parents due to recurrent episodes of urticaria and facial swelling occurring within 30 minutes of eating peanuts. His past medical history is unremarkable, and there is no family history of atopy. The physical examination is normal. The clinician considers allergy testing to confirm the diagnosis. The clinic has access to both skin prick testing and specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing. The parents ask whether both tests are necessary, and how the results should be interpreted.

Based on current EAACI guidelines, how should the clinician approach specific allergy testing in this patient, and how should the results be interpreted in the context of his clinical history?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach specific allergy testing in a 7-year-old with recurrent urticaria and facial swelling within 30 minutes of eating peanuts, including whether both skin prick testing and serum-specific IgE are necessary and how to interpret results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability from the clinical history. Then, I should verify what EAACI 2023 recommends as first-line testing. Next, I will examine whether a second test adds value or is redundant. After that, I need to interpret positive and negative results in light of the history and consider when to add component testing. Finally, I should confirm when an oral food challenge is indicated and outline management implications, including epinephrine and follow-up planning [^b21c5c4b] [^17e4bb86].

> Let me first confirm the pretest probability. Recurrent urticaria and facial swelling within 30 minutes of peanut ingestion is a classic IgE-mediated presentation, so the pretest probability is high; I should not jump to conclusions, but this pattern strongly supports IgE-mediated peanut allergy and justifies targeted testing rather than screening panels or no testing at all [^c0dfa251] [^78e3ee29].

> Next, I should review what EAACI 2023 says about first-line testing. EAACI recommends skin prick testing as the first-line evaluation in suspected IgE-mediated food allergy, with serum-specific IgE as an alternative when SPT is contraindicated or unavailable; importantly, both tests demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergy, and must be interpreted in the context of the history [^b21c5c4b] [^17e4bb86].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering both tests. I initially thought both SPT and serum-specific IgE might be necessary to increase diagnostic certainty, but wait, let me verify whether that adds value in a high-pretest-probability case. EAACI does not recommend routine dual testing; choosing one appropriate test based on availability and patient factors is acceptable, and repeating a different modality is generally reserved for inconclusive results or when planning an oral food challenge, so ordering both upfront is usually redundant unless there is a specific reason to cross-check results [^b21c5c4b] [^17e4bb86].

> I will now examine how to interpret results. A positive SPT or detectable peanut-specific IgE supports sensitization and, in the setting of a convincing history, supports a clinical diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy; however, I should double-check that we do not overcall severity, because test magnitude correlates with probability of allergy, not with reaction severity, and guidelines advise against using SPT wheal size, whole-peanut sIgE, or component levels to predict future severity [^a756c7c3] [^e3dd9511] [^8e54abbf] [^c7154f73].

> But wait, what if the test is negative despite a compelling history? I need to ensure I do not falsely reassure. Negative results can occur in non–IgE-mediated mechanisms or due to technical issues, and EAACI cautions that negative SPT or sIgE should be interpreted carefully when the history is suggestive; in such discordant cases, I should reconsider the diagnosis, review the history again, and consider additional evaluation, including component testing or, if appropriate, a supervised oral food challenge to clarify the diagnosis [^013c5884] [^17e4bb86].

> Next, I should review when to add component testing. If the initial test is inconclusive or if I need to refine the diagnosis, Ara h 2 can be helpful because it has higher specificity than whole-allergen tests; however, I should confirm that Ara h 2 is not used as a screening tool and that no single cutoff predicts clinical allergy with certainty, so component results must still be integrated with the history and, when needed, an oral food challenge [^1238e8fc] [^d09dd53d] [^80160d50].

> I need to check when an oral food challenge is indicated. Even with supportive testing, an OFC remains the reference standard to confirm or refute allergy when the diagnosis is uncertain or when planning reintroduction; in this case, if the history is unequivocal and testing is positive, an OFC may be deferred, but if there is any doubt or if the family seeks definitive confirmation, a supervised graded OFC should be offered with shared decision-making and appropriate safety protocols [^17e4bb86] [^cbb4737f].

> Let me consider management implications now. If the diagnosis is confirmed, I should prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors, provide a written emergency action plan, and arrange education on recognition and treatment of reactions; I should also counsel that test results do not predict severity, so strict avoidance and readiness to treat anaphylaxis are essential regardless of wheal size or sIgE level [^c26ba7e9] [^8e54abbf].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up planning. Pediatric food allergy should be reassessed periodically because tolerance can develop; EAACI recommends periodic re-evaluation, and in practice many clinicians reassess every 1–2 years in childhood, with less frequent testing if sensitization remains high, while remembering that peanut and tree nut allergies often persist and may require longer-term management [^9defb841] [^708d4fe6] [^1d5e8d78].

In a 7-year-old with recurrent urticaria and facial swelling within 30 minutes of peanut ingestion, **EAACI recommends skin prick testing (SPT) as first-line** [^b21c5c4b] to confirm IgE-mediated peanut allergy, given the high pretest probability [^c0dfa251]. Serum-specific IgE to peanut is an **acceptable alternative** [^045ad823] if SPT is unavailable or contraindicated. Both tests demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergy, so results must be interpreted in the context of the history [^17e4bb86]; **both tests are not routinely required** [^054be94c]. If results are inconclusive or discordant with the history, consider Ara h 2 component testing [^1238e8fc] or an oral food challenge [^17e4bb86] to confirm the diagnosis [^51174302].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm clinical history

Confirm the clinical history by documenting **symptom timing, reproducibility, and severity** to establish a high pretest probability of IgE-mediated peanut allergy [^6f9fbd21] [^78e3ee29].

---

### Step 2: first-line diagnostic testing

Perform **skin prick testing (SPT)** as the first-line test [^b21c5c4b] because of its high sensitivity and practical advantages [^78c00945]. If SPT is unavailable or contraindicated, obtain **serum-specific IgE to peanut** as an alternative [^045ad823] [^17e4bb86].

---

### Step 3: interpretation of test results

Interpret results in the clinical context: a positive SPT or specific IgE supports sensitization but **does not alone confirm clinical allergy** [^74c6adeb] [^17e4bb86]. Negative results in the face of a convincing history warrant caution and may require further evaluation [^013c5884].

---

### Step 4: additional testing if indicated

If results are inconclusive or discordant with the history, consider **Ara h 2 component testing** [^1238e8fc], which has higher specificity and can improve diagnostic accuracy [^80160d50]. If uncertainty persists, proceed to a **supervised oral food challenge (OFC)** [^17e4bb86], the gold standard for confirming or excluding clinical allergy [^51174302].

---

## Necessity of both skin prick testing and serum IgE testing

Routine use of both SPT and serum IgE is **not recommended** [^notfound]; either test alone is usually sufficient when interpreted in the clinical context [^17e4bb86]. Dual testing may be considered when results are inconclusive or when planning an OFC, but it is not standard practice [^notfound].

---

## Interpretation of test results in clinical context

| **Test result** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Positive SPT or specific IgE | Sensitization likely; clinical allergy probable given history | Confirm diagnosis; avoid peanut; prescribe epinephrine autoinjector [^c26ba7e9] |
| Negative SPT or specific IgE | Sensitization unlikely; clinical allergy possible but less likely | Re-evaluate history; consider alternative diagnoses or further testing if suspicion remains high [^013c5884] |
| Positive Ara h 2 | High specificity for peanut allergy | Strongly supports diagnosis; consider avoiding OFC if history is convincing [^80160d50] |
| Negative Ara h 2 | Low likelihood of peanut allergy | Consider OFC to confirm tolerance [^17e4bb86] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **SPT first-line**: Perform SPT to confirm IgE-mediated peanut allergy, given the high pretest probability [^b21c5c4b] [^c0dfa251].
- **Serum IgE alternative**: Use serum-specific IgE if SPT is unavailable or contraindicated [^045ad823] [^17e4bb86].
- **Interpret in context**: Positive tests support sensitization but do not confirm clinical allergy; interpret results with the clinical history [^74c6adeb] [^17e4bb86].
- **Additional testing**: Consider Ara h 2 or OFC if results are inconclusive or discordant with the history [^1238e8fc] [^51174302].
- **Both tests not routine**: Dual testing is not routinely required; use clinical judgment to decide when both are needed [^notfound].

---

This approach aligns with EAACI guidance and ensures accurate diagnosis while avoiding unnecessary testing and dietary restrictions [^b21c5c4b] [^17e4bb86].

Peanut allergy evaluation — pretest probability and appropriate test use emphasizes history-first assessment and selective testing. To properly use allergy diagnostic tests, the pretest probability must be determined via comprehensive history. Persons who can eat peanut without developing symptoms are by definition not allergic and should not be tested for peanut allergy. Testing should be conducted as narrowly as possible, clinicians should avoid searching for sensitization to other "common" allergens, and serologic tests can be ordered as single items rather than panels. When pretest probability is very low, even discretely sensitive and specific tests leave posttest probability low; certain factors such as moderate or severe eczema or a history of other food allergy may elevate pretest probability above that of the general population.

### Should younger siblings of peanut allergic children Be screened for peanut allergy? [^b628ad73]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The role of screening younger siblings of peanut allergic children with allergy testing before peanut introduction is controversial. Although certain guidelines note some value in screening this population, it is not a direct indication in the recent National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guideline. Some studies suggest that siblings of peanut allergic children are at increased risk of peanut allergy, whereas others note that delayed ingestion or mislabeling of allergy in these children may be the main factors accounting for this increased risk. The low risk of severe reaction with first ingestion and risks of pre-emptive testing must be balanced against data suggesting that families are reluctant to introduce peanut in siblings without testing. The goal of this article is to critically appraise the debated issues in this topic, providing a practical approach to this common clinical dilemma.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^9f4ce3d8]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guideline provides recommendations for the management of IgE-mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Following the confirmation of IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosis, allergen avoidance and dietary advice (with support of a specialised dietitian, if possible) together with the provision of a written treatment plan, education on the recognition of allergic symptoms and prescription of medication including adrenaline using an auto-injector are essential. Patients with significant anxiety and requirement for coping strategies may benefit from support from a clinical psychologist. As immunomodulatory interventions, omalizumab is suggested for treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy in children from the age of 1 and adults; and oral allergen-specific immunotherapy is recommended for children and adolescents with peanut allergy and suggested for milk and egg allergies (generally after 4years of age for milk and egg). Sublingual and epicutaneous immunotherapy are suggested for peanut allergy but are not yet available at the point of care. Future research into disease modifying treatments for IgE-mediated food allergy are highly needed, with standardised and patient-focused protocols and outcomes.

Peanut allergy diagnostic testing — Recommendation 2A states, for a single diagnostic test, the panel "suggest[s] in favor of Ara h 2 diagnostic testing" because Ara h 2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy by more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratios; however, Ara h 2 has the greatest specificity but lower sensitivity than skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE), and in high prior probability patients clinicians may use Ara h 2, SPT, or sIgE to confirm the diagnosis; this is a conditional recommendation with low certainty of evidence.

### Urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis… [^7f0b6efc]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Urticaria and, to a lesser extent, angioedema are common occurrences in the pediatric population. There are multiple causes of acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Most causes are benign, although they can be worrisome for patients and their parents. An allergist should evaluate acute urticaria and/or angioedema if there are concerns of an external cause, such as foods or medications. Chronic urticaria and angioedema can severely affect quality of life and should be managed aggressively with antihistamines and immunomodulators if poorly controlled. Chronic symptoms are unlikely to be due to an external cause. Anaphylaxis is a more serious allergic condition characterized by a systemic reaction involving at least 2 organ systems. Anaphylaxis should be initially managed with intramuscular epinephrine. Patients who experience anaphylaxis should be evaluated by an allergist for possible causes; if found, avoidance of the inciting antigen is the best management.

All patients should also be given an epinephrine autoinjector and an action plan. Foods are a common cause of anaphylaxis in the pediatric population. New evidence suggests that the introduction of highly allergic foods is safe in infancy and should not be delayed. In addition, the early introduction of foods such as peanuts may help prevent the development of food allergies.

### EAACI food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: diagnosis and management of food allergy [^d60daed3]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Food allergy can result in considerable morbidity, impact negatively on quality of life, and prove costly in terms of medical care. These guidelines have been prepared by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology's (EAACI) Guidelines for Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Group, building on previous EAACI position papers on adverse reaction to foods and three recent systematic reviews on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of food allergy, and provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. While the primary audience is allergists, this document is relevant for all other healthcare professionals, including primary care physicians, and pediatric and adult specialists, dieticians, pharmacists and paramedics. Our current understanding of the manifestations of food allergy, the role of diagnostic tests, and the effective management of patients of all ages with food allergy is presented. The acute management of non-life-threatening reactions is covered in these guidelines, but for guidance on the emergency management of anaphylaxis, readers are referred to the related EAACI Anaphylaxis Guidelines.

### EAACI guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^17e4bb86]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guideline provides recommendations for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Food allergy diagnosis starts with an allergy-focused clinical history followed by tests to determine IgE sensitization, such as serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) and skin prick test (SPT), and the basophil activation test (BAT), if available. Evidence for IgE sensitization should be sought for any suspected foods. The diagnosis of allergy to some foods, such as peanut and cashew nut, is well supported by SPT and serum sIgE, whereas there are less data and the performance of these tests is poorer for other foods, such as wheat and soya. The measurement of sIgE to allergen components such as Ara h 2 from peanut, Cor a 14 from hazelnut and Ana o 3 from cashew can be useful to further support the diagnosis, especially in pollen-sensitized individuals. BAT to peanut and sesame can be used additionally. The reference standard for food allergy diagnosis is the oral food challenge (OFC). OFC should be performed in equivocal cases. For practical reasons, open challenges are suitable in most cases. Reassessment of food allergic children with allergy tests and/or OFCs periodically over time will enable reintroduction of food into the diet in the case of spontaneous acquisition of oral tolerance.

Limitations and prior-probability effects — reactions may occur in at risk children with undetectable food specific IgE, with approximately 20% having clinical reactions when egg or peanut specific IgE is < 0.35 kIU/L, and most patients have a positive prick/puncture test result. Interpretation incorporating history shows that at peanut specific IgE of 2 kIU/L, children with a history of peanut allergic reaction had approximately a 50% chance of tolerating peanut, whereas among children with a positive test but no history of a reaction, 50% tolerated peanut at 5 kIU/L; a peanut wheal size of 3 mm had a positive predictive value of 61% in children with atopic dermatitis versus 28% in children at low risk.

Box 1. GRADE questions — diagnostic testing for peanut allergy is structured around PICO questions that ask whether testing should be performed in adults and children with a history of suspected peanut allergy who are requesting evaluation; among skin prick test (SPT), serum-specific IgE (sIgE) to whole peanut, or Ara h 2, which test yields the highest diagnostic accuracy by the more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratio; whether adding peanut component testing to either SPT or sIgE to whole peanut increases diagnostic accuracy; and whether diagnostic test results can predict the severity of a future allergic reaction.

Peanut allergy severity prediction by sensitization — there is no relationship indicating that the degree of sensitization is predictive of the underlying severity of the reaction to peanut using either skin or serologic markers, whole allergen or component; this includes any single test, component, or panel of tests, and clinicians are advised against interpreting that sensitization (at the thresholds evaluated) will predict whether someone will have a severe reaction or not, with no clearly predictive relationship at the cutoff levels reported.

Documentation of food allergy — diagnosis and testing states that "An accurate diagnosis of food allergy is needed before a management plan can be developed". Key points include that "Although any food may trigger an allergic reaction, most serious reactions are attributable to peanut, tree nuts (eg, cashew, walnut, etc), milk, egg, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, and sesame", and that "Reactions may include anaphylaxis, which, in rare cases, may be fatal". Establishing diagnosis "includes a clinical history consistent with IgE-mediated allergy (eg, urticaria, wheezing with onset shortly after ingestion) and confirmation of the relevant allergen with testing (eg, allergy skin-prick tests or food-specific serum immunoglobulin E [IgE] testing)", while "an isolated positive test alone is not diagnostic, and tests do not reliably predict severity". It adds that "Clinician-supervised oral food-challenge testing may be needed to confirm a diagnosis", and that confirmation is beneficial because "food-allergen avoidance and management of allergic reactions create significant burdens for patients and their families", with "Diagnosis is reviewed in another AAP clinical report".

Pre-introduction testing in infants who have never ingested peanut — Peanut skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) testing "is poorly specific and in general should not be used as a screening tool" for someone who has never eaten peanut; under early introduction guidelines, "infants younger than 6 months of age who have severe eczema and/or egg allergy" may have SPT and peanut sIgE utilized, "There is no current role for component testing in this context", and when very high peanut-specific IgE is present without ingestion history, "OFC should be considered" to diagnose.

Peanut allergy diagnosis — choice of single diagnostic test — For a single-test approach in suspected peanut allergy, "We suggest in favor of Ara h 2 diagnostic testing in a patient presenting for evaluation of suspected peanut allergy for which a single diagnostic test is to be used, as Ara h 2 would provide the best diagnostic accuracy as determined by virtue of more optimal positive/negative likelihood ratios". The recommendation further notes that "Ara h 2 has the greatest specificity, it has lower sensitivity than SPT and sIgE", and "in a patient with a high prior probability, the clinician may use Ara h 2, SPT, or sIgE to confirm the diagnosis of peanut allergy".

### A consensus approach to the primary prevention of food allergy through nutrition: guidance from the American academy of allergy, asthma, and immunology; American college of allergy, asthma, and immunology; and the Canadian Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology [^0c4b2f6f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

Preassessment, oral food challenge, and test use — guidance indicates that in infants undergoing preassessment, there may be contexts where the risk to benefit ratio supports offering an oral food challenge (OFC) regardless of the size of the positive skin test result or level of sIgE to verify the presence of an allergy. The rationale includes the known issues with false-positive test results, specifically poor specificity and imperfect positive predictive values, when tests are obtained without an ingestion history, and a low rate of severe reactions on initial consumption from available infant OFC data; decisions about an OFC should be a shared decision made by the clinician with the family after discussion of risks and benefits. The panel cautions that the predictive cutoffs used in the NIAID guidelines were adapted from one unselected Australian population of slightly older children and may potentially lack some generalization to the age group in question at screening, and strongly emphasizes that food allergen panel testing for other allergens in association with assessing peanut sensitization is not recommended because of poor positive predictive value and potential for inappropriate diagnosis.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^bfacdac4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy diagnosis — 2020 practice parameter update highlights that immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated peanut allergy has an estimated prevalence of between 0.2% and 4.5%, with U.S. prevalence appearing to have tripled in a recent 10-year period while the United Kingdom has plateaued; peanut allergy carries substantial economic and psychologic burden, is often severe and usually lifelong, and is a leading cause of food-related anaphylaxis. The parameter emphasizes that a test indicating peanut sensitization (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity, and it makes recommendations — based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses — for clinicians evaluating children and adults, focusing on when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^fefc802c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People suspected of food allergy require accurate diagnosis to help manage their condition and get appropriate care. Recent guidelines summarize the latest evidence about diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy, but they do not describe how to address practical issues when testing. There is a need to translate guideline recommendations into a practical common pathway that all centers dealing with food allergy can use.

Objective

The Global Network of Centres of Excellence for Anaphylaxis & Food Allergy — ANAcare developed a pathway to help clinicians apply the latest diagnostic guidelines and overcome implementation challenges.

Methods

The pathway is based on reviewing guidelines, research and clinical feedback, plus consensus of experts from 13 countries.

Results

We describe practical tips that clinicians can use when taking a detailed clinical history and testing people with suspected IgE-mediated food allergy. Tests for IgE sensitization such as skin prick tests and specific IgE are readily available and inexpensive. However, they only demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergic disease, so they need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. A controlled oral food challenge may also be needed to identify which foods the person is experiencing reactions to and what quantity can be tolerated.

Conclusions

Correct diagnosis is essential to support individualized management. Allergy centers around the world can use our practical tips to help avoid under- and overdiagnosis.

Question 1 recommendations — We suggest in favor of diagnostic (SPT or sIgE) testing for peanut allergy when patients have physician-judged high pretest probability of peanut allergy or prior to an OFC for patients with moderate pretest probability, with shared decision making; this is a conditional recommendation with very low certainty of evidence.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^56034b0e]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — clinical history, pretest probability, and likelihood ratios are emphasized for interpreting food allergy skin tests. A calculated likelihood ratio applies prior probability and test results to improve diagnostic accuracy, defined as the ratio of the odds that a patient with results in a specified range has the disease divided by the odds that they do not, with the formula "likelihood ratio = sensitivity/(1 − specificity)" for a positive test result. When the likelihood ratio is known, a pretest probability is estimated and a nomogram can be used to determine the posttest probability, and although likelihood ratios are not calculated for most tests of food allergy, the concept has practical implications. In an example, three patients with different histories each have prick/puncture testing to peanut showing a 4-mm wheal with modest sensitivity (approximately 50%) and good specificity (approximately 90%); in patient 1 with recurrent anaphylaxis the high prior probability "virtually 100%" means the result confirms reactivity and no food challenge should be undertaken; in patient 2 with atopic dermatitis a modest test may reflect clinical reactivity in only approximately half of patients and warrants confirmation or additional testing; and in patient 3 with headaches the result is most likely of no clinical concern because the pretest probability is essentially zero. One test can provide pretest probability for another test, and face-to-face evaluation of the patient is essential and remote practice of allergy is not valid.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^61985564]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guideline provides recommendations for the management of IgE‐mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Following the confirmation of IgE‐mediated food allergy diagnosis, allergen avoidance and dietary advice (with support of a specialised dietitian, if possible) together with the provision of a written treatment plan, education on the recognition of allergic symptoms and prescription of medication including adrenaline using an auto‐injector are essential. Patients with significant anxiety and requirement for coping strategies may benefit from support from a clinical psychologist. As immunomodulatory interventions, omalizumab is suggested for treatment of IgE‐mediated food allergy in children from the age of 1 and adults; and oral allergen‐specific immunotherapy is recommended for children and adolescents with peanut allergy and suggested for milk and egg allergies (generally after 4 years of age for milk and egg). Sublingual and epicutaneous immunotherapy are suggested for peanut allergy but are not yet available at the point of care. Future research into disease modifying treatments for IgE‐mediated food allergy are highly needed, with standardised and patient‐focused protocols and outcomes.

Ara h 2 component testing — cutoffs and use — has no single reliable threshold; there is no universal cutoff value for any component (including Ara h 2) to predict peanut allergy, and overall, use of Ara h 2 at present is limited to a corroborating role when there is sufficient pretest probability, not as a screening test where there is no pretest probability.

Peanut allergy sensitization and positive test thresholds — Allergic sensitization is denoted by detectable allergen‑specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) via serologic assay or skin prick test (SPT), with SPT most commonly considered "positive" when the wheal is 3 mm greater than a glycerinated saline control; for serum specific IgE, instruments typically have a detection limit of 0.1 kU_A/L and an upper reporting limit of 100 kU_A/L, with historical reporting conventions shifting from < 0.35 kU_A/L (positive ≥ 0.36 kU_A/L) to using 0.1 kU_A/L as the reporting limit (positive 0.11 kU_A/L), creating interpretive uncertainty for 0.11 kU_A/L to 0.35 kU_A/L, and many clinicians would only consider sensitization > 0.7 kU_A/L as clinically relevant; class designations are reported but have no clinical relevance, and in this document "positive" refers to detection of sensitization, which is unequivocally not synonymous with a clinical diagnosis that requires a demonstrated clinical history of allergy plus detectable sensitization or, in very circumscribed instances, very high levels of sensitization in certain infants with particular preexisting risk factors who have never ingested peanut previously.

Regarding medical management for food allergy, more specifically with respect to specific immunotherapy, peanut allergy, GA²LEN 2022 guidelines recommend to offer oral immunotherapy under specialist supervision with standardized, evidence-based protocols using peanut products (or licensed pharmaceutical products, where appropriate) to increase the amount of peanut tolerated while on therapy in selected pediatric patients (aged > 4 years) with clinically diagnosed, severe, IgE-mediated peanut allergy.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^01baae20]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the burden of disease and the consequences of a diagnosis of peanut allergy, it is important that peanut allergy be accurately diagnosed so that an appropriate treatment plan can be developed. However, a test that indicates there is peanut sensitization present (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity. This practice parameter addresses the diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy, both in children and adults, as pertaining to 3 fundamental questions, and based on the systematic reviews and meta-analyses, makes recommendations for the clinician who is evaluating a patient for peanut allergy. These questions relate to when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

Peanut allergy testing exceptions and screening — "A major possible exception are high-risk infants being considered for early peanut introduction". As per the 2017 NIAID addendum, "a special case may be made for screening infants who present with egg allergy and/or severe atopic dermatitis in the first 4 to 6 months of life", and "the prior NIAID guideline did recommend strong consideration that either peanut SPT or sIgE testing be obtained and interpreted before early peanut introduction in these infants"; however, "outside of this very circumscribed group, there are otherwise no formal recommendations that any individual should have peanut SPT or sIgE testing before peanut introduction specifically as a screening measure for risk assessment". Historically, testing children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis to "the 8 common food allergens" without prior consumption "has largely fallen out of favor", diagnostic tests used as screening are "poorly specific" and of "optimal utility in the setting of high pretest probability", and "Asymptomatic, clinically irrelevant peanut sensitization is not uncommon".
