## Question

Can you have thyroid symptoms with normal thyroid levels and thyroid nodule

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with a thyroid nodule and normal thyroid function tests can still have thyroid-related symptoms, and how to interpret and manage that scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "normal thyroid levels" mean biochemically and clinically. Then, I should verify the spectrum of symptoms that thyroid nodules can cause independent of hormone status. Next, I will review guideline-based evaluation steps to ensure we are not missing subtle dysfunction. After that, I need to consider subclinical thyroid disease and its symptom profile. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified management plan and counseling points, making sure I double-check where symptoms fit into the algorithm and when to escalate workup or treatment.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical definition of "normal thyroid levels". In practice, this typically means a serum TSH within the laboratory reference range with normal free T4 (and T3 when measured), indicating euthyroidism; guidelines emphasize TSH as the primary screening test and only add free hormones when TSH is abnormal or central hypothyroidism is suspected, so "normal levels" generally implies a normal TSH and normal free T4, with T3 reserved for specific contexts [^1178Nh11] [^113n1g4j] [^1161o8QZ].

> Now, I need to check what symptoms a thyroid nodule can cause irrespective of hormone status. Large or anatomically unfavorably located nodules can produce compressive symptoms such as dysphagia, globus sensation, positional dyspnea, and dysphonia, and these symptoms correlate with nodule/goiter size and substernal extension; importantly, they can occur even when TSH and free T4 are normal, reflecting mechanical effects rather than endocrine dysfunction [^114PHATd] [^1122J1AK] [^112PYsD4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "thyroid symptoms" only meaning hormone excess or deficiency. I should confirm that guidelines explicitly separate local compressive or cosmetic complaints from systemic thyrotoxic or hypothyroid symptoms; indeed, major guidelines direct clinicians to elicit compressive features and cosmetic concerns as part of the history and to use ultrasound risk stratification to guide management, underscoring that symptoms can be present with normal TSH and free T4 [^115eb5ud] [^113PpyVy] [^115SAYF7].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation to ensure we are not missing subtle dysfunction. Wait, let me verify the first step: all patients with a thyroid nodule should have a serum TSH measured; if TSH is normal, a radionuclide scan is not indicated initially, and management proceeds with thyroid ultrasound and selective fine-needle aspiration based on sonographic risk and size thresholds, whereas a suppressed TSH should prompt free hormone testing and a radionuclide scan to assess for autonomy [^1178Nh11] [^116cF3op] [^114Axijg].

> I will now examine the possibility of subclinical thyroid disease, because "normal" TSH does not always exclude clinically meaningful dysfunction. Subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3) are well-defined entities; symptoms can be minimal or nonspecific, but some patients report fatigue, mood changes, or mild autonomic symptoms, and the clinical significance and treatment thresholds remain individualized and debated, especially when TSH deviations are mild [^111trvZ4] [^117KaLMs] [^111w8THM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a normal TSH absolutely rules out any thyroid-related symptoms; but I should correct that assumption. Even with a normal TSH, patients can have compressive symptoms from nodule size or location, and they may also have subclinical disease with borderline TSH values and subtle symptoms; conversely, absence of symptoms does not exclude malignancy, so symptom-status and labs must be interpreted alongside ultrasound risk features and clinical context [^112xDBRA] [^115eugpj] [^114PHATd].

> Let me consider the practical management implications when symptoms coexist with a nodule and normal thyroid tests. I should confirm that ultrasound risk stratification (ATA or ACR TI-RADS) guides whether fine-needle aspiration is needed; for benign cytology with persistent compressive symptoms, options include surveillance, surgery for large or growing nodules, or minimally invasive ablation in selected cases, while levothyroxine suppression is not recommended for euthyroid patients with nodular disease and should be avoided outside specific indications [^112PYsD4] [^115Qw5to] [^116MLzT7] [^115TTSmv].

> But wait, what if the "symptoms" are actually due to subclinical hyperthyroidism from an autonomously functioning nodule that we might miss if we do not check TSH correctly or rely on symptoms alone? I should double-check that guidelines still anchor the workup to TSH: if TSH is low, proceed to free hormones and a radionuclide scan to identify hyperfunctioning nodules, which are rarely malignant and may explain hypermetabolic symptoms even when free T4/T3 are initially "normal" or high-normal [^1178Nh11] [^1139dtto] [^112fdxjj].

> Next, I should review how to counsel patients about symptom expectations. I need to ensure the patient understands that most thyroid nodules are benign and that compressive symptoms relate to size and location rather than cancer risk; shared decision-making is important, and for many low-risk nodules, observation with interval ultrasound is appropriate, reserving intervention for significant symptoms, growth, or higher-risk features on imaging or cytology [^112PYsD4] [^116Q5nJk].

> In summary, I should confirm that yes, patients with thyroid nodules can have thyroid-related symptoms despite normal thyroid function tests: compressive symptoms from mass effect are common and mechanistically independent of hormone levels, and a subset may have subclinical thyroid disease with mild or nonspecific symptoms; guideline-concordant evaluation with TSH, targeted free hormone testing when indicated, ultrasound risk stratification, and selective FNA addresses both malignancy risk and symptom etiology while avoiding unnecessary treatment such as levothyroxine suppression in euthyroid nodular disease [^112PYsD4] [^116cF3op] [^115Qw5to] [^116MLzT7].

---

Yes, patients can have **thyroid symptoms** (such as compressive symptoms or mild hyper/hypothyroid features) with a thyroid nodule and normal thyroid function tests. Most nodules are **benign and asymptomatic**, but larger nodules or those near critical structures can cause dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, or discomfort even when TSH, free T4, and free T3 are normal [^112PYsD4] [^114PHATd]. Symptom severity correlates with nodule size and location, not thyroid hormone levels. If symptoms are present, **evaluate with ultrasound and consider fine-needle aspiration** if indicated; routine thyroid hormone therapy is not recommended for euthyroid patients with nodules [^116MLzT7] [^115Qw5to].

---

## Thyroid symptoms associated with normal thyroid function tests

Patients with thyroid nodules may experience symptoms even when thyroid function tests are normal. These symptoms are typically related to the **size, location, and growth rate** of the nodule rather than thyroid hormone levels [^1122J1AK].

---

### Compressive symptoms

Compressive symptoms result from the nodule's mass effect on adjacent structures, including the trachea, esophagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. These symptoms can occur regardless of thyroid hormone levels and include:

- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing due to esophageal compression [^notfound].
- **Dyspnea**: Shortness of breath or positional breathing difficulties, particularly with substernal or large nodules [^114PHATd].
- **Hoarseness or voice changes**: Resulting from compression or involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve [^notfound].
- **Globus sensation**: A feeling of a lump or foreign body in the throat, commonly associated with larger nodules (> 3 cm) [^114PHATd].

---

### Localized discomfort or pain

Some patients may experience localized discomfort or pain associated with the nodule, particularly if there is **rapid growth, hemorrhage, or inflammation**. These symptoms are typically unrelated to thyroid hormone levels.

---

### Cosmetic concerns

Visible neck swelling or cosmetic deformity may cause significant psychological distress and affect quality of life, even in the absence of thyroid dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Prevalence of thyroid nodules and associated symptoms

Thyroid nodules are common, with a prevalence of approximately 4–7% in the general population by palpation and up to 50–68% by ultrasound or autopsy studies [^116pnehY] [^116ZnosJ]. Most nodules are **benign and asymptomatic**, but a significant proportion may cause symptoms due to their size or location [^112PYsD4].

| **Study** | **Prevalence of thyroid nodules** | **Symptomatic nodules (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Framingham study | 4–7% (palpation) | 10–20% |
| Ultrasound/autopsy studies | 50–68% | 20–30% |

---

## Clinical evaluation of thyroid nodules with normal thyroid function tests

When evaluating a patient with a thyroid nodule and normal thyroid function tests, the following steps are recommended:

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Essential initial test to assess thyroid function [^1178Nh11].
- **Free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3)**: Only if TSH is abnormal or if central hypothyroidism is suspected [^113n1g4j].
- **Thyroid antibodies**: Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies if TSH is elevated, to evaluate for autoimmune thyroid disease [^1161o8QZ].

---

### Imaging studies

Ultrasound is the **primary imaging modality** to assess nodule size, location, and characteristics, and to guide further management [^112PYsD4]. Radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy is indicated when TSH is low or suppressed, to assess nodule functionality and differentiate hyperfunctioning ("hot") nodules from nonfunctioning ("cold") nodules [^1178Nh11] [^1139dtto].

---

### Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)

FNAB is indicated for nodules with suspicious ultrasound features, larger size (> 1 cm), or those causing significant compressive symptoms, even if thyroid function tests are normal [^116ZnosJ].

---

## Management strategies for symptomatic thyroid nodules with normal thyroid function tests

Management depends on nodule size, symptoms, and risk of malignancy. Options include **observation with periodic ultrasound** for small, asymptomatic nodules and **surgical intervention** for large nodules causing significant compressive symptoms or cosmetic concerns, or when malignancy is suspected. Minimally invasive procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) may be considered for select patients [^115TTSmv]. Routine thyroid hormone therapy (levothyroxine) is not recommended for euthyroid patients with thyroid nodules, as it does not reduce nodule size or prevent recurrence and may cause harm [^115Qw5to] [^116MLzT7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize individualized management based on patient symptoms, nodule characteristics, and risk of malignancy. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) recommend **obtaining serum TSH as the initial test** and using ultrasound and FNAB to guide further evaluation and management [^1178Nh11] [^113pHpMM].

---

Patients with thyroid nodules can experience symptoms such as compressive effects, localized discomfort, and cosmetic concerns even when thyroid function tests are normal. These symptoms are typically related to nodule size and location rather than thyroid hormone levels. Evaluation and management should be individualized based on clinical presentation, imaging findings, and patient preferences [^112PYsD4].

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

### Thyroid nodules: diagnostic evaluation based on thyroid cancer risk assessment [^114Fch8i]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common and can be detected by sensitive imaging in more than 60% of the general population. They are often identified in patients without symptoms who are undergoing evaluation for other medical complaints. Indiscriminate evaluation of thyroid nodules with thyroid biopsy could cause a harmful epidemic of diagnoses of thyroid cancer, but inadequate selection of thyroid nodules for biopsy can lead to missed diagnoses of clinically relevant thyroid cancer. Recent clinical guidelines advocate a more conservative approach in the evaluation of thyroid nodules based on risk assessment for thyroid cancer, as determined by clinical and ultrasound features to guide the need for biopsy. Moreover, newer evidence suggests that for patients with indeterminate thyroid biopsy results, a combined assessment including the initial ultrasound risk stratification or other ancillary testing (molecular markers, second opinion on thyroid cytology) can further clarify the risk of thyroid cancer and the management strategies. This review summarizes the clinical importance of adequate evaluation of thyroid nodules, focuses on the clinical evidence for diagnostic tests that can clarify the risk of thyroid cancer, and highlights the importance of considering the patient's values and preferences when deciding on management strategies in the setting of uncertainty about the risk of thyroid cancer.

Thyroid nodule definition and evaluation thresholds — nonpalpable and palpable nodules of the same size carry similar malignancy risk, and evaluation is generally size-based: nonpalpable nodules have "the same risk of malignancy as do sonographically confirmed palpable nodules of the same size", and "only nodules > 1 cm should be evaluated", although "there may be nodules < 1 cm that require further evaluation because of clinical symptoms or associated lymphadenopathy". The guideline adds that pursuing all very small cancers "is deemed to cause more harm than good", and overall "most thyroid nodules are low risk, and many thyroid cancers pose minimal risk to human health and can be effectively treated".

### Thyroid nodules [^11267SRE]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on thyroid nodules:

- Definition: Thyroid nodules are solid growths in the thyroid gland that are radiologically distinct from surrounding thyroid parenchyma.
- Pathophysiology: Thyroid nodules may be benign (follicular adenoma, Hurthle cell adenoma, colloid cyst, simple or hemorrhagic cyst, lymphocytic thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, infectious processes) or malignant (malignancy of follicular or C-cell origin, papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, Hurthle cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, or malignancy metastatic to the thyroid).
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is > 65%. The estimated incidence of thyroid nodules in the US is around 0.1% per year.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for thyroid nodules include advanced age, female sex, tobacco use, higher BMI, metabolic syndrome, iodine deficiency, history of radiation exposure, elevated levels of TSH, increased thyroid volume, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.
- Disease course: Large thyroid nodules can result in dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Thyroid nodules may also become malignant over time.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules is around 4–6.5%.

Biochemical incomplete response to therapy — There are adequate data to make a strong recommendation regarding the intensity and duration of TSH suppression in this category; it encompasses patients with low serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (median nonstimulated Tg 3.6 ng/mL) and initial American Thyroid Association (ATA) low risk (16%–24%), ATA intermediate risk (47%–64%), or ATA high risk (18%–21%); the risk of developing structurally identifiable disease relates to the magnitude of Tg elevation and rate of rise of anti-Tg antibody; and, based on weak data and expert opinion, the authors state, "we recommend a goal TSH of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for the majority of patients with a biochemical", referencing this biochemical incomplete response to therapy category.

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management [^116ZnosJ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

### Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults [^113v1iw2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A thyroid nodule is a discrete lesion within the thyroid gland that might be palpable and is ultrasonographically distinct from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma. Thyroid nodules are more common as age increases and occur more frequently in women. Benign thyroid nodules often cause pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. In China and many other countries, doctors use Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) to treat thyroid nodules.

Objectives

To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules in adults.

Search Methods

Review authors searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP information (a Chinese database), WANFANG Data (a Chinese database), the Chinese Conference Papers Database and the Chinese Dissertation Database (all searched up to April 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing CHM or CHM plus levothyroxine versus levothyroxine, placebo or no treatment in adults with benign thyroid nodules.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation), with differences resolved by consensus.

Main Results

We included one randomised trial involving 152 participants with a randomisation ratio of 2:1 (CHM vs no treatment). The trial applied adequate sequence generation; however, allocation concealment was unclear. Duration of treatment was three months, and follow-up six months. Our a priori defined outcomes of interest (i.e. nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health-related quality of life; all-cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; and socioeconomic effects) were not investigated in the included study. Thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) serum levels were normal in both groups before and after the trial was conducted. No adverse events were reported (low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Firm evidence cannot be found to support or refute the use of Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of thyroid nodules-the clinician's perspective [^115SAYF7]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem encountered in an endocrine practice. More and more thyroid nodules are now being detected on unrelated imaging studies, leading to an increased diagnosis of low-risk thyroid cancers. There is therefore a greater emphasis on risk assessment based on clinical and sonographic features to avoid morbidity secondary to unnecessary therapy. Molecular diagnostics are also being widely used to further characterize indeterminate nodules.

Thyroid nodules — thyrotropin and cytology considerations — Suppressed or low levels of thyrotropin (TSH) are associated with a decreased probability of malignancy, whereas increased levels of serum TSH, even when the levels are still within reference limits, are statistically associated with an increased risk of cancer in thyroid nodular disease; the clinical role of these epidemiologic findings is still controversial and is of little use in individual patient treatment. Autonomously functioning thyroid nodules in adults usually need no cytologic evaluation unless suspicious clinical findings are present.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy — outcome evidence and degree of suppression: A meta-analysis supported efficacy of TSH suppression therapy in preventing major adverse clinical events with RR = 0.73 (CI 0.60–0.88), p < 0.05. A large RCT from Japan showed disease-free survival was equivalent with normal TSH (0.4–5 mU/L) compared with LT4 suppression therapy (TSH < 0.01 mU/L). Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L may improve outcomes in high-risk patients, with no such evidence of benefit in low-risk patients, and higher degrees of suppression to < 0.03 mU/L may offer no additional benefit. In a prospective, nonrandomized cohort study of 2936 patients, overall survival improved significantly when TSH was suppressed to undetectable levels in NTCTCSG stage III or IV disease and to the subnormal to undetectable range in stage II disease; however, there was no incremental benefit from suppressing to undetectable levels in stage II and suppression of TSH was not beneficial in NTCTCSG stage I disease.

Differentiated thyroid carcinoma — clinical presentation and diagnosis: Differentiated (ie, papillary, follicular, oncocytic) thyroid carcinoma is usually asymptomatic for long periods and commonly presents as a solitary thyroid nodule; both benign and malignant thyroid nodules are usually asymptomatic, with About 50% of the malignant nodules discovered during routine examination, incidentally on imaging, or during surgery for benign disease, and The other 50% often first noticed by the patient as an asymptomatic nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound guidance is the procedure of choice for evaluating suspicious thyroid nodules. Data show that higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with an increased risk for differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients with thyroid nodules, although TSH and thyroglobulin (Tg) do not appear to be useful for screening for thyroid cancer. Although > 50% of all malignant nodules are asymptomatic, the pretest probability of malignancy increases considerably when signs or symptoms are present; the likelihood that a nodule is malignant increases about 7-fold with features such as very firm consistency, fixation to adjacent structures, rapid growth, enlarged regional lymph nodes, vocal cord paralysis, or symptoms of invasion into neck structures. Family history of thyroid cancer is also indicative of malignancy, and If two or more of these features are present, the likelihood of thyroid cancer is virtually assured; however, this is a rare situation; a patient's age and gender also affect the probability of malignancy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Thyroid nodules [^112yw5c5]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are a common finding in the general population. They may present with symptoms of pressure in the neck or may be discovered during physical examination. Although the risk of cancer is small, it is the main reason for workup of these lesions. Measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone can identify conditions that may cause hyperfunctioning of the thyroid. For all other conditions, ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration are central to the diagnosis. Lesions larger than 1 cm should be biopsied. Lesions with features suggestive of malignancy and those in patients with risk factors for thyroid cancer should be biopsied, regardless of size. Smaller lesions and those with benign histology can be followed and reevaluated if they grow. The evaluation of thyroid nodules in euthyroid and hypothyroid pregnant women is the same as in other adults. Thyroid nodules are uncommon in children, but the malignancy rate is much higher than in adults. Fine-needle aspiration is less accurate in children, so more aggressive surgical excision may be preferable.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: a review [^112PYsD4]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population. This is likely due to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and safely managed with a surveillance program. The main goal of initial and long-term follow-up is identification of the small subgroup of nodules that harbor a clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Observations

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require additional testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management includes simple observation, local treatments, and surgery and should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, fine-needle aspiration biopsy and molecular testing, facilitates a personalized, risk-based protocol that promotes high-quality care and minimizes cost and unnecessary testing.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Approach to the patient with nontoxic multinodular goiter [^112YCpRa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are very common, and although the majority are benign, approximately 5% may harbor malignancy. The evaluation of the patient with solitary thyroid nodule is generally straightforward and will typically include measurement of serum TSH to assess thyroid function and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule, with or without ultrasound (US) guidance. The approach to the patient with nontoxic multinodular goiter represents a more difficult problem for the clinician. All patients should have serum TSH measured to assess functional thyroid status and US examination to evaluate the number, size, and sonographic features of the nodules and assist in the selection of nodules that may need fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Patients with nodules yielding malignant cytology should be referred for surgery. Given the lack of reliable markers to predict biological behavior of nodules with suspicious (indeterminate) cytology, patients with such nodules are generally advised to have surgery, unless autonomous function of these nodules can be confirmed by scintigraphy. Most of these patients, however, will ultimately prove to have benign follicular tumors. Many patients with benign but large goiters may experience clinical symptoms of pressure, such as dysphagia, choking sensation, or airway obstruction. Such patients will often require surgery for alleviation of symptoms. In the absence of malignancy, asymptomatic patients may be observed. Radioactive iodine, commonly used in many parts of Europe, is safe and effective and may be a reasonable option for many patients. Periodic follow-up with neck palpation and US exam is recommended for all patients.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^116Q5nJk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

USPSTF response to public comment and terminology: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator. The USPSTF notes there are no high-quality studies that show that treatment of "overt" thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, and given the widespread practice of screening and the absence of high-quality evidence on effectiveness, a presumption that treatment is effective seems unwarranted. To reduce terminology confusion, the USPSTF believes alternative terms are needed and suggests the term "overt thyroid disease" to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels. This recommendation replaces the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for thyroid disease.

Table 13 — Response-to-therapy reclassification after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (RAI) remnant ablation defines four categories with thresholds, outcomes, and management. Excellent response is negative imaging and either suppressed thyroglobulin (Tg) < 0.2 ng/mL or TSH-stimulated Tg < 1 ng/mL (in the absence of anti-Tg antibodies), with 1%–4% recurrence and < 1% disease specific death; an excellent response to therapy should lead to an early decrease in the intensity and frequency of follow up and the degree of TSH suppression. Biochemical incomplete response is negative imaging with suppressed Tg ≥ 1 ng/mL or stimulated Tg ≥ 10 ng/mL or rising anti-Tg antibody levels; at least 30% spontaneously evolve to no evidence of disease (NED), 20% achieve NED after additional therapy, 20% develop structural disease, and < 1% disease specific death; if associated with stable or declining serum Tg values, a biochemical incomplete response should lead to continued observation with ongoing TSH suppression, whereas rising Tg or anti-Tg antibody values should prompt additional investigations and potentially additional therapies. Structural incomplete response is structural or functional evidence of disease with any Tg level (with or without anti-Tg antibodies), with 50%–85% continuing to have persistent disease despite additional therapy and disease specific death rates as high as 11% with loco-regional metastases and 50% with structural distant metastases; this may lead to additional treatments or ongoing observation depending on clinico-pathologic factors including size, location, rate of growth, RAI avidity, 18FDG avidity, and specific pathology of the structural lesion(s). Indeterminate response comprises nonspecific imaging findings or faint uptake in the thyroid bed on RAI scanning, nonstimulated Tg detectable but < 1 ng/mL, stimulated Tg detectable but < 10 ng/mL, or anti-Tg antibodies stable or declining without structural or functional disease; 15%–20% will have structural disease identified during follow-up, the remainder are stable or resolve, and < 1% disease specific death; an indeterminate response should lead to continued observation with appropriate serial imaging and serum Tg monitoring, with additional imaging or biopsy if findings become suspicious.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^111Q7npZ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

Observations

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered.

### The diagnostic role of FNA based on clinicopathological features in thyroid malignancy [^113KBavu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid nodules are discrete lesions within the normal thyroid parenchyma that are benign in 90% of the cases. The reported prevalence of these nodules is 2–6% with palpation, 19–35% with ultrasonography, up to 68% with high frequency ultrasound, and 8–65% in autopsy. Despite the more common benign nature of these nodules, 5–10% of them are proven to be malignant lesions. The importance of these nodules lies in their potential for malignancy and the high burden of thyroid cancer, which necessitates early detection and assessment of these nodules.

The initial symptoms of thyroid nodules include sensation of lump or foreign body in the throat, dysphagia, hoarseness, and pain, however, most patients are asymptomatic. After a proper physical evaluation of the thyroid, a neck ultrasonography and a radionuclide thyroid assessment as well as a complete evaluation of the thyroid function including thyroid stimulation hormone, total and free thyroid hormones, and antithyroid peroxidase antibody levels are performed based on their indication to define the functionality and nature of the nodules. The risk of malignancy (ROM) is then calculated and reported according to the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System or the American Thyroid Association guidelines regarding the sonographic features of the nodules. When the ROM is reported high enough by the radiologist, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule is performed to define the type of pathology.

The recommendation on whether a patient undergoes surgery or not is based on the FNA cytology report which is obtained according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC). These results are categorized as follows: (I) non-diagnostic, (II) benign, (III) atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) (5–10% ROM), (IV) follicular neoplasm (20–30% ROM), (V) suspicious for malignancy (50–75% ROM), and (VI) malignant. Non-diagnostic cytology occurs in samples that are not adequate. The patients with BSRTC category V and VI, along with persistent category III and IV (indeterminate categories) nodules are referred for thyroid lobectomy or near-total thyroidectomy. Furthermore, there are some clinical features other than FNA results including large thyroid nodule, rapidly growing nodule and hyperthyroidism that can warrant thyroidectomy.

Radioiodine therapy for nontoxic nodular goiter — radioiodine treatment is best suited for small- to medium-sized benign goiters and for patients previously treated surgically, with serious comorbid conditions, or who decline surgery, whereas it is not suited for large nodules requiring high doses or when immediate resolution of hyperthyroidism is desired; absolute contraindications are breastfeeding and pregnancy, which should be excluded by a pregnancy test, and there is no consensus on a lowest age limit. Typical outcomes include a 40 to 50% decrease in thyroid size after 1 year and a 50 to 60% decrease after 3 to 5 years, with about half of the reduction seen within 3 months; approximately 20% of patients do not respond, very large goiters (> 100 mL) decrease by only 30 to 40% after 1 year, and an RCT found LT4 had no effect whereas radioiodine decreased goiter size by 50% after 1 to 2 years. Dosing is often adjusted to aim at an absorbed dose of 100 Gy, and radioiodine usually improves symptoms and respiratory function.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Nonsurgical management of thyroid nodules: the role of ablative therapies [^115TTSmv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

What is the evidence supporting RFA of toxic thyroid nodules?

Available studies have focused on patients with toxic nodules who declined RAI and surgery or for whom these procedures were contraindicated. However, there is no consensus among professional societies on the use of TA therapies in this clinical scenario. The main consideration of using ablative techniques for toxic nodules is the higher potential for preservation of thyroid function compared with RAI or surgery, while achieving significant nodule volume reduction and resolution or amelioration of symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Several studies, albeit heterogeneous, have shown that RFA and LTA can achieve normalization of thyroid function tests with an average volume reduction of 70% to 80% at 12 to 24 months and singled out nodules < 12 mL as having excellent results. A prospective study of 30 patients with mean nodule diameter of 3.9 cm found that a single RFA session reduced nodule volume by 75% with significant improvement in local discomfort and cosmetic score, and with 50% of patients achieving long-standing euthyroidism at 12 months. In a randomized prospective trial, a single session of LTA, while equally effective at volume reduction, resulted in only 50% of patients achieving normal TSH, compared with 100% of those treated with RAI. Some have performed repeat RFA for large toxic nodules unresponsive to initial ablation, and documented 79% of patients having concomitant nodule volume reduction and resolution of hyperthyroidism without any major complications. Additionally, one can follow RFA with RAI therapy for the nodules that remain toxic after RFA. In this case, there will be a significant reduction in the dose of RAI and likely, through decrease in nodule size, also a considerable improvement in health-related quality of life compared with RAI alone.

What additional considerations are important regarding thyroid function?

It is reassuring to see that the studies in this area have rarely identified patients developing hypothyroidism after TA. One study indicates only 1 such case in a patient with preexistent anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Some authors render patients euthyroid with antithyroid drugs before TA. We are pursuing that for couple weeks before therapy in patients with more severe hyperthyroidism or with large toxic nodules (> 10 mL). This is based on our experience (manuscript in preparation) that suggests a possibly significant, albeit transient, increase in thyroid hormone levels after TA.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111mUJd6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Detection of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic adults — early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial, but widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect "abnormal" serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons; however, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain, laboratory reference intervals are based on statistical distribution (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal), and there is professional disagreement about appropriate cut points, including in subgroups such as older adults.

Incidental thyroid nodules that are found on an imaging study performed for reasons other than thyroid pathology represent a common scenario encountered by health care providers. The initial workup for these nodules comprises a thorough history and physical examination, thyroid function tests, a dedicated thyroid ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration of any suspicious lesions. Management ranges from observation and reassurance to surgical resection and depends on the cytologic diagnosis. In cases of cytologically indeterminate or discordant nodules, surgical excision (lobectomy) offers a definitive diagnosis, although molecular testing or a reasonable period of observation may be useful as less invasive adjuncts.

Overt thyroid dysfunction is documented by serum thyrotropin or T4 concentrations are often ordered for nonspecific complaints and will by definition fall outside of the 95% reference range 5% of the time. In addition, most laboratories quote adult ranges, which are not necessarily applicable to young children, and regression toward the mean is common, justifying that the test be repeated before embarking on treatment. On the other hand, neck ultrasounds are frequently performed for diffuse goiter or non-thyroid conditions. Yet, an ultrasound is not required to make a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis and small cysts and nodules discovered incidentally often lead to unjustified concerns about neoplasia.

Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^115CxSTn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, current guidelines recommend repeat evaluation of a benign thyroid nodule after 1–2 years, which is only based on expert opinion. This study suggests that this recommendation can be safely extended to 3 years without increased malignancy and mortality risk, or likelihood of harm. Nodule growth can be expected, and therefore young patients, those experiencing possible structural symptoms, or those with larger nodules at baseline may be candidates for modified recommendations. Conversely, even longer follow-up intervals should be considered for older patients with predominantly cystic nodules. While replication of these data in large prospective multicenter studies is needed, this extension in follow-up interval would reduce unnecessary visits and medical interventions for millions of affected patients worldwide, leading to healthcare savings.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — clinical situations that favor specific modalities in Graves' hyperthyroidism: RAI therapy is favored for women planning a pregnancy in the future (in more than 6 months following RAI administration, provided that thyroid hormone levels are normal), individuals with comorbidities increasing surgical risk, those with previously operated or externally irradiated necks or lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon, and those with contraindications to antithyroid drugs (ATDs) or failure to achieve euthyroidism with ATDs; patients with periodic thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis, right heart failure pulmonary hypertension, or congestive heart failure are also considered good candidates. ATDs are favored for patients with high likelihood of remission (especially women with mild disease, small goiters, and negative or low-titer TRAb), pregnancy, elderly or others with comorbidities increasing surgical risk or limited life expectancy, residents of nursing homes or other care facilities unable to follow radiation safety regulations, those with previously operated or irradiated necks or lacking access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon, patients with moderate to severe active GO, and those needing more rapid biochemical disease control. Surgery is favored for women planning a pregnancy in < 6 months provided thyroid hormone levels are normal, symptomatic compression or large goiters (≥ 80 g), relatively low uptake of RAI, documented or suspected thyroid malignancy (e.g., suspicious or indeterminate cytology), large thyroid nodules especially if greater than 4 cm or if nonfunctioning or hyperfunctioning on 123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scanning, coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery, especially if TRAb levels are particularly high, and patients with moderate to severe active GO.

Although thyroid nodules are a common clinical entity, few (5% to 10%) are malignant and require surgical treatment. Most nodules are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing surveillance for medical reasons unrelated to thyroid disorders. Therefore, a systematic approach to their evaluation is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. High-resolution ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration have resulted in substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, cost reductions, and higher malignancy yield at the time of surgery. In this article, the authors present practical guidelines and a suggested management strategy for the effective diagnosis and management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules.

Clinical practice guideline recommendations

Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer extracted from these guidelines are shown in Table 4. Regarding the diagnostic procedures, all guidelines advocated thyroid sonography. In addition, a measurement of TSH and free thyroxine levels should be performed in all patients. A routine measurement of serum thyroidglobulin (Tg) for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules is not recommended. However, although all the guidelines supported FNA as the procedure of choice in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the CPGs define various nodular sizes as indications for FNA. The German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (GAES), IKNL, and Northern Cancer Network (NCN) guidelines recommend that FNA should be performed in all nodules, two CPGs recommend that the indication of FNA must be performed in nodules > 0.5 cm in diameter, and the other three CPGs suggest that FNA cytology is needed when the thyroid nodule is bigger than 1 cm in the absence of clinical suspicion. In the 2013 version of the NCCN guidelines, the threshold for FNA is a solid thyroid nodule > 1.5 cm, if no suspicious sonographic features are present. For laboratory evaluation, four CPGs recommend routine serum calcitonin, particularly before surgery for nodular thyroid disease. Four guidelines suggest a serum calcitonin assay as an optional test, but the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines cannot recommend or discourage the routine measurement of serum calcitonin, because of insufficient evidence. For radionuclide scanning, three guidelines mentioned thyroid scintigraphy in a single thyroid nodule with a low TSH level, and the GAES CPGs recommend thyroid scintigraphy before the planning and execution of an operation.

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: a review [^112KELhd]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Observations

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with 1 or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended for nodules at least 1.5 cm in patients 35 years or older and for nodules at least 1.0 cm in patients younger than 35 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Only a few select incidental thyroid nodules require further evaluation with ultrasonography based on recommendations that aim to diagnose clinically significant thyroid cancers while reducing unnecessary workup and provide guidance for clinical practice.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^114Xo7vx]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism [^116UT86r]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism — laboratory patterns and screening notes are as follows: In Primary Hypothyroidism (thyroid failure), free thyroxine (FT4) is low or normal and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is elevated, whereas in Central Hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic cause), FT4 is low but TSH may be normal or low (rare). Thyroid auto-antibodies (thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibodies) may be helpful in determining underlying etiology of hypothyroidism, and total and free triiodothyronine (T3) are generally not necessary for screening and monitoring. Mildly abnormal TSH levels (< 10 uIU/ml) with normal FT4 are not likely to cause symptoms and can be followed and repeated over time, and a good portion of children with this subclinical hypothyroidism revert back to normal thyroid function over time. Hyperlipidemia may be seen secondary to hypothyroidism; consider screening with TSH, FT4 in dyslipidemia, and consider screening for hypothyroidism in depression especially in setting of poor linear growth. Thyroid ultrasonography is not generally required unless thyroid gland is significantly enlarged and/or asymmetric, or there is suspicion of thyroid nodule. Common obesity is generally exogenous and unlikely to be secondary to hypothyroidism, and screening for thyroid dysfunction is not recommended in absence of symptoms, poor linear growth or other risk factors.

Nodules benign by FNA — Follow-up — Perform clinical follow-up of FNA benign nodules, unless symptomatic. Consider a repeat clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement in approximately 12 months in accordance with clinical setting. If nodules are unchanged at the first US control, repeat the US follow-up after 24 months. In asymptomatic nodules with a repeated benign cytology and no suspicious clinical or US features, routine follow-up may be avoided. In nodules with benign cytology but suspicious clinical or US features, a repeat FNA is recommended. In nodules with an increase > 50% in volume or that become symptomatic, we recommend repeat FNA.

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management… [^112NtFc9]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Most thyroid nodules are benign. 4, 6 Risk factors for thyroid cancer include ionizing radiation, rapid nodule growth, hoarseness, and a family history of thyroid cancer or cancer syndromes. 7 Patients with Graves disease who have hypofunctioning nodules have a higher prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer.
8. Evaluation The first step in evaluating a thyroid nodule is to measure the thyroid-stimulating hormone level and perform thyroid ultrasonography with a survey of the cervical lymph nodes.

7, 11, 12 A normal or elevated TSH level indicates that the thyroid nodule is nonfunctioning; a low or suppressed TSH level suggests the diagnosis of primary hyperthyroidism, and a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan should be performed. Focal increased uptake in the region of the thyroid nodule is consistent with a hyperfunctioning or "hot" nodule. Hyperfunctioning nodules are unlikely to be malignant and do not require FNA. Nonfunctioning or "cold" nodules should be further evaluated with FNA if they meet clinical or ultrasound criteria. According to the American College of Radiology, the American Thyroid Association, and the European Thyroid Association, ultrasound features that strongly suggest malignancy include hypoechoic echogenicity, solid composition, irregular margins, microcalcifications, height greater than width, extrathyroidal extension, disrupted rim calcification, and cervical lymph nodes with suspicious features.

Therefore, even though a benign pattern on molecular testing significantly decreases the risk of malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules, ultrasound surveillance is still required. Consultation with an endocrinologist may be helpful if there is uncertainty about how to interpret a molecular test result. PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE NODULES Because each thyroid nodule carries an independent risk of malignancy, patients with multiple nodules may require FNA for more than one nodule. Nodules with highly suspicious ultrasound features should be preferentially biopsied. A radionuclide thyroid uptake scan can be considered in patients with a low to low-normal TSH level to identify target nodules for FNA.

### Abstract… [^117RvdKA]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, especially in women. 1 Nonpalpable nodules are often found when patients undergo diagnostic imaging such as ultrasonography and computed tomography of the chest and neck. For these incidentalomas, current guidelines recommend the same diagnostic strategy that is recommended for palpable nodules. 2 Although the risk of malignancy in any given nodule is small, thyroid cancer must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Family physicians should understand the rationale for the evaluation of nodules and be able to perform an evidence-based assessment. Presentation Thyroid nodules are often noticed by patients as a lump or protrusion in the lower anterior neck. Large nodules can cause compressive symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing or a choking sensation. Nodules may be single or multiple, hard or soft, and tender or nontender. Nodules may also be found by physicians on routine examination.

Clinical examination of the thyroid is difficult in persons with large necks. Nodules 1 cm or smaller are rarely detected by palpation. Evaluation The primary goal when evaluating a thyroid nodule is to determine whether it is malignant. Figure 1 presents a suggested algorithm for evaluating and treating thyroid nodules. 14 Because of genetic mutations, a small number of nodules escape regulation by the normal thyroid-stimulating hormone feedback system and autonomously produce thyroid hormone. 15 Although reliable figures are not available, the proportion is probably about 5%. 15 These so-called "hot" nodules are unlikely to be malignant and require treatment that is somewhat different than that for other nodules. A reasonable first step in evaluating a thyroid nodule is to check TSH levels and perform thyroid ultrasonography.

1, 14 If TSH is suppressed, radionuclide scintigraphy with technetium 99m or iodine 123 can determine whether there are hyperfunctioning nodules or whether the entire thyroid gland is overactive, as it would be in cases of toxic multinodular goiter. 1, 14. In the past, nuclear thyroid scintigraphy was often performed to evaluate all thyroid nodules. However, nonfunctioning nodules have only a 14% to 22% chance of being malignant. Special Populations Some studies show that the rate of development of thyroid nodules is higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women, but that the thyroid cancer rate is not increased during pregnancy.

Some experts advocate the measurement of serum calcitonin levels as part of the workup for thyroid nodules. Calcitonin levels are elevated in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. However, this disease is rare, and there is no clear threshold that distinguishes between benign and malignant disease.

6 Previous guidelines found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this practice, 1, 14 although more recent guidelines recommend measuring calcitonin in patients with thyroid nodules and a family history or clinical suspicion of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN type 2.
2. If the pathology is malignant or suspicious, surgery to remove the affected thyroid lobe or lobes is recommended. 1, 14 Diagnostic lobectomy is often recommended for nodules 4 cm or larger because this size is an independent predictor of malignancy, and because FNA in a large nodule may miss a malignant focus and be falsely interpreted as benign. 3 Benign nodules should be followed with repeat ultrasonography six to 18 months after the initial FNA.

### Don't use nuclear medicine thyroid scans to evaluate thyroid nodules in patients with normal thyroid gland function… [^115ocCqi]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Nuclear medicine thyroid scanning does not conclusively determine whether thyroid nodules are benign or malignant. Cold nodules on thyroid scans will still require biopsy. Nuclear medicine thyroid scans are useful to evaluate the functional status of thyroid nodules in patients who are hyperthyroid.

### Management of adult thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer… [^115R3wrM]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid nodules are typically asymptomatic, and 33% to 68% of adults have thyroid nodules when evaluated by ultrasound. 1 Most thyroid nodules are benign, but about 7% to 15% of individuals with thyroid nodules harbor thyroid cancer. 2 Thyroid nodules may also cause morbidity due to hyperthyroidism or local compression. Population-based studies suggest a doubling in thyroid cancer incidence in recent decades, but nearly all of this increase is attributable to clinically occult cancers detected incidentally on imaging or pathology.
