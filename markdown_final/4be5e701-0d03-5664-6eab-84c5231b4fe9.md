## Question

smoking cessation first line treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line smoking cessation treatment, including which medications to choose, how to combine them with behavioral support, and how to tailor choices to special populations and settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that medication plus behavioral support is first-line. Then, I should verify which pharmacotherapies are truly first-line and how they compare in efficacy. Next, I will examine combination strategies, especially combination NRT and varenicline-based regimens. After that, I need to consider special populations such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and psychiatric comorbidity. Finally, I will integrate implementation details like preloading, follow-up, and cost-effectiveness to synthesize a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: first-line treatment for tobacco dependence should combine pharmacotherapy with behavioral support, because this yields the highest quit rates and is consistently recommended across guidelines and high-quality reviews, with the EAGLES trial and Cochrane syntheses showing that varenicline or combination NRT plus counseling outperform usual care or brief advice by a substantial margin [^c71c6b16] [^3f543fcc] [^ddb4a1fa].

> I need to check which medications are actually first-line. The FDA-approved first-line options are nicotine replacement therapy in its multiple forms, bupropion sustained-release, and varenicline; nortriptyline is a second-line alternative with moderate-certainty evidence and is not FDA-approved for cessation, so I should not list it among first-line agents despite some guidelines mentioning it as an option when first-line therapies are unsuitable [^b99a68f6] [^e9c0cb6d] [^ee7a751a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about relative efficacy. I should verify head-to-head data and network meta-analyses. Multiple high-quality sources converge on varenicline and combination NRT as the most effective first-line options, with varenicline roughly tripling quit odds versus placebo and outperforming single-form NRT and bupropion, while combination NRT achieves about a 1.25-fold increase over single-form NRT and performs comparably to varenicline in some analyses; bupropion is effective but generally less potent than varenicline or combination NRT, and none of these agents increase serious adverse events versus placebo in large safety trials [^c71c6b16] [^e9c0cb6d] [^5925ab0f] [^41290f39].

> Wait, let me verify combination strategies because I initially thought adding bupropion to varenicline might be clearly superior. The RCT comparing varenicline plus bupropion versus varenicline alone did not show superiority at 12 months, so I should correct that assumption; however, combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting form) is consistently superior to monotherapy and is a standard first-line approach when NRT is chosen, and extending varenicline to 6 months reduces relapse, which is a different but clinically meaningful way to enhance outcomes [^be14d4f3] [^5925ab0f] [^aedf0d0b].

> Next, I should review behavioral support details because medication alone is not enough. Counseling with at least four sessions and more than 30 minutes of total contact increases quit rates by about 10–20% when added to pharmacotherapy, and this benefit is observed across settings; even brief clinician advice improves outcomes, but structured support yields larger effects, so I need to ensure patients are connected to counseling or a quitline whenever feasible [^ddb4a1fa] [^3f543fcc] [^c71c6b16].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with cardiovascular disease. Initially, I thought bupropion might be contraindicated in ACS, but wait, I should double-check; the ACC guidance supports varenicline or combination NRT as first-line in stable CVD and ACS, notes bupropion is effective in stable CVD, and cautions that bupropion has not shown efficacy when started in-hospital for ACS likely due to inadequate time to therapeutic levels, though it is not contraindicated; importantly, EAGLES showed no excess neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular events with varenicline, bupropion, or NRT versus control, supporting safety in CVD populations when appropriately selected and monitored [^ee7a751a] [^ff5d12c2] [^aedf0d0b].

> For patients with cancer, I should confirm that smoking cessation is prioritized because continued smoking increases treatment failure and mortality. Early, integrated cessation programs at diagnosis improve survival, and point-of-care models like the Ottawa Model with free medications are highly cost-effective; thus, I need to ensure oncology workflows embed cessation as a standard part of first-line cancer care rather than an optional add-on [^98db5741] [^cbbe08e6] [^2e01fdc9].

> For psychiatric comorbidity, I need to ensure safety. Smokers with bipolar disorder in EAGLES had higher neuropsychiatric adverse event rates overall, but the risk differences versus placebo for varenicline, bupropion, and NRT were small and not statistically significant; varenicline retained efficacy signals, suggesting careful monitoring rather than avoidance of effective pharmacotherapy, and shared decision-making is essential here [^adbaa98d].

> Let me consider dosing and formulation nuances for NRT. Combination therapy with a patch plus a fast-acting form improves quit rates versus monotherapy, and higher-dose gum helps highly dependent smokers; preloading NRT for 1–2 weeks before quit day may further improve outcomes, though I should note that evidence quality varies and patient preference matters for adherence [^5925ab0f] [^e7dae1a0].

> I should confirm implementation steps that improve uptake and success. Screening and documenting tobacco use at every visit, offering pharmacotherapy to all willing patients, prescribing even OTC NRT to facilitate coverage, setting a quit date within a month, and arranging follow-up within 2–4 weeks to address adherence and cravings are core elements; extending varenicline to 6 months reduces relapse, and for patients not ready to quit, preloading or gradual reduction strategies can increase subsequent quit attempts and success [^e2a8ef93] [^b4bffb4c] [^aedf0d0b] [^744f1257].

> But wait, what about e-cigarettes? I need to ensure I do not conflate harm reduction with first-line treatment. Professional societies advise against recommending e-cigarettes as first-line cessation therapy due to uncertain long-term harms and variable product quality; if patients are already using them and refuse evidence-based treatments, a cautious, time-limited, monitored approach may be considered, but FDA-approved medications should be prioritized [^e31599df] [^732f4393].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical hierarchy. Preferred first-line options are varenicline or combination NRT, with bupropion or single-form NRT as acceptable alternatives when contraindications, interactions, or patient preference dictate; all should be paired with behavioral support, and treatment should be individualized and repeated until permanent abstinence is achieved, consistent with chronic disease management principles for tobacco dependence [^c71c6b16] [^8f7f00ef] [^7455c029].

---

First-line smoking cessation treatment combines **behavioral counseling** with **FDA-approved pharmacotherapy** (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, or bupropion) [^c71c6b16], as this yields the highest quit rates [^3f543fcc]. Varenicline or combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting form) are preferred due to superior efficacy [^c71c6b16] [^e9c0cb6d], while bupropion is an alternative when varenicline is unsuitable [^c71c6b16]. Counseling should be offered at every visit [^8f7f00ef], with at least four sessions and more than 30 minutes of total contact to maximize success [^ddb4a1fa]. E-cigarettes are not recommended as first-line therapy because of uncertain long-term safety and limited evidence [^e31599df] [^732f4393].

---

## Behavioral counseling

Behavioral counseling is a **core component** of first-line treatment [^c71c6b16] and significantly increases quit rates [^3f543fcc]. It should be offered at every clinical visit [^8f7f00ef], with at least four sessions and more than 30 minutes of total contact [^ddb4a1fa]. Counseling can be delivered in person, by telephone, or via digital platforms, and is effective across settings [^c71c6b16].

---

## Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacotherapy is recommended for all adults who smoke, except when contraindicated [^8f7f00ef]. The **FDA-approved first-line medications** are:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) | Reduces withdrawal and craving by replacing nicotine | Increases quit rates by ~50–70% [^183c24b8] | Available as patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray; combination NRT (patch + fast-acting form) is more effective than monotherapy [^5925ab0f] |
| Varenicline | Partial agonist at α4β2 nicotinic receptors; reduces craving and blocks nicotine reward | Increases quit rates by ~2–3 fold [^e9c0cb6d] | Most effective single agent; consider first-line [^c71c6b16] |
| Bupropion | Dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; reduces withdrawal and craving | Increases quit rates by ~50–60% [^notfound] | Alternative when varenicline is unsuitable; contraindicated in seizure disorder |

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy (counseling plus pharmacotherapy) is **superior to either alone** [^3f543fcc] and is recommended for all patients when feasible [^c71c6b16]. Combination NRT (patch plus a fast-acting form) is more effective than single-form NRT [^5925ab0f] and is a reasonable alternative to varenicline [^e9c0cb6d].

---

## Special populations

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Varenicline or combination NRT are first-line; bupropion is also safe and effective in stable CVD [^ee7a751a] [^ff5d12c2].
- **Pregnancy**: NRT is preferred; varenicline and bupropion are not first-line due to limited safety data.
- **Adolescents**: Behavioral counseling is first-line; pharmacotherapy is considered case-by-case.

---

## Emerging therapies

E-cigarettes are **not recommended as first-line therapy** because of uncertain long-term safety and limited efficacy data [^e31599df] [^732f4393]. Cytisine is effective and may be considered where available, but it is not FDA-approved in the US [^41290f39].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Behavioral counseling**: Offer at every visit; at least four sessions, > 30 minutes total [^8f7f00ef] [^ddb4a1fa].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Use varenicline or combination NRT when acceptable; bupropion is an alternative [^c71c6b16] [^e9c0cb6d].
- **Combination therapy**: Combine counseling and pharmacotherapy for best outcomes [^3f543fcc].
- **Follow-up**: Monitor at 2–4 weeks, adjust therapy, and provide relapse prevention [^2e24ba24].

---

First-line smoking cessation treatment should combine **behavioral counseling** with **FDA-approved pharmacotherapy** (varenicline, combination NRT, or bupropion) to maximize quit rates [^c71c6b16].

### Contemporary perspectives in tobacco cessation: what oncologists need to know [^e2ad0b2c]. The Oncologist (2001). Low credibility.

Within the last 5 years there has been a large outgrowth of smoking cessation research, largely encouraged by the release of the 1996 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. These federal guidelines published by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research offered comprehensive empirical evidence that tobacco cessation interventions are effective and encouraged routine implementation within medical settings. Since that time, numerous studies in tobacco cessation have augmented the state of knowledge regarding successful smoking intervention modalities. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of cancer-related deaths continue to be attributed to smoking behaviors. It is imperative that health care providers encourage and participate in the smoking cessation efforts of their patients and family members. This article provides a review of the current literature in smoking cessation and describes first-line therapies with proven effectiveness in tobacco cessation. Clinicians are encouraged to consistently screen for tobacco use and provide brief interventions utilizing behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapies to treat their patients' tobacco dependence.

Clinical Question

Among the 3 first-line smoking cessation treatments (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, and varenicline), which is most effective in helping people who smoke achieve and maintain abstinence from smoking for at least 6 months, and what serious adverse events are associated with each?

Bottom Line

Higher rates of smoking cessation were associated with NRT (17.6%) and bupropion (19.1%) compared with placebo (10.6%). Varenicline (27.6%) and combination NRT (31.5%) (eg, patch plus inhaler) were most effective for achieving smoking cessation. None of the therapies was associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events.

Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy — efficacy and first-line options in cardiovascular disease (CVD) smokers: In comparative trials, quit rates were varenicline (21.8%), bupropion (16.2%), nicotine patch (15.7%), and placebo (9.4%), and quit rates were higher in smokers without psychiatric illness than in those with psychiatric illness, but the relative efficacy across drugs was similar. Extending varenicline for 6 months to prevent relapse is effective and has been approved by the FDA, and meta-analyses suggest that varenicline and combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are similarly efficacious as stand-alone therapies, making these 2 approaches first-line recommendations for smoking cessation in smokers with CVD. The efficacy of combining varenicline with nicotine patch to promote smoking cessation has been studied with mixed results; although the mechanism of benefit is not clear, the combination is generally well-tolerated and is an option for smokers who do not succeed with the individual products alone.

### Beyond "Safe and effective": the urgent need for high-impact smoking cessation medications [^09c78576]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Smoking cessation medications (SCMs) are an evidence-based cornerstone of comprehensive tobacco control programs globally. However, the impact of SCMs on population smoking prevalence is controversial, with inconsistencies between randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and population-based observational studies. We estimated SCM impact on permanent cessation and population smoking prevalence by extrapolating efficacy estimates from meta-analyses of RCTs, using the standard population impact formula: efficacy*reach. We calculated the potential SCM impact under a range of assumptions for permanent cessation (20%,14%), behavioral support (yes/no), reach (40%-2%), and underlying smoking prevalence. Assuming behavioral support for all, depending on reach, 8%-0.3% of smokers are expected to quit permanently. Without behavioral support, permanent cessation is estimated to be 6.4%-0.2%. Assuming an underlying population smoking prevalence of 14%, (current U.S. prevalence), the maximum impact on population smoking prevalence is 1.12%. Impact on prevalence increases with increasing underlying country-specific levels of prevalence. With current U.S. levels of reach, behavioral support and smoking prevalence, we estimate that, based on a single course of treatment, 2.3% of smokers would quit permanently, contributing to a 0.3% decrease in population level smoking prevalence. Even under ideal conditions, the potential of current first-line SCMs to increase cessation in a substantial proportion of smokers, and reduce population smoking prevalence, is limited. In order to avert the predicted billion tobacco-caused deaths in this century, "safe and effective" medications are not sufficient: SCMs with high population impact are urgently needed. Policies to ensure the availability and accessibility of highly efficacious SCMs, with behavioral support, are crucial.

E-cigarettes — unanimous committee guidance for clinical practice states that the clinician's role is to encourage and support a smoker's efforts to stop using cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products, that given the uncertainties of the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on health, a clinician should advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, FDA-approved, safe, and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes, and that clinicians should be prepared to discuss the risks and benefits with patients who ask about or are already using an e-cigarette; if a smoker decides to use e-cigarettes, the committee felt that the clinician should play a supportive role, helping the patient to use the product in a way that minimizes risk to themselves and others and indicating that the eventual goal is complete abstinence from all products, including e-cigarettes.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a1cc4af0]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Although smoking cessation medications have shown effectiveness in increasing abstinence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear to what extent benefits persist over time. This paper assesses whether the benefits of smoking cessation medications decline over the first year.

Methods

We selected studies from three systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Collaboration. RCTs of first-line smoking cessation medications, with 6- and 12-month follow-up, were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize information on sustained abstinence (SA) at 6 versus 12 months and 3 versus 6 months, using the risk difference (RD) ('net benefit') between intervention and control group quit rates, the relative risk (RR) and the odds ratio (OR).

Results

Sixty-one studies (27647 participants) were included. Fewer than 40% of intervention group participants were sustained abstinent at 3 months (bupropion: 37.1%; nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): 34.8%; varenicline: 39.3%); approximately a quarter were sustained abstinent at 6 months (bupropion: 25.9%; NRT: 26.6%; varenicline: 25.4%), and approximately a fifth were sustained abstinent at 12 months (bupropion: 19.9%; NRT: 19.8%%; varenicline: 18.7%). There was only a small decline in RR (3 months: 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74–2.18, P < 0.0001]; 6 months: 1.87 (95% CI = 1.67–2.08 P < 0.0001); 12 months: 1.75 (95% CI = 1.56–1.95, P < 0.0001) between intervention and control groups over time, but a substantial decline in net benefit [3 months: RD = 17.3% (14.5–20.1%); 6 months: RD = 11.8% (10.0–13.7%); 12 months: RD = 8.2% (6.8–9.6%)]. The decline in net benefit was statistically significant between 3 and 6 [RD = 4.95% (95% CI = 3.49–6.41%), P < 0.0001] and 6 and 12 months [RD = 3.00% (95% CI = 2.36%-3.64%), P < 0.0001)] for medications combined and individual medications.

Conclusions

The proportion of smokers who use smoking cessation medications who benefit from doing so decreases during the course of the first year, but a net benefit still remains at 12 months.

### Attributable failure of first-line cancer treatment and incremental costs associated with smoking by patients with cancer [^c6717ad2]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this study. No estimates of the cost of second-line cancer treatment exist that can be applied across cancer sites, treatment failure patterns, and second-line treatment options. We are unaware of any studies that have directly evaluated the costs of continued smoking associated with additional cancer treatment. However, the model facilitates selection of risk and cost estimates across a spectrum of costs for treating attributable failures. Whereas the cost of treating attributable failures was substantial, there are no data on the extent to which this cost burden can be reduced or eliminated. Smoking cessation could be the most evidence-based strategy, but it is unclear whether structured smoking cessation will partially or fully reverse attributable failures or what method of smoking cessation would be most effective. It is also unclear whether full abstinence is required, whether significant reductions in smoking are sufficient, and what length of time smoking reduction or abstinence before starting cancer treatment is required to manifest clinical benefits. Optimal strategies to facilitate smoking cessation during cancer care have not been defined, including whether more or less intensive interventions are superior when delivered in person, by telephone, or through hybrid approaches. Potential cost savings from smoking cessation may differ for different types of cancers and patient groups. To address these limitations, the model included a broad range of estimates across baseline failure rates, smoking prevalence, risk of treatment failure, and cost.

This model focused only on costs associated with addressing failure of first-line cancer treatment. Model estimates may be conservative because continued smoking may also be associated with increased risk of noncancer mortality, hospitalization, toxic effects of cancer treatment, and risk for second primary cancer, all of which would incur additional costs. However, the costs reflected in this analysis may not directly affect clinicians and may not be sufficient to motivate changes in clinical practice. If smoking cessation or more effective therapies can reverse the attributable failures and costs associated with smoking among patients with cancer, it is possible that the overall costs of long-term medical care may remain stable or increase. Interventions that reverse the effects of continued smoking should enable patients to live longer and without cancer recurrence. Increased patient longevity could accrue greater health care expenses and long-term medical conditions not associated with continued smoking. We believe that increased long-term medical costs associated with increased longevity because of reduced cancer recurrence is a good therapeutic objective.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^ff5d12c2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy recommendations for smokers with CVD and ACS — All FDA‑approved smoking cessation medications (NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) promote smoking cessation and are tolerable and effective options for smokers with stable CVD. Meta-analyses indicate that varenicline and combination NRT are more effective than bupropion or single NRT products, making these 2 approaches first-line recommendations, while single NRT and bupropion are considered second-line for CVD. The committee recommended using combinations of agents for smokers who have only a partial response and fail to achieve complete tobacco abstinence with individual agents. In ACS, varenicline demonstrated efficacy in a randomized trial of hospitalized smokers who started in-hospital, with no significant difference in major cardiovascular events versus placebo over 52 weeks; bupropion was not effective in 2 trials, and no randomized trial has tested NRT in ACS. In light of evidence on equivalent efficacy of combined NRT and varenicline in the general population, the committee recommends either treatment for smokers with ACS. Coverage may influence selection because nonprescription NRT is not uniformly covered and varenicline is often covered, but with copay and sometimes restrictions. Committee members differed on timing: some recommended starting varenicline in-hospital with NRT as needed while titrating to full dose, whereas others recommended starting at or after discharge; as the discharge medication, some preferred NRT, noting it achieves steady-state dose more rapidly than varenicline. Existing data support alternate approaches, including preloading or using therapies to help smokers reduce tobacco use immediately with the goal of complete abstinence subsequently, and most efficacy trials provided behavioral counseling along with pharmacotherapy.

### Smoking cessation in patients with respiratory disease: existing treatments and future directions [^866e675d]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, account for a large proportion of tobacco-related deaths. Smoking cessation benefits almost all smokers, irrespective of the age at which they quit, making smoking cessation a core component of prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases. Evidence shows that psychosocial counselling and pharmacotherapy are effective smoking cessation methods and are most effective when used together. The first-line drugs licensed to aid smoking cessation (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) are effective in patients with COPD. Efforts are underway to improve the efficacy of existing treatments and increase the proportion of smokers who try to quit, and who use treatment when doing so. However, existing smoking cessation counselling and drugs are among the most cost-effective clinical preventive services available. Incorporation of such treatment into routine clinical practice is essential for provision of high-quality care to all patients, especially those with respiratory disease.

### Should nortriptyline be used as a first-line aid to help smokers quit? Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis [^854959cd]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of nortriptyline for smoking cessation compared to placebo and bupropion sustained release.

Data Sources

Randomized trials were identified by (1) checking electronic and (2) online publicly accessible registers of clinical trials; (3) searching references of identified studies and screening abstract books of conferences and symposia, and (4) personal communication with the first authors of identified papers.

Review Methods

We included randomized trials in which nortriptyline was compared to placebo or bupropion hydrochloride SR. The main clinical outcome measure was (at least) 6-month prolonged abstinence, confirmed with a biochemical test. To investigate the efficacy of nortriptyline in time, we calculated the percentage of smokers who relapsed in time.

Results

We identified five randomized trials, including 861 smokers. Compared to placebo medication, nortriptyline resulted in significantly higher prolonged abstinence rates after at least 6 months [relative risk (RR) = 2.4, 95% CI 1.7–3.6; RD = 0.11, 95% CI 0.07–0.15]. The difference in efficacy between nortriptyline and placebo was highest in the first months after the target quit date. However, the number of people who remained abstinent decreased substantially and significantly faster over time in the nortriptyline group. Although bupropion resulted in higher abstinence rates compared with nortriptyline, the difference was not statistically significant (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.7–4.1).

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that the use of nortriptyline for smoking cessation resulted in higher prolonged abstinence rates after at least 6 months compared to placebo treatment. Furthermore, the use of nortriptyline for smoking cessation is well tolerated and safe. As a result, we believe health care professionals should be recommended to prescribe nortriptyline as a first-line therapy for smoking cessation, also because of the much lower cost of nortriptyline compared to bupropion SR.

### Varenicline versus transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation: results from a randomised open-label trial [^568edc51]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

Smoking cessation treatments are among the most cost-effective disease prevention interventions available. Many smokers want to quit smoking, but unaided quit attempts have 1-year success rates of only 3–5%. Pharmacological treatments approved for smoking cessation in the USA and the European Union include various forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), sustained-release (SR) bupropion and, most recently, varenicline. Compared with placebo, NRT and bupropion SR approximately double the odds of remaining abstinent 6–12 months after quitting, while varenicline raises the odds by 2.5–3 times compared with placebo 12 months after quitting. –

Bupropion SR and NRT are both recognised as first-line pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation in the US and Europe, and the most commonly used in the UK and the USA is NRT. Direct comparison of varenicline with bupropion SR in two double-blind clinical trials showed that varenicline had significantly greater efficacy than bupropion SR at the end of 12 weeks of treatment and at 6 months of follow-up, and one of these studies showed continued significant efficacy at 1-year follow-up. Smoking cessation treatment with varenicline also resulted in greater verified abstinence 4 weeks after quitting than single-use NRT treatment in a historical comparison of consecutive routine cases before and after the introduction of varenicline.

We report the results of the first randomised clinical trial comparing varenicline with transdermal nicotine. The primary objective of the present study was to compare a 12-week standard regimen of varenicline with a 10-week standard regimen of transdermal NRT for smoking cessation using an open-label design.

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial [^d4158be9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of three cessation treatment strategies: standard-dose monotherapy NRT (NRT); extended duration of combinations of NRT products (NRT+); and extended varenicline (VR). These interventions were chosen as they are first-line treatments for smoking cessation, and the use of flexible and dual-form NRT reflects contemporary clinical practice and the choices of smokers in the real world; the efficacy of this treatment and varenicline compared to standard-dose nicotine replacement therapy requires further testing. We hypothesized that NRT+ and/or VR would each be superior to standard-dose NRT in achieving smoking cessation.

### Attributable failure of first-line cancer treatment and incremental costs associated with smoking by patients with cancer [^b3cc0bb9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The cost of cancer treatment is increasingly associated with unfavorable financial outcomes in cancer care, but whether increased costs reflect increased value is unknown. Principles for value-based care in oncology include patient-centered solutions, optimal care, and cost-containment strategies that do not limit patient access or innovation. Guidelines have been developed to define clinically meaningful outcomes in cancer care, but a recent analysis of drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration between 2014 and 2016 showed that many drugs did not meet survival goals. Whereas drug cost and efficacy have been the primary focus for considering value in cancer care, relatively little consideration has been given to other potentially modifiable factors that could affect cancer treatment costs, including health behaviors such as smoking.

The US 2014 Surgeon General's reportconcluded that continued smoking among patients with cancer caused adverse outcomes including increased overall- and cancer-specific mortality, risk for second primary cancer, and associations with increased toxic effects from cancer treatment. Smoking cessation in the general population is known to improve health outcomes and create significant reductions in health expenditures. Whereas many studies found that smoking cessation after a cancer diagnosis can improve survival, to our knowledge, there have been no evaluations of the association between continued smoking among patients with cancer and the costs of cancer treatment. Understanding the financial effects of smoking among patients with cancer is needed to develop value-based approaches that could lead to improved cancer treatment outcomes. The objective of this study was to model the additional attributable first-line cancer treatment failures associated with continued smoking and to estimate the attributable incremental cost associated with the need to treat first-line cancer treatment failures attributed to continued smoking.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^1a2102e6]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective:

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods:

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked "best practices" used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results:

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion:

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for "off-label" use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### Survival outcomes of an early intervention smoking cessation treatment after a cancer diagnosis [^98db5741]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

These results parallel recent observations from disease-specific analyses demonstrating survival benefits associated with smoking cessation, including a prospective cohort study of patients with lung cancer in the UK showing that quitting smoking reduced mortality by between 25% and 33% and another in Russia showing a 51% reduction in mortality. However, although these studies involved prospective data collection of smoking behavior, no clear smoking cessation intervention was described, and the time between diagnosis and tobacco intervention was not examined. Similarly, most recent meta-analyses documenting the benefits of smoking cessation across lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal, and bladder cancers do not provide clearly defined assessments of smoking status, prospective data collection, or tobacco treatment information, as done in this study. Moreover, several studies evaluating the benefits of cessation after diagnosis are limited by excluding patients who died within the first several years after diagnosis, thereby eliminating the ability to identify patients whose smoking caused early death. The design and execution of the current study overcomes these prior methodological limitations, confirming the long-term survival benefit of quitting smoking after a cancer diagnosis and extending previous findings that early intervention optimizes survival. Thus, the larger magnitude of survival benefit among patients who received treatment within 6 months of diagnosis suggests that cessation can attenuate mortality risks caused by smoking even within the first few years after diagnosis.

An important clinical implication from this study is that providing a structured smoking cessation program at the time of a cancer diagnosis that is integrated with cancer care can have a demonstrable positive association with life expectancy for patients. Large cancer organizations have been called on to make meaningful cancer advances that will substantially benefit patients, and investing in smoking cessation treatment programs represents an approach that should be a standard component of cancer treatment. Regulatory agencies that provide expedited approval of new cancer therapies emphasize treatments leading to measurable clinical benefit. Ensuring that all patients with cancer who smoke have access to smoking cessation treatment can optimize the effectiveness of cancer treatments and contribute to a substantial benefit in survival, in addition to improved non–cancer-related health outcomes. The results of this study suggest that early entry into tobacco treatment is associated with the best survival outcomes and justifies the need to prioritize tobacco cessation as a core element of first-line cancer care.

### A brief review of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation [^d765afaf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Clinical Practice Guidelines have established both nicotine and nonnicotine-based pharmacotherapies as efficacious treatments for smoking cessation. Smokers attempting to quit smoking can significantly increase their chances by using one of several first-line agents, including nicotine transdermal patches, gum, nasal spray, inhalers, tablets, and the antidepressant bupropion. Those who cannot use either bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy because of contraindications or lack of effectiveness may benefit from the second-line treatment nortriptyline. This article also discusses several novel compounds for smoking cessation.

Figure 1 — Pathway for Tobacco Cessation Treatment — cardiovascular clinicians or other professionals ask tobacco use status with categories including current smoker (daily or nondaily cigarette smoking) and former smoker, then proceed through assessment and treatment steps. In current smokers, clinicians assess nicotine dependence including number of cigarettes per day and time to first cigarette after waking, give advice to quit now, and offer treatment options that include behavioral support and to prescribe pharmacotherapy if not contraindicated. For those starting treatment, a phone call or office visit at 2–4 weeks is used to monitor treatment response, adherence and adverse effects, while those declining receive continuous engagement to quit at every visit. For former smokers, the pathway includes assessment for risk of relapse with relapse prevention advice and continued monitoring of tobacco abstinence and SHS exposure.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^a359c559]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked "best practices" used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for "off-label" use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### Non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation [^f48f0e35]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

International chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines recommend that smokers be strongly advised to quit, and should be offered help in doing so. The most effective smoking-cessation interventions combine behavioural support with pharmacotherapies. For smokers who do not wish to use nicotine replacement treatments, bupropion is a safe and effective non-nicotine alternative first-line treatment. Nortriptyline and clonidine have demonstrated efficacy in aiding smoking cessation, but are regarded as second-line therapies. A number of other non-nicotine treatments show promise, but more data are required before these can be recommended in assisting smokers to stop.

### Treatment of tobacco smoking: a review [^c71c6b16]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.

Observations

Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.

### Update on pharmacologic options for smoking cessation treatment [^41ab7248]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Although the proportion of the adult population in the United States that smokes has decreased steadily, the rate of successful quit attempts is still low. Smokers develop nicotine dependence that resembles other addictions, and may require multiple attempts and long-term treatment to sustain abstinence. Currently available first-line agents for smoking cessation therapy include nicotine replacement therapy, which is available in several formulations, including transdermal patch, gum, nasal spray, inhaler, and lozenge; bupropion, an atypical antidepressant; and varenicline, a partial agonist of the alpha(4)beta(2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that was recently developed and approved specifically for smoking cessation therapy. Second-line agents are nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant agent, and clonidine, an antihypertensive drug. With the exception of varenicline, which has been shown to offer significant improvement in abstinence rates over bupropion, all of the available treatments appear similarly effective. However, the adverse event profiles of nortriptyline and clonidine make them more appropriate for second-line therapy, when first-line treatments have failed or are not tolerated. Rimonabant, a cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist that was being developed for smoking cessation, received a nonapprovable letter from the FDA in 2006 and there is no further information as to whether development for this indication is continuing for this agent. Nicotine vaccines are under investigation and offer promise, especially for relapse prevention. Ultimately, selection of pharmacologic agent should be based on the patient's comorbidities and preferences, as well as on the agent's adverse event profile.

### Attributable failure of first-line cancer treatment and incremental costs associated with smoking by patients with cancer [^a45fa936]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This model showed that continued smoking among patients with cancer was associated with significant incremental costs after failure of first-line cancer treatment. This model did not clarify the potential financial benefits of smoking cessation or alternative therapeutic cancer strategies. However, given the substantial attributable treatment failures and cost associated with continued smoking, development and implementation of effective mitigation strategies appear to be financially justified.

Treatment algorithm for former smokers — relapse risk assessment and timing: Determining the risk of relapse to smoking is the key assessment step for former smokers, assessed by asking how much time has passed since the individual's last use of tobacco products. Most relapses occur within days to weeks after initiating a quit attempt; the risk of relapse remains high for the first month and declines gradually over the next 3 months, but relapses still do occur even after 1 year of abstinence from smoking. Another useful question is how confident a smoker is that he/she will stay quit for the next year, which can be done using a 1 to 10 scale, where 1 indicates "not at all confident" and 10, very confident.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c9dcbf11]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background and aims

Although smoking cessation medications have shown effectiveness in increasing abstinence in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is unclear to what extent benefits persist over time. This paper assesses whether the benefits of smoking cessation medications decline over the first year.

Methods

We selected studies from three systematic reviews published by the Cochrane Collaboration. RCTs of first‐line smoking cessation medications, with 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up, were eligible for inclusion. Meta‐analysis was used to synthesize information on sustained abstinence (SA) at 6 versus 12 months and 3 versus 6 months, using the risk difference (RD) ('net benefit') between intervention and control group quit rates, the relative risk (RR) and the odds ratio (OR).

Results

Sixty‐one studies (27 647 participants) were included. Fewer than 40% of intervention group participants were sustained abstinent at 3 months (bupropion: 37.1%; nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): 34.8%; varenicline: 39.3%); approximately a quarter were sustained abstinent at 6 months (bupropion: 25.9%; NRT: 26.6%; varenicline: 25.4%), and approximately a fifth were sustained abstinent at 12 months (bupropion: 19.9%; NRT: 19.8%%; varenicline: 18.7%). There was only a small decline in RR (3 months: 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.74–2.18, P < 0.0001]; 6 months: 1.87 (95% CI = 1.67–2.08 P < 0.0001); 12 months: 1.75 (95% CI = 1.56–1.95, P < 0.0001) between intervention and control groups over time, but a substantial decline in net benefit [3 months: RD = 17.3% (14.5–20.1%); 6 months: RD = 11.8% (10.0–13.7%); 12 months: RD = 8.2% (6.8–9.6%)]. The decline in net benefit was statistically significant between 3 and 6 [RD = 4.95% (95% CI = 3.49–6.41%), P < 0.0001] and 6 and 12 months [RD = 3.00% (95% CI = 2.36%–3.64%), P < 0.0001)] for medications combined and individual medications.

Conclusions

The proportion of smokers who use smoking cessation medications who benefit from doing so decreases during the course of the first year, but a net benefit still remains at 12 months.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f1f703e5]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Based on 27 647 participants in 61 trials of first‐line recommended smoking cessation medications, this study showed that the benefit of medications diminished during the course of the first year. The net benefit to the intervention declined by 4.95% (95% CI = 3.49–6.41%, P < 0.0001) points from 3 to 6 months and by 3.00% (95% CI = 2.36–3.64%, P < 0.0001) points from 6 to 12 months. This decline was observed for each main category of smoking cessation medications: bupropion, NRT and varenicline. Although a decline in SA RR was found for all medications combined and for NRT at 6‐12 months, the magnitude of the decline was very small, so that relative risks essentially remained constant.

These empirical findings, which show large changes over time in RD and only very slight changes in RR, have a clear theoretical basis: it is a mathematical fact that under conditions of constant relative risks and decreasing quit rates the net benefit, as expressed by the RD, will decrease 35. This is illustrated with hypothetical data in Fig. 3. Of note is that if cessation medications were to induce permanent cessation — the true goal as stated by Stapleton nearly 20 years ago 35 — then the declining quit rates in the control groups would not be matched by declining quit rates in intervention groups, and both RR and RD would increase over time.

Figure 3
Illustrative example using hypothetical data: how net benefit of medications decreases over time with declining quit rates and stable relative risk

The net benefit of medications was 11.8% (95% CI = 10.0–13.7%, P < 0.0001) at 6 months. West has shown that due to the enormous benefits of quitting smoking, increases of even 1% in 6‐month continuous abstinence rates lead to 3 years of life gained for every 100 smokers treated 23. The 11.8% calculated benefit is therefore of substantial clinical importance and cost‐beneficial.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^46cdf97f]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Helping smokers quit is a critical, yet often perplexing role for physicians. While pharmacotherapy generally doubles the odds of quitting successfully, these smoking cessation aids are not widely prescribed or used by smokers. Although guidelines exist in several countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand) – that recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion SR as first-line medication, limited data are available to guide clinicians in selecting specific forms of pharmacotherapy for individual smokers. While varenicline, a new pharmacotherapeutic option, has demonstrated therapeutic superiority over existing first-line medications, – post-marketing reviews have recently raised safety concerns regarding varenicline.

The health benefits of smoking cessation are well documented. Smokers who quit reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer and increase their life expectancy substantially. While most smokers make several quit attempts before they succeed, about one in four who use any pharmacotherapy will eventually quit smoking. Evidence indicates that pharmacotherapy increases the odds of success and may reduce symptoms of withdrawal for those who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day. While a few studies have shown that pharmacotherapy works even in the absence of psychosocial therapies, most studies show that combining pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatments increases quit rates.

A Cochrane reviewincluding 123 trials concluded that all types of NRT increased the odds of quitting by approximately one-and-a-half to twofold. In addition, the effectiveness of NRT was independent of the intensity of behavioural support provided to the smoker. Bupropion SR and nortriptyline (antidepressants) were found to increase rates of smoking cessation in a Cochrane review of antidepressants including 53 trials. When prescribed as monotherapy, bupropion (31 trials) and nortriptyline (four trials) both doubled the odds of cessation. Bupropion and nortriptyline appear to have similar effectiveness to NRT. Other antidepressants (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, moclobemide, venlafaxine) have not shown significant benefit as an aid to smoking cessation. While studies of rimonabant have been completed, no reviews currently exist and there have been conflicting results regarding its efficacy in the US and Europe.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0a6cba1e]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the most common cause of preventable death in the world today 1, 2, causing more than 7 million deaths per year 3. The fastest way to reduce the burden of smoking is through smoking cessation by current smokers 4. The effectiveness of US FDA‐recommended first‐line smoking cessation medications 5 is undisputed when considering evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration 6, 7, 8, the US Public Health Services, 5 England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 9 and others 10, 11, 12, 13 show consistently that smoking cessation medications help smokers quit.

However, the magnitude of benefit to individual smokers and populations is less well understood. There are two sources of confusion. First, it is possible that the benefits of medications decline, even in the context of RCTs. Many smokers who quit relapse 14, 15, 16, 17, leading to declines in quit rates over time 18, 19, 20, 21. This is well illustrated by a recent study (n = 1086), which found initial quit rates of at least 24 hours' duration to be 70–80%, with declines over time to approximately 20% for varenicline, nicotine patch and combination nicotine groups by 1 year 22. Original reports of studies often describe quit rates at a single time‐point, with 6 months used as a standard, on the grounds that it is possible to 'make reliable estimates of permanent cessation' on the basis of 6‐month continued abstinence 23. Reviews and meta‐analyses usually provide a single summary measure based on quit rates at a single time‐point, or as a summary based on several time‐points (Cochrane Reviews: 6 months or more, 6–24 months 6, 7, 8; the US Public Health Service: 6 months 5; independent reviewers: 6 or 12 months 10, 12.). Representing smoking cessation at a single or composite time‐point obscures the more complex reality of declining quit rates: neither the benefit to an individual as time progresses nor to a population is easily grasped. The problem is compounded because few studies continue beyond 1 year 6, 7, 8.

Offer treatment and connect to resources — "The third step is to offer smoking cessation treatment, which translates into providing a pharmacotherapy prescription and actively connecting the patient to behavioral support resources", and patients "are encouraged to set a quit date, usually within the next month, to provide a structure for the quit attempt". Under pharmacotherapy, "Pharmacotherapy should be offered to every patient who is willing to accept it, with rare exceptions", and "It can also be started even in patients who are not ready to quit smoking immediately, because it can help motivate patients to reduce their smoking and increase the odds of them eventually making a quit attempt"; "Prescriptions should be written even for over-the-counter medications" to support coverage, reinforcement, and documentation. For behavioral support, "Either the clinician or office staff should proactively connect a smoker to his/her preferred form of behavioral support", and "Studies have shown that a clinician's active referral to a behavioral support program for smoking cessation is more effective than simply providing advice or information about these".

Advice to quit — clinicians are instructed that "The second step is to provide strong, clear, personalized advice to the smoker to quit all tobacco use as soon as possible", and the advice "should be tailored to the individual's specific health situation and should emphasize the benefits of stopping smoking" rather than harms; an example phrase is, "As your doctor (or healthcare provider), I want you to know that quitting smoking now is the best way for you to improve your health". For smokers who are post-myocardial infarction, the clinician "can emphasize the rapid reduction in the chance of future CV morbidity and mortality" by saying, "Quitting smoking now is the best way for you to avoid another heart attack", and after percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, or interventions for peripheral artery disease, the clinician "can emphasize the importance of quitting to preserve stent or graft patency".

### A systematic review of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for people with severe mental ill health-what works? [^ea2f58a9]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

People with severe mental ill health smoke more and suffer greater smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the effectiveness of behavioural interventions for smoking cessation in this group. This review evaluated randomized controlled trial evidence to measure the effectiveness of behavioural smoking cessation interventions (both digital and non-digital) in people with severe mental ill health.

Design

Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis. We searched between inception and January 2020 in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Health Management Information Consortium and CENTRAL databases.

Setting and Participants

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of behavioural smoking cessation and reduction interventions in adults with severe mental ill health, conducted in any country, in either in-patient or community settings and published in English.

Measurements

The primary outcome was biochemically verified smoking cessation. Smoking reduction and changes in mental health symptoms and body mass index (BMI) were included as secondary outcomes. Narrative data synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted and the quality of included studies was appraised using the risk of bias 2 (RoB2) tool.

Findings

We included 12 individual studies (16 articles) involving 1861 participants. The first meta-analysis (three studies, 921 participants) demonstrated effectiveness of bespoke face-to-face interventions compared with usual care across all time-points [medium-term: relative risk (RR) = 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38–3.81; long-term: RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.09–2.30]. The second (three studies, 275 participants) did not demonstrate any difference in effectiveness of bespoke digital on-line interventions compared with standard digital on-line interventions (medium-term: RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.17–4.46). A narrative overview revealed mixed results when comparing bespoke face-to-face interventions with other active interventions. The methodological quality of studies was mixed, with the majority having some concerns mainly around risk of selective reporting.

Conclusions

Face-to-face bespoke smoking cessation interventions for adults with severe mental ill health appear to be effective when compared with treatment as usual, but evidence is equivocal when compared with other active interventions. There is limited evidence comparing bespoke digital interventions with generic interventions, and we found no studies comparing them with usual treatment.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0d6c7bff]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The second reason for confusion is the nearly exclusive use of the relative risk (RR) (the ratio of the probability of success in intervention versus control groups) or odds ratio (OR) (the ratio of the odds of success in intervention versus control groups) to describe intervention effects. These measures have been shown to be stable over time and settings in smoking cessation 24, 25. However, like all summary measures, they provide only partial information. An RR of 2 indicates that medication doubles the probability of quitting; it could equally well describe an intervention group quit rate of 2% and a control group quit rate of 1% or an intervention quit rate of 80% and a control quit rate of 40%. These represent vastly different scenarios in terms of benefit to individuals or populations. The risk difference (RD), another important summary measure, overcomes this problem: it presents differences in probabilities of success between intervention and control groups, allowing consideration of the magnitude of benefit. The corresponding RDs for our examples are 1 and 40%, respectively. However, the RD is used far less often than the RR or the OR. Cochrane Reviews generally present RRs in the results of smoking cessation medication reviews 6, 7, 8, while NICE 9 and others 10, 11, 12, 13 present ORs. The European guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention describes relative benefit based on the OR: 'Overall, NRT and bupropion help ∼80% more people to quit than placebo' (26, p. 92). Information on the percentage of people who benefit from treatment is often absent 26 or unclear 7, 8.

In this study, we assessed effects and changes in effects of cessation medication over time from published RCTs, with several complementary measures. Using studies included in Cochrane Collaboration Systematic Reviews, we present quit rates, RRs, RDs, and ORs from RCTs of first‐line smoking cessation medications at three time‐points (3, 6 and 12 months), and test whether benefits decreased over time.

Inpatient pharmacotherapy and counseling — Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is used because of its rapid onset of action and overall safety, with the nicotine patch the most often used product because of its ability to sustain nicotine levels over a 24-hour period and short-acting nicotine products (lozenges, gum, or an inhaler) used as needed to manage acute cravings in the hospital. Using nicotine replacement in the hospital also increases the odds that a smoker will use the medication after discharge, and adding nicotine replacement to counseling increases hospitalized smokers' odds of long-term abstinence; for discharge, TOB-3 states to offer tobacco cessation treatment at hospital discharge, documenting the offer of both pharmacotherapy and counseling that will continue after discharge, with a prescription for a smoking cessation medication in the discharge medication list satisfying the pharmacotherapy criterion, and all cessation medications (NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) safe to prescribe at hospital discharge, even in patients admitted with ACS, with combination NRT and varenicline considered first-line options.

Recommended pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) — Outpatient with stable CVD first-line options are varenicline or combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); second-line options are bupropion or a single NRT product; third line is nortriptyline. If a single agent is insufficient to achieve abstinence, combine categories: varenicline + NRT (single agent), varenicline + bupropion, or bupropion + NRT (single agent). For inpatient acute coronary syndromes (ACS), in-hospital therapy to relieve nicotine withdrawal is a nicotine patch or combination NRT, with at-discharge options of combination NRT or varenicline; at-discharge second line is a single NRT product and third line is bupropion. Combination NRT comprises a nicotine patch plus the patient's choice of gum, lozenge, inhaler, or spray; some would start varenicline in-hospital and others at discharge, and regardless, continue nicotine patch or short-acting form for 1 week during up‑titration. Nortriptyline is not FDA‑approved for smoking cessation and has few data in CVD, and bupropion is listed as 3rd line because of no evidence of efficacy when started during hospitalization for acute ACS or acute MI, though no special safety concerns are noted.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^876ce4c8]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Our primary goal was to examine changes in effectiveness of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first‐line smoking cessation medications [bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (all five approved forms) and varenicline] 5 over time among participants in RCTs. The specific objectives were (1) to compare the effects of the intervention versus control on the proportion of sustained abstainers (SA) from smoking at 6 and 12 months, and on the proportion of people who were quit at 6 and 12 months [point prevalence quit rate (PP)] and (2) to measure the interaction effect (i.e. the change) with time across these two time‐points (6 and 12 months), on the scale of risk differences, relative risks and ORs for the medications. A secondary goal was to examine changes from 3 to 6 months.

### National trends in cessation counseling, prescription medication use, and associated costs among US adult cigarette smokers [^a468c92f]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States despite the considerable decrease in smoking prevalence since the release more than 50 years ago of the first US Surgeon General's report on the health implications of cigarette smoking. An estimated 480 0000 US residents die of smoking-related illnesses each year. Overall, smoking costs the nation at least $130 billion in medical care and more than $150 billion in lost productivity annually. Consequently, federally sponsored programs, like Medicare, and private health plans have an enormous economic burden. An estimated 60% of the US health care spending attributable to cigarette smoking is paid by public programs.

Smoking cessation substantially reduces smoking-related morbidity and mortality. When used separately or in combination, smoking cessation counseling and cessation pharmacotherapies are associated with higher cessation rates. Even brief cessation advice or counseling by health care professionals has been associated with effectiveness. Thus, clinical guidelines recommend that smoking cessation counseling be addressed at every clinical visit.

In the United States, 7 US Food and Drug Administration–approved smoking cessation pharmacotherapies are available, including 5 forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as well as bupropion hydrochloride and varenicline tartrate. The NRTs are available over the counter (OTC), but the 2 non-NRT medications are prescription only. Although each of these agents is more efficacious than placebo in smoking cessation, clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated superior efficacy of prescription non-NRT, especially varenicline, as compared with OTC NRT. Thus, the 2018 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Tobacco Cessation Treatment guidelines recommend prescription varenicline as the first-line pharmacotherapeutic agent for smoking cessation. Nonetheless, data are lacking on trends in the uptake of prescription smoking cessation therapies, and their associated costs, among the general population of US adult smokers.

The objective of this study was to present the 10-year trends in physician advice to quit smoking and prescription smoking cessation medication use along with their associated total and out-of-pocket expenditures in a nationally representative sample of adult active smokers in the United States.

### Comparison of available treatments for tobacco addiction [^6f59867b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem that causes more than 5 million deaths annually worldwide. Cigarette smoking is especially common among individuals with psychiatric comorbidity, including individuals with primary psychiatric disorders and other addictions. Effective behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation are available. Behavioral treatments including brief (< 3 min) counseling by physicians are effective. Seven first-line pharmacologic treatments are currently available: five nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion, and varenicline. In addition, clonidine and nortriptyline are second-line treatments for smoking cessation. These treatments increase the chances of quitting smoking by two- to threefold, supporting their use in smokers who are motivated to quit. However, effective treatments for many subpopulations, including smokers with psychiatric comorbidities as well as adolescent, pregnant, or postpartum smokers, remain to be developed and represent an important challenge.

Heaviness of Smoking Index — two-question nicotine dependence assessment and scoring are specified, with cigarette consumption options of 0: 10 or fewer, 1: 11–20, 2: 21–30, and 3: ≥ 31, and time-to-first-cigarette options of 0: After 60 minutes, 1: 31–60 minutes, 2: 6–30 minutes, and 3: within 5 minutes; summed scores classify dependence as 0–2 = low, 3–4 = moderate, and 5–6 = high. Asking these 2 questions "is a simple, reliable, and validated test to assess the strength of a daily smoker's nicotine dependence", has "equivalent or stronger validity in predicting relapse back to smoking after a quit attempt than other longer tests", and dependence strength is "important for tailoring the intensity of treatment or dose of pharmacotherapy recommended".

### Nonpharmacologic therapy for smoking cessation: characteristics and efficacy of current approaches [^68e2e652]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the most common nonpharmacologic approaches used to support smoking cessation and, where possible, provides estimates of their efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Virtually all of the approaches that have been systematically evaluated to date have demonstrated modest efficacy in increasing quit rates. A cornerstone of effective treatment is tobacco dependence counseling, for which there is a dose-response relation between the intensity of counseling (total minutes of contact) and its effectiveness. New approaches in which treatment is tailored to individual patient characteristics appear promising for the future but require further study. Also, new technologies that permit delivery of smoking interventions to a wider range of patients could have a significant impact on reducing smoking prevalence worldwide in the future. Overall, the clinical literature strongly endorses combining nonpharmacologic interventions with pharmacotherapy to optimize support for smokers who are trying to quit.

Even after a cancer diagnosis, for any stage and prognosis, patients with cancer can reap health benefits from smoking cessation. To address the clinical problems associated with smoking in cancer patients, the NCCN created a new set of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for 2015. At NCCN 20th Annual Conference, Dr. Peter Shields presented these inaugural guidelines, focusing primarily on the adverse outcomes associated with smoking in patients with cancer, the common barriers to smoking cessation in this patient population, simple yet effective assessment approaches, and treatment recommendations that center on the combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy.

Follow-up after a quit attempt — timing and content: Because a smoker's risk of relapse is highest in the first few days and weeks after making a quit attempt, a follow-up contact to monitor a patient's tobacco cessation treatment should occur within 2 to 4 weeks of the initial visit, either in person, by phone from the office, or via a patient portal in the EHR, and actions that should occur in follow-up contacts include assessing smoking status, asking about adherence and response to treatments, providing support and encouragement to remain or become smoke-free, and addressing interim issues; for current smokers who decline treatment at the visit, treatments should be offered again at every subsequent visit.

Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (Figure 3.5) — major findings and recommendations from the Tobacco Use & Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline Panel state that tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that warrants repeated treatment until long-term or permanent abstinence is achieved; effective treatments exist and all tobacco users should be offered these treatments; clinicians and health care delivery systems must operationalize the consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user at every visit; brief smoking cessation counseling is effective and every tobacco user should be offered such advice at every contact with health care providers; there is a strong dose-response relation between the intensity of tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness; three types of counseling have been found to be especially effective: practical counseling, social support of family and friends as part of treatment, and social support arranged outside of treatment; first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence — varenicline, nortriptyline, bupropion sustained release, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch — are effective and at least one of these medications should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications; financial incentive programs for smoking cessation may facilitate smoking cessation; tobacco dependence treatments are cost effective interventions.

### An RCT with the combination of varenicline and bupropion for smoking cessation: clinical implications for front line use [^be14d4f3]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite the availability of several efficacious smoking cessation treatments, fewer than 25% of smokers who quit remain abstinent 1 year post-treatment. This study aimed to determine if varenicline and bupropion combination treatment would result in higher abstinence rates than varenicline alone.

Design

A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group smoking cessation clinical trial in which participants were exposed to 12 weeks of treatment and followed for 12 months.

Setting

Hospital-based out-patient clinic in Texas, USA specializing in cancer prevention.

Participants

A total of 385 community smokers (58.44% male) who smoked 1 pack of cigarettes/day [mean = 19.66 cigarettes/day, standard deviation (SD) = 9.45]; had average carbon monoxide (CO) of 26.43 parts per million (SD = 13.74); and were moderately dependent (Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence = 4.79; SD = 2.07).

Interventions and Comparator

Smokers were randomized in a 3: 1 (active: Placebo) ratio to 12 weeks of treatment as follows: placebo (n = 56), varenicline (Var; n = 166), and varenicline + bupropion (Combo; n = 163).

Measurements

A priori primary outcome: prolonged abstinence at 12 months.

Secondary Outcomes

7-day point prevalence abstinence and continuous abstinence; all abstinence measures at end of treatment and 6-month follow-ups.

Findings

Intention-to-treat analysis: the Combo group (n = 163) failed to demonstrate superiority to the Var group (n = 166) for prolonged abstinence at 12 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50–1.64], supported by Bayes factor = 0.06. Both the Var (OR = 6.66, 95% CI = 1.61–59.27) and Combo groups (OR = 6.06, 95% CI = 1.45–54.09) demonstrated superiority to the Placebo group (n = 56; score = 8.38, P < 0.016).

Conclusions

The addition of bupropion to varenicline treatment does not appear to increase smoking abstinence rates above that of varenicline alone. The findings support previous research showing a consistently favorable effect of both varenicline and the combination of varenicline and bupropion on smoking cessation compared with placebo.

### Smoking cessation [^816b9c9b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Smoking is a risk factor for the four leading causes of death in the United States, yet 48 million Americans — 24% of the U.S. adult population — continue to smoke. Approximately 70% of people who smoke visit a physician each year, yet only half report ever being advised to quit smoking by their physician. Smoking cessation is difficult due to nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Expert groups such as the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research offer protocols for smoking cessation that primary care physicians can use in their office practice. Recent developments in the pharmacotherapy of smoking cessation has led the U.S. Public Health Service to update the practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence. Pharmacotherapy, which includes nicotine replacement therapy, offers assistance to patients who want to stop smoking. However, the cost of pharmacotherapy may be a barrier for some. Other nonpharmacologic therapies, such as counseling, are also effective.

### Motivating and helping smokers to stop smoking [^25e5a55c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Smokers try to quit only once every 2 to 3 years and most do not use proven treatments. Repeated, brief, diplomatic advice increases quit rates. Such advice should include a clear request to quit, reinforcing personal risks of smoking and their reversibility, offering solutions to barriers to quitting, and offering treatment. All smokers should be encouraged to use both medications and counseling. Scientifically proven, first-line medications are nicotine gum, inhaler, lozenge, and patch plus the nonnicotine medication bupropion. Proven second-line medications are clonidine, nicotine nasal spray, and nortriptyline. These medications are equally effective and safe and the incidence of dependence is very small. The proven psychosocial therapies are behavioral and supportive therapies. These are as effective as medications and are effective via individual counseling, group, and telephone formats. The writing of this article was supported in part by Senior Scientist Award DA-00450 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

### Randomized trial of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and NRT plus bupropion for smoking cessation: effectiveness in clinical practice [^b429fa3d]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The antidepressant bupropion hydrochloride SR (Zyban; GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) was introduced as the first non-nicotine medicine for smoking cessation following a manufacturer-sponsored Phase III trial. The main result showed bupropion to be substantially more beneficial than a nicotine patch, the most widely used type of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22–3.53]. In combination, bupropion and the patch were superior to the patch alone, although not compared with bupropion alone.

Despite the importance of this primary result, only two small trials have since compared bupropion with NRT, both failing to show a difference. When data from the three trials are summarized, the result is equivocal because of a suggestion of heterogeneity and uncertainty about the most appropriate pooling model. Bupropion is more effective using fixed-effect modelling (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.01–2.37), but not with a random-effect model (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.71–2.56). There has been more interest in combination treatment, with five subsequent small trials all failing to find a benefit for bupropion plus NRT compared with NRT alone, albeit with widely different study populations and smoking phenotypes–. In all six trials there is no evidence of benefit (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.63–2.62 — author random-effects meta-analysis). No trials have since tested the combination against bupropion alone, arguably a more relevant comparison given that the evidence points towards bupropion being more effective than NRT.

With much uncertainty remaining, we conducted an effectiveness trial of these therapies in a clinical practice setting. Three main questions were addressed: (i) is there a difference in effectiveness between NRT and bupropion; (ii) is the combination superior to either treatment alone; and (iii) can subgroups be identified who would benefit more from one or other treatment?

### Impact of smoking status on clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor-based regimens [^23112e4a]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Smoking tobacco products has been consistently linked with an increased risk of developing renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The association between smoking and RCC seems to be dose-dependent, with heavier smoking resulting in a higher risk of RCC. Notably, smoking cessation reduces the risk of RCC, with long-term cessation leading to substantial benefits. Moreover, active smoking negatively impacts the efficacy of targeted therapies, which constitute an essential component of standard-of-care systemic regimens used for the treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC). Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations represent the recommended first-line regimens for the treatment of mRCC. However, the impact of smoking status on the response to these therapies has not been clearly evaluated in mRCC.

In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is hypothesized that carcinogens present in cigarettes can induce mutations that result in a greater number of neoantigens, thereby enhancing immunogenicity and response to immunotherapy. In lung adenocarcinoma, 80% of patients with high tumor mutation burden (TMB) had a recent smoking history, compared to just 19% of those with low TMB. In line with these findings, patients with NSCLC who had a history of smoking and were treated with first-line pembrolizumab had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) when compared to those who had never smoked. Similarly, in the context of NSCLC and response to pembrolizumab, tumors displaying a smoking-associated molecular signature showed better clinical outcomes in response to treatment. However, the same mutational smoking signature affects the tumor immune microenvironment differently depending on the anatomical location, leading to either immunosuppression or inflammation. This difference underscores the importance of studying the effect of smoking on the effectiveness of immunotherapy in different types of cancer. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of smoking status on survival outcomes and treatment response in patients with mRCC treated with first-line ICI-based combination therapies in a real-world setting.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e7dae1a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I² = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I² = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I² = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I² = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I² = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I² = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

### Retreatment with varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers who have previously taken varenicline: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^9de1b470]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Tobacco dependence continues to kill an estimated 5 million tobacco users each year worldwide. Most smokers would like to quit, and many make several quit attempts each year. However, few are able to achieve permanent or long-term abstinence (≥ 6 months) from smoking with a single quit attempt. This chronic cycling of periods of tobacco use followed by periods of abstinence and periods of relapsein highly dependent smokers has resulted in such tobacco dependence being defined as a chronic disease. Treatment guidelines encourage clinicians to prescribe/recommend medications plus counseling for each quit attempt. Repeated medication-assisted quit attempts can result in progressively greater abstinence over time. Even if increasing the frequency of quit attempts per year does not result in long periods of abstinence, these attempts may still be clinically important by reducing exposure to toxicants in tobacco smoke and improving lung function.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^5925ab0f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation: an overview and network meta-analysis [^e9c0cb6d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death worldwide. Some medications have been proven to help people to quit, with three licensed for this purpose in Europe and the USA: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline. Cytisine (a treatment pharmacologically similar to varenicline) is also licensed for use in Russia and some of the former socialist economy countries. Other therapies, including nortriptyline, have also been tested for effectiveness.

Objectives

How do NRT, bupropion and varenicline compare with placebo and with each other in achieving long-term abstinence (six months or longer)? How do the remaining treatments compare with placebo in achieving long-term abstinence? How do the risks of adverse and serious adverse events (SAEs) compare between the treatments, and are there instances where the harms may outweigh the benefits?

Methods

The overview is restricted to Cochrane reviews, all of which include randomised trials. Participants are usually adult smokers, but we exclude reviews of smoking cessation for pregnant women and in particular disease groups or specific settings. We cover nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants (bupropion and nortriptyline), nicotine receptor partial agonists (varenicline and cytisine), anxiolytics, selective type 1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists (rimonabant), clonidine, lobeline, dianicline, mecamylamine, Nicobrevin, opioid antagonists, nicotine vaccines, and silver acetate. Our outcome for benefit is continuous or prolonged abstinence at least six months from the start of treatment. Our outcome for harms is the incidence of serious adverse events associated with each of the treatments. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) in The Cochrane Library, for any reviews with 'smoking' in the title, abstract or keyword fields. The last search was conducted in November 2012. We assessed methodological quality using a revised version of the AMSTAR scale. For NRT, bupropion and varenicline we conducted network meta-analyses, comparing each with the others and with placebo for benefit, and varenicline and bupropion for risks of serious adverse events.

Main Results

We identified 12 treatment-specific reviews. The analyses covered 267 studies, involving 101,804 participants. Both NRT and bupropion were superior to placebo (odds ratios (OR) 1.84; 95% credible interval (CredI) 1.71 to 1.99, and 1.82; 95% CredI 1.60 to 2.06 respectively). Varenicline increased the odds of quitting compared with placebo (OR 2.88; 95% CredI 2.40 to 3.47). Head-to-head comparisons between bupropion and NRT showed equal efficacy (OR 0.99; 95% CredI 0.86 to 1.13). Varenicline was superior to single forms of NRT (OR 1.57; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.91), and to bupropion (OR 1.59; 95% CredI 1.29 to 1.96). Varenicline was more effective than nicotine patch (OR 1.51; 95% CredI 1.22 to 1.87), than nicotine gum (OR 1.72; 95% CredI 1.38 to 2.13), and than 'other' NRT (inhaler, spray, tablets, lozenges; OR 1.42; 95% CredI 1.12 to 1.79), but was not more effective than combination NRT (OR 1.06; 95% CredI 0.75 to 1.48). Combination NRT also outperformed single formulations. The four categories of NRT performed similarly against each other, apart from 'other' NRT, which was marginally more effective than NRT gum (OR 1.21; 95% CredI 1.01 to 1.46). Cytisine (a nicotine receptor partial agonist) returned positive findings (risk ratio (RR) 3.98; 95% CI 2.01 to 7.87), without significant adverse events or SAEs. Across the 82 included and excluded bupropion trials, our estimate of six seizures in the bupropion arms versus none in the placebo arms was lower than the expected rate (1:1000), at about 1:1500. SAE meta-analysis of the bupropion studies demonstrated no excess of neuropsychiatric (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.50) or cardiovascular events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.59). SAE meta-analysis of 14 varenicline trials found no difference between the varenicline and placebo arms (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.55), and subgroup analyses detected no significant excess of neuropsychiatric events (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.67), or of cardiac events (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56). Nortriptyline increased the chances of quitting (RR 2.03; 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). Neither nortriptyline nor bupropion were shown to enhance the effect of NRT compared with NRT alone. Clonidine increased the chances of quitting (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), but this was offset by a dose-dependent rise in adverse events. Mecamylamine in combination with NRT may increase the chances of quitting, but the current evidence is inconclusive. Other treatments failed to demonstrate a benefit compared with placebo. Nicotine vaccines are not yet licensed for use as an aid to smoking cessation or relapse prevention. Nicobrevin's UK license is now revoked, and the manufacturers of rimonabant, taranabant and dianicline are no longer supporting the development or testing of these treatments.

Authors' Conclusions

NRT, bupropion, varenicline and cytisine have been shown to improve the chances of quitting. Combination NRT and varenicline are equally effective as quitting aids. Nortriptyline also improves the chances of quitting. On current evidence, none of the treatments appear to have an incidence of adverse events that would mitigate their use. Further research is warranted into the safety of varenicline and into cytisine's potential as an effective and affordable treatment, but not into the efficacy and safety of NRT.

Postcessation weight gain — prevalence, mitigation, and counseling — notes that about 80% of smokers gain an average of 3 to 6 kg in the first 3 months after quitting, yet this weight gain does not attenuate the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of tobacco abstinence. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help control or mitigate weight gain, and a Cochrane review found bupropion, NRT, and varenicline reduced postcessation weight change while the medication was being used, although these medications appear to delay rather than prevent weight gain. It is reasonable to advise patients not to replace cigarettes with food, to decrease high fat consumption, and to increase physical activity. Patients with an elevated body mass index who smoke should be advised to focus first on smoking cessation rather than weight loss; a "Maintain, Don't gain" approach can be recommended, and daily exercise should be strongly encouraged in line with guidance recommending adults achieve 30 minutes per day of brisk exercise on most days of the week.

Regarding medical management for tobacco use, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, nicotine replacement therapy, USPHS 2008 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following combinations of first-line pharmacotherapy in patients willing to quit:

- long-term (> 14 weeks) nicotine patch and other nicotine replacement therapy (gum and spray)

- nicotine patch and nicotine inhaler

- nicotine patch and sustained-release bupropion.

### Prevention and treatment of tobacco Use: JACC health promotion series [^ed226116]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both prevention of smoking initiation among youth and smoking cessation among established smokers are key for reducing smoking prevalence and the associated negative health consequences. Proven tobacco cessation treatment includes pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, which are most effective when provided together. First-line medications (varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement) are effective and safe for patients with CVD. Clinicians who care for patients with CVD should give as high a priority to treating tobacco use as to managing other CVD risk factors. Broader tobacco control efforts to raise tobacco taxes, adopt smoke-free laws, conduct mass media campaigns, and restrict tobacco marketing enhance clinicians' actions working with individual smokers.

Varenicline mechanism and comparative effectiveness for smoking cessation — Varenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor that mediates brain dopamine release and is believed to be the primary mediator of nicotine addiction. As a partial agonist, varenicline activates the nicotine receptor, producing about 50% of the maximal effects at this receptor and thereby reducing the intensity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, while binding tightly to the nicotine receptor prevents receptor binding by nicotine from cigarette smoke and reduces the rewarding effects of smoking. Varenicline is proven to be more effective in promoting smoking cessation than single NRT or bupropion in several clinical trials; the largest was the EAGLES randomized controlled trial, which included over 8,000 smokers and compared varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo given for 12 weeks along with brief counseling.

Search strategy

Searches were conducted in PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), PsycINFO (Ebsco), SciELO, WHO Global Index Medicus and Scopus from inception to 4 April 2018, using search strategies that were collaboratively developed by the first author (M.O. A.) and librarian (L.C.O'D.). The search utilized randomized controlled trial (RCT) filters to identify titles on smoking cessation in LMICs. Search terms included 'smoke', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco', 'tobacco use', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco use cessation products' and term variants, in combination with countries identified as LMICs if the per‐capita gross national income was below $12 235, based on the most recent World Bank classification 15. The full list of search strategies is available in Supporting information, S1.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included RCTs of individual‐level smoking cessation interventions recommended by national guidelines 16, 17. Recommended interventions fell into two groups: (1) pharmacotherapy; and (2) behavioral interventions (brief advice, behavioral counseling, tailored self‐help materials). First‐line pharmacotherapies are nicotine replacement therapies (NRT), bupropion and varenicline. Some national guidelines recommend nortriptyline or clonidine 16. A combination of behavioral intervention and pharmacotherapy is also recommended. Although delivery of smoking cessation interventions by mobile phones are yet to be recommended, we included mobile phone interventions because of their potential to improve access to smoking cessation services in LMICs 18. Comparators included usual care, placebo or a less intense smoking cessation intervention(s). Study participants were adult current cigarette smokers residing in LMICs. Studies were required to have at least 6 months' follow‐up from the start of the intervention until outcome assessment. We excluded policy‐level interventions, mass media campaigns or interventions targeting someone other than the smoker.

### Cost-effectiveness of point of care smoking cessation interventions in oncology clinics [^f73dee75]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Cancer treatment failures and mortality

The number of first-line cancer treatment failures (FTF) and second-line treatment failures (STF) and costs of subsequent cancer treatments (due to failure) were calculated for each group by cancer site using methods and data similar to those used by Iragorri et al. Treatment failure rates used to calculate both FTFs and STFs were 52% for patients who continued to smoke and 40% for those who quit smoking. The one-year mortality rates by cancer site provided by HHN Decision's Support and the New Brunswick Vital Statistics Database were 26.4%, 5.1%, 14.3%, 4.5%, and 12.4% for lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, and other cancers, respectively. The same treatment failure, cessation, and mortality rates were assumed for first-line and second-line treatment phases.

The number of treatment failures that were attributable to continued smoking (attributable failures [AFs]) were calculated for each group by cancer site as follows:

The total number of FTF and STF by cancer site and by group are presented in Supplementary Table S2 and the number of AFs are in Supplementary Table S3.

### Safety and efficacy of first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies in bipolar disorders: subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^adbaa98d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Post hoc analyses of EAGLES data to examine safety and efficacy of first-line smoking cessation pharmacotherapies in smokers with bipolar disorders (BD).

Methods

Smokers with BD I/II (n = 285; 81.4% with BD I) and a comparison nonpsychiatric cohort (NPC; n = 2794) were randomly assigned to varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or placebo for 12 weeks, plus weekly counseling. Primary outcomes were occurrence of moderate to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPSAEs) and Weeks 9–12 biochemically-confirmed continuous abstinence (CA) rates.

Results

For BD smokers, NPSAE risk differences versus placebo were: varenicline, 6.17 (95% CI: -7.84 to 20.18); bupropion, 4.09 (-8.82 to 16.99); NRT, -0.56 (-12.34 to 11.22). ORs for Weeks 9–12 CA, comparing active medication to placebo among BD smokers were: varenicline, 2.61 (0.68–9.95); bupropion, 1.29 (0.31–5.37), NRT, 0.71 (0.14–3.74). Pooling across treatments, NPSAE occurrence was higher (10.7% versus 2.3%; P < 0.001) and CA rates were lower (22.8% versus 13.3%; P = 0.008) in BD than NPC.

Limitations

Study not powered to detect differences in safety and efficacy in the BD subcohort; generalizability limited to stably treated BD without current substance use disorders.

Conclusions

Smokers with BD had higher risk of NPSAEs and were less likely to quit overall than NPC smokers. Among smokers with BD, NPSAE risk difference estimates for active treatments versus placebo ranged from 1% lower to 6% higher. Efficacy of varenicline in smokers with BD was similar to EAGLES main outcomes; bupropion and NRT effect sizes were descriptively lower. Varenicline may be a tolerable and effective cessation treatment for smokers with BD.

### Assessment of racial differences in pharmacotherapy efficacy for smoking cessation: secondary analysis of the EAGLES randomized clinical trial [^f7fbd410]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

All active treatments had greater efficacy than placebo for White smokers at long-term follow-up (week 24) but only varenicline had greater relative efficacy than placebo for Black smokers. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of the relative efficacy of 3 active treatments and placebo by race in a single study, with the data indicating that varenicline appears to be the best first-line treatment for both Black and White smokers. This is consistent with previous research that suggests that varenicline is the most effective of available smoking cessation pharmacotherapies.

Lack of difference in the long-term relative efficacy of bupropion and NRT to placebo in Black smokers should be interpreted in light of the time frame (short or long term) and cohort (psychiatric or nonpsychiatric). Among Black smokers in the nonpsychiatric cohort, both bupropion and NRT had significantly higher relative efficacy than placebo during active treatment (weeks 9–12). Specifically, Black smokers in the nonpsychiatric cohort had 3 times the odds of quitting while taking bupropion vs placebo and nearly 5 times the odds of quitting with NRT vs placebo from weeks 9 to 12. These findings suggest that long-term pharmacotherapy (> 12 weeks), particularly bupropion and NRT, may be important for Black smokers given that the effects of these therapies diminished at the end of treatment and were not significantly different from placebo at long-term follow-up. Similar relapse effects have been seen with Black smokers taking bupropion in previous trials. Extended treatment has been found to be effective in White smokers but is understudied in Black smokers. Future research is needed in this area. Little is known about pharmacotherapy efficacy in Black smokers with psychiatric comorbidities. Findings from this study suggest that this group may be particularly recalcitrant to treatment and that it is an important group for future studies.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^744f1257]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Preloading pharmacotherapy and gradual reduction strategies for smokers not ready to quit: Medication preloading involves starting pharmacotherapy while the smoker is still smoking to reduce satisfaction from smoking, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and enhance the likelihood of subsequent quitting; clinical trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) preloading have had mixed results, and separate trials of NRT and varenicline with a flexible quit date have been promising, enabling prescription for smokers not ready to set a quit date. For gradual reduction, a meta-analysis of gradual reduction versus abrupt quitting found similar quit rates, and a randomized trial found that abruptly quitting versus reducing cigarette smoking for 2 weeks prior to quitting was more effective. In contrast, varenicline-assisted gradual reduction over 3 months before the quit date enhanced quit rates over placebo in smokers who were not ready to quit in the next 30 days.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^82a8b479]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We created summary of findings tables using standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2019), for the following comparisons, which we judged to be most clinically relevant.

Bupropion compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment
Bupropion plus NRT compared to NRT alone
Bupropion plus varenicline compared to varenicline alone

We judged these comparisons to be of most relevance because bupropion is currently the only antidepressant used as a first‐line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation worldwide.

Following standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2019), we used GRADEpro GDT software and the five GRADE considerations (risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for three outcomes: smoking cessation, SAEs, and dropouts due to adverse events of the treatment, and to draw conclusions about the certainty of the evidence (Schünemann 2013). We chose these outcomes as they are important factors to consider regarding pharmaceutical efficacy, harms, and tolerability, and are therefore useful to both clinicians and patients when deciding whether to provide or use a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^e31599df]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) practice statement — tobacco cessation and harm reduction states that clinicians should advise patients that ENDS are not considered evidence-based smoking-cessation therapy; if patients have refused or failed these treatments and are more willing to try ENDS as a harm reduction or nicotine-cessation approach than a first-line evidence-based strategy, clinicians should use a shared decision-making approach and address limited short-term evidence, lack of long-term efficacy or harms, current lack of regulation, and rare but serious harms including burns, explosions, and childhood poisonings, and clinicians should monitor for effectiveness and any adverse effects (B (NASEM conclusions 17–1, 2, 3, 4)). Clinicians should counsel patients about the inconsistent nicotine content of liquids, the possibility that flavorings may sometimes include toxic components, unreliable labeling, and significant variations in drug delivery associated with ENDS devices that limit the expected efficacy of ENDS as a smoking-cessation measure and possibly could result in harm, and clinicians should advise pregnant women who smoke cigarettes to use evidence-based treatments rather than recommending ENDS.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for long-term smoking cessation: a meta-analysis [^257d84a7]. Tobacco Control (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess if the effect of a single treatment episode with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) enhances smoking cessation over many years.

Data Sources

Meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials of NRT with final follow-up more than one year after the start of treatment. Twelve eligible trials were identified, all placebo-controlled, having final follow-ups ranging from 2–8 years. All had earlier follow-ups at 12 months. They comprised 2408 active and 2384 placebo treatment participants.

Data Synthesis

The odds ratio (OR) in favour of NRT at final follow-up was 1.99 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.64). There was no evidence that the effect varied according to length of final follow-up (beta = 0.92, p = 0.28) or duration of initial NRT treatment (beta = 0.99, p > 0.5). The overall relapse rate between the 12 months and final follow-up was 30.0% (95% CI 23.5% to 37.5%). This rate did not differ between NRT and control groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59), or length of initial NRT treatment. There was also no evidence that it varied according to length of final follow up. Due to relapse, the overall efficacy of NRT treatment in terms of additional ex-smokers declined from 10.7% over and above placebo (6.6% to 14.8%) after one year to 7.2% (3.8% to 11.3%) at an average of 4.3 years follow up.

Conclusions

The relative efficacy of a single course of NRT remains constant over many years. The majority of relapse after 12 months occurs within the first or second year and is not detectable thereafter, suggesting that NRT has a permanent effect on smoking cessation. However, initial relapse after one year has the effect of diminishing the number of ex-smokers that can be ultimately attributed to NRT. Results after only 6–12 months of follow-up, as used in existing reviews and treatment guidelines, will overestimate the lifetime benefit and cost-efficacy of NRT by about 30%. Because the long-term benefit of NRT is modest, tobacco dependence treatment might be better viewed as a chronic disorder, requiring repeated episodes of treatment.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^41290f39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e-cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e-cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco.

Search Methods

We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e-cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co-interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co-intervention was provided equally to study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta-analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta-regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE.

Main Results

Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e-cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results. Benefits We found high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast-acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high-certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast-acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively. Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non-nicotine/placebo e-cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI -2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low-certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2). Harms There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non-nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low-certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e-cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Authors' Conclusions

The most effective interventions were nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast-acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non-nicotine e-cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty). There was moderate-certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty. Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head-to-head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.

### Evidence-based cessation treatment… [^74d0e5b9]. progressreport.cancer.gov (2011). Low credibility.

Background Quitting smoking has major and immediate health benefits for people of all ages. It dramatically reduces the risk of lung and other cancers caused by smoking, as well as the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cessation success is increased by the use of evidence-based treatment, including the use of behavioral counseling and medications. The combination of behavioral counseling and medication is especially effective. FDA-approved cessation medications include various forms of nicotine replacement therapy, and two medications that do not contain nicotine: bupropion, and varenicline. Behavioral support can be delivered in person, in group settings, over the phone, and with other mobile technology tools and methods.

However, few people who smoke use evidence-based cessation treatments when attempting to quit, which decreases their likelihood of success. Any Cessation Counseling Use: adults who reported using any of the following type of behavioral counseling: from a quit-line; one-on-one with a clinician; at a clinic, class or support group; or from the internet, a smartphone app, or a texting program.

### Attributable failure of first-line cancer treatment and incremental costs associated with smoking by patients with cancer [^83474cdf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Previous studies have shown that continued smoking among patients with cancer can increase overall and cancer-specific mortality, risk for second primary cancer, and risk for toxic effects of cancer treatment. To our knowledge, there have been no efforts to estimate additional costs for cancer treatment attributed to smoking.

Objective

To model attributable incremental costs of subsequent cancer treatment associated with continued smoking by patients with cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For this economic evaluation, a model was developed in 2018 using data from a 2014 US Surgeon General's report that considered expected failure rates of first-line cancer treatment in nonsmoking patients, smoking prevalence, odds ratio of first-line cancer treatment failure attributed to smoking compared with nonsmoking, and cost of cancer treatment after failure of first-line cancer treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Attributable failures of first-line cancer treatment and incremental cost for subsequent treatment associated with continued smoking among patients with cancer.

Results

Attributable treatment failures were higher under conditions in which high first-line cure rates were expected in nonsmoking patients compared with conditions in which low cure rates were expected. Peak attributable failures occurred under the conditions in which expected cure rates among nonsmoking patients ranged from 50% to 65%. Under the conditions of a 30% expected treatment failure rate among nonsmoking patients, 20% smoking prevalence, 60% increased risk of failure of first-line cancer treatment, and $100 000 mean added cost of treating a first-line cancer treatment failure, the additional incremental cost per 1000 total patients was estimated to be $2.1 million, reflecting an additional cost of $10 678 per smoking patient. Extrapolation of cost to 1.6 million patients with cancer diagnosed annually reflects a potential $3.4 billion in incremental cost.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that continued smoking among patients with cancer and the increase in attributable first-line cancer treatment failure is associated with significant incremental costs for subsequent cancer treatments. Additional work appears to be needed to identify optimal methods to mitigate these incremental costs.

### Cost-effectiveness of point of care smoking cessation interventions in oncology clinics [^cbbe08e6]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We examined the cost-effectiveness of providing systematic smoking cessation interventions to oncology patients at point-of-care.

Methods

A decision analytic model was completed from the healthcare payer's perspective and included all incident cancer cases involving patients who smoke in New Brunswick, Canada (n = 1040), cancer site stratifications, and risks of mortality, continued smoking, and cancer treatment failure over one year. Usual care (no cessation support) was compared to the standard Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) intervention, and to OMSC plus unlimited cost-free stop smoking medication (OMSC + SSM), including nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, or bupropion. Primary outcomes were incremental cost per quit (ICQ) and incremental cost per cancer treatment failure avoided (ICTFA).

Results

The ICQ was $C143 and ICTFA $C1193 for standard OMSC. The ICQ was $C503 and ICTFA was $C5952 for OMSC + SSM. The number needed to treat (NNT) to produce one quit was 9 for standard OMSC and 4 for OMSC + SSM, and the NNT to avoid one first-line treatment failure was 78 for OMSC and 45 for OMSC + SSM. Both were cost-effective in 100% of 1000 simulations.

Conclusions

Given the high clinical benefits and low incremental costs, systematic smoking cessation interventions should be a standard component of first-line cancer treatment.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural interventions for smoking cessation [^3f543fcc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both behavioural support (including brief advice and counselling) and pharmacotherapies (including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline and bupropion) are effective in helping people to stop smoking. Combining both treatment approaches is recommended where possible, but the size of the treatment effect with different combinations and in different settings and populations is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of combining behavioural support and medication to aid smoking cessation, compared to a minimal intervention or usual care, and to identify whether there are different effects depending on characteristics of the treatment setting, intervention, population treated, or take-up of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in July 2015 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of NRT, bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support for smoking cessation, compared to a control receiving usual care or brief advice or less intensive behavioural support. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women, trials recruiting only adolescents, and trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Search results were prescreened by one author and inclusion or exclusion of potentially relevant trials was agreed by two authors. Data was extracted by one author and checked by another. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Fifty-three studies with a total of more than 25,000 participants met the inclusion criteria. A large proportion of studies recruited people in healthcare settings or with specific health needs. Most studies provided NRT. Behavioural support was typically provided by specialists in cessation counselling, who offered between four and eight contact sessions. The planned maximum duration of contact was typically more than 30 minutes but less than 300 minutes. Overall, studies were at low or unclear risk of bias, and findings were not sensitive to the exclusion of any of the six studies rated at high risk of bias in one domain. One large study (the Lung Health Study) contributed heterogeneity due to a substantially larger treatment effect than seen in other studies (RR 3.88, 95% CI 3.35 to 4.50). Since this study used a particularly intensive intervention which included extended availability of nicotine gum, multiple group sessions and long term maintenance and recycling contacts, the results may not be comparable with the interventions used in other studies, and hence it was not pooled in other analyses. Based on the remaining 52 studies (19,488 participants) there was high quality evidence (using GRADE) for a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and behavioural treatment compared to usual care, brief advice or less intensive behavioural support (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.98) with moderate statistical heterogeneity (I² = 36%). The pooled estimate for 43 trials that recruited participants in healthcare settings (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.18) was higher than for eight trials with community-based recruitment (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.76). Compared to the first version of the review, previous weak evidence of differences in other subgroup analyses has disappeared. We did not detect differences between subgroups defined by motivation to quit, treatment provider, number or duration of support sessions, or take-up of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Interventions that combine pharmacotherapy and behavioural support increase smoking cessation success compared to a minimal intervention or usual care. Updating this review with an additional 12 studies (5,000 participants) did not materially change the effect estimate. Although trials differed in the details of their populations and interventions, we did not detect any factors that modified treatment effects apart from the recruitment setting. We did not find evidence from indirect comparisons that offering more intensive behavioural support was associated with larger treatment effects.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^074ae536]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

We did not assess smoking cessation medications which were not FDA first‐line approved medications, or non‐medical interventions.

Although we intended originally to analyse changes in benefit at time‐points longer than 1 year, sufficient data were unavailable. For the same reason, we were unable to analyse changes in benefit from very early (< 3 months) time‐points.

Although this review included a large number of studies, we were unable to use all the studies included in the three original Cochrane Reviews. Twenty‐six per cent of NRT trials were included, as were 20% of bupropion trials and 25% of varenicline trials. Exclusions were due primarily to our exclusive focus upon approved first‐line cessation medications (two of the three Cochrane Reviews 6, 7 also included other medications), the need for information on both 6‐ and 12‐month end‐points (Cochrane did not require information at multiple end‐points), our requirement that there be a comparable non‐medicated control group, which stemmed from our intent to estimate the full effect of medication at different time‐points, and our requirement that the report be peer‐reviewed, contain sufficient information for the meta‐analysis and report on at least 95% of randomized participants. Five potentially eligible trials were excluded due to language of publication. On the basis of publications about those five studies [Cochrane tables and English language publications], we do not believe that their inclusion would have altered our findings.

We were unable to assess fully the extent to which differential attrition between treatment arms may have affected results, because attrition information was not available for most studies. We used the standard assumption that those lost to follow‐up were continuing smokers in calculating ITT quit rates. Most investigators make this assumption, as they assume that the great majority of those not continuing to participate have in fact lost interest in quitting. (If this were not the case, our estimated quit rates would underestimate the true quit rates.) The few papers which we identified that did report attrition rates between 6 and 12 months show that attrition during this period was small, suggesting that the difference between attrition in intervention and control groups was minimal for that period 44, 45, 46. Therefore, the impact on our primary result — that the difference between quit rates between intervention arms decreases over time — should be negligible.

### The efficacy of smoking cessation interventions in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4f7590f1]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of recommended individual‐level smoking cessation interventions in LMICs. This study is important, because the current evidence supporting the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions emanate from decades of research conducted in high‐income countries. Differences in smoking behavior, cultural contexts, health‐care access and health‐care systems may influence the translation of these interventions to LMICs where smoking prevalence is rising 11. Because of these concerns, smoking cessation research has been recognized as a priority in LMICs 11, 18.

We identified 24 RCTs with a follow‐up duration of at least 6 months that investigated recommended smoking cessation interventions. The majority of the published studies (76%) reported that the interventions for smoking cessation were efficacious. Results of our meta‐analysis showed increased smoking abstinence with NRT compared to placebo/brief advice; counseling compared to usual care/brief advice; the combination of bupropion and counseling compared to usual care; and brief advice compared to usual care. Pooled analysis of two studies that compared bupropion to placebo or usual care, however, did not show that bupropion significantly improved smoking abstinence.

There are still relatively few RCTs of smoking cessation in LMICs compared to high‐income countries. We identified five RCTs of NRT (patches, gum), which is one of the most widely studied pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation 12, 13. A recent systematic review of 136 trials of NRT compared to placebo with a follow‐up duration of at least 6 months 13 found an effect size of 1.55 (95% CI = 1.49–1.61), similar to the present analysis (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.30–2.37), suggesting that NRT may have similar efficacy irrespective of the country. The low cost and high availability of NRT in LMICs make NRT an ideal pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation compared to other smoking cessation medications 48. Notably, NRT is the only first‐line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation on the World Health Organization essential drug list 49.

### Nicotine replacement therapy versus control for smoking cessation [^183c24b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no NRT' interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search is July 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared NRT to placebo or to no treatment. We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations.

Smoking cessation in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hospitalized smokers — The US Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guideline for Smoking Cessation recommends smoking-cessation pharmacotherapy for all smokers attempting to quit, and the most effective smoking-cessation therapies include both behavioral and pharmacological interventions; high-quality evidence showed that using a combination of behavioral support and medication increases the chances of successfully quitting for at least 6 months and the chance of success was increased by 70% to 100% compared with just brief advice or support. Among patients with CVD who were motivated to quit smoking, varenicline and bupropion are efficacious for smoking cessation, varenicline was the most efficacious of therapies in patients with stable CVD who were motivated to quit smoking, and in 1 study abstinence rates with varenicline versus placebo persisted for 52 weeks. Given uncertainties about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes, clinicians have been urged to advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, US Food and Drug Administration–approved, safe and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes. In hospitalized tobacco users, counseling with supportive follow-up for ≥ 1 month after discharge increases smoking cessation rates by 37% at 6 to 12 months, and varenicline use for hospitalized smokers with ACS who were motivated to quit significantly increased abstinence versus placebo at 1 year after discharge; at week 24, using varenicline increased smoking abstinence and reduced cigarette use by ≥ 50%. There is no evidence that pharmacotherapies increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse events during or after treatment, and the EAGLES trial showed that pharmacotherapies do not increase the risk of cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric adverse events compared with nicotine patch or placebo in smokers with and without psychiatric disorders.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^7455c029]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Foundations of Tobacco-Dependence Treatment — All patients should be screened for tobacco use, and the potential diagnosis of tobacco dependence should be assessed. The diagnosis of tobacco dependence, as well as the toxic effects of tobacco exposure, should be incorporated into the patient's problem list. Simply encouraging patients to stop smoking is insufficient. All patients who use tobacco should be provided with evidence-based treatment, including pharmacotherapy, to help them stop. Tobacco-dependence interventions require longitudinal follow-up, akin to the longitudinal evaluation and management of other chronic illnesses.

### National guidelines for smoking cessation in primary care: a literature review and evidence analysis [^6d43ab20]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

General population

With regard to guidelines that focus on the treatment of tobacco dependence in the general population (n = 22), we were able to categorise recommendations into 12 intervention types recommended for primary care:
Each patient's smoking status should be identified and recorded (20/22);
All smokers should be given brief advice to stop (20/22);
Smokers' motivation to quit should be assessed (17/22);
All smokers wishing to stop should be offered assistance (22/22);
All smokers wishing to stop should be offered/encouraged to use pharmacotherapy (22/22);
All smokers wishing to stop should be offered behavioural support (19/22);
Self-help materials should be offered as part of tobacco dependence treatment (12/22);
Smoking abstinence should be evaluated following treatment (5/22);
The '5A's Framework' should be used to guide brief intervention (16/22);
The 'ABC Framework' should be used to guide brief intervention (3/22);
Health-care professionals should be trained in delivering tobacco dependence treatment (13/22);
Hypnotherapy and acupuncture are not effective smoking cessation treatments (6/22).

Table 2 provides an overview of these recommendations put forth in each national guideline. Full details on the types of pharmacotherapy recommended in each national guideline are presented in Table 3.

### What to do after smoking relapse? A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial of chronic care smoking treatments [^e0cf6a40]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare effects of three post-relapse interventions on smoking abstinence.

Design

Sequential three-phase multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART).

Setting

Eighteen Wisconsin, USA, primary care clinics.

Participants

A total of 1154 primary care patients (53.6% women, 81.2% White) interested in quitting smoking enrolled from 2015 to 2019; 582 relapsed and were randomized to relapse recovery treatment.

Interventions

In phase 1, patients received cessation counseling and 8weeks nicotine patch. Those who relapsed and agreed were randomized to a phase 2 relapse recovery group: (1) reduction counseling+nicotine mini-lozenges+encouragement to quit starting 1month post-randomization (preparation); (2) repeated encouragement to quit starting immediately post-randomization (recycling); or (3) advice to call the tobacco quitline (control). The first two groups could opt into phase 3 new quit treatment [8weeks nicotine patch+mini-lozenges plus randomization to two treatment factors (skill training and supportive counseling) in a 2×2 design]. Phase 2 and 3 interventions lasted ≤ 15months.

Measurements

The study was powered to compare each active phase 2 treatment with the control on the primary outcome: biochemically confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence 14months post initiating phase 2 relapse recovery treatment. Exploratory analyses tested for phase 3 counseling factor effects.

Findings

Neither skill training nor supportive counseling (each on versus off) increased 14-month abstinence rates; skills on versus off 9.3% (14/151) versus 5.2% (8/153), P = 0.19; support on versus off 6.6% (10/152) versus 7.9% (12/152), P = 0.73. Phase 2 preparation did not produce higher 14-month abstinence rates than quitline referral; 3.6% (8/220) versus 2.1% [3/145; risk difference = 1.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.8–5.0%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.5–6.9]. Recycling, however, produced higher abstinence rates than quitline referral; 6.9% (15/217) versus 2.1% (three of 145; risk difference, 4.8%, 95% CI = 0.7–8.9%, OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.0–12.4). Recycling produced greater entry into new quit treatment than preparation: 83.4% (181/217) versus 55.9% (123/220), P < 0.0001.

Conclusions

Among people interested in quitting smoking, immediate encouragement post-relapse to enter a new round of smoking cessation treatment ('recycling') produced higher probability of abstinence than tobacco quitline referral. Recycling produced higher rates of cessation treatment re-engagement than did preparation/cutting down using more intensive counseling and pharmacotherapy.

### Additional behavioural support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation [^ddb4a1fa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation increase the likelihood of achieving abstinence in a quit attempt. It is plausible that providing support, or, if support is offered, offering more intensive support or support including particular components may increase abstinence further.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of adding or increasing the intensity of behavioural support for people using smoking cessation medications, and to assess whether there are different effects depending on the type of pharmacotherapy, or the amount of support in each condition. We also looked at studies which directly compare behavioural interventions matched for contact time, where pharmacotherapy is provided to both groups (e.g. tests of different components or approaches to behavioural support as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and the ICTRP in June 2018 for records with any mention of pharmacotherapy, including any type of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, nortriptyline or varenicline, that evaluated the addition of personal support or compared two or more intensities of behavioural support.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which all participants received pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and conditions differed by the amount or type of behavioural support. The intervention condition had to involve person-to-person contact (defined as face-to-face or telephone). The control condition could receive less intensive personal contact, a different type of personal contact, written information, or no behavioural support at all. We excluded trials recruiting only pregnant women and trials which did not set out to assess smoking cessation at six months or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically-validated rates, if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Eighty-three studies, 36 of which were new to this update, met the inclusion criteria, representing 29,536 participants. Overall, we judged 16 studies to be at low risk of bias and 21 studies to be at high risk of bias. All other studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias. Results were not sensitive to the exclusion of studies at high risk of bias. We pooled all studies comparing more versus less support in the main analysis. Findings demonstrated a benefit of behavioural support in addition to pharmacotherapy. When all studies of additional behavioural therapy were pooled, there was evidence of a statistically significant benefit from additional support (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.22, I² = 8%, 65 studies, n = 23,331) for abstinence at longest follow-up, and this effect was not different when we compared subgroups by type of pharmacotherapy or intensity of contact. This effect was similar in the subgroup of eight studies in which the control group received no behavioural support (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43, I² = 20%, n = 4,018). Seventeen studies compared interventions matched for contact time but that differed in terms of the behavioural components or approaches employed. Of the 15 comparisons, all had small numbers of participants and events. Only one detected a statistically significant effect, favouring a health education approach (which the authors described as standard counselling containing information and advice) over motivational interviewing approach (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94, n = 378).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that providing behavioural support in person or via telephone for people using pharmacotherapy to stop smoking increases quit rates. Increasing the amount of behavioural support is likely to increase the chance of success by about 10% to 20%, based on a pooled estimate from 65 trials. Subgroup analysis suggests that the incremental benefit from more support is similar over a range of levels of baseline support. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of specific components that comprise behavioural support.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^322d2051]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Costs and benefits of smoking cessation aids: making a case for public reimbursement of nicotine replacement therapy in Australia [^4aafc11d]. Tobacco Control (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and other developed countries. Of the pharmacological aids that are available for smoking cessation, bupropion (Zyban SR) is eligible for public reimbursement on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), whereas nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is not. Information on the cost-effectiveness and financial impact of public reimbursement of these strategies can better inform debate about their inclusion or exclusion in public reimbursement schemes.

Objective

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of bupropion and NRT, and the potential financial impact of public reimbursement of NRT in Australia.

Design

A cost-effectiveness analysis using a deterministic Markov model, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a lifetime as the outcome measure.

Population

Current smokers, motivated to quit, in Australia in 2000.

Interventions

(1) NRT; (2) bupropion; and (3) a combined strategy using bupropion as the first-line treatment and NRT in those who fail to quit smoking or have adverse reactions to bupropion.

Results

Quitting smoking can increase life expectancy of current smokers by 1–7.6 years depending on age at cessation and sex. Providing bupropion to current smokers who are motivated to quit would cost A$7900 (95% uncertainty interval A$6000 to A$10,500) for each DALY averted; NRT patches would cost A$17,000 (A$9000 to A$28,000) for each DALY averted, with similar results even if used as a second-line treatment following initial failure to quit using bupropion. If 6% of current smokers were to use NRT following inclusion on the PBS, this would result in an annual cost of A$40–110 million to the PBS depending on the listed price.

Conclusions

Compared with other drugs included on the PBS, bupropion and NRT are both highly cost-effective smoking cessation interventions, and including NRT on the PBS would have a moderate financial impact. Given the sizeable health burden of smoking, and the large individual benefits of quitting smoking, increasing the availability of alternative aids and uptake of these strategies through public reimbursement would be a positive and rational step towards further reducing tobacco-related disease burden in Australia and other countries where NRT is currently not subsidised.

### Prevalence and correlates of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in hospitalized smokers with acute myocardial infarction [^a162b97f]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although current performance measures recommend smoking cessation counseling at the time of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy as well. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and correlates of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in hospitalized patients with AMI.

Methods

In the 24-center TRIUMPH registry, 4,340 AMI patients underwent detailed interviews; and 1,631 reported smoking within 30 days of admission. Prescription of first-line smoking cessation medications at discharge was assessed by medical record review. All patient-related factors associated with smoking cessation treatment, based on literature review, were included in hierarchical modified log Poisson models.

Results

Only 14% (222/1,631) of AMI patients who smoked were prescribed smoking cessation medication at discharge. After multivariable adjustment for patient characteristics, there was significant variation across sites (range 0%-28%, median rate ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.23–2.67). Independent factors associated with smoking cessation pharmacotherapy included older age (rate ratio 0.81 per 10-year increment, 95% CI 0.71–0.93), high school graduation (rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.10–1.66), heavy cigarette usage (> 20/d) (rate ratio 3.08, 95% CI 2.20–4.12), in-hospital revascularization (rate ratio 1.41, 95% CI 1.0–1.94), and instructions on smoking cessation (rate ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.40–4.01).

Conclusions

Smokers surviving an AMI are infrequently prescribed guideline-recommended smoking cessation treatments, and there is considerable variation across hospitals. Older, less educated, and lighter smokers are less likely to receive aggressive smoking cessation treatment. Novel strategies to augment current practice are needed.

### Pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation: nicotine agonists, antagonists, and partial agonists [^2b71ba5e]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) were the main pharmacologic option for treatment of nicotine dependence until the early 1990s, when controlled clinical trials confirmed the efficacy of bupropion, the first treatment not based on nicotine. Varenicline, a partial agonist at nicotine receptors, gained US regulatory approval in 2006 for smoking cessation. Although these agents are all effective for nicotine dependence, their efficacy rates vary compared with placebo (overall OR for NRT efficacy, 1.77; for bupropion, 1.94; for varenicline, 3.09). Each of these treatments has a place, sometimes in combinations with other agents, in cancer patients who continue to smoke. Our initial experience with varenicline has been encouraging. Bupropion has specific advantages for cancer patients, including increased energy, low risk for nausea, and decreased weight gain from quitting.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^b5ff7232]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD smoking cessation — treatment should be adapted to individual needs and the level of tobacco dependence, and there is evidence that a combination of counseling and pharmacotherapy is the most effective smoking cessation treatment for people with COPD; assessment of nicotine dependence should be carried out for all patients, with indicators of high dependence including smoking within 30 min of waking up, smoking at night, consuming ≥ 20 cigarettes per day, a score of 7 to 10 on the Fagerström scale or 5 to 6 on the Heaviness of Smoking Index; legislative smoking bans are effective in increasing quit rates and reducing harm from second-hand smoke exposure.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^b99a68f6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) pharmacotherapy — availability, efficacy, and use: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 5 nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products as well as bupropion and varenicline, and these medications are more effective than placebo for 6 months or more and are safe for patients with CVD; in the United States, NRT is available over the counter or by prescription as patches, gum, and lozenges, and by prescription only as a nasal spray and oral inhaler. Each NRT product has about the same efficacy, increasing quit rates with risk ratios of ~1.6 compared with placebo, and combining the nicotine patch with a more rapidly absorbed form is more effective than using a single product, with a risk ratio of 1.34 compared with single use of a single product. Combination NRT is now considered the standard of care for using NRT and should be recommended as initial therapy when NRT is chosen, nicotine patches are typically marketed with doses that taper over 12 weeks but tapering is optional, the typical duration of treatment is 12 weeks, and no harm from long-term NRT use has been reported.

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial [^5e2b8347]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the well-established consequences, smoking remains prevalent worldwide. Cessation attempts are common; 40% of smokers try to quit at least twice annually, but only 3–5% will be successful. Pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions improve quit rates. Evidence based on indirect comparisons derived from meta-analyses favors combinations of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline over NRT monotherapy. To date, most studies have compared standard-dose NRT or varenicline to placebo; only a handful of studies have compared NRT monotherapy to combinations of NRT products or varenicline, and only one study has included NRT monotherapy, combination NRT, and varenicline in a single trial, with the results proving inconsistent with previous meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines. Additional comparisons of these treatments are required to provide direct evidence of their relative effectiveness.

Little is known about the efficacy of smoking cessation treatments in populations with significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities; these groups are typically excluded from trials. Cardiac patients, for example, who may gain immediate benefits from quitting are often deemed ineligible for participation in smoking cessation research due to concerns of potential adverse events. In fact, a recent review reported that only two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigated varenicline prescribed to patients with active cardiovascular disease and 11 studies included patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Studies examining cessation among those with psychiatric diagnoses are limited by small sample size, have omitted formal diagnostic procedures, or have examined only select psychiatric populations. This is particularly true of trials assessing varenicline – only six RCTs examining psychiatric patients have been published and three included fewer than 50 smokers. As rates of smoking are disproportionately higher in those with psychiatric disorders, RCTs including such patients should be a priority. The present trial includes patients with physical and psychiatric comorbidities and it is the first to directly compare NRT and varenicline in smokers with and without psychiatric illness.

### The impact of smoking on nivolumab outcomes in renal cell carcinoma: real-world data from the Turkish oncology group kidney cancer consortium [^49d1c12e]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations, including its retrospective design, which may introduce selection bias, limit causal inferences and missing data (For example, IMDC data were unavailable for 33.6% of patients) Smoking status was based on medical records, lacking detailed information on smoking intensity (pack-years), cessation timing and time between last smoked and diagnosis of cancer. Additionally, TMB and specific immune microenvironment factors were not assessed, which could have provided mechanistic insights. While immunotherapy-based combination regimens are now considered the standard first-line treatment for metastatic RCC, access to these therapies remains limited in many regions due to reimbursement constraints. As a result, vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are often used in the first-line setting, and single-agent nivolumab continues to be a widely utilized subsequent-line option in real-world clinical practice. Despite these limitations, the study's strengths include its large, real-world cohort of metastatic RCC patients treated with nivolumab in the second line or beyond. It also includes data from multiple cancer centers, enhancing patient representation. The comprehensive analysis of prognostic factors, including smoking status, provides clinically relevant insights and underscores the importance of smoking cessation. Furthermore, the findings align with existing literature while addressing the gap regarding the impact of smoking on immunotherapy outcomes in RCC.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that current smoking status is an independent adverse prognostic factor for both TTF and OS in patients with metastatic RCC treated with nivolumab in the second line and beyond. These findings highlight the detrimental impact of smoking on treatment outcomes and underscore the importance of smoking cessation in improving survival among RCC patients. Moreover, other factors such as ECOG performance status, bone metastases, and histological subtypes also play significant roles in determining prognosis.

Future research should focus on prospective studies to better delineate the biological mechanisms underlying the negative impact of smoking on immunotherapy efficacy. Investigating TMB, immune microenvironment characteristics, and specific causes of death could provide deeper insights into these outcomes. Additionally, evaluating the role of smoking cessation interventions after diagnosis and during treatment could offer practical strategies to enhance survival and quality of life in metastatic RCC patients.

### Interventions for smoking cessation in people diagnosed with lung cancer [^c9ca3e23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of death from cancer worldwide. Smoking induces and aggravates many health problems, including vascular diseases, respiratory illnesses and cancers. Tobacco smoking constitutes the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Most people with lung cancer are still active smokers at diagnosis or frequently relapse after smoking cessation. Quitting smoking is the most effective way for smokers to reduce the risk of premature death and disability. People with lung cancer may benefit from stopping smoking. Whether smoking cessation interventions are effective for people with lung cancer and whether one method of quitting is more effective than any other has not been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of smoking cessation programmes for people with lung cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Embase up to 22 December 2018. We also searched the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting proceedings, the lung cancer sections of the proceedings of the ESMO Congress, the lung cancer sections of the proceedings of the European Conference of Clinical Oncology (ECCO) Congress, the World Conference on Lung Cancer proceedings, the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Annual Meeting from 2013, the Food and Drug Administration website, the European Medicine Agency for drug registration website, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) to 30 December 2018. We applied no restriction on language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include any randomised controlled trial (RCT) of any psychosocial or pharmacological smoking cessation intervention or combinations of both, compared with no intervention, a different psychosocial or pharmacological (or both) intervention or placebo for pharmacological interventions in people with lung cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the studies from the initial search for potential trials for inclusion. We planned to use standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We found no trials that met the inclusion criteria.

Main Results

We identified no RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Among the 1817 records retrieved using our search strategy, we retrieved 19 studies for further investigation. We excluded 15 trials: ten trials because we could not distinguish people with lung cancer from the other participants, or the participants were not people with lung cancer, four because they were not randomised, or RCTs. We excluded one trial because, though it was completed in 2004, no results are available. We assessed four ongoing trials for inclusion when data become available.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no RCTs that determined the effectiveness of any type of smoking cessation programme for people with lung cancer. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether smoking cessation interventions are effective for people with lung cancer and whether one programme is more effective than any other. People with lung cancer should be encouraged to quit smoking and offered smoking cessation interventions. However, due to the lack of RCTs, the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions for people with lung cancer cannot be evaluated and concluded. This systematic review identified a need for RCTs to explore these.

### Interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients [^46e11ecd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020, 32.6% of the world's population used tobacco. Smoking contributes to many illnesses that require hospitalisation. A hospital admission may prompt a quit attempt. Initiating smoking cessation treatment, such as pharmacotherapy and/or counselling, in hospitals may be an effective preventive health strategy. Pharmacotherapies work to reduce withdrawal/craving and counselling provides behavioural skills for quitting smoking. This review updates the evidence on interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalised patients, to understand the most effective smoking cessation treatment methods for hospitalised smokers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any type of smoking cessation programme for patients admitted to an acute care hospital.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 7 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised studies of behavioural, pharmacological or multicomponent interventions to help patients admitted to hospital quit. Interventions had to start in the hospital (including at discharge), and people had to have smoked within the last month. We excluded studies in psychiatric, substance and rehabilitation centres, as well as studies that did not measure abstinence at six months or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was abstinence from smoking assessed at least six months after discharge or the start of the intervention. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, preferring biochemically-validated rates where reported. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 82 studies (74 RCTs) that included 42,273 participants in the review (71 studies, 37,237 participants included in the meta-analyses); 36 studies are new to this update. We rated 10 studies as being at low risk of bias overall (low risk in all domains assessed), 48 at high risk of bias overall (high risk in at least one domain), and the remaining 24 at unclear risk. Cessation counselling versus no counselling, grouped by intensity of intervention Hospitalised patients who received smoking cessation counselling that began in the hospital and continued for more than a month after discharge had higher quit rates than patients who received no counselling in the hospital or following hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 1.49; 28 studies, 8234 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might account for an additional 76 quitters in every 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 103). The evidence was uncertain (very low-certainty) about the effects of counselling interventions of less intensity or shorter duration (in-hospital only counselling ≤ 15 minutes: RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.89; 2 studies, 1417 participants; and in-hospital contact plus follow-up counselling support for ≤ 1 month: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.20; 7 studies, 4627 participants) versus no counselling. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that smoking cessation counselling for at least 15 minutes in the hospital without post-discharge support led to higher quit rates than no counselling in the hospital (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.58; 12 studies, 4432 participants). Pharmacotherapy versus placebo or no pharmacotherapy Nicotine replacement therapy helped more patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67; 8 studies, 3838 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 62 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 9 to 126). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision (as CI encompassed the possibility of no difference), that varenicline helped more hospitalised patients to quit than placebo or no pharmacotherapy (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 4 studies, 829 participants). Evidence for bupropion was low-certainty; the point estimate indicated a modest benefit at best, but CIs were wide and incorporated clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.43, 4 studies, 872 participants). Hospital-only intervention versus intervention that continues after hospital discharge Patients offered both smoking cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge had higher quit rates than patients offered counselling in hospital but not offered post-discharge support (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38; 7 studies, 5610 participants; high-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this might equate to an additional 34 quitters per 1000 participants (95% CI 13 to 55). Post-discharge interventions offering real-time counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.60, 8 studies, 2299 participants; low certainty-evidence) and those offering unscheduled counselling without pharmacotherapy (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; 2 studies, 1598 participants; very low-certainty evidence) may have little to no effect on quit rates compared to control. Telephone quitlines versus control To provide post-discharge support, hospitals may refer patients to community-based telephone quitlines. Both comparisons relating to these interventions had wide CIs encompassing both possible harm and possible benefit, and were judged to be of very low certainty due to imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias (post-discharge telephone counselling versus quitline referral: RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.51; 3 studies, 3260 participants; quitline referral versus control: RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.96; 2 studies, 1870 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Offering hospitalised patients smoking cessation counselling beginning in hospital and continuing for over one month after discharge increases quit rates, compared to no hospital intervention. Counselling provided only in hospital, without post-discharge support, may have a modest impact on quit rates, but evidence is less certain. When all patients receive counselling in the hospital, high-certainty evidence indicates that providing both counselling and pharmacotherapy after discharge increases quit rates compared to no post-discharge intervention. Starting nicotine replacement or varenicline in hospitalised patients helps more patients to quit smoking than a placebo or no medication, though evidence for varenicline is only moderate-certainty due to imprecision. There is less evidence of benefit for bupropion in this setting. Some of our evidence was limited by imprecision (bupropion versus placebo and varenicline versus placebo), risk of bias, and inconsistency related to heterogeneity. Future research is needed to identify effective strategies to implement, disseminate, and sustain interventions, and to ensure cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy initiated in the hospital is sustained after discharge.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^dce80199]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is temporarily to replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 132 trials; 111 with over 40,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50–70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^0b4188ff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Bupropion for tobacco cessation in general and in smokers with cardiovascular disease — Bupropion stimulates some of nicotine's effects on the brain by blocking neuronal uptake of dopamine and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine; it relieves nicotine withdrawal symptoms and reduces the reward from smoking a cigarette, and is FDA-approved both as an antidepressant and for smoking cessation. Sustained-release bupropion is similar in efficacy to NRT and is effective in smokers with and without depression, but bupropion reduces seizure threshold and should not be used in patients who are at increased risk for seizures. Bupropion is approved for 12 weeks' use, but extended treatment for 1 year reduced the relapse rate after initial cessation in 1 study; combination therapy with bupropion and nicotine patch is more effective than bupropion alone or NRT alone, and in combination with varenicline it showed significantly enhanced quit rates at 12 and 26 weeks but not at 52 weeks. In smokers with CVD, bupropion is efficacious in smokers with stable CVD but has not shown efficacy in smokers hospitalized with ACS, likely because hospitalization is often too brief to allow bupropion to achieve active drug levels before discharge, and clinical trials have found no evidence of increased CV events compared with placebo; the CATS study, involving more than 8,000 smokers, found no evidence of an adverse effect on blood pressure and no increased risk of CV events in smokers treated with bupropion compared with NRT or placebo.
