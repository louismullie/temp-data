## Question

Given a tissue biopsy for non-small cell lung cancer 4 months ago that showed only a KRAS mutation, and the patient has received no treatment, is it worthwhile to order a liquid biopsy now?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a liquid biopsy is worthwhile now in an untreated NSCLC patient whose tissue biopsy showed "only a KRAS mutation" four months ago. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which KRAS variant is present (G12C versus non-G12C). Then, I should verify whether the original tissue testing was comprehensive across all recommended NSCLC biomarkers or limited. Next, I will review guideline-endorsed roles for liquid biopsy in treatment-naïve NSCLC and the implications of negative plasma results. After that, I need to examine concordance and detection rates for KRAS G12C in plasma and the risk of false negatives. Then, I will consider the potential for uncovering additional actionable drivers or co-mutations and the impact on time-to-treatment. Finally, I will synthesize conditional recommendations and ensure I do not overstep current FDA indications for KRAS G12C inhibitors in the frontline setting.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical variables because they drive the value proposition of plasma testing here. I need to check exactly which KRAS mutation was reported on tissue (G12C versus non-G12C) and whether the prior tissue assay covered the full guideline panel of oncogenic drivers for metastatic NSCLC (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, NTRK, and others), since a "KRAS-only" result may reflect limited testing rather than true exclusivity of drivers [^114WLz5j] [^113UZ9uE].

> Next, I should review when guidelines endorse liquid biopsy in untreated NSCLC. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — plasma is a complement, not a wholesale replacement for tissue in de novo staging. ESMO explicitly recommends considering cell-free DNA to test for oncogenic drivers in the metastatic setting, with reflex tissue testing if plasma is negative, and professional groups concur that plasma-first is reasonable when tissue is inadequate or time to treatment might be delayed by re-biopsy, but negative plasma must not falsely reassure us [^114WLz5j]. I should also confirm FDA companion diagnostic language for KRAS G12C inhibitors, which permits selection based on tumor or plasma, but requires tissue confirmation if plasma is negative, underscoring the false-negative risk inherent to ctDNA testing [^114s3n4x].

> Now, concordance and detection rates matter for decision-making. I initially recalled a 93% tissue–plasma concordance for RAS/BRAF in colorectal cancer and almost applied it directly to NSCLC, but wait, let me verify NSCLC-specific data before extrapolating. In NSCLC cohorts, thoracic oncology studies show high overall concordance with plasma CGP, and prospective data (e.g. NILE) suggest plasma can be at least as good as tissue at finding actionable alterations with faster turnaround, yet sensitivity depends on ctDNA shedding and can be incomplete [^1116YU3D] [^111eo12u]. Critically for KRAS G12C, the FDA CodeBreaK submission reports only about 70% of tissue-confirmed G12C cases were detected in plasma, meaning roughly a 30% false-negative rate and the need to reflex to tissue when plasma is negative [^114s3n4x] [^114WLz5j].

> I will now examine what additional value a new liquid biopsy could add beyond confirming KRAS. Let me consider tumor heterogeneity and the chance of uncovering other actionable drivers or fusions missed by a limited tissue assay; liquid biopsy can capture alterations across lesions and, in trials like VISION for MET exon 14, tissue and plasma were complementary, with guidance to reflex to tissue after a negative plasma to avoid missed targets due to low ctDNA shedding [^1174KZfi] [^1126gBCD]. Beyond binary driver calls, broad ctDNA profiling can characterize co-mutations and establish a baseline ctDNA tumor fraction for response monitoring; early declines in ctDNA associate with outcomes in KRAS G12C inhibitor studies, which is useful even if the inhibitor is not used first-line in an untreated patient [^1139eVue] [^115fXZHF].

> Weighing benefits against limitations, I need to ensure we do not delay appropriate first-line therapy. Plasma testing is noninvasive and often faster than arranging a repeat tissue biopsy, and randomized and observational data suggest potential improvements in time-to-treatment for subgroups when liquid biopsy is integrated early, though overall effects can be modest and context-dependent [^114urUXA] [^1139VEzK]. But hmm, wait a minute — negative plasma results occur with low-shedding tumors, so a non-diagnostic or negative report must trigger reflex tissue testing per guidelines to avoid missed targets, which can itself add time if not planned in parallel [^1126gBCD] [^114WLz5j].

> Synthetizing conditional recommendations, I should be explicit. If the KRAS variant is G12C and the original tissue testing was truly comprehensive across all recommended drivers, then ordering a liquid biopsy now is not strictly required to make the initial treatment decision in an untreated patient; however, it is reasonable to obtain a plasma CGP concurrently to establish a baseline ctDNA tumor fraction for future monitoring and to document co-mutations that may inform subsequent-line strategies, acknowledging that a negative plasma does not negate the tissue finding [^1126gBCD] [^1139eVue]. If the KRAS variant is G12C but the prior tissue assay was limited (e.g. KRAS-only), then yes — ordering a broad-panel liquid biopsy now is worthwhile to search for other actionable alterations that could alter first-line therapy selection and to confirm G12C in plasma if detectable, planning reflex tissue CGP if plasma is negative or indeterminate to avoid missed drivers [^1126gBCD] [^114s3n4x].

> For non-G12C KRAS, I should double-check the expected yield. In the setting of a comprehensive negative tissue CGP aside from non-G12C KRAS, a liquid biopsy is unlikely to change immediate management because there is no FDA-approved targeted therapy for non-G12C KRAS at baseline, and standard chemoimmunotherapy pathways generally apply; in this case, plasma testing could be deferred or reserved for clinical trial screening or for future monitoring needs, provided this does not delay therapy initiation [^1126gBCD] [^113DzT63]. Conversely, if non-G12C KRAS was called on a limited assay, a liquid biopsy now can be considered to complete comprehensive profiling without the morbidity of a re-biopsy, with reflex tissue if plasma is negative, balancing this against the urgency to start evidence-based first-line treatment [^1126gBCD] [^114WLz5j].

> Hold on, I should verify the regulatory context for KRAS G12C inhibitors before implying their frontline use. I almost said "proceed directly to a KRAS G12C inhibitor" based on a positive tissue result, but that would be a mistake in an untreated patient; I should correct myself because current FDA labels for sotorasib and adagrasib in NSCLC are for patients previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or platinum chemotherapy, not first-line use, so frontline decisions should still follow guideline-concordant chemoimmunotherapy or targeted therapy if another actionable driver is found, while KRAS G12C inhibitors remain appropriate subsequent-line options [^114s3n4x] [^116hyAAN] [^113UZ9uE].

> Addressing the "4 months untreated" timeline, let me reconsider whether molecular drift undermines the old tissue result. Prior data suggest many truncal drivers remain detectable over time and across assay types, and plasma positivity rates for drivers like MET exon 14 and KRAS G12C remain substantial even in later lines, though ctDNA shedding varies with disease burden and sites; practically, a 4-month gap does not invalidate a tissue driver call but does justify reassessing with a complementary plasma assay if the original testing was incomplete or if establishing a ctDNA baseline will aid longitudinal management [^1174KZfi] [^114s3n4x].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure a pragmatic, guideline-aligned plan that avoids treatment delays. Therefore, I would first verify the KRAS variant and the breadth of the prior tissue panel; if the prior testing was limited or if other guideline-recommended drivers were not assessed, I would order a broad-panel liquid biopsy now in parallel with arranging reflex comprehensive tissue CGP if plasma is negative or indeterminate, so that first-line therapy can be selected on complete information without unnecessary delay, and I would reserve KRAS G12C inhibitors for the appropriate post–first-line setting while using ctDNA for baseline and future response monitoring as clinically useful [^1126gBCD] [^114WLz5j] [^114s3n4x] [^114urUXA].

It is appropriate to obtain a liquid biopsy now because **liquid biopsy can detect additional actionable mutations** (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK, HER2) that may have been missed or untested in the initial tissue sample [^113UZ9uE], and **KRAS G12C can be confirmed in plasma** to guide targeted therapy selection [^114rEbr6]. Liquid biopsy is minimally invasive [^1142MvQN], offers rapid turnaround [^111eo12u], and is **recommended by guidelines** when tissue is limited or to complement tissue testing [^1126gBCD]; if plasma is negative, reflex tissue testing is advised [^1174KZfi] [^115NUuux]. This approach helps ensure no actionable driver is missed and enables timely, personalized treatment.

## Clinical utility of liquid biopsy in NSCLC

Liquid biopsy analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma, providing **real-time insights** into the tumor's genomic landscape [^1142MvQN]. It is **minimally invasive** and offers several advantages over tissue biopsy, including:

- **Minimally invasive**: Reduced patient discomfort and risk compared to tissue biopsy [^1142MvQN].

- **Rapid turnaround**: Faster results, enabling timely treatment decisions [^111eo12u].

- **Comprehensive profiling**: Ability to detect multiple genomic alterations simultaneously, including actionable mutations and resistance mechanisms [^1116YU3D].

- **Real-time monitoring**: Allows for serial monitoring of tumor evolution and response to therapy [^111jgqmr].

---

## Detection of additional actionable mutations

In NSCLC, numerous **actionable mutations** beyond KRAS — EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, MET, RET, NTRK, and HER2 — have corresponding targeted therapies that significantly improve patient outcomes [^113UZ9uE]. Liquid biopsy can detect these alterations when they were missed or untested on the initial tissue biopsy because of limited tissue or sampling bias [^113u4ALX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major oncology guidelines (IASLC, ESMO) recommend **comprehensive molecular profiling** for all patients with advanced NSCLC [^1126gBCD] and endorse liquid biopsy as a complementary or alternative approach when tissue is insufficient or unavailable [^1156i4pn]. The IASLC consensus highlights the role of liquid biopsy in identifying **actionable genomic alterations** and guiding targeted therapy selection [^1156i4pn], and ESMO likewise recommends its use to detect oncogenic drivers and resistance mutations, particularly when tissue biopsy is not feasible or could delay treatment initiation [^1126gBCD].

---

## Clinical scenarios where liquid biopsy is beneficial

Liquid biopsy is **particularly beneficial** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Insufficient tissue**: When the initial tissue biopsy sample is inadequate for comprehensive molecular testing [^1126gBCD].

- **Tumor heterogeneity**: To capture tumor heterogeneity and detect mutations that may not be present in a single tissue sample [^1139eVue].

- **Monitoring disease progression**: To detect emerging resistance mutations or new actionable targets during disease progression [^111jgqmr].

- **Patient preference**: When patients prefer a less invasive procedure compared to repeat tissue biopsy [^1142MvQN].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Liquid biopsy can have **lower sensitivity** than tissue biopsy in some settings — particularly in patients with low tumor burden or non-shedding tumors [^1142MvQN]. Negative plasma results can represent **false negatives** and should prompt confirmatory tissue testing when feasible [^1174KZfi] [^115NUuux]. Assay-to-assay variability in sensitivity, specificity, and genomic coverage can affect results; therefore, **test selection matters** [^116T195x].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting liquid biopsy

Several studies have demonstrated the **clinical utility** of liquid biopsy in NSCLC:

- **NILE study**: Demonstrated that liquid biopsy is at least as effective as tissue-based genotyping for identifying actionable genomic alterations, with significantly shorter turnaround times [^111eo12u].

- **LIBELULE trial**: Showed that early liquid biopsy testing reduced time to treatment initiation and improved clinical outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC.

- **Real-world studies**: Consistently highlight the practical benefits of liquid biopsy, including reduced complications, lower costs, and improved patient management [^1139VEzK].

---

## Clinical decision-making algorithm

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **clinical decision-making algorithm** is recommended:

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Perform comprehensive molecular profiling on initial tissue biopsy [^1126gBCD] |
| 2 | If tissue biopsy reveals only KRAS mutation, consider liquid biopsy to detect additional actionable mutations [^114WLz5j] |
| 3 | If liquid biopsy detects actionable mutations, initiate targeted therapy accordingly [^114rEbr6] |
| 4 | If liquid biopsy is negative or inconclusive, consider repeat tissue biopsy or alternative diagnostic methods [^1174KZfi] [^115NUuux] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given that the initial tissue biopsy showed only a KRAS mutation and the patient remains untreated, it is **clinically justified to perform a liquid biopsy** now [^1126gBCD]. Liquid biopsy can detect additional actionable mutations that may have been missed or untested on the initial sample, enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes [^111eo12u]. Current clinical guidelines and available evidence strongly support its use in this scenario, particularly when tissue samples are limited or unavailable [^1156i4pn].

Timely tissue reflex testing enables the use of targeted therapy and is associated with prolonged benefits for patients. We then studied the clinical value of confirmatory tissue testing for those with indeterminate liquid results (ctDNA TF < 1%). Subsequent TBx CGP after LBx, prior to 1L therapy, was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving matched targeted therapy (43/254, 17% vs. 9/220, 4%; Fig. 5A).

Targeted therapy use was limited in patients whose tissue CGP detected KRAS and MET alterations (2/16 and 1/7, respectively), likely due to lack of options (non-G12C KRAS, Supplementary Fig. S7) or testing occurring prior to the approval of appropriate targeted therapies. When excluding non-G12C KRAS patients along with driver-negative patients, 130 patients had a targetable driver on confirmatory TBx testing following a negative LBx. Among 81 with TBx results prior to 1L therapy, 53% (43) received targeted therapy compared with 18% (9/49) of patients with testing results after the start of 1L treatment (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S1). For patients treated with targeted therapy after timely tissue reflex CGP, both median rwPFS (15.9 months; Fig. 5C) and median rwOS (45.8 months; Fig. 5D) are favorable, consistent with prolonged benefit from the selected therapy.

Liquid biopsy is a molecular diagnostic procedure that aims to provide readily accessible genetic profiling of tumors for primary diagnosis, detection of minimal residual or metastatic disease, and therapeutic decision-making, especially for molecularly targeted treatments. Cancers release various biological markers into the circulation; the most widely used are cell-free tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells. The paucity of biological material means that laboratory methods mainly based on genetic sequencing expose this innovative diagnostic method to a considerable incidence of false negatives. The three cases presented here show how the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy may be improved through selective venous sampling.

Plasma DNA collected at the time of disease progression was analyzed through targeted sequencing to identify evidence of genomic evolution following treatment and potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to therapy. In total, 16 patients in the mCRC cohort and 2 patients in the non-colorectal cancer cohort had plasma DNA available at disease progression, allowing comparison with the baseline pretreatment ctDNA analysis (Fig. 3A).

Twelve patients (12/18, 67%) were found to have at least one acquired mutation upon disease progression. Of note, 2 patients with NSCLC in the non-colorectal cancer cohort had no detectable mutations in their progression plasma sample, and 4 patients in the mCRC cohort retained the original BRAF V600E mutation but no new mutations were identified at progression. Fifty percent (9/18) of patients showed the emergence of ≥ 1 KRAS or NRAS mutation, which was not detectable at baseline. Polyclonal KRAS mutations were observed in 6 of 9 patients (67%). Moreover, other MAPK pathway alterations such as MAP2K1 mutation were detected in 22% of patients. In addition to these findings, amplifications of MET and EGFR were detected in 2 patients, whereas 1 patient acquired MET amplification alone (Fig. 4C).

### Genetic features and therapeutic relevance of emergent circulating tumor DNA alterations in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers [^113bN6JZ]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Liquid biopsies have been used to elucidate tumor cell evolution in several cancer types, including non-small cell lung and colorectal cancer. The role of ctDNA in tracking genetic changes in response to treatment has also been demonstrated across several studies in colorectal cancers. Whether evolutionary changes in ctDNA, including the emergence of new alterations and changes in tumor mutation burden (TMB), have therapeutic relevance across cancer types remains undefined. Therefore, we analyze a national cohort of patients with advanced and refractory esophagogastric, pancreatic, biliary, and hepatocellular cancers who underwent serial liquid biopsies using a clinical ctDNA assay to characterize ctDNA changes over time.

Our results uncover mechanisms of treatment resistance to conventional therapies and demonstrate a high prevalence of emergent ctDNA alterations at progression that are associated with treatment actionability. We also observe considerable fluctuations in TMB and suggest the clinical utility of serial liquid biopsies in a case series of patients who received subsequent treatment matched to emergent alterations. As the standard practice is to obtain genomic profiling at a singular timepoint regardless of treatment history, our study supports the clinical utility of repeat tumor-naive liquid biopsies in a subset of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

### Preclinical study and parallel phase II trial evaluating antisense STAT3 oligonucleotide and checkpoint blockade for advanced pancreatic, non-small cell lung cancer and mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer [^116biHH3]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical trial translational correlatives analyzed liquid biopsy findings with a focus on the pancreatic cancer cohort, due to the lower number of NSCLC and MRD CRC patients. Of the 12 pancreatic patients tested, four exhibited baseline KRAS mutations detected through cfDNA, and two patients exhibited KRAS mutations detected through exosome DNA. The presence of baseline KRAS mutation by either method was not associated with patient outcomes.

Baseline mutation status assessed via tumor biopsies was obtained for 15 pancreatic cancer patients. Three patients were found to exhibit both TP53 and SMAD4 mutations. The presence of TP53 or SMAD4 mutations (n = 7) was associated with longer PFS (median 9.43 vs. 1.31 months, log-rank p = 0.034).

Among the entire cohort, two patients exhibited STK11 mutations — one with pancreatic cancer (290+1G > T) and another with NSCLC (721G > C). Both patients achieved a best response of SD. The pancreatic cancer and NSCLC patients with STK11 mutations were taken off study at three and seven months, respectively, due to grade 3 transaminitis, without evidence of progression of disease.

Flow cytometry was conducted on biopsy samples from six pancreatic cancer patients. Five experienced a best response of PD, while one exhibited SD lasting nine months. Interestingly, the one patient who achieved SD exhibited a higher proportion of dendritic cells than the other five patients. Flow cytometry noted trends in increased PD-1 expression on peripheral CD8 T cells and CD4 T effector and T regulatory cells.

### Kras mutations in non-small cell lung cancer [^114R4Ufy]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

Some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor a single specific mutated oncogene thought to be the primary genetic "driver" leading to cancer. The two most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer encode for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS. EGFR kinase domain mutations, only recently identified, have already been established in clinical settings as valid predictors of increased sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. By contrast, even though KRAS mutations were identified in NSCLC tumors more than 20 years ago, we have only just begun to appreciate the clinical value of KRAS tumor status. Recent studies indicate that patients with mutant KRAS tumors fail to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and their disease does not respond to EGFR inhibitors. There is a dire need for therapies specifically for patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC.

In this review, we summarize the initial discovery of RAS mutations in NSCLC, describe work exploring associations with clinical factors and outcomes, and provide an overview of approaches to targeting KRAS mutant NSCLC.

### Assessing the clinical utility of liquid biopsies across 5 potential indications from therapy selection to population screening: A review [^1142MvQN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

There has been great enthusiasm for the emerging technology of molecular-based tests to detect and quantify tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream, colloquially known as a liquid biopsy. However, less attention has been given to how their clinical utility depends on the indication for testing, which includes a range of clinical situations, each presenting unique challenges.

Five indications for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) blood testing were considered:

- **Therapy selection**: ctDNA tests can identify genetic alterations in patients with cancer amenable to targeted therapy, but most patients do not have a targetable alteration.

- **Response to therapy**: The absence of residual tumor DNA following cancer surgery could reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but it is unclear if this reduction will occur in practice.

- **Disease surveillance**: Following cancer treatment, ctDNA tests may detect cancer recurrence before symptoms appear. However, earlier intervention may have no effect on mortality.

- **Diagnosis of suspected cancer**: ctDNA tests are able to identify some symptomatic cancers, but how they add to the conventional diagnostic evaluation is unknown.

- **Screening for cancer**: Multicancer tests can detect many types of cancer, but their low sensitivity for early-stage tumors raises questions as to whether screening can help patients live longer or live better.

Circulating tumor DNA tests are being promoted for multiple indications. Numerous studies are ongoing, but randomized clinical trials of their effectiveness are still needed for definitive conclusions.

### A phase II trial to assess the evolution of the KRAS mutation load by liquid biopsy in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant NALIRIFOX [^1149iRKu]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the association between the KRAS mutational load and the histologic tumor response in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who received neoadjuvant treatment (NAC) with pegylated liposomal irinotecan in combination with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX), a multicenter, single-arm, interventional, open-label, phase 2 trial was conducted. Participants included were 18 years or older, had histologically or cytologically confirmed PDAC, were candidates for surgery, and received neoadjuvant NALIRIFOX. The primary outcome was the determination of the association between the KRAS mutational load and the histologic tumor response after chemotherapy.

Twenty patients were included in the study. Before initiating NAC, 11 patients were KRAS+, 6 were KRAS-, and 3 were not evaluable for KRAS mutation status. After treatment, 8 of the 11 (72.7%) patients changed from KRAS+ at baseline to KRAS-, and none of the 6 (0.0%) patients changed from KRAS- at baseline to KRAS+. A good histopathologic response after NAC was observed in 3 (15%) of the 20 patients; a greater proportion of good responses was noted among patients who were KRAS- (3 out of 16 [18.8%]) than among those who were KRAS+ (0 out of 1 [0.0%]) after NAC, although the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.633).

Our results indicate that patients with potentially resectable PDAC tend to have detectable KRAS in the blood if the disease is locally more advanced and that most patients who are treated with neoadjuvant NALIRIFOX show some degree of mutation clearance.

### Echoendoscopic ultrasound pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis and theranostic approach: Should mutation research be recommended in everyday practice [^113Ap9HM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The impact of KRAS mutation testing on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for reducing the need to repeat EUS-FNA has been demonstrated. However, such testing is not part of standard practice for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB).

- **Objectives**: We aim to analyze the proportion of non-contributive samples by EUS-FNB and evaluate the impact of KRAS mutation testing on diagnosis, theranostics, and survival.

- **Design**: In this retrospective study, the impact on diagnosis and survival of KRAS testing for contributive and non-contributive samples by EUS-FNB was analyzed.

- **Methods**: The EUS-FNB samples, combined with KRAS testing using the Idylla® technique on liquid-based cytology from patients with PDAC between February 2019 and May 2023, were retrospectively reviewed. The cytology results were classified according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization System for Reporting Pancreaticobiliary Cytopathology (WHOSRPC).

- **Results**: A total of 85 EUS-FNB specimens were reviewed. Among these, 25 EUS-FNB samples did not lead to a formal diagnosis of PDAC according to the WHOSRPC (30.2%). Out of these 25, 11 (44%) could have been considered positive for a PDAC diagnosis thanks to the KRAS mutation test without carrying out further diagnostic procedures. The sensitivity of KRAS mutation testing using the Idylla technique was 98.6%. According to the available data, survival rates were not statistically different depending on the type of mutation.

- **Conclusion**: KRAS mutat

### Diagnostic strategies toward clinical implementation of liquid biopsy RAS/BRAF circulating tumor DNA analyses in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer [^114sSwEG]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). High credibility.

Detection of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in tumor tissue is currently used to predict resistance to treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Liquid biopsies are minimally invasive, and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation analyses may better represent tumor heterogeneity. This study examined the incorporation of liquid biopsy RAS/BRAF ctDNA analyses into diagnostic strategies to determine mCRC patient eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy.

Tumor tissue and liquid biopsies were collected from 100 mCRC patients with liver-only metastases in a multicenter prospective clinical trial. Three diagnostic strategies incorporating droplet digital PCR ctDNA analyses were compared with routine tumor tissue RAS/BRAF mutation profiling using decision tree analyses. Tissue DNA mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were present in 54%, 0%, and 3% of mCRC patients, respectively. A 93% concordance was observed between tissue DNA and liquid biopsy ctDNA mutations. The proportion of patients with RAS/BRAF alterations increased from 57% to 60% for diagnostic strategies that combined tissue and liquid biopsy mutation analyses.

Consecutive RAS/BRAF ctDNA analysis followed by tissue DNA analysis in case of a liquid biopsy-negative result appeared to be the most optimal diagnostic strategy to comprehensively determine eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy in a cost-saving manner. These results highlight the potential clinical utility of liquid biopsies for detecting primary resistance to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^113DzT63]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

The rapid advancements in biomarker research and technology can create gaps in knowledge among healthcare practitioners. Molecular testing and interpreting genomic reports are becoming increasingly complex, and health professionals may find it difficult to understand how to correctly read or interpret the results. A recent survey found that oncologists feel less confident when dealing with multigene panel results compared to single-gene tests. Clinical practice guidelines for the management of lung cancer include guidance on how to perform molecular testing. Several professional bodies, such as ESMO, ASCO, and NCCN, have also issued additional specific guidance on how to select patients, perform procedures, or interpret molecular test results.

### Concordance between comprehensive cancer genome profiling in plasma and tumor specimens [^1116YU3D]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Detection of somatic genomic alterations in the plasma of patients with cancer ("liquid biopsy") is increasingly being used in the clinic. However, the concordance of alterations identified in liquid biopsies with those detected in cancer specimens is not routinely being determined.

- **Methods**: We sought to systematically compare alterations found by a massively parallel sequencing liquid biopsy assay covering 39 genes (NEOliquid [NEO New Oncology GmbH, Köln, Germany]) with those identified through routine diagnostic testing in a certified central pathology laboratory in a cohort of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. NEOliquid is based on enrichment of the genomic territory of interest by hybrid capture and is thus capable of detecting point mutations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and gene rearrangements/fusions in a single assay.

- **Results**: In a cohort of 82 patients with matched blood/tissue samples, the concordance between NEOliquid and tissue-based routine testing was 98%. The sensitivity of NEOliquid was higher than 70%, and the specificity was 100%. Discordant cases included those with insufficient amounts of circulating tumor DNA in plasma and cases in which known driver mutations (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)), 1 systolic gene [IDH1] R132H, kinesin family member 5B gene [KIF5b-ret proto-oncogene [RET], or MNNG HOS transforming gene [MET] exon 14) were found in the plasma but were not interrogated by routine tissue analyses.

- **Conclusions**: In summary, NEOliquid offers accurate and reliable detection of clinically relevant genomic alterations in plasma samples.

### The emerging role of "liquid biopsies", circulating tumor cells, and circulating cell-free tumor DNA in lung cancer diagnosis and identification of resistance mutations [^1113XRk9]. Current Oncology Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Therapeutic advances in the treatment of lung cancer are in part due to a more complete understanding of its genomic portrait. The serial monitoring of tumor genotypes, which are instable and prone to changes under selective pressure, is becoming increasingly needed. Although tumor biopsies remain the reference standard for the diagnosis and genotyping of lung cancer, they are invasive and not always feasible.

"Liquid biopsies" have the potential to overcome many of these hurdles, allowing for rapid and accurate identification of de novo and resistant genetic alterations and real-time monitoring of treatment responses. In this review, we provide insights into new liquid diagnostic platforms and discuss the role of circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA in the diagnosis and identification of resistance mutations in lung cancer.

### Application of liquid biopsies in cancer targeted therapy [^1175WMhR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

As a growing body of evidence demonstrates intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution during carcinogenesis and throughout treatment, resulting in acquired drug resistance, the utility of blood-based assays or "liquid biopsies" is becoming increasingly recognized in clinical practice and trial design. "Liquid biopsies" provide a less invasive approach to the gold standard of interrogating tumors by tissue biopsies, which are frequently unfeasible, associated with morbidity, and cannot be performed as often.

### Liquid biopsy testing for the management of patient with non-small cell lung cancer carrying a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion [^113iQ1es]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence suggests that liquid biopsy might play a relevant role in the management of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Here, we show how the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) in our cancer center employed liquid biopsy to support therapeutic decisions in a patient with NSCLC carrying a rare EGFR mutation.

A 44-year-old woman, a never-smoker with an EGFR, ALK, and ROS1-negative lung adenocarcinoma and multiple brain metastases, received systemic therapy and surgery before being referred to our institute. The MTB suggested next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing of the tumor biopsy, which revealed a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion (p. His773dup; c.2315_2316insCCA) and EGFR amplification. The MTB recommended treatment with erlotinib and follow-up with liquid biopsy using both cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). An increase in EGFR mutation levels in cfDNA revealed resistance to treatment about six months before clinical progression. Extremely low levels of EGFR p.T790M were detected at progression.

Based on preclinical data suggesting the activity of osimertinib against EGFR exon-20 insertions, the MTB recommended treatment with brain and bone radiotherapy and osimertinib. A dramatic reduction in EGFR mutation levels in the cfDNA was observed after four weeks of treatment. The PET scan demonstrated a metabolic partial remission that was maintained for nine months. This case supports the evidence that liquid biopsy can aid in the management of metastatic NSCLC and suggests that treatment with osimertinib might be a therapeutic option in patients with EGFR exon-20 insertions.

### Liquid and tissue biopsies for identifying MET exon 14 skipping NSCLC: Analyses from the Phase II VISION study of tepotinib [^1174KZfi]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). High credibility.

Prior data indicate that actionable genetic drivers generally remain detectable over the course of treatment for metastatic cancers. Accordingly, in TBx-positive patients, MET ex14 skipping was detected in LBx collected up to 1,111 days after the positive TBx, supporting the stability of MET ex14 skipping over time.

Collectively, the VISION trial data indicate that TBx and LBx are both suitable for the detection of MET ex14 skipping and should ideally be used together as complementary methods at diagnosis to maximize the identification of candidates for MET inhibitor treatment. Consistent with the "tissue-first" and "plasma-first" approaches recommended by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, as well as the tepotinib US Prescribing Information, a positive result from either biopsy type can be considered sufficient for MET inhibitor eligibility.

A negative LBx result may be followed up by tissue testing, where possible, to minimize missed opportunities to receive an MET inhibitor due to false-negative results caused by low ctDNA shedding. Recent data suggest that reflex tissue testing is especially important in patients with low ctDNA levels (tumor fraction < 1%), who have an appreciable risk of false-negative results, but may add limited value in patients with high ctDNA levels (tumor fraction ≥ 1%). Other potential sources of assay discordance include technical variation and tumor heterogeneity, which can cause false-negative TBx results.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^115fXZHF]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

To inform prognosis, treatment response, disease biology, and KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity, we conducted exploratory circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling on 134 patients with solid tumors harboring a KRAS G12C mutation treated with single-agent divarasib (GDC-6036) in a phase 1 study.

- **Experimental design**: Plasma samples were collected for serial ctDNA profiling at baseline (cycle 1 day 1 prior to treatment) and multiple on-treatment time points (cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 3 day 1).

- **Results**: KRAS G12C ctDNA was detectable from plasma samples in 72.9% (43/59) and 92.6% (50/54) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively, the majority of whom were eligible for study participation based on a local test detecting the KRAS G12C mutation in tumor tissue. Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was associated with tumor type, disease burden, and metastatic sites. A decline in ctDNA level was observed as early as cycle 1 day 15. Serial assessment showed a decline in ctDNA tumor fraction associated with response and progression-free survival. Except for a few cases of KRAS G12C sub-clonality, on-treatment changes in KRAS G12C variant allele frequency mirrored changes in the overall ctDNA tumor fraction.

- **Conclusions**: Across tumor types, the KRAS G12C mutation likely represents a truncal mutation in the majority of patients. Rapid and deep decline in ctDNA tumor fraction was observed in patients responding to divarasib treatment. Early on-treatment dynamics of ctDNA were associated with patient outcomes and tumor response to divarasib treatment.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^116WSK6a]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

To further validate the finding that different tumor types bearing the same KRAS G12C mutation may have distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, we utilized a pan-cancer real-world genomic database comprising patients who received liquid biopsy-based CGP at Foundation Medicine Inc. as part of routine clinical care. Estimated using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx assay, the median ctDNA tumor fraction was 3.5%, 13.2%, and 4.6% among patients with stage IV KRAS G12C-positive NSCLC (n = 507), colorectal cancer (n = 83), and other solid tumors (n = 271), respectively [Supplementary Fig. S2].

Baseline ctDNA tumor fraction was positively associated with tumor volume [sum of longest diameter (SLD)], with Pearson's r = 0.412 and r = 0.420 in NSCLC and colorectal cancer, respectively [Fig. 2C], consistent with previous studies. There was also a trend of positive association between baseline ctDNA tumor fraction and the number of metastatic sites [Fig. 2D]. Among patients with NSCLC, the presence of liver, bone, lymph node, or adrenal gland metastasis showed a mild trend of positive association with higher ctDNA tumor fractions [Fig. 2E]. Conversely, the presence of brain metastasis showed no association with higher ctDNA tumor fractions [Fig. 2E]. Among patients with colorectal cancer, the presence of liver metastasis was associated with higher levels of ctDNA tumor fraction regardless of the presence or absence of lung metastasis [Fig. 2F and G]. In contrast, no association was found between baseline ctDNA tumor fraction and the number of prior lines of systemic therapy [Fig. 2H].

### Molecular testing for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: How to implement evidence-based recommendations [^111N1Q4x]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of relevant biomarkers has reshaped our approach to therapy selection for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The unprecedented outcomes demonstrated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in molecularly defined cohorts of patients underscore the importance of genetic profiling in this disease. Despite published guidelines on biomarker testing, successful tumor genotyping faces significant hurdles at both academic and community-based practices. Oncologists are now faced with interpreting large-scale genomic data from multiple tumor types, possibly making it difficult to stay with practice standards in lung cancer.

In addition, physicians' lack of time, resources, and face-to-face opportunities can interfere with the multidisciplinary approach that is essential to the delivery of care. Finally, several challenges exist in optimizing the amount and quality of tissue for molecular testing. Recognizing the importance of biomarker testing, a series of advisory boards were recently convened to address these hurdles and clarify best practices. We reviewed these challenges and established recommendations to help optimize tissue acquisition, processing, and testing within the framework of a multidisciplinary approach.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^115phhGe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging tool for understanding the mutational landscape of cancer through minimally invasive liquid biopsies. It has the potential to better capture tumor genomic heterogeneity present across all tumor lesions, including primary and metastatic sites, in the body. ctDNA can be utilized clinically in biomarker selection and risk stratification and can potentially serve as an early surrogate of tumor response and long-term outcomes. Although tissue-based molecular profiling remains the gold standard, liquid-based assays have become an alternative approach for tumor mutation detection and companion diagnostic purposes, with multiple tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Most panel-based ctDNA assays have a limit of detection (LOD) near 0.5% or 0.1%, while tumor-informed approaches can have sensitivity at 0.01% or below. Despite this, false negatives are still possible depending on the patient's disease, such as if they have early-stage disease or a non-shedding tumor. Recommendations state that patients who test negative for select biomarkers with liquid biopsies should be referred to routine biopsy and testing with biopsy specimens if feasible.

In addition to the clinical utility of companion diagnostics, there are collaborative initiatives to build an evidentiary roadmap for using ctDNA as an early endpoint for regulatory decision-making. However, key knowledge gaps remain, such as establishing the baseline ctDNA tumor fraction across tumor types.

### Vectibix [^115J3PUJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Vectibix in combination with sotorasib was evaluated in CodeBreaK 300 [NCT 05198934], a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study conducted in previously treated patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Key eligibility criteria included patients 18 years of age or older, who had received at least one prior line of therapy for mCRC, and who had received prior fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan for metastatic disease unless there was a medical contraindication.

All patients were also required to have KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC prospectively identified in tumor tissue samples using the QIAGEN Therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR performed in a central laboratory. Other eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).

A total of 160 patients with previously treated mCRC with the KRAS G12C mutation were randomized 1:1:1 to receive Vectibix 6 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks and sotorasib 960 mg orally daily (N = 53), Vectibix 6 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks and sotorasib 240 mg orally daily (N = 53), or the investigator's choice of standard of care (SOC) consisting of trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib (N = 54). Randomization was stratified by prior anti-angiogenic therapy (yes or no), time from initial diagnosis of metastatic disease to randomization (≥ 18 months or < 18 months), and ECOG status (0 or 1 versus 2). Patients received treatment until disease progression, lack of clinical benefit, or intolerance to treatment.

### Echoendoscopic ultrasound pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis and theranostic approach: Should mutation research be recommended in everyday practice [^112KhwNX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The impact of KRAS mutation testing on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for reducing the need to repeat EUS-FNA has been demonstrated. However, such testing is not part of standard practice for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB).

- **Objectives**: We aim to analyze the proportion of non-contributive samples by EUS-FNB and to evaluate the impact of KRAS mutation testing on the diagnosis, theranostics, and survival.

- **Design**: In this retrospective study, the impact on diagnosis and survival of KRAS testing for contributive and non-contributive samples by EUS-FNB was analyzed.

- **Methods**: The EUS-FNB samples, combined with KRAS testing using the Idylla® technique on liquid-based cytology from patients with PDAC between February 2019 and May 2023, were retrospectively reviewed. The cytology results were classified according to the guidelines of the World Health Organization System for Reporting Pancreaticobiliary Cytopathology (WHOSRPC).

- **Results**: A total of 85 EUS-FNB specimens were reviewed. In all, 25 EUS-FNB samples did not lead to a formal diagnosis of PDAC according to the WHOSRPC (30.2%). Out of these 25, 11 (44%) could have been considered positive for a PDAC diagnosis thanks to the KRAS mutation test without carrying out further diagnostic procedures. The sensitivity of KRAS mutation testing using the Idylla technique was 98.6%. According to the available data, survival rates were not statistically different depending on the type of mutation.

### Evolution and clinical impact of EGFR mutations in circulating free DNA in the BELIEF trial [^111jgqmr]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Longitudinal evaluation of mutations in blood samples was a prespecified secondary objective in the BELIEF trial of erlotinib and bevacizumab in advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC. Here, we report the testing results and explore the correlation of EGFR status in blood with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were prospectively collected from patients at baseline, at response evaluation, and at progression and sent to a central laboratory. Circulating free DNA was purified, and EGFR mutations were analyzed with a validated real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.

- **Results**: EGFR exon 19/21 mutations were detected in 55 of 91 baseline blood samples (60.4%) and correlated with a significantly worse progression-free survival: 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.0–14.8 mo) for the patients who were positive versus 22.9 months (95% CI: 9.5–33.9 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.0020). Among the 74 samples at response, exon 19/21 mutations were detected only in three samples (4.1%). In contrast, 29 of 58 patients (50.0%) were exon 19/21 positive at progression and showed a significantly worse median overall survival of 21.7 months (95% CI: 17.0–30.9 mo) compared with 37.4 months (95% CI: 22.6–53.1 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.011). Blood samples at the three time points were available for 48 patients. Of those, among 14 exon 19/21 EGFR-negative at presentation, 13 (93%) were persistently negative for the sensitizing mutations after progression, and the p.T790M could only be detected in the blood of two patients.

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^114WLz5j]. The Oncologist (2025). High credibility.

Traditionally, tumor tissue has been the standard biospecimen for most molecular-based biomarker testing. However, it carries several inherent limitations related to the accessibility of the biopsy locations, inadequate tissue for molecular testing, and tumor heterogeneity, particularly in patients progressing on treatment. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization are not suitable for ctDNA evaluation. Increasingly, liquid biopsy offers a more practical alternative in the diagnostic setting if tumor tissue testing is not possible and more often at the time of progression or metastasis when tissue may not be accessible.

NSCLC has been the main test area for establishing this sampling method for examining tumor-derived alterations. Liquid biopsy refers to the procedure of collecting blood, from which molecular components can be isolated and examined. In lung cancer, liquid biopsies are most frequently used to isolate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), which in turn can be assessed for gene mutations. The first liquid biopsy test ever approved was the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 in 2016. This uses plasma specimens as a companion diagnostic test for the detection of exon 19 deletions or exon 21 substitution mutations in the EGFR gene to guide therapy with anti-EGFR TKIs. More sensitive tests have become available since.

Liquid biopsy is not invasive and bypasses issues related to tumor heterogeneity, thus having the potential to be used for real-time detection and monitoring of lung cancer disease progression. It does have limitations, however, namely the rise in complexities associated with…

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^1162ik99]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Real-world clinical practice is complex, as local institutional setups and procedures, as well as issues about cost and reimbursement, cannot be ignored. In addition, as mentioned previously, molecular testing is variable and frequently suboptimal, either occurring too late in the diagnostic journey or not at all. Several challenges may contribute to this.

In delivering precision medicine-based patient-centered care, effective collaboration and communication are paramount. This requires several types of expertise and specialized knowledge best delivered via a well-coordinated multidisciplinary team (MDT). Logistical issues such as a lack of standardized protocols and operating procedures, together with time pressure or capacity issues, hinder efficient communication. The need for sharing and interpreting data in real-time compounds these challenges. Other critical and more practical challenges are discussed below.

- **Challenges and best practices of tissue acquisition, tissue quality, biomarker testing, and reporting**: Any method that provides high-quality tissue for diagnosis, staging, and biomarker testing, while posing minimal risk to the patient, may be considered suitable for tissue acquisition. In diagnosing lung cancer, the most appropriate biopsy site is determined by a team of specialists, including respiratory physicians, pathologists, oncologists, and surgeons. Bronchoscopy, with or without endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), surgical resections, percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy (CNB), or pleural or lymph…

### Liquid biopsy testing for the management of patient with non-small cell lung cancer carrying a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion [^117UKNah]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence suggests that liquid biopsy might play a relevant role in the management of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Here, we show how the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) in our cancer center employed liquid biopsy to support therapeutic decisions in a patient with NSCLC carrying a rare EGFR mutation.

A 44-year-old woman, never-smoker with an EGFR, ALK, and ROS1-negative lung adenocarcinoma and multiple brain metastases received systemic therapy and surgery before being referred to our institute. The MTB suggested next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing of the tumor biopsy that revealed a rare exon-20 EGFR insertion (p. His773dup; c.2315_2316insCCA) and EGFR amplification. The MTB recommended treatment with erlotinib and follow-up with liquid biopsy, using both cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

An increase in EGFR mutation levels in cfDNA revealed resistance to treatment about 6 months before clinical progression. Extremely low levels of EGFR p.T790M were detected at progression. Based on preclinical data suggesting the activity of osimertinib against EGFR exon-20 insertions, the MTB recommended treatment with brain and bone radiotherapy and osimertinib. A dramatic reduction of EGFR mutation levels in the cfDNA was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. The PET scan demonstrated a metabolic partial remission that was maintained for 9 months.

This case supports the evidence that liquid biopsy can aid in the management of metastatic NSCLC. It also suggests that treatment with osimertinib might be a therapeutic option in patients with EGFR exon-20 insertions.

### Potential clinical utility of liquid biopsy in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^113cAbRZ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, the types of liquid biomarkers, detection technologies, platforms, and the lack of a standardized ctDNA detection manual all contribute to the great heterogeneity among the included studies. Second, there were ten extensive stage patients enrolled in our analysis, but their impact may be negligible. In addition, even though we have completed a comprehensive and systematic search of the literature, publication bias is still inevitable. Finally, some studies did not report detailed information on histology and radiology, and further analysis was therefore limited.

### Krazati [^116hyAAN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR and DOR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR. In the efficacy population, KRAS G12C mutation status was determined by prospective local testing using tumor tissue specimens. Of the 94 patients with KRAS G12C mutation, tissue samples from 79% (74/94) of patients were tested retrospectively using the QIAGEN therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit. Of the 74 tissue samples submitted, 81% (60/74) yielded a result, with 93% (56/60) positive for KRAS G12C and 7% (4/60) without a KRAS G12C mutation identified.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics in the efficacy population were: median age 57 years (range: 24 to 75 years), 53% female, 71% White, 14% Black or African American, 5% Asian, 1.1% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 9% reported as other. ECOG PS was 51% at 0 and 49% at 1. Tumor histology was 100% adenocarcinoma, and 99% of patients had metastatic disease. Patients received a median of 3 prior systemic therapies (range 1 to 9); 9% received 1 prior line, 36% received 2 prior lines, 31% received 3 prior lines, and 25% received 4 or more prior lines. Sites of metastatic disease included lung (71%), liver (64%), and bone (14%).

### Emerging molecular testing paradigms in non-small cell lung cancer management-current perspectives and recommendations [^116c9hzT]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Precision medicine in patient care requires specialized knowledge that is best delivered via a well-coordinated and well-educated multidisciplinary team (MDT), equipped at the time of writing with the latest developments in lung biomarker research and testing technology. Molecular testing should be performed in clinical situations where there is evidence that targeting particular molecular alterations makes a clinical difference. Specimen acquisition and processing of tissue should follow well-established standard procedures and protocols. For genomic testing, next-generation sequencing using multigene panels is highly recommended.

Besides methodological aspects, effective collaboration and communication within the MDT are paramount. Patients should be evaluated by MDTs implementing rapid on-site evaluation and reflex testing to improve testing efficiency and reduce the time-to-treatment initiation.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^113nntJy]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Low credibility.

Oncogenic driver mutations in KRAS have been shown to be a frequent initiating event that usually occurs early during tumorigenesis. However, subclonal KRAS driver mutations also exist and were reported to be more common in certain tumor types, such as colorectal cancer, than others. Here, we tracked KRAS G12C and overall ctDNA tumor fractions simultaneously at baseline and upon treatment with divarasib using serial plasma profiling. Except for a few outliers with a subclonal KRAS G12C mutation, the dynamics of KRAS G12C VAF upon divarasib treatment mirrored that of the overall ctDNA tumor fraction. These data from a clinical study with a KRAS G12C inhibitor represent strong evidence that the KRAS G12C mutation is likely truncal in the vast majority of patients across tumor types.

In this study, we observed that patients with metastatic NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors bearing the KRAS G12C mutation have different mutation detectability in plasma samples associated with distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, and these results were further validated with an independent real-world pan-cancer liquid biopsy cohort. In general, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer tend to have a higher ctDNA tumor fraction and thus higher detectability of the KRAS G12C mutation in plasma samples than patients with metastatic NSCLC. This may impact the utility of a blood-based diagnostic assay for KRAS G12C inhibitors, potentially resulting in a higher rate of reflex testing with a tissue-based assay in NSCLC. In addition to tumor type, we found that ctDNA tumor fractions…

### Complications, costs, and health care resource use with tissue biopsy followed by liquid biopsy versus tissue re-biopsy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer [^117SgqsJ]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Lung cancer was projected to cause more than 127,000 deaths in the United States in 2023. Worldwide, lung cancer leads to approximately 1.8 million deaths annually. The most common form, nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancer cases. This form is associated with high mortality, and patients with NSCLC have a 5-year relative survival rate of only 25%. More than 50% of patients with NSCLC have metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) at diagnosis, and patients with mNSCLC have an especially poor prognosis, with only 6% surviving 5 years after diagnosis.

Molecular-based therapies have improved outcomes such as objective response rate and progression-free survival for patients with mNSCLC that is driven by actionable mutations. Targeted therapies are recommended to treat mNSCLC with confirmed aberrations in several genes, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS); ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK); ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1); B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF); neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK); MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET); RET proto-oncogene (RET); and ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2). NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer recommend, when feasible, broad molecular profiling to identify these and other biomarkers to optimize targeted treatment.

Until recently, tissue biopsy testing was the standard of care for pathologic confirmation of NSCLC and for predictive biomarker detection to guide.

### Kras inhibition with sotorasib in advanced solid tumors [^1121yFEa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

No therapies targeting KRAS mutations in cancer have been approved. The KRAS p.G12C mutation occurs in 13% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and in 1 to 3% of colorectal and other cancers. Sotorasib is a small molecule that selectively and irreversibly targets KRAS G12C.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 1 trial of sotorasib in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring the KRAS p.G12C mutation. Patients received sotorasib orally once daily. The primary endpoint was safety. Key secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics and objective response, assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.

- **Results**: A total of 129 patients (59 with NSCLC, 42 with colorectal cancer, and 28 with other tumors) were included in dose escalation and expansion cohorts. Patients had received a median of 3 previous lines of anticancer therapies for metastatic disease (range, 0 to 11). No dose-limiting toxic effects or treatment-related deaths were observed. A total of 73 patients (56.6%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, and 15 patients (11.6%) had grade 3 or 4 events. In the NSCLC subgroup, 32.2% (19 patients) had a confirmed objective response (complete or partial response), and 88.1% (52 patients) had disease control (objective response or stable disease); the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (range, 0.0+ to 14.9, with + indicating censored data). In the colorectal cancer subgroup, 7.1% (3 patients) had a confirmed response, and 73.8% (31 patients) had disease control.

### Liquid biopsy-based precision therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors: A real-world experience from a community-based oncology practice [^115bwEPT]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

For each patient, potential molecular targets and therapies were reviewed based on the aberration(s) detected by the assay. A distinction was made between actionable mutations, which are aberrations amenable to targeted therapy with any FDA-approved agent, and non-actionable mutations. A test report with one alteration was considered a "positive" test, while the absence of any alteration was considered a "negative" test result. Within the cohort of patients with a positive test result, a further distinction was made between those with non-actionable and those with actionable mutations who could benefit from target-specific FDA-approved agents, either within or outside FDA indication/off-label use. The availability of target-based clinical trial opportunities for patients with a positive test but no actionable mutation was also noted.

The choice of a therapeutic option was at the discretion of the treating oncologist. This was reviewed retrospectively: treatment was considered "matched" if the patient received at least one agent targeting at least one aberration, whether using an FDA-approved agent, an off-label agent, or through a signal-based clinical trial opportunity. Patients who received non-targeted therapy when an actionable mutation/signal was available were considered "unmatched", and the reason for not matching was listed.

In patients who received signal-based targeted therapy, a "matching score" was used. For each patient, the number of received matched drugs (numerator) was divided by the number of aberrations.

The study is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical utility of liquid biopsy, focusing on early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regarding the commonly detected biomarkers: circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), methylation signatures, and microRNAs. The present study indicated that liquid biopsy could reliably facilitate more precise and effective management of early-stage NSCLC.

The early detection of lung cancer is critical for reducing its mortality and morbidity. In recent decades, many studies have investigated the screening and diagnostic values of different biomarkers, including ctDNA, CTCs, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. Our analysis indicated that these common biomarkers could provide similar diagnostic accuracy for early-stage NSCLC, with acceptable effectiveness in areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.84 to 0.87. With the development of platforms and technology, ctDNA analysis has provided a practical approach to the noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors. In addition, the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics profiles was newly highlighted as a novel approach and pattern for the accurate screening, early detection, and monitoring of human cancer. With the advantages of an early appearance in the disease course, cancer specificity, biological stability, and ready accessibility in bodily fluids, aberrant DNA methylation analysis combined with machine learning provided the opportunity to overcome the challenge of the low abundance of ctDNA in plasma samples. CTCs in the blood could serve as effective screening and diagnostic markers to discriminate small malignant pulmonary lesions.

### Are liquid biopsies a surrogate for tissue EGFR testing [^116HJ2Bt]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Molecular profiling has changed the treatment landscape in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Accurately identifying the tumors that harbor sensitizing EGFR mutations, the most common targetable molecular alteration, as well as those with acquired resistance mutations (e.g. T790M) on treatment is a high clinical priority. The clinical gold standard is genotyping of tumor specimens. However, the practical utility of this approach is limited by the lack of available tissue and the potential complications associated with biopsies.

With the advent of newer sequencing assays, it has become feasible to assess tumor genomics via a blood sample, termed a 'liquid biopsy'. In this review, we summarize the available techniques for liquid biopsies and their applicability for detecting sensitizing and resistance EGFR mutations, and how these results may be used for making treatment decisions.

### Practical considerations for the use of circulating tumor DNA in the treatment of patients with cancer: A narrative review [^116T195x]. JAMA Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine based on tumor profiling and identification of actionable genomic alterations is pivotal in cancer management. Although tissue biopsy is still preferred for diagnosis, liquid biopsy of blood-based tumor analytes, such as circulating tumor DNA, is a rapidly emerging technology for tumor profiling.

This review presents a practical overview for clinicians and allied health care professionals for selection of the most appropriate liquid biopsy assay, specifically focusing on circulating tumor DNA and how it may affect patient treatment and case management across multiple tumor types. Multiple factors influence the analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of testing. This review provides recommendations and practical guidance for best practices.

- **Methodologies**: Include polymerase chain reaction-based approaches and those that use next-generation sequencing (e.g. capture-based profiling, whole exome, or genome sequencing).
- **Factors influencing utility**: Sensitivity and specificity, quantity of circulating tumor DNA, detection of a small vs. a large panel of genes, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential.

Currently, liquid biopsy appears useful in patients unable to undergo biopsy or where mutations detected may be more representative of the predominant tumor burden than for tissue-based assays. Other potential applications may include screening, primary diagnosis, residual disease, local recurrence, therapy selection, or early therapy response and resistance monitoring.

### Libelule: A randomized phase III study to evaluate the clinical relevance of early liquid biopsy in patients with suspicious metastatic lung cancer [^114urUXA]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Genomic profiling is a major component for first-line treatment decisions in patients with NSCLC, and the timeliness of biomarker testing is essential to improve time to treatment initiation (TTI) or avoid inappropriate treatment.

- **Methods**: The phase III LIquid Biopsy for the Early detection of LUng cancer Lesion trial (NCT03721120) included patients with radiological suspicion of advanced lung cancer. They were randomized (1:1), with the control arm receiving diagnostic procedures according to each center's practice and the liquid biopsy arm receiving additional testing performed at the first visit using the InVisionFirst-Lung assay. Treatment initiation and type were defined according to the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to initiation of appropriate treatment based on informative genomic and pathological results in the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: A total of 319 patients were enrolled (liquid biopsy [LB]: 161; control: 158). The median age was 68 years, 28.8% were non-smokers, 18.1% had a performance status of 2 or higher, and 56.7% had adenocarcinoma. In the LB arm, 81% of patients had circulating tumor DNA findings. The mean TTI was not significantly reduced (LB: 29.0 d; control: 34 d [p = 0.26]). Sensitivity analyses found a shorter TTI in patients from the LB arm who received systemic treatment (LB: 29.1 d; control: 38.9 d, [p = 0.01]), in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC (LB: 29.5 d; control: 40.3 d, [p = 0.01]), and in patients with first-line targetable alterations (LB: 21 d).

### Liquid biopsy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): A statement paper from the IASLC [^1156i4pn]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The isolation and analysis of circulating cell-free tumor DNA in plasma is a powerful tool with considerable potential to improve clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types, including NSCLC. Assays of this nature that use blood as opposed to tumor samples are frequently referred to as liquid biopsies. An increasing number of innovative platforms have recently been developed that improve not only the fidelity of the molecular analysis but also the number of tests performed on a single specimen. Circulating tumor DNA assays for the detection of both EGFR-sensitizing and resistance mutations have already entered clinical practice, and many other molecular tests — such as the detection of resistance mutations for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase rearrangements — are likely to do so in the near future.

Due to an abundance of new evidence, an appraisal was warranted to review strengths and weaknesses, to describe what is already in clinical practice, and what has yet to be implemented, and to highlight areas in need of further investigation. A multidisciplinary panel of experts in the field of thoracic oncology, with an interest and expertise in liquid biopsy and molecular pathology, was convened by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer to evaluate available evidence with the aim of producing a set of recommendations for the use of liquid biopsy for molecular analysis in guiding the clinical management of advanced NSCLC patients as well as identifying unmet needs.

In summary, the panel concluded that liquid biopsy approaches have significant potential for transforming clinical management.

### Usefulness of circulating tumor DNA in identifying somatic mutations and tracking tumor evolution in patients with non-small cell lung cancer [^112kXUCi]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

In agreement with biopsy-based findings, we found that KRAS and EGFR gene mutations were significantly mutually exclusive, whereas MET and CDK6 amplifications were significantly mutually co-occurring with BRAF amplifications. A low cumulative percent VAF in ctDNA was an independent predictor of longer PFS after adjusting for patient age, sex, and smoking status. Low levels of cumulative percent ctDNA potentially indicate a low tumor burden as detected in the blood, and thus less severe disease. Given the fleeting nature of ctDNA, it is not surprising to find no significant association of ctDNA with OS. Other studies have also demonstrated the prognostic value of pretreatment or presurgery cell-free DNA levels as a surrogate marker for tumor burden and treatment response in many cancers.

Studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in patients harboring EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF mutations when targeted agents were directed against these driver and resistant mutations. In our study, patients with BRAF, PIK3CA, or KRAS mutations, as detected by ctDNA, showed significantly worse survival rates. Although FDA-approved BRAF-targeted therapy is available for NSCLC, patients with positive BRAF findings received EGFR-targeted therapies or chemotherapies because of the presence of actionable EGFR-sensitizing or KRAS mutations. Despite the PIK3CA mutations, PIK3CA-targeted therapies were rare because PIK3CA mutations often went undetected in tissue biopsy samples and are not considered actionable in NSCLC. Currently, no KRAS-targeted therapy is available, and biomarker data remain a critical component of therapeutic decisions.

### Vectibix [^111UZXmf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to the initiation of treatment with Vectibix as monotherapy for RAS wild-type mCRC, it is essential to assess the RAS mutational status in colorectal tumors. Confirm the absence of a RAS mutation in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of both KRAS and NRAS. In cases of KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, before starting treatment with Vectibix in combination with sotorasib, the presence of the KRAS G12C mutation must be confirmed using an FDA-approved test. For more information, FDA-approved tests for detecting RAS mutations in patients with mCRC can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.

- **Recommended dosage**:

	- **RAS wild-type mCRC**: The recommended dosage of Vectibix is 6 mg/kg, administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. During Vectibix infusions, appropriate medical resources should be available to address severe infusion reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

	- **KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC**: Administer the first sotorasib dose before the first Vectibix infusion. The recommended dosage for Vectibix in combination with sotorasib is 6 mg/kg, administered as an intravenous infusion every 14 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until sotorasib is withheld or discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]. Refer to the sotorasib full prescribing information for recommended sotorasib dosing information.

### Biomarker testing and time to treatment decision in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer [^1173gJRz]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Testing for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement has become standard in managing advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, many institutions in Europe, North America, and other world regions continue to face a common challenge of facilitating timely molecular testing with rapid result turnaround time. We assessed the prevalence of biomarker testing for advanced NSCLC patients and whether testing affected the timeliness of treatment decisions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of a random sample of one-quarter of all patients with advanced NSCLC referred to the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013.

- **Results**: Of 300 patients reviewed, 175 seen by medical oncology had nonsquamous NSCLC, 72% of whom had biomarker testing carried out. Patients tested for biomarkers were more likely to be female (47% versus 21%, P = 0.002), Asian (27% versus 6%, P = 0.005), and never smokers (42% versus 8%, P < 0.0001). Only 21% of patients with biomarker testing had results available at their initial oncology consultation. This group had a shorter median time from consultation to treatment decision (0 versus 22 days, P = 0.0008) and time to treatment start (16 versus 29 days, P = 0.004). Thirteen percent underwent repeat biopsy for molecular testing after the initial consultation. Of those with positive EGFR or ALK results, 19% started chemotherapy before biomarker results became available.

- **Conclusions**: Awaiting biomarker testing results can delay treatment decisions and treatment initiation for patients with advanced NSCLC.

### Residual ctdna after treatment predicts early relapse in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^111HmLJv]. Annals of Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Identification of residual disease in patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following treatment with curative intent holds promise to identify patients at risk of relapse. New methods can detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma to fractional concentrations as low as a few parts per million, and clinical evidence is required to inform their use.

- **Patients and methods**: We analyzed 363 serial plasma samples from 88 patients with early-stage NSCLC (stage I: 48.9%, stage II: 28.4%, stage III: 22.7%), predominantly adenocarcinomas (62.5%), treated with curative intent by surgery (n = 61), surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy/radiotherapy (n = 8), or chemoradiotherapy (n = 19). Tumour exome sequencing identified somatic mutations, and plasma was analyzed using patient-specific RaDaR™ assays with up to 48 amplicons targeting tumour-specific variants unique to each patient.

- **Results**: ctDNA was detected before treatment in 24%, 77%, and 87% of patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively, and in 26% of all longitudinal samples. The median tumour fraction detected was 0.042%, with 63% of samples at 98.5% and preceded clinical detection of recurrence of the primary tumour by a median of 212.5 days. ctDNA was detected after treatment in 18 out of 28 (64.3%) patients who had clinical recurrence of their primary tumour. Detection within the landmark timepoint of 2 weeks to 4 months after treatment end occurred in 17% of patients, and was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival.

### Rechallenge for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer with acquired resistance to first-line cetuximab and irinotecan: A phase 2 single-arm clinical trial [^1111Tc7B]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Based on a small retrospective study, rechallenge with cetuximab-based therapy for patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), who were previously treated with the same anti-epidermal growth factor receptor-based regimen, might be efficacious. Recent data suggest the role of liquid biopsy as a tool to track molecular events in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

- **Objective**: To prospectively assess the activity of cetuximab plus irinotecan as a third-line treatment for patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC who were initially sensitive to and then resistant to first-line irinotecan- and cetuximab-based therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a multicenter phase 2 single-arm trial conducted from January 7, 2015, to June 19, 2017. Liquid biopsies for analysis of ctDNA were collected at baseline. Main eligibility criteria included RAS and BRAF wild-type status on tissue samples; prior first-line irinotecan- and cetuximab-based regimen with at least partial response; progression-free survival of at least 6 months with first-line therapy; progression within 4 weeks after the last dose of cetuximab; and prior second-line oxaliplatin- and bevacizumab-based treatment.

- **Interventions**: Biweekly cetuximab, 500 mg/m², plus irinotecan, 180 mg/m².

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Overall response rate according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and overall survival, and as an exploratory analysis, RAS mutations in ctDNA.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight patients (9 women and 19 men) participated in the trial.

### Oncogene-addicted metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^113UZ9uE]. Annals of Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of non-small cell lung cancer, specifically concerning the management of metastatic disease and molecular testing, the ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining the following molecular tests:

- **EGFR mutations**: Obtain EGFR mutation status testing, adequately covering mutations in exons 18–21, including those associated with resistance to some therapies. Determine at least the most common activating mutations, such as exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R point mutation, when resources or materials are limited.

- **T790M mutations**: Obtain T790M mutation status testing in patients with disease relapse on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs.

- **BRAF V600 mutations**: Obtain BRAF V600 mutation status testing.

- **ALK rearrangements**: Obtain testing for ALK rearrangements, with FISH as the standard to detect the ALK translocation. Consider obtaining immunohistochemistry with high-performance ALK antibodies and validated assays for screening, as an equivalent alternative to FISH for ALK testing.

- **ROS1 rearrangements**: Obtain testing for ROS1 rearrangements, with FISH as the standard to detect the ROS1 translocation. Consider obtaining immunohistochemistry as a screening approach.

- **NTRK rearrangements**: Obtain testing for NTRK rearrangements. Consider obtaining immunohistochemistry or next-generation sequencing to screen for NTRK rearrangements, with appropriate follow-up testing to validate a positive result.

- **Other genetic alterations**: Obtain testing for MET exon 14 skipping mutations.

### Lumakras [^114s3n4x]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Lumakras was demonstrated in a subset of patients enrolled in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial (CodeBreaK 100 [NCT03600883]). Eligible patients were required to have locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with disease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).

All patients were required to have prospectively identified KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in tumor tissue samples by using the QIAGEN therascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit performed in a central laboratory. Of the 126 total enrolled subjects, 2 (2%) were unevaluable for efficacy analysis due to the absence of radiographically measurable lesions at baseline. Of the 124 patients with KRAS G12C mutations confirmed in tumor tissue, plasma samples from 112 patients were tested retrospectively using the Guardant360® CDx. Among these, 78 out of 112 patients (70%) had the KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimens, 31 out of 112 patients (28%) did not have the KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimens, and 3 out of 112 (2%) were unevaluable due to Guardant360® CDx test failure.

### Circulating tumor DNA dynamics reveal KRAS G12C mutation heterogeneity and response to treatment with the KRAS G12C inhibitor divarasib in solid tumors [^1139eVue]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). High credibility.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging tool with potential clinical applications in diagnosing cancer, detecting mutations, capturing tumor heterogeneity, tracking tumor evolution, and monitoring response to therapy. We observed that different tumor types with the KRAS G12C driver mutation have distinct levels of ctDNA shedding, and this is further impacted by tumor burden and metastatic sites. Tumor-specific features in ctDNA shedding may impact the utility of a blood-based diagnostic assay for KRAS G12C inhibitors. Longitudinal tracking revealed that the dynamics of KRAS G12C variant allele frequency largely mirrored the overall ctDNA tumor fraction upon divarasib treatment, providing evidence that the majority of KRAS G12C mutations are truncal across indications. We also showed that changes in ctDNA tumor fraction upon treatment were associated with patient outcomes and response to divarasib treatment, supporting the potential utility of ctDNA as an early readout of treatment response in future clinical trials.

### Molecular adequacy of image-guided rebiopsies for molecular retesting in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A single-center experience [^116aLWtX]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In the era of biomarker-driven systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC, the role of routine repeated biopsies for decision-making outside EGFR-mutant disease remains unproven. We report our center's experience of safety and adequacy for molecular retesting of tumor material obtained from image-guided lung rebiopsies in NSCLC.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of patients undergoing image-guided lung rebiopsies at a single cancer center between 2011 and 2014. The primary objective was to determine the pathological success rate. Secondary and exploratory objectives were to determine technical success rate, histological concordance, molecular adequacy, genotypes identified, and complication rate.

- **Results**: In all, 103 patients underwent transthoracic image-guided procedures. A total of 66 rebiopsies in NSCLC were identified and analyzed. The pathological success rate was 87.1%. A high histological discordance rate was observed (12 of 52 evaluable cases [23.1%]). Pretest molecular adequacy as determined by the lung pathologist was 78.8% (52 of 66). Of 52 adequate samples, 51 were sent for molecular analysis, with a total of 209 genes analyzed (including EGFR, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene [ALK], KRAS, BRAF, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene [DDR2], NRAS, ROS1, and rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene gene [RET]). The rate of postgenotyping molecular adequacy was 87.1% (182 of 209). Overall, 20 new potentially actionable mutations were identified, with 13 of 66 patients (19.7%) starting to receive new targeted treatment.

### Liquid biopsy, diagnostic imaging, and future synergies [^112Q6m8u]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Imaging plays an integral role in the initial diagnosis and longitudinal care of patients with cancer. Liquid biopsies, which most commonly involve genetic analysis of circulating free DNA, have emerged as important complementary tools in cancer care with the potential to interface with imaging at each step of the cancer care continuum. Here, the authors use non-small-cell lung cancer as a paradigm to elucidate factors driving the need for liquid biopsy in the spectrum of lung cancer care. They demonstrate ways in which liquid biopsy has already changed standard clinical practice, and discuss anticipated synergies of liquid biopsy and imaging in screening, early detection, and monitoring of disease.

### Complications, costs, and health care resource use with tissue biopsy followed by liquid biopsy versus tissue re-biopsy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer [^1139VEzK]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

As more targeted therapies become available, testing for all actionable mutations has presented challenges, including limited tissue availability and prolonged wait times. In an observational study, patients with advanced NSCLC with actionable mutations had an average wait of 46.5 days from diagnosis to positive biomarker test. Difficulty accessing some tumors and tumor heterogeneity may also limit the feasibility of tissue biopsy. Such issues can lead to underreporting of genotypes and missed opportunities for targeted treatment.

Liquid biopsy, in which circulating tumor DNA is genotyped to identify mutations, is gaining acceptance as a complement to tissue biopsy for genetic testing for NSCLC. This technique can provide additional information to facilitate therapeutic decision-making in cases of insufficient biopsy tissue. Liquid biopsy is also less invasive, and results can be obtained more rapidly, which improves disease management and prognosis. Liquid biopsy, coupled with tissue biopsy, is predicted to identify actionable mutations more effectively than tissue biopsy alone while also reducing costs.

Recommendations from IASLC and ESMO support the use of liquid biopsy in NSCLC. IASLC considers liquid biopsy testing a valid complement to tissue biopsy genotyping for tumors of patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC. ESMO recommends liquid biopsy NGS assays as a complement or alternative to tissue NGS to identify actionable mutations in treatment-naive patients with NSCLC, especially when tissue biopsy could delay treatment or when invasive procedures may pose a risk.
