## Question

prognosis and risk factors for neoplastic pancreatic cysts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis and risk factors for neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the cyst types and their malignant potential. Then, I should quantify baseline malignancy risk and survival. Next, I will identify patient-related and cyst-related risk factors, followed by guideline-based risk stratification systems. After that, I need to integrate surveillance and surgical thresholds, including competing risks and when to stop surveillance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk framework and highlight evidence gaps and future directions, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and their malignant potential, because misclassification here derails downstream decisions. Neoplastic pancreatic cysts include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), serous cystadenomas (SCNs), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs), with mucinous lesions (IPMN, MCN) carrying malignant potential, whereas SCNs are typically benign and SPNs, while often indolent, warrant resection due to metastatic potential in a subset [^112EdNmY] [^115wRhje] [^112ZdQEP].

> I should double-check baseline malignancy risk estimates before drawing conclusions. In average-risk populations, the estimated annual malignant transformation risk is about 0.24% per year, and the 5-year survival after invasive cancer is approximately 28%, underscoring the need to balance surveillance against overtreatment given the low absolute risk but poor outcomes if cancer develops [^115Hdyim] [^111eTVYL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these figures derive from heterogeneous cohorts and surgical series, so I need to contextualize them with guideline cautions about evidence quality and selection bias [^1172dZxP] [^112EdNmY].

> Next, I will examine patient-related risk factors. Advancing age increases risk incrementally, with a hazard ratio around 1.03 per year in large cohorts, and male sex is associated with higher malignancy risk in MCNs and may influence progression dynamics in IPMN cohorts, though associations vary by study design [^114QKa7p] [^1162hc3U]. Smoking is consistently linked to progression and malignancy, with current smoking approximately doubling progression risk in surveillance cohorts, and obesity (BMI > 26.4) independently increases progression risk in BD-IPMN, which I should keep in mind when personalizing surveillance intensity [^114y3Jmt] [^1135rAo4]. Family history of pancreatic cancer and hereditary cancer syndromes elevate risk and are addressed in high-risk screening frameworks, and long-standing diabetes is a notable risk for concomitant PDAC arising separate from an IPMN, which complicates surveillance planning [^114XPvb2] [^115SDQUR].

> Now, let me consider cyst-related features, since these drive most management algorithms. Larger cyst size, particularly ≥ 3 cm, is a key risk marker, with meta-analytic odds ratios for malignancy exceeding 6 in some series, though I should confirm that size alone is insufficient and must be integrated with other features to avoid overtreatment [^116XD8uA]. Main pancreatic duct dilation, especially ≥ 10 mm, confers markedly higher cancer risk, with hazard ratios around 13.5 in population data, and mural nodules or solid components substantially increase malignancy odds, reinforcing the need for EUS-FNA in such cases [^114QKa7p] [^116nSpm8]. Growth rate matters: rapid growth, commonly defined as > 3–4 mm/year, independently predicts cancer and should trigger expedited evaluation, even if other features are modest [^114QKa7p] [^116fUc2Y] [^114i8gGj]. I should also verify that cyst type modifies risk: main-duct IPMN carries the highest malignancy risk and is generally an indication for resection if operable, whereas branch-duct IPMN without worrisome features has lower but nonzero risk [^114SW6w3] [^112EdNmY].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines operationalize these risks. The Fukuoka and European frameworks classify features into high-risk stigmata and worrisome features, with high-risk stigmata (e.g., obstructive jaundice, enhancing mural nodule, main duct ≥ 10 mm) generally prompting surgical referral, while worrisome features (e.g., cyst ≥ 3 cm, nonenhancing mural nodule, main duct 5–9 mm) prompt EUS-FNA and closer surveillance; these systems align with observed 5-year cancer risks of roughly 49.7% for high-risk versus 4.1% for worrisome-feature cysts in validation cohorts [^115pPfSG] [^114DzSJx]. The AGA suggests EUS-FNA when at least two high-risk features are present and recommends MRI surveillance at 1 year then every 2 years for up to 5 years for small, featureless cysts, with surgery considered for those with both a solid component and ductal dilation or concerning EUS/FNA findings, ideally at high-volume centers [^115jQVs2] [^116Pag4w] [^112a4v6i] [^113yj8jA].

> I need to ensure I incorporate competing risks and patient-centered factors. Comorbidity and life expectancy strongly influence net benefit; patients with high comorbidity have substantially higher non-pancreatic mortality, and in some cohorts non-pancreatic deaths are 8–11-fold more frequent than pancreatic cancer deaths, arguing for individualized surveillance intensity and consideration of stopping surveillance when surgical candidacy is unlikely [^1128Ax9R] [^114wMPXZ]. But wait, what if the cyst is stable for 5 years? The AGA allows discontinuation after 5 years of stability in select patients, yet European guidance and longitudinal series suggest progression can occur beyond 5 years, so I should frame this as a conditional recommendation with shared decision-making rather than a blanket rule [^116ivAzs] [^114SW6w3] [^111RBbVg].

> Next, I should review surveillance cadence and thresholds for escalation. For average-risk patients with low-risk cysts, MRI at 1 year then every 2 years for a total of 5 years is reasonable if features remain stable, whereas new-onset diabetes, rapid growth, or worrisome features warrant short-interval MRI or EUS within 3–6 months and multidisciplinary review. High-risk individuals generally undergo 6–12 month surveillance with tighter intervals for evolving lesions [^116Pag4w] [^116fUc2Y] [^117XjY5F]. I should confirm that MRI is preferred over CT for longitudinal follow-up due to comparable diagnostic performance without radiation, and that EUS-FNA is reserved for those with high-risk features or when results will change management [^114SW6w3] [^111mmbiR].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk framework, but I will double-check that it aligns with observed outcomes. Low-risk cysts are typically ≤ 3 cm, branch-duct type, without mural nodules or ductal dilation, in patients with reasonable life expectancy; these can be surveilled with MRI, and progression risk remains low but nonzero over time, supporting continued follow-up rather than automatic discharge at 5 years in many cases [^112EdNmY] [^1135rAo4]. Intermediate-risk cysts have one worrisome feature or modest size/growth; these merit EUS-FNA and shortened surveillance intervals, with individualized discussion of operative risk and patient preferences [^114DzSJx]. High-risk cysts have high-risk stigmata or multiple worrisome features; these should prompt surgical referral if operable, ideally at experienced centers, given the substantial malignancy risk and the survival advantage of resection before invasion [^115pPfSG] [^113yj8jA] [^1157sx5L].

> I will now examine post-resection prognosis and surveillance, since this affects long-term planning. After resection of noninvasive IPMN, recurrence risk persists and is higher with multifocality or prior high-grade dysplasia; European guidance recommends lifelong surveillance of the remnant pancreas, with intensified intervals after invasive disease or high-grade dysplasia, whereas AGA suggests no routine surveillance after resection of non-malignant cysts, reflecting differing interpretations of limited evidence [^111PLBAX] [^111vdsgQ] [^117RvBMG]. Wait, let me verify recurrence dynamics: invasive progression can occur years later, with 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences around 6.4% and 12.9% respectively in some series, reinforcing the rationale for ongoing surveillance in suitable candidates [^111PLBAX].

> Finally, I should review evidence gaps and future directions, and I need to ensure I do not overstate unproven tools. Molecular and multi-analyte cyst fluid testing show promise for improving preoperative classification and may reduce unnecessary surgery, but prospective validation and integration into guidelines are ongoing; similarly, blood-based biomarkers and refined growth-rate thresholds may refine risk prediction in the near term [^116PrS3S] [^113BN3Sv]. Hold on, I should verify that current guideline disagreements largely reflect the paucity of high-quality prospective data; harmonization will likely evolve as longitudinal cohorts mature and biomarkers are standardized, so shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care remain essential while evidence accrues [^112EdNmY] [^113JkKSB].

Neoplastic pancreatic cysts have a **low but real risk of malignant transformation** [^115Hdyim], with an average progression rate of ~0.24% per year in asymptomatic patients [^111eTVYL]. The **5-year risk is ~1–2%** for low-risk cysts and higher for those with worrisome features [^1128Ax9R] [^115pPfSG]. Key risk factors include **cyst size ≥ 3 cm**, main pancreatic duct dilation ≥ 5 mm, mural nodules, rapid growth (> 2–3 mm/year), and solid components [^116nSpm8] [^114QKa7p] [^116fUc2Y]. Patient factors such as older age, male sex, smoking, and family history also increase risk [^114QKa7p] [^1135rAo4] [^115QXDpM]. Most patients die from non-pancreatic causes, so management should balance malignancy risk against surgical morbidity and patient comorbidities [^1129uae4] [^114wMPXZ].

## Prognosis and malignant transformation risk

- **Overall malignant transformation risk**: ~0.24% per year in asymptomatic patients [^115Hdyim] [^111eTVYL].
- **5-year cancer risk**: ~1–2% for low-risk cysts; higher with worrisome features [^115pPfSG].
- **10-year cancer risk**: ~3–5% for low-risk cysts; higher with high-risk features [^111eTVYL].
- **Survival**: 5-year survival after resection of invasive cancer is ~28% [^115Hdyim].

## Risk factors for malignant transformation

### Cyst-related factors

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cyst size | ≥ 3 cm increases malignancy risk [^116nSpm8] [^112c7rEC] |
| Main pancreatic duct dilation | ≥ 5 mm is a strong predictor [^114QKa7p] [^114Mttdt] |
| Mural nodules | Presence significantly increases risk [^116nSpm8] [^114Mttdt] |
| Rapid growth | > 2–3 mm/year is concerning [^116XD8uA] [^116fUc2Y] |
| Solid component | Presence markedly increases risk [^112c7rEC] [^111fyb2j] |

---

### Patient-related factors

- **Age**: Older age increases risk [^114QKa7p].
- **Sex**: Male sex is associated with higher risk [^1162hc3U].
- **Smoking**: Current smoking increases risk [^111fyb2j].
- **Family history**: Familial pancreatic cancer increases risk [^115QXDpM].

---

## Impact of cyst type and size

- **IPMN**: Main-duct IPMN has higher malignancy risk than branch-duct IPMN [^116nSpm8].
- **MCN**: Mucinous cystic neoplasms have significant malignant potential [^115wRhje] [^1162hc3U].
- **SCN**: Serous cystadenomas are typically benign [^115wRhje] [^111Nrqrj].
- **Size**: Cysts ≥ 3 cm have higher malignancy risk than smaller cysts [^116nSpm8] [^114QKa7p].

---

## Surveillance and management strategies

Surveillance entails **MRI or EUS every 1–2 years** for low-risk cysts, with shorter intervals for high-risk features [^116Pag4w] [^114SW6w3]. Surgery is indicated for cysts with high-risk stigmata or worrisome features — such as size ≥ 3 cm, main duct dilation ≥ 5 mm, mural nodules, or rapid growth — typically after EUS-FNA confirmation [^114DzSJx] [^115jQVs2]. Post-resection, **lifelong surveillance** is recommended for IPMNs due to persistent risk of recurrence or new lesions [^111vdsgQ] [^111PLBAX].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing prognosis

Comorbidities increase non-pancreatic mortality and may outweigh cancer risk [^1129uae4] [^114wMPXZ]. Life expectancy guides the intensity of surveillance and the threshold for intervention [^114DzSJx] [^111SVtsg]. Surgical risk is substantial, with **mortality ~2% and morbidity ~30%**, and must be weighed against potential benefit [^115Hdyim] [^117Coa3T].

---

Neoplastic pancreatic cysts carry a **low but real malignancy risk** [^115Hdyim], with risk modulated by cyst features and patient factors. Management should be individualized, balancing malignancy risk against surgical morbidity and patient comorbidities [^115hYhvH].

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^113DGv8E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30% and that half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma. Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as in 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms and in particular regarding long-term prognosis. Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and that it is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, current guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery. In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up. Data from the literature support the current conservative management of the majority of patients with "small" (< 3–4 cm) branch-duct IPMNs, who do not have IPMN-related symptoms and do not present worrisome radiological features. Invasive carcinoma is reported to develop during follow-up in 1–11% of patients.–The risk for pancreatic cancer developing at a distance from the IPMN also seems to be increased, with a 5-year incidence reported in approximately 7% of patients under surveillance and a standardized incidence ratio of 15.8- to 26-fold. Even though published data support the safety of surveillance for the majority of patients with IPMN, experiences are not uniformly positive. This is most likely explained by the use of different inclusion criteria and different indications for surgery or surveillance as well as by the small size of some of the study cohorts.

### Are all cysts created equal? pancreatic cystic neoplasms in patients with familial or genetic risk factors for pancreatic cancer [^115SCnq4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) have become more prevalent over time, particularly in asymptomatic individuals. Current screening guidelines for incidental PCLs offer a unified approach to surveillance and management, predicated on "worrisome features". Although PCLs are common in the general population, their prevalence may be higher in high-risk individuals (HRI, unaffected patients with specific familial and/or genetic risk factors). As more PCLs are diagnosed and more HRI identified, it is important to promote research that bridges data gaps and introduces nuance to risk assessment tools, ensuring tailoring of guidelines to the needs of HRI with varying pancreatic cancer risk factors.

### Factors associated with the risk of progression of low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111Lapcw]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are common incidental findingsand considered preneoplastic lesions that could progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

When IPMNs harbor morphologic features associated with cancer risk, surgery is indicated, and surveillance is advised for most patients with good life expectancy. Guidelines for IPMN management underline the importance of specific morphologic features associated with increased risk of cancer, including size of the branch-duct (BD) cyst, presence of solid nodules, and main pancreatic duct dilation. Most IPMNs, however, are small BD lesions without such features and carry a low risk of cancer.

There have been efforts to investigate characteristics associated with the subsequent progression risk. The initial size and multifocality of BD-IPMNs have been associated with progression risk during surveillance. These results, however, were based on older guidelines and did not consider IPMNs' growth rate. Also, information on possible patient-related factors associated with progression risk is limited.

In addition to the limited knowledge of cyst and patient features, there are few available data on the role of genetic variants in this context. Because it has been reported that non–type O blood is associated with an increased risk of PDAC, we hypothesized that this variant might also be associated with the risk of progression of BD-IPMN.

The present study aimed to investigate comprehensively cyst-related and patient-related factors associated with worrisome features (WFs) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) development in a cohort of BD-IPMNs under surveillance. To our knowledge, the role of ABO blood group type was also evaluated in a subgroup for the first time in this setting.

### Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection [^112dJm73]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

With respect to lymph nodes, several studies have indicated that lymph node metastasis increases the risk of recurrence, which aligns with our findings. However, little attention has been given to whether lymphadenopathy observed on imaging independently increases the risk of recurrence. In our study, lymphadenopathy was determined based on size (short diameter ≥ 1 cm). Therefore, our finding that lymphadenopathy on imaging is an independent risk factor can be partially explained by the hypothesis that the size of metastatic lymph nodes influences prognosis. However, not all enlarged lymph nodes are metastatic; further research through radiologic‒pathologic correlation is needed to determine whether enlarged lymph nodes increase the risk of recurrence regardless of metastasis.

Among the clinical features, history of pancreatitis was identified as a significant factor increasing the risk of recurrence. Previous studies have also reported that pancreatitis is associated with IPMN recurrence, and recent research has shown that the presence of symptoms is linked to an increase in both intra- and extrapancreatic recurrence, which is consistent with our findings. Finally, adjuvant treatment is known to improve survival in patients with invasive IPMN, especially those with metastatic lymph nodes. In our study, it was also found to reduce early postoperative recurrence, which aligns with previous reports.

As mentioned, even noninvasive IPMNs can lead to the development of clinically significant remnant pancreatic lesions after surgical resection. Some studies have even reported cases of extrapancreatic recurrence in patients initially diagnosed with noninvasive IPMN, including IPMN with LGD. However, many patients do not experience recurrence (10-year disease-free survival, 70–78%), and a recent study reported a low recurrence rate for patients with IPMN with LGD (10-year recurrence rate, 3.7%). Therefore, predicting the risk of recurrence for individual IPMN patients and establishing an appropriate surveillance strategy are crucial. Our study results suggest that preoperative imaging not only aids in the differential diagnosis of cysts and the determination of surgical candidates but also has the potential to help predict postoperative prognosis and inform surveillance strategies. For example, extending the follow-up interval after surgical resection in patients without risk factors might be a practical approach, although further research is needed to validate risk factors across multiple institutions and to establish a specific follow-up strategy.

### Cyst features and risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a meta-analysis [^116nSpm8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

International guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas recommend surgical resection of those with specific characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of malignancy associated with each of these features of IPMNs.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE from January 1, 1996, to November 11, 2011, for studies that included any of the features mentioned in the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of main duct and branch duct IPMNs. Data were analyzed from 41 studies for the following features: cyst size greater than 3 cm, the presence of mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct, symptoms, and main duct vs branch duct IPMNs. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with carcinoma in situ or more advanced histology. A separate meta-analysis was performed for each risk factor to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). A random-effects model was used, based on the assumption of variation among study populations.

Results

The risks of malignancy associated with individual cyst features were as follows: cyst size greater than 3 cm (OR, 62.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 30.8–126.3), presence of a mural nodule (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 5.3–16.1), dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (OR, 7.27; 95% CI, 3.0–17.4), and main vs branch duct IPMN (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.3–6.9). There was a moderate level of heterogeneity among studies (I² range, 34–67).

Conclusions

Based on a meta-analysis, cyst features proposed by the international guidelines for resection of IPMN were highly associated with malignancy. However, based on our findings, not all cyst features should be weighted equally when considering risk of malignancy; cyst size greater than 3 cm was associated most strongly with malignant IPMN.

### Low rates of malignancy and mortality in asymptomatic patients with suspected neoplastic pancreatic cysts beyond 5 Years of surveillance [^1128Ax9R]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The 2015 American Gastroenterological Association guidelines recommend discontinuation of surveillance of pancreatic cysts after 5 years, although there are limited data to support this recommendation. We aimed to determine the rate of pancreatic cancer development from neoplastic pancreatic cysts after 5 years of surveillance.

Methods

We performed a retrospective multicenter study, collecting data from 310 patients with asymptomatic suspected neoplastic pancreatic cysts, identified by endoscopic ultrasound from January 2002 to June 2010 at 4 medical centers in California. All patients were followed up for 5 years or more (median, 87 mo; range, 60–189 mo). Data were used to calculate the risk for pancreatic cancer and all-cause mortality.

Results

Three patients (1%) developed invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Based on American Gastroenterological Association high-risk features (cyst size > 3 cm, dilated pancreatic duct, mural nodule), risks for cancer were 0%, 1%, and 15% for patients with 0, 1, or 2 high-risk features, respectively. Mortality from nonpancreatic causes was 8-fold higher than mortality from pancreatic cancer after more than 5 years of surveillance.

Conclusions

There is a very low risk of malignant transformation of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts after 5 years. Patients with pancreatic lesions and 0 or 1 high-risk feature have a less than 1% risk of developing pancreatic cancer, therefore discontinuation of surveillance can be considered for select patients. Patients with neoplastic pancreatic cysts with 2 high-risk features have a 15% risk of subsequent pancreatic cancer, therefore surgery or continued surveillance should be considered.

### AGA clinical practice update on pancreas cancer screening in high-risk individuals: expert review [^117XjY5F]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

How frequently should surveillance imaging/testing be performed — surveillance intervals, risk markers, and detection outcomes in high-risk pancreas cancer screening are summarized as follows: Guidelines for surveillance imaging in average-risk individuals with pancreas cysts typically range from 6 to 24 months, and a 2015 AGA study estimated cyst progression to be approximately 0.25% per year in average-risk individuals; in high-risk individuals with pancreas cysts without high-risk features, intervals should be the same as or more intensive. Many high-risk screening studies have utilized surveillance intervals of 6–12 months, with follow-up of abnormal findings such as a < 1 cm solid lesion within 3–6 months. Baseline risk markers for progression include the presence of 3 or more pancreas cysts or dilation of the main pancreas duct, observed in a cohort of 354 high-risk individuals followed for up to 16 years (mean, 5.6 years). During surveillance, nine of 10 pancreas adenocarcinomas were resectable with an 85% 3-year survival rate vs 1 of 4 symptomatic cancers with a 25% 3-year survival rate; across 13 studies (1317 patients) with 18 cancers detected, 9 were on initial imaging and 9 on surveillance, with 12 early-stage and 6 advanced-stage cases. The target treatment threshold for resection has been set at PanIN3, cystic lesions with high-grade dysplasia, or localized small solid tumors (T1N0M0); therapeutic decisions should be made as part of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, and abnormal screening results that do not lead to resection may require more intensive surveillance.

### Pancreatic cystic lesions: risk stratification and management based on recent guidelines [^113JkKSB]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) can present complex diagnostic and management challenges with uncertainty as to the most appropriate investigations, interventions and surveillance. Guidelines have been developed to aid decision making, including the European Study Group, American College of Gastroenterology and International Study Group guidelines. This paper presents issues relating to risk stratification and the appropriate management of patients with PCLs, reviewing these recently published guidelines. While there are similarities across these expert guidelines, there are notable differences in terms of features associated with increased risk of malignant transformation, the most appropriate imaging modality and timing of interval imaging. Where variations exist, this reflects differing interpretations of a limited evidence base, and decision making will likely evolve further as experience with these guidelines develops.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging, ACG 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain short-interval MRI or EUS with or without FNA in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or mucinous cystic neoplasms with new onset or worsening diabetes mellitus, or a rapid increase in cyst size (> 3 mm/year) as they may have an increased risk of malignancy.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^116nMNyx]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was based on a prospectively collected cohort of patients who were diagnosed with IPMN at the Pancreas Unit at Karolinska University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2013. Also included were patients who were surveyed during the study period but whose diagnosis of IPMN had been established before January 2008. An absolute inclusion criterion for the study cohort was a diagnosis of IPMN based on cytological confirmation and/or radiological demonstration of a cystic lesion that communicated with the main pancreatic duct.

Data were retrospectively analyzed after approval from the local Ethical Committee was obtained. All patients were managed according to the Sendai criteria(until October 2011) and the European guidelines criteria(from November 2011). Excluded from the series were patients with an IPMN that fulfilled the criteria for resection and underwent surgery directly after discussion at the multidisciplinary conference. Further excluded were patients who were diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic IPMN-associated cancer. The remaining patients were assigned to two groups. Patients who were enrolled in the surveillance program in accordance with the Sendai criteria (until October 2011) or the European guidelines (from November 2011) formed Group 1. Group 2 included patients who were not eligible for surgery for general reasons and therefore remained under follow-up, although their IPMN fulfilled indications for surgery.

Indications for Surgery

Until November 2011, we used the indications for surgery in patients with IPMN as suggested by the Sendai criteria. When the European guidelines were published in November 2011, the recommendations of these guidelines were adopted by our hospital. In patients with BD-IPMN, surgery was indicated in case of symptomatic disease (jaundice, acute pancreatitis related to IPMNs) and/or in case one or multiple of the following features were detected: maximum cyst diameter ≥ 4 cm, mural nodules, rapid increase in cyst size, elevated serum levels of Ca 19–9. Patients with a main pancreatic duct > 6 mm were considered being affected by MD-IPMN and represented a surgical indication.

### Spectrum and classification of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^113uYS4Y]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

As patients are living longer and axial imaging is more widespread, increasing numbers of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are found. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and mucinous cystic neoplasms are the most common. The revised Sendai guidelines provide a safe algorithm for expectant management of certain cystic neoplasms; however, studies are ongoing to identify further subgroups that can be treated nonoperatively. For those patients with high-risk clinical features or symptoms, surgical resection can be performed safely at high-volume pancreatic centers. Accurate diagnosis is critical for accurate decision making.

Pancreatic cyst epidemiology and surveillance imaging — MRI preference and baseline malignancy risk: The incidence of pancreatic cysts in the US population increases with age and may be as common as 25% in those older than 70 years. A cyst seen incidentally on MRI has a 10 in 100,000 chance of being a mucinous invasive malignancy and a 17 in 100,000 chance of being a ductal cancer; MRI is the preferred surveillance imaging modality over computed tomography, and the follow-up interval of 2 years is not based on any evidence but is believed to be reasonable given the small absolute risk of malignancy.

### Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection [^116e5H4a]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess significant radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for post-surgery recurrence in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).

Materials and methods

Patients with IPMNs who underwent surgery from 2011 to 2021 at a single center were retrospectively included. Two reviewers evaluated CT findings according to international guidelines. Clinicopathological data were collected from medical records and surgical pathology reports. Patients were monitored for recurrence with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI up to 2023. Univariable Cox regression analysis included potential risk factors: all high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in the international guidelines, age, sex, tumor location, type, carcinoembryonic antigen, surgery type, postsurgical residual cyst, adjuvant treatment, pathologic grade, type, size, margin status, lymph node metastasis, gland type, and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Variables with p < 0.2 were included in multivariate analysis.

Results

Among 332 patients (mean age, 66.3 ± 9.0 years; 212 men), recurrence occurred in 39 (11.7%) over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (range: 0.1–12.3 years). Two- and five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 91.2% and 86.4%, respectively. Significant radiological risk factors included enhancing mural nodule (EMN) presence (hazard ratio [HR] 5.088, p = 0.007) and lymphadenopathy (HR 2.837, p = 0.01). Associated invasive carcinoma (HR 25.030), lymph node metastasis (HR 27.562), adjuvant treatment (HR 0.203), and history of pancreatitis (HR 2.608) were also significant. Most imaging features showed moderate to excellent interobserver agreement, except for thickened/enhancing cyst walls (κ, 0.25).

Conclusion

The presence of EMNs and lymphadenopathy, along with several clinicopathologic factors, were significantly associated with IPMN recurrence.

Key Points

Question Understanding postoperative recurrence risk in IPMN patients is crucial for determining surveillance strategies; however, research on radiologic risk factors remains limited.

Findings The presence of EMNs and lymphadenopathy were identified as significant radiologic risk factors for the postoperative recurrence of IPMN, along with clinicopathologic factors.

Clinical relevance IPMN recurrence is significantly associated with imaging findings like EMNs and lymphadenopathy, as well as clinical and pathologic factors. It can guide the development of tailored postoperative surveillance strategies for IPMN patients in further studies.

4.20 How should patients be followed up who underwent surgical resection for an IPMN?

Lifelong surveillance is recommended following resection of an IPMN as long as the patient is fit and is willing to undergo surgery if indicated. Patients with evidence of anIPMN-associated invasive carcinoma should be followed up in the same manner as those with a resected pancreatic cancer. IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN should have close follow-up every 6 months for the first 2 years, followed by yearly surveillance. IPMN with low-grade dysplasia should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected IPMN (see statement 4.2 and figure 1 for details). Patients with IPMN in the remnant pancreas, who do not have high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN, should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected BD-IPMN (see section 4.15 and figure 1 for details). Follow-up imaging using MRI or EUS is recommended (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Several studies have reported that IPMN recurrence is possible 5 to 10 years after resection. The risk of BD-IPMN and MD-IPMN recurrence is similar (7–8%). Resected IPMN with low-grade dysplasia have a low risk of recurrence (5.4−10%) with disease-free survival of approximately 52 months, while IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma have a higher risk (> 50%), with disease-free survival of 29 months.

4.21 What preoperative investigation should be performed for a patient with an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma? Should the same criteria be used as for pancreatic cancer?

The diagnostic investigation for an IPMN-associated invasive cancer should follow the same algorithm used for pancreatic cancer (GRADE 1C, strong agreement).

No studies have examined the differences between an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma and spontaneous pancreatic cancer with respect to local tumour extension or staging for distant metastases.

Pancreatic cyst malignancy risk and surgical context — literature estimates cited in the guideline: The review of the literature suggests that the risk of malignant transformation of pancreatic cysts is approximately 0.24% per year. Overall, 15% of patients harbored invasive malignancy in a highly selected group of patients with pancreatic cysts. In addition, our review estimated that the overall 5-year survival of patients with invasive cancer is approximately 28%, and approximately 17% of patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic resection have cysts that harbor HGD. Any surgical benefit must also be considered alongside an overall postoperative mortality of 2% and major morbidity of 30% from the review of the literature.

### Biomarker risk score algorithm and preoperative stratification of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions [^11355Bjz]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cysts are incidentally detected in up to 13% of patients undergoing radiographic imaging. Of the most frequently encountered types, mucin-producing (mucinous) pancreatic cystic lesions may develop into pancreatic cancer, while nonmucinous ones have little or no malignant potential. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical for optimal management, but has been difficult to achieve, resulting in unnecessary major surgery. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm based on biomarker risk scores to improve risk stratification.

Study Design

Patients undergoing surgery and/or surveillance for a pancreatic cystic lesion, with diagnostic imaging and banked pancreatic cyst fluid, were enrolled in the study after informed consent (n = 163 surgical, 67 surveillance). Cyst fluid biomarkers with high specificity for distinguishing nonmucinous from mucinous pancreatic cysts (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], glucose, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], amylase, cytology, and DNA mutation) were selected. Biomarker risk scores were used to design an algorithm to predict preoperative diagnosis. Performance was tested using surgical (retrospective) and surveillance (prospective) cohorts.

Results

In the surgical cohort, the biomarker algorithm outperformed the preoperative clinical diagnosis in correctly predicting the final pathologic diagnosis (91% vs 73%; p < 0.000001). Specifically, nonmucinous serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) were correctly classified more frequently by the algorithm than clinical diagnosis (96% vs 30%; p < 0.000008 and 92% vs 69%; p = 0.04, respectively). In the surveillance cohort, the algorithm predicted a preoperative diagnosis with high confidence based on a high biomarker score and/or consistency with imaging from ≥ 1 follow-up visits.

Conclusions

A biomarker risk score-based algorithm was able to correctly classify pancreatic cysts preoperatively. Importantly, this tool may improve initial and dynamic risk stratification, reducing overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.

### Risk models for pancreatic cyst diagnosis [^115hfyJP]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The overall prevalence of pancreatic cysts (PCs) is high in the general population. In clinical practice PCs are often incidentally discovered and are classified into benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions according to the World Health Organization. For this reason, in the absence of reliable biomarkers, to date clinical decision-making relies mostly on risk models based on morphological features. The aim of this narrative review is to present the current knowledge regarding PC's morphologic features with related estimated risk of malignancy and discuss available diagnostic tools to minimize clinically relevant diagnostic errors.

### Pancreatic cyst disease: a review [^115wRhje]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are common and increasingly detected in the primary care setting. Some patients have a low risk for developing a malignancy and others have a high risk and need further testing and interventions.

Observations

Pancreatic cysts may be intraductal mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystadenomas, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, cystic variations of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, or 1 of several types of nonneoplastic cysts. Mucinous (intraductal mucinous neoplasm or mucinous cystic neoplasm) lesions have malignant potential and should be distinguished from serous lesions (serous cystadenomas) that are nearly always benign. Symptomatic patients or those having high-risk features on initial imaging (eg, main pancreatic duct dilatation, a solid component, or mural nodule) require further evaluation with advanced imaging, possibly followed by surgical resection. Advanced imaging includes endoscopic ultrasound with cyst fluid analysis and cytology to confirm the type of cyst and determine the risk of malignancy. Small cysts (size < 3 cm) in asymptomatic patients without any suspicious features may be observed with serial imaging because the risk for malignancy is low.

Conclusions and Relevance

The management of pancreatic cysts requires risk stratification for malignant potential based on the presence or absence of symptoms and high-risk features on cross-sectional imaging. Because pancreatic cysts are becoming more frequently diagnosed, clinicians should have a systematic approach for establishing a diagnosis and determining which patients require treatment.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is usually discovered at advanced stage and there are no screening or surveillance strategies proven to reduce risk. Pancreatic cysts have been targeted for intervention since mucin-producing cysts are associated with a risk of progression to adenocarcinoma over time. Though pancreatic cysts are easily identified on cross-sectional imaging, most types pose no risk of malignant degeneration. With trending use and improvements in imaging, incidental pancreatic cysts have been increasingly detected, occurring in 2.4–14.4% of the general population. The minority of these cysts are easily and accurately distinguished using clinical and radiographic features such as main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (MD-IPMN) and high-risk (≥ 3 cm in size) mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) perform poorly in discerning cyst type for the majority of cysts, with accuracy of diagnosis < 50%. Many are presumably neoplastic cysts such as branch duct (BD)-IPMN or small MCN whose natural history and risk for progression to adenocarcinoma are poorly understood. Resection is reserved for symptomatic or probable malignant cysts with features as suggested per Fukuoka criteria and the 2015 AGA guidelines on diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Surgical resection of pancreatic cysts carries a morbidity of 35% and mortality of 1%. Thus, non-operative management in most cases is reasonable as transformation of pancreatic cysts into adenocarcinoma appears to be a rare event (33.2 events per 100,000). The challenge is discerning BD-IPMN with highest malignant potential that warrant operative management from those that can be safely entered into a surveillance program, thereby minimizing risks to this patient population.

Data management and statistical analyses

Data were entered into a password protected de-identified database. Patients were divided into two groups, "Highest-Risk Group" (HRG) and "Lowest-Risk Group" (LRG), based the presence of Fukuoka criteria for analysis. The HRG consisted of BD-IPMN with at least one Fukuoka criterion (obstructive jaundice associated with cyst in head of pancreas, presence of a solid mass component or mural nodule within cyst, PD size ≥ 5 mm, cyst size ≥ 30 mm, abrupt change in caliber of PD with distal pancreatic atrophy, lymphadenopathy). The remaining patients with benign-appearing cysts without any Fukuoka criteria comprised the LRG.

Follow-up interval for each patient was calculated as the time between EUS examination and diagnosis of cancer, surgery, the most recent patient contact or death. Associations of individual factors with risk groups were tested using either the chi-square test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to compare the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Patients who underwent surgery or died without a cancer diagnosis were censored; however, follow-up information on clinical outcomes of pancreatic cancer and/or death following surgery was obtained for each patient.

### Pancreatic cyst features predict future development of pancreatic cancer: results of a nested case-control study [^115DT4UE]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are common, and prevalence increases with age. Previously, risk for malignant potential was deemed to be high, and surgical resection was often performed as initial management for pancreatic cysts across many centers. As additional studies examining natural history of pancreatic cysts have emerged, a more conservative approach with periodic surveillance has been adopted.

Risk factors for future development of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts remain incompletely characterized. Multiple guidelines recommend surveillance of pancreatic cystic neoplasms based on cyst-specific characteristics (Supplementary Table 1, available online at). – These guidelines are based on low-quality data and primarily represent expert opinion.

Prior studies examining the risk of future pancreatic cancer in individuals with pancreatic cysts have been limited by small study size, selection bias because of reliance on surgical and endosonographic series, and/or short follow-up. To address these research and clinical care gaps, we evaluated patient and cyst-specific risk factors for development of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts using a large national cohort with a long follow-up.

### Pancreatic cyst features predict future development of pancreatic cancer: results of a nested case-control study [^116fmDkr]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic neoplasms are common, and risk factors for future pancreatic cancer are incompletely understood. Our study confirmed multiple findings surrounding pancreatic cancer risk among people with pancreatic cysts reported in the literature and expands on the existing evidence gaps. Consistent with prior work, we identified age, cyst size, cyst growth rate, pancreatic duct dilation, and presence of a mural nodule as risk factors for development of future pancreatic cancer. By using a study base representing a usual care population rather than a study group highly selected for pancreatic resection, we have extended the confidence in the importance of these risk factors.

Furthermore, our study more confidently established cyst growth rate as predictor for future pancreatic malignancy. Specifically, the median cyst growth was 5.0 mm versus 0 mm (P < .001) and the median cyst growth rate was 1.9 mm/y compared with 0 mm/y (P < .001) in cases versus control subjects, respectively. We found that 38.5% of cancer cases demonstrated a clinical impression of cyst growth with a median cyst growth rate of 4.7 mm/y, whereas 9.8% of control subjects demonstrated a clinical impression of cyst growth, with a median cyst growth rate of 3.4 mm/y. Although Fukuoka and European guidelines recommended the use of cyst growth rate as a predictor, current American Gastroenterological Association guidelines did not, based on a lack of evidence; our novel findings suggest the cyst growth rate should be considered as a marker of pancreatic cancer in future clinical practice guidelines.

### Timeline of development of pancreatic cancer and implications for successful early detection in high-risk individuals [^1172Rd8y]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To successfully implement imaging-based pancreatic cancer (PC) surveillance, understanding the timeline and morphologic features of neoplastic progression is key. We aimed to investigate the progression to neoplasia from serial prediagnostic pancreatic imaging tests in high-risk individuals and identify factors associated with successful early detection.

Methods

We retrospectively examined the development of pancreatic abnormalities in high-risk individuals who were diagnosed with PC or underwent pancreatic surgery, or both, in 16 international surveillance programs.

Results

Of 2552 high-risk individuals under surveillance, 28 (1%) developed neoplastic progression to PC or high-grade dysplasia during a median follow-up of 29 months after baseline (interquartile range [IQR], 40 months). Of these, 13 of 28 (46%) presented with a new lesion (median size, 15 mm; range 7–57 mm), a median of 11 months (IQR, 8; range 3–17 months) after a prior examination, by which time 10 of 13 (77%) had progressed beyond the pancreas. The remaining 15 of 28 (54%) had neoplastic progression in a previously detected lesion (12 originally cystic, 2 indeterminate, 1 solid), and 11 (73%) had PC progressed beyond the pancreas. The 12 patients with cysts had been monitored for 21 months (IQR, 15 months) and had a median growth of 5 mm/y (IQR, 8 mm/y). Successful early detection (as high-grade dysplasia or PC confined to the pancreas) was associated with resection of cystic lesions (vs solid or indeterminate lesions (odds ratio, 5.388; 95% confidence interval, 1.525–19.029) and small lesions (odds ratio, 0.890/mm; 95% confidence interval 0.812–0.976/mm).

Conclusions

In nearly half of high-risk individuals developing high-grade dysplasia or PC, no prior lesions are detected by imaging, yet they present at an advanced stage. Progression can occur before the next scheduled annual examination. More sensitive diagnostic tools or a different management strategy for rapidly growing cysts are needed.

4.4 What is the best imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN?

MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN. EUS can be used in selected cases (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

See section 3 for details.

4.5 Should the progress of IPMN be followed for as long as the patient is fit for surgery?

The risk of IPMN progression increases over the time, therefore patients affected by IPMN without indication for surgery should be followed up until they are no longer fit for surgery (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

The risk of progression of IPMN increases over the time as does the risk of developing indications for surgical resection. Interruption of surveillance is not recommended if the patient is fit for a potential surgical resection. A single study on IPMN concluded that patients with a Charlson-age comorbidity index ≥ 7 have an 11-fold risk of comorbidity-related death within 3 years and only 6% of patients will die of malignant IPMN.

4.6 Should patients with IPMNs be screened for other tumours (including pancreatic cancer)?

The incidence of new extra-pancreatic neoplasms during the follow-up evaluation of pancreatic IPMN is not significantly greater than in the general population. Comprehensive screening outside the national protocols might not be necessary. Patients with IPMN are at risk of developing pancreatic cancer and attention should be paid to its concomitant development even when an IPMN has been successfully resected (GRADE 1C, strong agreement).

A systematic review concluded that the available data remain inconclusive. Two large studies including both surgically resected or followed IPMN did not find any difference in terms of incidence of extra-pancreatic neoplasms in patients with IPMN if compared with the general population.

4.7 Should MD-IPMN always be resected?

Patients with MD-IPMN who are fit for surgery should undergo resection (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Surgery for MD-IPMN is universally accepted considering the high-rate of malignancy due to MD-IPMN, even though no randomised trials comparing surgery with observation are available. As discussed in statement 4.1 above, a MD-IPMN measuring between 5 and 9.9 mm is a relative indication for surgical resection, while MD-IPMN measuring ≥ 10 mm (see statement 4.1 for details) is an absolute indication for surgical resection.

### Therapeutic approach to cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^112b7us8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Management of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is challenging as it relies on radiologic and cyst fluid markers to discriminate between benign and pre-cancerous lesions, however their ability to predict malignancy is limited. While asymptomatic serous cystadenomas can be managed conservatively, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are more difficult to manage. A selective approach, based on the preoperative likelihood of high-grade dysplasia or invasive disease, is the standard of care. Research is focusing on the development of pre-operative markers for identifying high risk lesions, which will spare patients with low-risk or benign lesions the risks of pancreatectomy.

### Prevalence and progression of pancreatic cystic precursor lesions differ between groups at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer [^113Hof6h]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of cystic pancreatic lesions and their natural behavior in 2 distinct high-risk groups for developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): (1) carriers of a mutation that predisposes to PDAC and (2) individuals without a known gene mutation but with a family history of PDAC (familial pancreatic cancer [FPC]).

Methods

Pancreatic surveillance by annual magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound was performed in individuals with an estimated lifetime risk of developing PDAC of 10% or greater. Progression of a lesion was defined as growth 4 mm or greater or the development of worrisome features.

Results

We included 186 individuals: 98 mutation carriers and 88 FPC individuals (mean follow-up, 51 months). Individuals with FPC were significantly more likely than mutation carriers to have a pancreatic cyst 10 mm or greater (16% vs 5%, P = 0.045). Pancreatic cysts detected in mutation carriers, however, were significantly more likely to progress than those in FPC individuals (16% vs 2%, P = 0.050).

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that the prevalence and growth characteristics of pancreatic cysts differ between distinct high-risk groups: individuals with FPC have a higher prevalence of pancreatic cysts 10 mm or greater, whereas cysts in mutation carriers are more likely to progress. These observations may help to develop more optimally tailored surveillance strategies in specific high-risk populations.

### Management algorithms for pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^111Nrqrj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different indications for treatment.

Objective —

To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of view.

Data Sources —

Literature review of published studies and the authors' own work.

Conclusions —

The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111SVtsg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance — discontinuation and age-related considerations: Surveillance should be discontinued if a patient is no longer a surgical candidate (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). It is reasonable to assess the utility of ongoing surveillance in those aged > 75 years. An individualized approach for those aged 76–85 years should be considered including an informed discussion about surgery (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines are the only guideline that recommends stopping surveillance of pancreatic cysts (3). They recommend that surveillance should stop after 5 years if there are no high-risk features, and size of the cyst is stable. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support discontinuing surveillance after 5 years in patients who are still surgically fit.

### Factors associated with the risk of progression of low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^114y3Jmt]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Most BD-IPMNs have a low risk of malignant transformation. Apart from specific morphologic changes considered overt indicators of the need for invasive diagnostics or operative management, there are few factors guiding clinicians' choices; thus, follow-up is similar for all patients potentially fit for surgery. This study investigated factors available at diagnosis, including, to our knowledge for the first time in this setting, the ABO blood group that might be associated with the risk of developing WFs or HRS.

In this ambispective cohort of 540 BD-IPMNs under surveillance for a median of 51.5 months, both cyst-related factors, such as initial cyst size, and patient-related factors, such as overweight and heavy smoking, were associated with progression risk. In the subgroup genotyped for ABO group, the AA genotype was associated with increased risk and the non-O group was not.

The observed rate of progression is in keeping with the 3.8% per year, with a mean of 12.8% during a mean follow-up of 3.8 years reported in a meta-analysisand with the rate of WF development of 14.8% in a mean follow-up of 61 months reported in a cohort of 1310 patients with BD-IPMN. This rate is lower in studies with shorter follow-up, being 4.2% after 25 months of surveillance among 1036 patients with BD-IPMNs. The probability of progression was 4% at 1 year, 24% at 5 years, and 43% at 10 years, with some of the events occurring after 5 years of stability. This observation is in keeping with previous studies, and emphasizes the need to consider with cautionthe American Gastroenterology Association 2015 guideline recommendationsto discontinue surveillance of BD-IPMNs after 5 years of no significant changes.

### Pancreatic cyst features predict future development of pancreatic cancer: results of a nested case-control study [^112yyFs7]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Risk factors for pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts are incompletely characterized. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for development of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective case-control study of U.S. veterans with a suspected diagnosis of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm from 1999 to 2013.

Results

Age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.06), larger cyst size at cyst diagnosis (HR, 1.03 per mm; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04), cyst growth rate (HR, 1.22 per mm/y; 95% CI, 1.14–1.31), and pancreatic duct dilation (5–9.9 mm: HR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.90–7.51; ≥ 10 mm: HR, 13.57; 95% CI, 5.49–33.53) were found to be significant predictors for pancreatic cancer on multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Age, cyst size, cyst growth rate, and high-risk or worrisome features were associated with a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Applying current and developing novel strategies is required to optimize early detection of pancreatic cancer after cyst diagnosis.

### Risk factors for malignant progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^117PM4vC]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas are increasingly diagnosed. Due to their malignant potential, greater understanding of their nature is required.

Aims

Define risk factors for malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

Methods

An international, multicentre study was performed in Europe and the United States. Clinical databases were reviewed for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms diagnosis.

Results

Of 1126 patients, 84 were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma/high-grade dysplasia and were compared to the rest of the cohort. Multivariate logistic analysis showed a statistically significant association between cancer/high-grade dysplasia and the variables smoking history (OR 1.9, 95% CI [1.1–3.1]), body mass index (OR 1.1, 95% CI [1–1.1]), symptoms (OR 3.4, 95% CI [1.9–6]), jaundice (OR 0.1, 95% CI [0–0.3]), and steatorrhea (OR 0.3, 95% CI [0.1–0.8]). Univariate analysis showed no association between malignancy and the cyst number/location (p = 0.3 and p = 0.5, respectively) although a strong association was shown for cyst size (p < 0.001). The presence and size of nodules (p < 0.01) and main duct involvement (p < 0.001) were also strongly related with malignancy.

Conclusion

The presence of jaundice and steatorrhea, smoking, high body mass index, and imaging features such as cyst size, main duct involvement, and the presence and size of mural nodules are associated with high-grade neoplasia in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^114XPvb2]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

When should surgery be performed? What type of surgery should be performed?

Screening should only be offered to individuals who are candidates for surgery (agree 75.5%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Pancreatic resections should be performed at high-volume specialty centres (agree 100%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Determining when surgery is required for pancreatic lesions is difficult and is best individualised after multidisciplinary assessment, preferably within research studies.

There is little consensus about which lesions detected by screening require surgery. The few published reports are based on limited numbers of patients. Because of the risks of pancreatectomy, prophylactic surgery is not recommended for asymptomatic HRIs without an identifiable lesion. When indicated, pancreatic surgery is best performed at a high-volume specialty centre. Multiple studies have shown volume directly correlates with outcomes.

Unambiguous solid lesions (≥ 1 cm, or seen by multiple imaging modalities) are ominous and the threshold for removing them is much lower. There was no consensus as to whether any indeterminate solid lesions detected by EUS should be resected (Appendix).

The majority of cystic lesions detected by screening appear to be low-risk branch-duct IPMNs (table 1). The Sendai international consensus guidelines have been developed and updatedto help stratify patients with an IPMN as low risk versus high risk for either developing or currently harbouring a malignancy. In subjects with suspected BD-IPMNs, resection is considered if the patient has symptoms attributable to the cyst(s), if the cysts are > 3 cm in size, or if the cysts contain mural nodules. Logic would dictate that if these are the recommendations for subjects without a strong family history of PC, then these thresholds for resection should be either the same or lower in subjects with a strong family history. There was no consensus on the size criterion for resection of suspected BD-IPMNs or other cysts in HRIs but the majority agreed that surgery should be considered for suspected BD-IPMNs which were ≥ 2 cm (Appendix). Pathologically confirmed PanIN-3 lesions have been found in the pancreata of individuals who had resections of IPMNs smaller than 1 cm. High-grade dysplasia and main-duct involvement have been identified at resection of some individuals who had surgery for one or more small (< 3 cm) BD-IPMNs. However, there is insufficient evidence to lower the threshold criteria for surgery for patients with lesions identified during pancreatic screening.

### Current trends in pancreatic cystic neoplasms… [^1157sx5L]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Whereas the majority of symptomatic patients had their cystic neoplasms resected on diagnosis, 50% of incidentally discovered cysts were initially managed nonoperatively. Of the patients who were managed with surveillance, 13 subsequently underwent resection after a median of 2. 1 years because of an increase in cyst size, development of symptoms, increasing tumor markers, worrisome endoscopic ultrasonography findings, or patient anxiety. Conclusions Incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic neoplasms composed 71% of our series, of which 50% were immediately resected. Subsequent morphologic changes or development of symptoms prompted an operation in 8% of patients after a period of surveillance. Invasive malignancy was present in 11% of all resected specimens but in 38% of main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

Prior studies have demonstrated that resection before progression to invasive cancer, even with carcinoma in situ, leads to a 5-year survival of up to 100% in contrast to 55% to 60% when there is invasive cancer. 7–9 The challenge is therefore to choose accurately between preemptive resection and surveillance. This decision is often based on circumstantial evidence, physician bias, and the comorbidities and anxieties of the patient. Surgical mortality was less than 1%. A complication developed in 18% of patients, with a pancreatic fistula being the most common. Many of the patients with a pancreatic fistula developed additional complications, including intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, wound infection, and sepsis. Most cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, with the exception of serous cystadenomas and rare entities like lymphangiomas and lymphoepithelial cysts, have the potential to be or to become malignant.

Prior reports from this institution7–9 and others12, 13 have indicated that common cystic tumors, which have a mucinous epithelial lining, contain carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer in up to 60% of resected cases.
8. These changes are likely due to increased awareness of pancreatic cystic lesions by clinicians and radiologists, as well as the improved resolution and availability of cross-sectional imaging. We currently recommend resection for symptomatic patients and those with lesions measuring 30 mm or more or with a solid component.

### Factors associated with the risk of progression of low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^114ZetnY]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can factors that are readily available at diagnosis be used to estimate the risk of progression of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs)?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 540 patients under surveillance for a median of 51.5 months, initial cyst size greater than 15 mm, body mass index greater than 26.4, and heavy smoking were associated with progression risk of BD-IPMNs. The AA blood genotype was also associated with progression risk.

Meaning

Results of this study suggest that cyst size alone is not a reliable factor to estimate progression risk, but along with other readily available data, size is helpful for planning personalized surveillance of BD-IPMNs.

### Pancreatic cyst features predict future development of pancreatic cancer: results of a nested case-control study [^114Mttdt]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

On univariable analysis, age, cyst size at diagnosis, cyst size ≥ 30 mm, change in cyst size, cyst growth rate, clinical impression of cyst growth, pancreatic duct dilation, enhancing mural nodule, and presence of any Fukuoka high-risk stigmata or worrisome feature were significantly associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1A and B). On multivariable analysis, age, index cyst size at diagnosis, cyst growth rate, and pancreatic duct dilation of 5 to 9.9 mm and ≥ 10 mm were all significant predictors for pancreatic cancer (Fig. 1C).

### Competing risks for mortality in patients with asymptomatic pancreatic cystic neoplasms: implications for clinical management [^1129uae4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) are being detected with increased frequency. Current clinical practice guidelines emphasize management based on cyst-related features. We aimed to evaluate the impact of comorbidity on mortality in PCN patients via competing risk analysis.

Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed between 2005–2010, with follow-up through 2015, for overall and cause-specific mortality. Comorbidities were classified by the Charlson comorbidity index. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the independent effect of cyst features, age, gender, and comorbidities on cause-specific mortality. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine the cause-specific mortality based on four a priori clinical profiles-healthy patients with low- or high-risk cysts, and high-comorbidity patients with low- or high-risk cysts.

Results

A total of 1,800 patients with PCNs comprised the study cohort (median follow-up 5.7 years). A total of 402 deaths (22.3%) occurred during the study period: 43 pancreatic cancer and 359 non-pancreatic cancer deaths. Compared to healthy patients without any high-risk cyst features (reference group), patients with high comorbidity as well as high-risk cyst features had an increased risk of overall mortality (Cox hazard ratio 6.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.71, 8.42, P < 0.01), pancreatic cancer mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 51.13, 95% CI 6.35, 411.29, P < 0.01), as well as non-pancreatic cancer mortality (SHR 5.24, 95% CI 3.85, 7.12, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, low-risk patients with a high-risk cyst were more likely to experience pancreatic cancer mortality (SHR 68.14, 95% CI 9.27, 501.01, P < 0.01) rather than non-pancreatic cancer mortality (SHR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88, 1.71, P = 0.23), compared to the reference group. Similarly, compared to the reference group, high-risk patients with a low-risk cyst were more likely to experience non-pancreatic cancer mortality (SHR 3.96, 95% CI 2.98, 5.26, P < 0.01) rather than pancreatic cancer mortality (SHR 2.35, 95% CI 0.14, 38.82, P = 0.55).

Conclusions

Most of the deaths in the study were unrelated to pancreatic cancer. This has implications for clinical management. By applying patient-related factors in conjunction with cyst features, we defined commonly encountered patient profiles to help guide PCN clinical management.

### Long-standing diabetes mellitus increases concomitant pancreatic cancer risk in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^115yxYSU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A few reports have indicated risk factors for concomitant PDAC in patients with IPMN; thus, we need to follow all patients with IPMN in a uniform manner with consideration of the possible onset of concomitant PDAC. This study is the first to report that long-standing diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for concomitant PDAC in patients with IPMN, and this might be an indication to reconsider the surveillance method for IPMNs.

Pancreatic cancers that developed from IPMN are divided into the two following types: (1) carcinogenesis from IPMN itself (IPMN-derived carcinoma) and (2) carcinoma development away from IPMN (concomitant PDAC). However, there are no guidelines and recommendations for surveillance that are concerned with finding concomitant PDAC. Herein, we encountered 14 patients with concomitant PDAC in pancreatic cysts, especially in IPMNs, and analyzed the risk factors for concomitant PDAC.

First, the proportion of the incident rate (IPMN-derived carcinoma vs. concomitant PDAC) reportedly varies (4:1, 1:1, 2:5). In our cohort, we encountered only 5 IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and one IPMN associated with invasive carcinoma. In contrast, 14 patients had concomitant PDACs. Our accommodation for surgery was not based on cyst size. One patient with a cyst of 68 mm in size had penetration into the stomach and underwent surgery, but the histological diagnosis was IPMN with HGD. As such, in our cohort, there might be some patients who did not have an operation unless they had a larger cyst, possibly with high-grade dysplasia. However, there have been no critical problems for these patients until now. Furthermore, most patients with further therapies due to worsening of a cyst had a better prognosis than those with concomitant PDAC. From this result and other studies, we strongly recognize the necessity of surveillance with targets for concomitant PDAC in a patient with IPMNs.

### Spectrum of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas and their surgical management… [^112ZdQEP]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are an increasing entity. Long-term survival of patients with these tumors is generally better than that of patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and mandates aggressive resectional therapy in most patients. Resection of these tumors can be done with resultant low morbidity and mortality rates. This was the only patient requiring reoperation. Seven patients had miscellaneous complications including stroke, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infection, delayed gastric emptying, and aspiration pneumonia. No complications were noted in 53 patients. Overall mortality was 4%. All deaths occurred in the IPMN category and include 2 patients who underwent total pancreatectomy and 1 patient with a T3 N1b tumor who committed suicide following discharge from the hospital. Ten patients recovered without complication. The 3 deaths in the series all occurred as previously explained within this group.

Two patients developed an abscess and 3 patients developed other miscellaneous complications. Although solid pseudopapillary neoplasms generally carry a favorable prognosis, metastatic disease has been reported. 11, 12 Differentiating between benign, malignant, or potentially malignant lesions cannot be done based on prognostic factors, making resection necessary for all of these lesions.
13. We think the risk of recurrence is less than the risk of total pancreatectomy. Both of the patients in this series who underwent total pancreatectomy died: one owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the other essentially from failure to thrive, no other cause was able to be discerned. Owing to the morbidity of total pancreatectomy as well as the mortality, we will leave the pancreas with dysplastic changes but no frank malignancy. Owing to the nature of this tumor, surveillance should be undergone by those who have not had a total pancreatectomy.

Since long-term survival of patients with cystic neoplasms is better than survival for those with adenocarcinoma, an aggressive approach for surgical resection is advocated for these tumors. Although most tumors require a Whipple procedure or distal pancreatec-tomy, central pancreatectomy can be performed with limited morbidity for small tumors in the neck of the pancreas. Additionally, as jaundice was a presenting sign in 4 of our patients, a cystic neoplasm, specifically IPMN, should be part of the differential diagnosis for any patient presenting with jaundice.

### Incidental pancreatic cysts… [^117TMP6s]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

The respective numbers for symptomatic cysts were 7%, 16%, 40%, and 9%. Ten percent of asymptomatic patients had a variety of other cystic lesions, and in 12%, no definitive cytologic or pathologic diagnosis was obtained. Overall, 17% of asymptomatic patients had in situ or invasive cancer, and 42% had a premalignant lesion. When evaluated as a function of size, only 1 of 28 asymptomatic cysts smaller than 2 cm had cancer compared with 13 of 50 cysts larger than 2 cm. The proportion of premalignant lesions, however, remained high in both groups. Pseudocysts comprised only 3. 8% of asymptomatic cysts compared with
19. 4% of symptomatic cysts. Patients with incidental cysts also had a significantly larger proportion of mucinous cystic neoplasms and fewer IPMTs, probably because of the predilection of mucinous cystic neoplasms for the tail of the pancreas.

However, the combined numbers of both types of mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas was 55% in both groups. We have no explanation for the finding that patients with incidental pancreatic cysts were nearly 10 years older than their symptomatic counterparts. Even if we had excluded patients with pseudocysts, a significant difference would remain. In an attempt to establish guidelines for the management of incidental cysts, we analyzed pathologic diagnosis as a function of size and presence or absence of symptoms. Even though the subgroup of patients with incidental cysts measuring 2 cm or smaller had a very low risk of cancer, the overall proportion of premalignant lesions was 50% or greater in all subgroups, regardless of size and mode of presentation. The issue of removal of serous cystadenomas is a matter of debate.

Even though the risk of malignancy in these tumors is negligible, 21, 22 and at least one study has shown that development of symptoms does not occur over a 3-year follow-up, 9 there is no question that serous cystadenomas can reach very large dimensions and can cause symptoms at a later date. Early resection is therefore advisable in patients with a long life expectancy and good surgical risk.

### Factors associated with the risk of progression of low-risk branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^113JHN3g]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) are common pancreatic preneoplastic lesions, but their surveillance is not personalized.

Objective

To investigate patient- and cyst-related factors associated with progression into worrisome features (WFs) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) categories of BD-IPMNs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cyst- and patient-related factors of consecutive BD-IPMNs without WFs or HRS in 540 patients diagnosed from 2009 to 2018 with at least 12 months' surveillance until February 28, 2020, were registered in a 2-center ambispective cohort study in Italy. In a subgroup, the ABO blood group was studied for the first time in this setting.

Exposure

Cyst-related and patients-related factors and ABO blood group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The study outcome was the appearance of WFs or HRS according to the 2017 International Association of Pancreatology guidelines. Survival probability was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curve and risk factors identified by Cox proportional hazards regression. ABO blood group was inferred through genotypes with DNA extraction.

Results

Of 540 patients with BD-IPMNs (median age, 66 years [interquartile range, 58.5–72.0 years]; 337 women [62.4%]) undergoing surveillance for a median of 51.5 months (interquartile range, 28–84 months) for 2758 person-years, 130 patients (24.1%) experienced progression. Probability of progression was 3.7% at 1 year, 23.4% at 5 years, and 43.3% at 10 years; 15 patients (2.8%) underwent surgery, 7 patients (1.3%) had malignant histologic findings, and 3 patients (0.56%) died of pancreatic-associated disease. Initial cyst size greater than 15 mm (hazard ratio [HR], 2.05; 95% CI, 1.44–2.91), body mass index greater than 26.4 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.19–2.50), and heavy smoking (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14–2.86) were significant independent factors associated with progression risk. The AA blood genotype was also associated with progression risk (HR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.04–11.71) compared with the OO genotype in the investigated subgroup.

Conclusions and Relevance

This analysis of factors associated with progression of BD-IPMNs according to recent guidelines suggests that cyst size alone is not a reliable factor for estimation of progression risk; however, along with other readily available data, size is helpful for planning personalized surveillance of BD-IPMNs.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^115263kq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) — post-resection recurrence risk and surveillance intervals: Retrospective studies have reported a high risk of recurrence, 17–65% in IPMNs with pancreatic cancer, and these patients should be followed per pancreatic cancer guidelines. After resection of an IPMN with high-grade dysplasia, recurrence rates of 13–31% are reported and we recommend surveillance with MRI or EUS on a 6-month basis; the median time to recurrence varies from 19 to 47 months, with a wide range of 4 to 180 months. For surgically resected IPMN with low- or intermediate-grade dysplasia, recurrence is 0–22%; in the absence of pancreatic cysts in the remnant, surveillance with MRI every 24 months appears reasonable. If there is an IPMN in the remnant pancreas, patients should be followed based on the size of the largest IPMN, and the shortest surveillance interval should be followed (i.e., if there is a 1.5 cm cyst then surveillance would be yearly).

### Pancreatic cancer is associated with medication changes prior to clinical diagnosis [^115arR4f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, pancreatic cancer is the 3 rd leading cause of cancer-related death. Approximately 80% of patients present with advanced disease, which is difficult to cure and is associated with short survival times. Although earlier detection is a critical priority, average-risk general population screening is difficult due to the relatively low disease incidence (39 per 100,000 person-years for women and 50 per 100,000 person-years for men among those ≥ 50 years of age). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), after weighing the potential benefits and harms, recently reaffirmed a recommendation against screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults. Identifying high-risk subsets who might benefit from surveillance is critical to pancreatic cancer early detection, but currently is pursued only among those with high familial or genetic risk and individuals with pancreatic cystic lesions. Defining additional patient features for inclusion in multi-factor models that identify individuals at near-term high risk for pancreatic cancer is important to expanding the population appropriate for pancreatic cancer early detection.

### Important radiological and clinicopathological risk factors for the recurrence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms after surgical resection [^112W9t1C]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The detection frequency of cystic lesions in the pancreas has increased with advancement and the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, with many lesions thought to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Although the majority of IPMNs are benign, some have malignant potential, making it crucial to establish management and surveillance strategies for these lesions. As a result, several studies have addressed this issue, leading to the development and revision of international consensus guidelines (ICGs) for IPMNs. The ICGs define high-risk stigmata and worrisome features to aid in surgical decision-making for IPMN patients. However, determining surveillance strategies for patients after surgical resection remains a challenge.

Currently, it is known that even noninvasive IPMN can lead to the development of clinically significant remnant pancreatic lesions (such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or IPMN which are indications for resection) after partial pancreatectomy, with risks persisting even beyond 5 years post-surgery. Consequently, recent guidelines recommend lifetime surveillance for all patients who have undergone surgery for IPMN, including those diagnosed with IPMN with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), as long as they remain fit for surgical resection. However, these recommendations are not strongly supported by high-level evidence, such as randomized controlled trials. Although rare, some studies suggest a low recurrence rate in noninvasive branch-duct IPMNs, indicating that surveillance might be discontinued for selected patients. Therefore, further research on risk-based surveillance strategies is needed, and understanding the factors that influence recurrence is crucial. Several studies have investigated risk factors for postoperative recurrence of IPMN, suggesting multiple potential factors, including pathologic grade, family history of pancreatic cancer, and other clinicopathologic factors. However, despite the importance of cross-sectional imaging in the diagnosis and management of IPMNs, few studies have thoroughly evaluated preoperative radiologic features alongside clinical and pathological factors as potential risk factors for postoperative recurrence. Even when some radiologic features are included in the analysis, the results vary among studies, highlighting the need for further research on the impact of preoperative imaging features on postoperative recurrence.

Therefore, this study aims to identify risk factors affecting postoperative recurrence-free survival in IPMN patients through a survival analysis that includes preoperative imaging findings, as well as pre- and postoperative clinical and pathological features.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: current evidence and guidelines [^112EdNmY]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are a heterogeneous group of pancreatic cysts that include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystic neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions, all with different biological behaviours and variable risk of progression to malignancy. As more pancreatic cysts are incidentally discovered on routine cross-sectional imaging, optimal surveillance for patients with PCN is becoming an increasingly common clinical problem, highlighting the need to balance cancer prevention with the risk of (surgical) overtreatment. This Review summarizes the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of PCN, including the quality of available evidence. Also discussed are the most important differences between the PCN guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association, the International Association of Pancreatology and the European Study Group on Cystic Tumours of the Pancreas, including diagnostic and follow-up strategies and indications for surgery. Finally, new developments in the management of patients with PCN are addressed.

### Natural history of pancreatic cyst with diameter as solitary risk factor [^1116msPq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple pancreatic cyst surveillance guidelines include cyst diameter ≥ 3cm as a worrisome feature prompting surgical referral.

Methods

Single center retrospective review of patients with pancreatic cysts ≥ 3cm at diagnosis and no other worrisome features. Cyst progression was defined as the development of additional worrisome features, pancreatic cancer diagnosis, or pancreatectomy. Pseudocysts and biopsy proven malignancies or non-IPMN cysts at initial consultation were excluded.

Results

Between 2010–2019, 89 patients met eligibility criteria with median age 70.9 (21–91), cyst size 3.5cm (3.10–9.7cm), and follow-up of 85.7 months (30.8–139.3). Cyst progression or resection occurred in 13 during follow-up There were no cases of pancreatic cancer or high-grade dysplasia on post-operative pathology. 12 patients (13%) died without evidence of progression. Cumulative incidence of progression from surveillance initiation was 3.4% [95%CI: 0.9%-8.8%] at 3 months, 5.6% [95%CI: 2.1%-11.9%] at 9 months, 9.0% [95%CI: 4.2%-16.2%] at 15 months, 11.2% [95%CI: 5.7%-18.8%] at 21 months, and 13.7% [95%CI: 7.5%-21.8%] at 57 months.

Conclusion

Pancreatic cysts with diameter ≥ 3cm as the sole worrisome feature can be safely monitored with low rates of progression during surveillance, and no incidence of cancer or high-grade dysplasia in our cohort.

### Long-term outcomes and risk of pancreatic cancer in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111cYdxM]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Multiple studies, in tertiary centers have found that IPMNs were associated with increased PC risk and that risk was higher in the presence of F-W or F-HR features. Attempts to quantify the risk of malignant transformation of PCLs to PC using large administrative databases have found that overall risk was relatively low. Specifically, IPMN-PC was more frequently earlier stage at diagnosis and had overall improved survival compared with non-IPMN PC. Our population-based study's findings agree with these prior observations. The improved prognosis of IPMN-PC has been attributed to an earlier stage of diagnosis and a greater proportion of nonmetastatic disease, as observed in our study. Moreover, the survival benefit in IPMN-PC has been primarily observed in node-negative disease, further highlighting outcomes associated with stage shift. Although several studies, describe the prevalence of PC in patients with IPMN, the true prevalence in the general population has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. This study provides estimates of the prevalence of IPMN-PC in a population-based PC cohort and addresses a critical gap in our understanding of IPMN-PC epidemiology. Using our CT cohort, we also found that the risk of developing PC was relatively low. This is highlighted further in our study given that patients with F-N IPMNs did not have different rates of PC compared with patients without IPMNs. This finding highlights previous work published by our group finding that F-HR IPMNs were the primary contributors to the risk of developing PC while F-W and F-N IPMNs had a low 5-year PC risk. Although the risk of IPMN-PC is has been extensively described, our population-based study further demonstrates that most IPMNs did not progress in Fukuoka stage and did not transform into PC, a similar message expressed by the current American Gastroenterological Association pancreatic cyst guidelines, published in 2015, and studies published in 2022and 2016.

Although intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are benign and make up only approximately 20% of the cystic lesions of the pancreas, they are the most extensively studied that this is secondary to their innate ability to transform into malignant lesions. In addition, the development and recent advances in endoscopic ultrasonography have largely influenced our understanding of IPMN and its subsequent risk for PDAC development. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia has been shown to increase the risk of the subsequent development of PDAC. The presence of a mural nodule during endoscopic ultrasonography is the most reliable indicator for malignancy potential. Size greater than 3 cm, though once thought to be a major predictor of malignancy, has been shown to not be a significant factor leading to cancer development. The frequency of malignancy in main pancreatic duct lesions is close to 80%, whereas the frequency of malignancy in branch duct lesions is lower with an average of approximately 20%.

Follow-up strategies according to Fukuoka consensus guidelines

European guidelines distinguish absolute and relative indications for surgery (Table 5). Patients with absolute indications for surgery, patients with one or more relative indications for surgery and without significant comorbidities and patients with comorbidities and with two or more indications for surgery should be operated, while patients with significant comorbidities or short life expectancy and with only one relative indication for surgery should undergo intensive surveillance with clinical evaluation, serum CA 19.9, MRI and/or EUS every six months. Patients without indications for surgery should be followed up with clinical evaluation, serum CA 19.9, MRI and/or EUS every six months for the first year from diagnosis and then yearly

European guidelines criteria for resection 2018

Many other guidelines for management of IPMN or CPNs including IPMN have been published, but none of them is complete, mainly because knowledge of natural history of these tumors is not perfect yet.

In our opinion, the IAP guidelines, in which treatment and follow-up strategies are decided on the basis of the presence of "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features", and the European guidelines are the most comprehensive and practical for decision making; however, the final decision on treatment should be individualized and should depend not only on the risk of malignancy and on the presence of symptoms, but also on patient's life expectancy, comorbidities, operative risk, cyst location and extent of surgery.

In particular, it is important to remember that the only possible treatment is surgery, and even in high-volume centers, risk of mortality and morbidity for pancreatic surgery is high (up to 3 and 30%, respectively); moreover, according to a recent study on risks for mortality in 1800 patients with asymptomatic CPL, comorbidity is the major cause of mortality, and only in patients with "high-risk cysts" (considered those with size > 3 cm and main pancreatic duct dilatation) and "low-risk comorbidities", the risk of pancreatic cancer mortality approaches that of non-pancreatic cancer mortality. Thus, patients-related factors such as age, life expectancy and comorbidities should strongly impact on clinical decision making.

### Long-standing diabetes mellitus increases concomitant pancreatic cancer risk in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^1124DH6p]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among cancers, and its 5-year survival rate is approximately 10% and 7.1% in the United States and Japan, respectively. Therefore, great effort has been made to detect pancreatic cancers at earlier stages, focusing on patients with risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Risk factors include hereditary pancreatic cancer syndrome, familial pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). There are two pathways that promote pancreatic cancer in patients with IPMN: pancreatic cancer derived from IPMN and concomitant pancreatic cancer (PDAC) with IPMN. Concomitant PDAC develops at different site than that for IPMN, and its pathogenesis is still not well-understood. However, some clinical studies have shown that patients with IPMN had more PDACs (concomitant PDACs in this paper) than the general population. Concomitant PDAC has been reported to be induced even after 5 years of surveillance, stressing the importance of vigilance in monitoring for concomitant PDAC with IPMN over a lengthy time course. The surveillance of patients diagnosed with IPMNs over many years might be difficult for patients and doctors and in terms of medical economics. The frequency of concomitant PDACs found during surveillance is very low compared with PDACs found for other reasons in our institute. For this reason, we need to focus on patients with a higher risk for pancreatic cancers, even in IPMN cohorts. Herein, we studied the risk factors for concomitant PDAC in a patient cohort with pancreatic cysts.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111RBbVg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study represents one of the largest, single-institution analysis of the results of a surveillance program for patients with IPMN, who were managed according to current guidelines. Our study was one of the few to report on the outcome of patients whose IPMN required resection but who could not undergo surgery due to general contraindications. The study results support the recommendations of current guidelines by demonstrating that the majority of patients with branch-duct IPMN (78.5% in this study) can be managed safely with a conservative approach. The mortality rate due to the development of IPMN-associated cancer or concomitant pancreatic cancer separate from the IPMN is 1% in the cohort of patients who were under surveillance as recommended by the guidelines. This does not exceed the mortality rate associated with pancreatic surgery, even in the most experienced centers. Interestingly, the cumulative risk for IPMN progression increased over time and was 70% at 5 years and 97.5% at 10 years from the time of detection of the IPMN. Even the cumulative risk for progression to an IPMN that required surgery increased continuously and reached 26% at 5 years and 72.1% at 10 years of follow-up. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with an IPMN that developed features requiring surgery increased significantly also after 5 years of follow-up. The median time from first diagnosis of an IPMN (not requiring resection) to surgery was 48 months. The final histology of IPMNs that progressed and required surgery confirmed that the large majority of these lesions (85.4%) represented a true surgical indication, either with respect to the IPMN type (main-duct or mixed-type) or the grade of dysplasia (high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma). This indicates that the detection of changes in cyst characteristics or in patient symptoms is indeed more predictive than a simple "one shot" evaluation at the time of first diagnosis. The observations in this study demonstrate that progression of IPMNs that do not fulfill criteria for surgery to lesions that require resection can occur even after 5 years or more following diagnosis. These observations validate and support the recommendations of the European and International guidelines regarding the necessity of a life-long follow-up of these patients. Moreover, the findings of the current study do not support the recent statement from the American Gastroenterological Association (ASA), which suggests that surveillance does not need to be continued for cysts without significant change after 5 years of follow-up. Considering that both the risk for progression and the risk for surgery gradually increase over time, our results support also the recommended strategy of a low frequency of control investigations in the initial years of the screening program, followed by an intensified protocol after 5 years. The results of this study further show that radiological prominence of the main pancreatic duct (diameter ≥ 6 mm) is associated with an increased risk for progression. This observation confirms the importance and prognostic significance of even mild pancreatic duct dilatation, as recently reported by Hackert et al. and stated by the European guidelines. Furthermore, the current analysis shows that localization of an IPMN in the pancreatic head also is associated with an increased risk for progression. This finding seems to confirm previous observations by Ammori et al.

At this time, HRIs with cysts in the setting of elevated HbA1c should continue surveillance under published guidelines. In newly established guidelines, there was expert consensus around the need for glucose testing (fasting glucose or HbA1c) to detect new-onset diabetes in HRIs. Additionally, there was consensus that the new emergence of diabetes in HRIs should prompt additional investigation. Further prospective surveillance data are required to evaluate risk factors for neoplastic progression in HRIs with cysts and elevated HbA1c.

### Association of preoperative risk factors with malignancy in pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms: a multicenter study [^1162hc3U]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) harbor malignant potential, and current guidelines recommend resection. However, data are limited on preoperative risk factors for malignancy (adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia) occurring in the setting of an MCN.

Objectives

To examine the preoperative risk factors for malignancy in resected MCNs and to assess outcomes of MCN-associated adenocarcinoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Patients who underwent pancreatic resection of MCNs at the 8 academic centers of the Central Pancreas Consortium from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2014, were retrospectively identified. Preoperative factors of patients with and without malignant tumors were compared. Survival analyses were conducted for patients with adenocarcinoma.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Binary logistic regression models were used to determine the association of preoperative factors with the presence of MCN-associated malignancy.

Results

A total of 1667 patients underwent resection of pancreatic cystic lesions, and 349 (20.9%) had an MCN (310 women [88.8%]; mean (SD) age, 53.3 [14.7] years). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.72; 95% CI, 1.21–11.44; p = 0.02), pancreatic head and neck location (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.43–10.81; p = 0.01), increased radiographic size of the MCN (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08–1.27; P < .001), presence of a solid component or mural nodule (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.95–10.57; P < .001), and duct dilation (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 1.63–10.64; p = 0.003) were independently associated with malignancy. Malignancy was not associated with presence of radiographic septations or preoperative cyst fluid analysis (carcinoembryonic antigen, amylase, or mucin presence). The median serum CA19–9 level for patients with malignant neoplasms was 210 vs 15 U/mL for those without (P = 0.001). In the 44 patients with adenocarcinoma, 41 (93.2%) had lymph nodes harvested, with nodal metastases in only 14 (34.1%). Median follow-up for patients with adenocarcinoma was 27 months. Adenocarcinoma recurred in 11 patients (25%), with a 64% recurrence-free survival and 59% overall survival at 3 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia is present in 14.9% of resected pancreatic MCNs for which risks include male sex, pancreatic head and neck location, larger MCN, solid component or mural nodule, and duct dilation. Mucinous cystic neoplasm-associated adenocarcinoma appears to have decreased nodal involvement at the time of resection and increased survival compared with typical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Indications for resection of MCNs should be revisited.

### Editorial: management of the small asymptomatic pancreatic cyst: somehow along the way we forgot about the patient [^11643Fw3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The incidentally identified pancreatic cyst is an increasing burden for both physicians and patients alike. Although we recognize that most of these lesions are benign and may not progress, a subset of these lesions are premalignant, may have frank cancer, and may progress over time. Most occur in older patients who have associated comorbidity. Recent studies highlight neoplastic features of these cysts that when present may warrant surgery or close long-term follow-up; however, there has been little study on the natural history factoring in patient comorbidity and pancreatic cancer-free survival. This retrospective cohort study underscores the importance of patient comorbidity in our management algorithm, and these data should prompt subsequent guidelines to factor in such comorbidity.

### Pancreatic cysts are monitored in new trial aimed at reducing cancer risk through targeted screening… [^116YkkjL]. prevention.cancer.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Date Posted, by Susan Jenks In a new NCI-sponsored study now recruiting participants, investigators will evaluate two different screening strategies for non-cancerous pancreatic cysts to determine which works best at detecting early malignancy. Even though few of these sac-like structures are likely to develop into pancreatic cancer, researchers said, accurately predicting which cysts pose the highest cancer risk is essential to improving prevention and early detection. Screening for pancreatic cysts has long presented clinicians and patients with the challenging dilemma of whether benefits outweigh the risks. Finding pancreatic cancers early when they are most treatable can improve relative overall 5-year survival. But, studies have shown that the surgical removal of these cysts carries an estimated 2% mortality rate or higher, especially in older individuals, and a 30% chance for complications following surgery.

"If you take all comers with pancreatic cysts, the risk they will turn cancerous is about 0. 25% per year, " Dr. Weinberg said. Given the dire prognosis for many patients with these cancers, he said, that's not trivial, and it illustrates the tension doctors labor under to find these cancers much earlier. "Even with the best of intentions and the very best imaging we have now, " Dr. Weinberg said, only about 50% of patients will have either cancer or high-grade dysplasia, a precursor to cancer development, when they go to the operating room. So, the remaining 50% endure the worry, cost and risks without apparent benefit, he said. At Memorial Sloan Kettering, patients diagnosed with pancreatic cysts undergo regular monitoring for rapid changes in size or other features, such as high-grade dysplasia, that might signal a developing cancer. Now in its fifth year, the surveillance clinic follows the Fukuoka approach, Dr.

Soares said, because the AGA guidelines suggest screening should stop after 5 years "and we don't think the risk necessarily goes away over time. " Even in patients who have had cyst resection, the "rest of the pancreas is still at risk going forward". Among the clinical trials in which the hospital participates, is a randomized study looking at how to stop cyst progression to cancer, Dr. Soares said. Participants are first tested for an anti-inflammatory marker identified in cyst fluid, then receive either an anti-inflammatory drug or a placebo to see if there's a decrease in cyst growth.

### Fukuoka criteria accurately predict risk for adverse outcomes during follow-up of pancreatic cysts presumed to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^115pPfSG]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Fukuoka consensus guidelines classify pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) presumed to be intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into Fukuoka positive (FP) (subgroups of high-risk (HR) and worrisome features (WFs)) and Fukuoka negative (FN) (non-HR feature/WF cysts). We retrospectively estimated 5-year risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) in FN, WF and HR cysts of patients with PCL-IPMN.

Design

From Mayo Clinic databases, we randomly selected 2000 patients reported to have a PCL; we excluded inflammatory or suspected non-IPMN cysts and those without imaging follow-up. We re-reviewed cross-sectional imaging and abstracted clinical and follow-up data on PCL-IPMNs. The study contained 802 patients with FN cysts and 358 with FP cysts.

Results

Patients with PCL-IPMN had median (IQR) follow-up of 4.2 (1.8–7.1) years. Among FN cysts, 5-year PC risk was low (2–3%) regardless of cyst size (p = 0.67). After excluding events in the first 6months, 5-year PC risk remained low (0–2%) regardless of cyst size (p = 0.61). Among FP cysts, HR cysts (n = 66) had greater 5-year PC risk than WF cysts (n = 292) (49.7% vs 4.1%; p < 0.001). In HR cysts, 3-year PC risk was greatest for obstructive jaundice versus enhancing solid component or main pancreatic duct > 10mm (79.8% vs 37.3% vs 39.4%, respectively; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Fukuoka guidelines accurately stratify PCL-IPMNs for PC risk, with FN cysts having lowest and HR cysts having greatest risk. After 6-month follow-up, WF and FN cysts had a low 5-year PC risk. Surveillance strategies should be tailored appropriately.

Pancreatic cyst size thresholds — IPMN/MCN referral and growth risk are supported by meta-analyses showing elevated odds of high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer at larger sizes, with a systematic review reporting OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.82–4.85) and a meta-analysis reporting OR 6.24 (95% CI, 3.08–12.63); accordingly, "we recommend referral for IPMNs or MCNs measuring ≥ 3 cm". Growth rate is also important, as IPMNs with "an increase in cyst size of ≥ 2 mm/year" were associated with higher risk; measurement variability "may be as high as 4 mm", and "if there are concerning features, or ongoing rapid increase in cyst size, patients should be referred for further evaluation".

Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies and bound to become the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death in the Western world. There are two types of PDAC precursor lesions, namely pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN) and mucinous cysts. The latter are subdivided further into intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). In particular IPMNs have a high potential to develop into malignant tumors with a bad prognosis and are therefore of high clinical relevance. They are frequently discovered through incidental cross-sectional imaging. Diagnostically, three IPMN grades are described: low-grade and high-grade dysplasia (also called carcinoma in situ) as well as IPMN with an associated carcinoma. On the basis of clinical evidence, low-grade IPMN dysplasia are considered benign with a low risk of malignant progression. They have a 5-year disease-specific survival rate of 97%, as compared with 84% and 39% of patients with high-grade and invasive IPMN. They are kept under close surveillance to monitor further development of the disease. High-grade dysplasia is a premalignant form and IPMNs with an associated carcinoma have already become malignant. Because of the high risk, these IPMN patients require surgical tumor resection. Distinguishing high-risk from low-risk IPMN patients accurately is critical to give patients the appropriate treatment. If the intervention is late, a highly malignant tumor could develop which results in poor prognosis. If surgery is performed when not required, it poses an unnecessary risk to the patient's health. There are quite a few indicators for surgery, such as a positive cytology for malignant, high-grade dysplasia, tumor-related jaundice, enhancing mural nodes, main pancreatic duct dilatation, tumor growth-rate, cyst diameter, increased carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) blood concentration, new-onset of diabetes mellitus, and diagnosis of pancreatitis. Despite this large number of diagnostic features, however, diagnosis is not sufficiently accurate. Also imaging does not solve the problem; resected IPMN samples frequently reveal other grades of malignancy than predicted prior to resection.

As reported in Table 3, in the multivariable analysis, the best fit model was the one including a BMI greater than 26.4 (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.19–2.50; p = 0.004), heavy smoking (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.14–2.86; p = 0.01), and cyst size greater than 15 mm (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.44–2.91; P < .001). The Kaplan-Meier curves representing the risk of progression according to the presence or absence of these 3 variables are presented in Figure 2. Although the probability of progression was much lower in patients with an initial cyst size less than or equal to 15 mm, it increased over time with a probability of being progression-free of 90.2% at 3 years, 82.8% at 5 years, and 69.6% at 10 years. We then estimated the progression risk in 4 subgroups: (1) size less than or equal to 15 mm and neither heavy smoking nor BMI greater than 26.4 (reference); (2) size less than or equal to 15 mm, heavy smoking, and BMI greater than 26.4; (3) size greater than 15 mm and neither heavy smoking nor BMI greater than 26.4; and (4) size greater than 15 mm, heavy smoking, and BMI greater than 26.4. The rate of patients free of progression at 5 years was 84.2% in group 1 (reference); lower progression-free rates were noted in all other groups with Cox proportional hazards regression: 57.1% in group 2 (HR, 5.65; 95% CI, 1.75–18.2), 70% in group 3 (HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.53–3.22), and 47.9% in group 4 (HR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.81–10.61) (χ² for comparison among groups, P < .001). A history of diabetes, alcohol intake, family or personal history of pancreatic cancer or any other cancer, and the number of cystic lesions were not associated with progression risk.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^112TTaUq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are very common with the majority incidentally identified. There are several types of pancreatic cysts; some types can contain cancer or have malignant potential, whereas others are benign. However, even the types of cysts with malignant potential rarely progress to cancer. At the present time, the only viable treatment for pancreatic cysts is surgical excision, which is associated with a high morbidity and occasional mortality. The small risk of malignant transformation, the high risks of surgical treatment, and the lack of high-quality prospective studies have led to contradictory recommendations for their immediate management and for their surveillance. This guideline will provide a practical approach to pancreatic cyst management and recommendations for cyst surveillance for the general gastroenterologist.

### Risk of neoplastic progression in individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer undergoing long-term surveillance [^114i8gGj]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Screening of individuals who have a high risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), because of genetic factors, frequently leads to identification of pancreatic lesions. We investigated the incidence of PDAC and risk factors for neoplastic progression in individuals at high risk for PDAC enrolled in a long-term screening study.

Methods

We analyzed data from 354 individuals at high risk for PDAC (based on genetic factors of family history), enrolled in Cancer of the Pancreas Screening cohort studies at tertiary care academic centers from 1998 through 2014 (median follow-up time, 5.6 years). All subjects were evaluated at study entry (baseline) by endoscopic ultrasonography and underwent surveillance with endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of PDAC, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) after baseline. We performed multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.

Results

During the follow-up period, pancreatic lesions with worrisome features (solid mass, multiple cysts, cyst size > 3 cm, thickened/enhancing walls, mural nodule, dilated main pancreatic duct > 5 mm, or abrupt change in duct caliber) or rapid cyst growth (> 4 mm/year) were detected in 68 patients (19%). Overall, 24 of 354 patients (7%) had neoplastic progression (14 PDACs and 10 HGDs) over a 16-year period; the rate of progression was 1.6%/year, and 93% had detectable lesions with worrisome features before diagnosis of the PDAC or HGD. Nine of the 10 PDACs detected during routine surveillance were resectable; a significantly higher proportion of patients with resectable PDACs survived 3 years (85%) compared with the 4 subjects with symptomatic, unresectable PDACs (25%), which developed outside surveillance (log rank P < .0001). Neoplastic progression occurred at a median age of 67 years; the median time from baseline screening until PDAC diagnosis was 4.8 years (interquartile range, 1.6–6.9 years).

Conclusions

In a long-term (16-year) follow-up study of individuals at high-risk for PDAC, we found most PDACs detected during surveillance (9/10) to be resectable, and 85% of these patients survived for 3 years. We identified radiologic features associated with neoplastic progression.

### Invasive and noninvasive progression after resection of noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111PLBAX]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To define frequencies, pattern of progression (invasive vs noninvasive), and risk factors of progression of resected noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

Background

There is a risk of progression in the remnant pancreas after resection of IPMNs.

Methods

Four hundred forty-nine consecutive patients with resected IPMNs from 1995 to 2018 were included to the study. Patients with invasive carcinoma or with follow-up < 6 months were excluded. Noninvasive progression was defined as a new IPMN, increased main pancreatic duct size, and increased size of an existing lesion (5 mm compared with preoperative imaging). Invasive progression was defined as development of invasive cancer in the remnant pancreas or metastatic disease.

Results

With a median follow-up of 48.9 months, progression was identified in 124 patients (27.6%); 108(24.1%) with noninvasive and 16(3.6%) with invasive progression. Median progression follow-up was longer for invasive progression (85.4 vs 55.9 months; P = 0.001). Five-and 10-year estimates for a cumulative incidence of invasive progression were 6.4% and 12.9% versus 26.9% and 41.5% for noninvasive progression. After risk adjustment, multifocality (HR 4.53, 95% CI 1.34–15.26; P = 0.02) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in the original resection (HR 3.60, 95% CI 1.13–11.48; P = 0.03) were associated with invasive progression.

Conclusions

Progression to invasive carcinoma can occur years after the surgical resection of a noninvasive IPMN. HGD in the original resection is a risk factor for invasive progression but some cases of low-grade dysplasia also progressed to cancer. Patients with high-risk features such as HGD and multifocal cysts should be considered for more intensive surveillance and represent an important cohort for future trials such as anti-inflammatory or prophylactic immunotherapy.

### Cystic lesions of the pancreas [^113RKXmA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent publications, such as the Fukuoka guidelines, provide more specific recommendations for surgical resection and surveillance of mucinous cystic neoplasms and IPMNs. In the study by Lee et al, a new EUS-based scoring system has been proposed for the prediction of malignancy in patients with BDT-IPMN. It has been proposed that for patients < 65 years old a threshold of 2 cm can be used to determine more aggressive management, while for older patients, a lesion > 3 cm without the presence of mural nodules could be observed. The American Gastroenterological Association published a technical review on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. The review concluded that for patients with benign-appearing lesions and low-risk features on imaging, surveillance with MRI and EUS with or without FNA will allow watchful waiting of a presumed mucinous lesion, including both mucinous cystic neoplasms and branch duct IPMNs. The risks of malignancy should always be weighed against the risks of pancreatic surgery.

Most importantly, the American Gastroenterological Association published a Guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts, based on expert opinions and the available literature. According to their recommendations, pancreatic cysts < 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic ducts should be reevaluated by MRI in 1 year and every 2 years thereafter for a total of 5 years if there is no change in size and other features. In contrast, cysts with 2 or more high-risk characteristics, such as dilated main pancreatic duct, size more than 3 cm and the presence of a solid component, should undergo EUS-FNA. Those patients with a dilated pancreatic duct and a solid component and/or suspicious findings on EUS and EUS-FNA should undergo surgical resection of the cystic lesion to reduce mortality from malignancy.

However, some experts questioned some of the statements of the guideline, emphasized the role of EUS-FNA and concluded that we need more evidence. In Fig. 6, a simplified algorithm for the follow up and treatment of pancreatic cystic neoplasms is proposed. The technique of EUS-FNA does not differ for solid or cystic lesions. For cystic lesions, broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the puncture procedure and should be continued for at least 48 h. One should try to aspirate all the cystic fluid with one pass of the needle to reduce complications. Molecular analysis of cyst fluid aspiration is being investigated as a diagnostic tool for the risk assessment of cystic pancreatic neoplasms, especially for the smaller cysts which do not meet size criteria for resection.

Pancreatic cysts — concerning symptoms and laboratory/clinical triggers for evaluation: Obstructive jaundice due to the cyst is concerning for cancer and such patients "should be urgently referred" for multidisciplinary evaluation and consideration of surgery. An elevated CA19–9 in IPMNs has pooled sensitivity 40%, specificity 89%, and OR 4.34 (95% CI, 2.65–7.10); if no benign cause is found, patients "should be referred" to a multidisciplinary clinic. Acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst has been associated with increased cancer risk in several studies. New-onset diabetes in older adults carries population-level risk — "Approximately 1% of adults over than 50 years with new-onset diabetes will develop pancreatic cancer within 3 years", and in IPMNs, new or worsening diabetes is linked to higher risk; therefore, the guideline states, "We recommend careful evaluation… with consideration of EUS or MRI".

### Risk factors for progression in patients undergoing surveillance for pancreatic cysts [^111fyb2j]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors associated with the progression of pancreatic cysts in patients undergoing surveillance.

Background

Previous studies of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) rely on surgical series to determine malignancy risk and have inconsistently identified characteristics associated with IPMN progression.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 2197 patients presenting with imaging concerning for IPMN from 2010 to 2019 at a single institution. Cyst progression was defined as resection or pancreatic cancer development.

Results

The median follow-up time was 84 months from the presentation. The median age was 66 years, and 62% were female. Ten percent had a first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer, and 3.2% had a germline mutation or genetic syndrome associated with an increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cumulative incidence of progression was 17.8% and 20.0% at 12 and 60 months postpresentation, respectively. Surgical pathology for 417 resected cases showed noninvasive IPMN in 39% of cases and PDAC with or without associated IPMN in 20%. Only 18 patients developed PDAC after 6 months of surveillance (0.8%). On multivariable analysis, symptomatic disease [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.25–2.01], current smoker status (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.16–2.15), cyst size (HR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.20–1.33), main duct dilation (HR = 3.17; 95% CI: 2.44–4.11), and solid components (HR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.34–2.66) were associated with progression.

Conclusions

Worrisome features on imaging at presentation, current smoker status, and symptomatic presentation are associated with IPMN progression. Most patients progressed within the first year of presentation to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Further investigation is necessary to develop personalized cyst surveillance strategies.

Table 2
Risk of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy according to dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in IPMN

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN several factors may predict progression during surveillance (eg, diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

4.2 What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection

For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

For patients with relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection therefore does not eliminate the need for regular follow-up screening.

4.3 Is there a certain size cut-off point for resecting an IPMN regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms or (other) risk factors? Is age of the patient a co-factor that should be analysed to define better management strategy?

Patients with IPMNs > 40 mm have an increased risk of harbouring malignancy (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Several studies including both surgically resected or observed IPMN have reported an increased risk of malignancy ranging from 12% to 47% in cases of a cyst ≥ 30 mm. In some of these series, the risk of malignancy produced by cyst size was stratified by the presence of other features for malignancy, indicating that cyst size alone is not an appropriate indication for surgery since the risk of malignancy is actual but low. If multiple risk factors are present the sensitivity to detect malignancy increases.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^1172dZxP]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts focuses on adult patients with cysts detected by radiology and uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework phrased in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. The scope pertains only to asymptomatic pancreatic neoplastic cysts, does not evaluate the impact of symptoms, and excludes solid papillary neoplasms, cystic degeneration of adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) without side branch involvement. Incidental identification is common with modern imaging, and subsequent evaluations and interventions can be invasive, expensive, and harmful. Management emphasizes identifying the small minority of cysts with early invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) so that appropriately timed surgical resection can reduce mortality, while acknowledging that surgery is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality. Common diagnostic tools — including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — have suboptimal sensitivities and specificities for identifying patients at highest risk. For each PICO statement, both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are provided, with quality described on a 4-point scale from high to very low.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: integrating novel diagnostic and prognostic factors with current clinical guidelines [^112X4QMK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Owing to increased detection rates, the diagnosis and management of incidental pancreatic cysts has become a common predicament. Up to 13% of patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging studies for other indications are found to have pancreatic cystic lesions. Although most cystic lesions are benign, the malignant potential of several types of pancreatic cysts makes accurate classification vital to directing therapy. To this end, advances in the last decade led to better characterization of pancreatic cyst morphology and hence enhanced the ability to predict underlying histopathology, and biological behavior. Although accurate classification remains a challenge, the utilization of complementary diagnostic tools is the optimal approach to dictate management. The following review includes a description of pancreatic cysts, a critical review of current and emerging diagnostic techniques and a review of recent guidelines in the management of incidental pancreatic cysts.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: current evidence and guidelines [^115QXDpM]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on neoplastic pancreatic cysts:

- **Definition**: Neoplastic pancreatic cysts are abnormal, fluid-filled sacs in the pancreas that have the potential to develop into tumors.
- **Pathophysiology**: Neoplastic pancreatic cysts are usually caused by genetic mutations and abnormal cell growth. Mutations in genes such as KRAS and GNAS have been detected in pancreatic fluid samples.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of neoplastic pancreatic cysts in the US is estimated at 31.3 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for pancreatic cysts include advancing age, male sex, tobacco use, familial history of pancreatic cancer, and specific genetic syndromes.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include symptoms like abdominal pain, jaundice, unexplained weight loss, and new-onset diabetes. However, many of these cysts are asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered on routine cross-sectional imaging.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis varies depending on their biological behavior and potential for progression to malignancy. Routine surveillance of pancreatic cysts without high-grade dysplasia or malignancy at surgical resection is not recommended, as these cysts have a lower risk of progression.

Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) — post-resection risk and surveillance: Patients with surgically resected MCNs with low-, intermediate-, or high-grade dysplasia do not require surveillance. Patients with a surgically resected MCN with invasive cancer have no risk of developing a new MCN in the remnant pancreas, but they do carry a 25% risk of recurrence of their original cancer, and they should undergo standard surveillance-based pancreatic cancer guidelines for 5 years; no surveillance is required after 5 years.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111eTVYL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Pancreatic Cysts — epidemiology and malignant risk are summarized as follows: In asymptomatic populations, pancreatic cyst prevalence is reported from 2.4 to 13.5%, and among patients over the age of 70 undergoing abdominal magnetic resonance imaging the prevalence of incidental cysts was 40%. Using the assumption that all pancreatic cancer arises in patients with pancreatic cysts, the probability that a cyst harbors malignancy at imaging is 0.25%, with an overall conversion rate to invasive cancer of 0.24% per year. In surgically resected series, the pooled proportion with pancreatic cancer was 15% in 27 studies of 2,796 patients, and when only intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are considered, a review of 99 studies of 9,249 patients reported a 42% rate of either high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer. For suspected IPMNs, one review of 3,980 patients found an overall risk of developing pancreatic cancer of 2.8% (95% CI, 1.8–4.0%), consistent with an estimated 0.72% per year (95% CI, 0.48–1.08). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 3,236 patients reported pooled cumulative incidence for low-risk IPMNs of 0.02% at 1 year, 3.12% at 5 years, and 7.77% at 10 years, and for high-risk IPMNs of 1.95% at 1 year, 9.77% at 5 years, and 24.68% at 10 years; the approach of including all pancreatic cysts has been criticized, as many pancreatic cysts have no malignant potential.

### Predictors of progression among low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in a multicenter surveillance cohort [^111nvFi3]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to identify baseline characteristics associated with disease progression and malignant transformation in low-risk suspected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of prospectively maintained databases of pancreatic cysts at 3 international, academic institutions. Five hundred fifty-nine adult patients with clinically suspected asymptomatic IPMN evaluated by radiologic studies or endoscopic ultrasound between 2003 and 2013 without worrisome features and under surveillance for 12 months or longer were included. We evaluated the relationship of baseline demographics and cyst features to disease progression (size increase, development of worrisome features, or high-grade dysplasia/cancer).

Results

After a median of 44 months follow-up, 269 (48%) patients experienced cyst size increase, 68 (12%) developed worrisome features, and 11 (2%) developed high-grade dysplasia/cancer. In multivariable Cox-regression analysis, no baseline characteristics were associated with size increase. An initial cyst size of 2 cm or greater, multifocality, history of prostate cancer, and smoking were the strongest predictors of development of new worrisome features. Univariable analysis found male sex, diabetes, and recent weight loss associated with development of high-grade dysplasia/cancer.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that low-risk suspected IPMNs carry a small but clinically relevant risk of disease progression and provides data on baseline characteristics that may help in risk stratification.

### Pancreatic cyst features predict future development of pancreatic cancer: results of a nested case-control study [^114QKa7p]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims:

Risk factors for pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts are incompletely characterized. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors for development of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreatic cysts.

Methods:

We conducted a retrospective case-control study of U.S. veterans with a suspected diagnosis of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm from 1999 to 2013.

Results:

Age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.06), larger cyst size at cyst diagnosis (HR, 1.03 per mm; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04), cyst growth rate (HR, 1.22 per mm/y; 95% CI, 1.14–1.31), and pancreatic duct dilation (5–9.9 mm: HR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.90–7.51; ≥ 10 mm: HR, 13.57; 95% CI, 5.49–33.53) were found to be significant predictors for pancreatic cancer on multivariable analysis.

Conclusions:

Age, cyst size, cyst growth rate, and high-risk or worrisome features were associated with a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Applying current and developing novel strategies is required to optimize early detection of pancreatic cancer after cyst diagnosis.

### Long-standing diabetes mellitus increases concomitant pancreatic cancer risk in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^115SDQUR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

When monitoring patients with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), it is important to consider both IPMN-derived carcinoma and concomitant ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The latter is thought to have a poorer prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the risk factors for concomitant PDAC in IPMN.

Methods

In total, 547 patients with pancreatic cysts, including IPMNs inappropriate for surgery on initial diagnosis, encountered from April 2005 to June 2019, were reviewed. We performed surveillance by imaging examination once or twice a year.

Results

Five IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia and one IPMN associated with invasive carcinoma were encountered. In comparison, 14 concomitant PDACs were encountered. The prognosis was very poor for concomitant PDACs. All 14 PDAC patients had IPMNs. In patients with IPMNs, long-standing diabetes mellitus was the only significant risk factor for concomitant PDAC in both univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, patients with IPMNs and diabetes mellitus had a high frequency of concomitant PDACs (9.5%, 9/95) in a median 48-month surveillance period.

Conclusions

When monitoring IPMNs, the development of not only IPMN-derived carcinomas but also concomitant PDACs should be considered. During this period, it may be prudent to concentrate on patients with other risk factors for PDAC, such as long-standing diabetes mellitus.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^114595aH]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

As pancreatic cyst incidence rises, likely due to the ubiquitous increase in cross-sectional imaging, their management presents multiple challenges for both the practitioner and patient. It is critical that all pancreatic cysts are appropriately characterized, as treatment decisions depend on an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic modalities such as cytology, biopsy, and cyst fluid biomarkers allow for definitive diagnosis of virtually all lesions. Some cysts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and cystic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, have malignant potential and must be surveyed. Other cysts, such as serous cystadenomas and pancreatic fluid collections, do not have malignant potential. Surveillance strategies vary widely depending on cyst type and size and while multiple medical societies advocate surveillance, their published surveillance guidelines are heterogenous. Cysts with high-risk stigmata or worrisome features are usually resected, depending on the patient's surgical fitness. In patients unfit for resection, newer endoscopic ablative techniques are advocated. Controversial aspects regarding cyst management include whether surveillance can be stopped, how surveillance should be performed, and the extensive financial burden cyst management places on the health care system. Further study into the natural history of cystic lesions, including definitive determination of the rate of malignant transformation for each cyst type, is essential.
