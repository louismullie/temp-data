## Question

How to treat epidermoid cyst with mupirocin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat an epidermoid cyst with mupirocin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of epidermoid cysts and whether they are primarily infectious. Then, I should verify what the evidence-based standard of care is for inflamed versus infected cysts. Next, I will check mupirocin's labeled indications and whether it has any role here. After that, I need to consider exceptions, such as when there is a secondary bacterial infection or when decolonization is relevant. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and note safety considerations and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the nature of epidermoid cysts. Epidermoid cysts are keratin-filled, epithelial-lined cysts that arise from implantation or proliferation of epidermal elements in the dermis; they are not inherently infectious, though they can become inflamed or secondarily infected, and they often present as mobile subcutaneous nodules with a central punctum [^dc9daeaa] [^f54229b1].

> Wait, let me verify the standard of care when an epidermoid cyst is inflamed. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline for skin and soft tissue infections explicitly recommends incision and drainage as the treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, and it does not recommend routine Gram stain or culture of cyst contents, reflecting that most are inflamed rather than truly infected; antibiotics are reserved for select scenarios with systemic features or host compromise, not as primary therapy [^26aa9bd6] [^1949fbf9] [^60f646c9].

> I need to check mupirocin's indications and mechanism to see if there is any fit. Mupirocin is a topical RNA synthetase inhibitor indicated for impetigo and secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions; it is not indicated for cysts, and its activity is limited to susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, which means it treats superficial bacterial infections rather than the cyst itself or its keratinous content [^218a6cef] [^e73f8207] [^9cc8262f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider exceptions. If the cyst is ruptured and there is a clearly secondarily infected wound with purulence, erythema, warmth, and pain, then a short course of topical mupirocin could be reasonable for the overlying skin infection, but this is adjunctive and does not replace drainage or excision of the cyst wall, which is necessary to prevent recurrence; moreover, mupirocin resistance is not rare, so clinical response should be reassessed promptly [^218a6cef] [^c898ce1f] [^f54229b1].

> Let me think about decolonization, because I initially wondered if nasal mupirocin might help with recurrent cysts. Hmm, wait a minute, that would be a misapplication; intranasal mupirocin is used for S. aureus decolonization in recurrent skin and soft tissue infections or in specific perioperative contexts, not for treating cysts themselves, and it does not address the cyst pathophysiology or prevent cyst recurrence [^cb34eea6] [^e71ba990] [^40fdf64f].

> I should double-check safety and formulation issues if someone is considering topical mupirocin on broken skin. Mupirocin ointment contains polyethylene glycol, which can be absorbed from open wounds and may cause renal toxicity in large amounts, especially with renal impairment; thus, prolonged use on large open areas should be avoided, and patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction should use caution or avoid use on open wounds [^d3b1e8c2] [^aad477dd].

> Next, I should review practical management steps. For a noninflamed cyst, observation or elective excision is appropriate; for an inflamed cyst, incision and drainage is first-line, with consideration of intralesional corticosteroid to reduce inflammation if needed; for a recurrent or bothersome cyst, complete excision of the cyst wall is preferred to prevent recurrence; if there is secondary infection of the overlying skin, a short course of topical mupirocin may be used as an adjunct while arranging definitive drainage or excision, with reassessment in 3 to 5 days for response [^26aa9bd6] [^f54229b1] [^dc9daeaa] [^be071360].

> But wait, what if the lesion is not actually an epidermoid cyst? I should confirm the diagnosis and consider mimics such as pilar cysts, hidradenitis, or pilonidal disease, because management differs; ultrasound can help distinguish cystic from solid lesions and guide whether drainage or excision is indicated, and this avoids inappropriate antibiotic use when the process is noninfectious [^8a3ca6a9] [^dbdf1c2e].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: mupirocin is not a treatment for epidermoid cysts themselves; it has no role in resolving keratinous cyst contents or preventing recurrence. It may be used briefly for a clearly secondarily infected superficial component, but definitive therapy remains incision and drainage or excision of the cyst, with antibiotics reserved for systemic features or host risk factors, not as routine care [^26aa9bd6] [^1949fbf9] [^218a6cef].

---

Mupirocin is **not indicated** for epidermoid cysts because they are noninfectious, keratin-filled lesions [^dc9daeaa]. Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic for impetigo or secondarily infected skin lesions [^218a6cef] [^e59d1242]; it does not treat the cyst itself. The standard of care is **incision and drainage** for inflamed cysts [^26aa9bd6], with complete excision of the cyst wall to prevent recurrence [^f54229b1]. Reserve mupirocin only for clear secondary bacterial infection after drainage, and avoid use if there is a known allergy or if the skin is severely damaged [^d3b1e8c2].

---

## Indications and mechanism of action of mupirocin

Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic indicated for impetigo and secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions [^218a6cef] [^e59d1242]. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and is active against Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes [^e73f8207]. It is **not indicated for noninfectious lesions** such as uninfected epidermoid cysts [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of epidermoid cysts

Epidermoid cysts are benign, keratin-filled lesions lined by stratified squamous epithelium [^d0900f69]. They arise from implantation of epidermal cells into the dermis, often after trauma or follicular rupture [^dc9daeaa]. Inflammation is typically sterile and driven by keratin leakage, not bacterial infection; thus, antibiotics like mupirocin do not address the underlying pathology [^1eb09ca3].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for treatment

Current guidelines and evidence-based practice consistently recommend **incision and drainage** as the primary treatment for inflamed or infected epidermoid cysts [^26aa9bd6] [^1949fbf9]. Antibiotics are not routinely required unless there is systemic involvement, immunocompromise, or a high risk of complications [^60f646c9]. Mupirocin is not mentioned in guidelines for cyst management, underscoring its lack of role in treating the cyst itself [^notfound].

---

## Role of mupirocin in epidermoid cyst management

Mupirocin may be considered only when there is **secondary bacterial infection** of the cyst or surrounding skin, typically after drainage. It targets surface bacteria but does not penetrate the cyst wall or resolve the keratinous content. Its use should be limited to short courses (≤ 7 days) and discontinued if there is no clinical improvement within 3–5 days [^be071360].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

There is **no evidence** that mupirocin improves outcomes for uninfected epidermoid cysts. Its effectiveness is limited to reducing bacterial colonization in secondarily infected lesions, and it does not prevent recurrence or address the cyst wall, which is the key to definitive management [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Mupirocin is generally well tolerated, but adverse effects include:

- Local irritation (burning, itching, erythema) [^3bcc3c3d]
- **Allergic reactions (rare)**: urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis [^a740b0b4]
- **Superinfection**: overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi [^d3b1e8c2]
- **Polyethylene glycol absorption**: risk of renal toxicity with large-area use on damaged skin, especially in renal impairment [^d3b1e8c2]

---

## Alternative and preferred treatments

The **preferred treatments** for epidermoid cysts include:

- **Incision and drainage**: for inflamed or infected cysts; relieves pain and accelerates resolution [^26aa9bd6].
- **Complete excision**: removes the cyst wall and prevents recurrence; gold standard for definitive management [^f54229b1].
- **Intralesional corticosteroids**: for inflamed, noninfected cysts to reduce inflammation and hasten resolution [^dc9daeaa].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** | **Role of mupirocin** |
|-|-|-|
| Uninfected epidermoid cyst | Observation or excision | Not indicated |
| Inflamed epidermoid cyst | Incision and drainage ± intralesional steroid | Not indicated |
| Secondarily infected cyst | Incision and drainage ± systemic antibiotics | Consider topical mupirocin only if clearly infected |
| Recurrent cysts | Complete excision of cyst wall | Not indicated |

---

Mupirocin is **not indicated** for epidermoid cysts and should be reserved for cases with clear secondary bacterial infection after drainage. The standard of care remains incision and drainage with complete excision of the cyst wall to prevent recurrence.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^60f646c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

7.2 What should dermatologists be aware of?

The most common cutaneous manifestation in patients with BCNS is multiple BCCs, both nonpigmented and pigmented, involving all histological subtypes and occurring on both sun‐exposed and nonsun‐exposed parts of the body. Some patients with BCNS will develop > 100 BCCs during their lifetime. The first BCC can develop during early childhood. Sunscreen use must be discussed frequently, as it can prevent the development of BCCs in patients with BCNS.

Other frequently found skin abnormalities (palmoplantar pits, basaloid follicular hamartomas, facial milia and epidermoid cysts) are benign and do not need treatment, but may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

Regarding BCCs, treatment with surgical excision is the gold standard. When localized in functionally/cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face, Mohs micrographic surgery is preferred. As multiple excisions lead to many scars and can have a high psychological impact, noninvasive topical treatments can be useful alternatives. Radiotherapy is relatively contraindicated in patients with BCNS, owing to the increased risk of BCCs in the irradiated area. Hh pathway inhibitors (HPIs), such as vismodegib and sonidegib, may be indicated in advanced BCC, and are very effective in the treatment of multiple BCNS‐associated BCCs (Tables S2 and S3; see Supporting Information). These treatments are not a lifelong option because of side‐effects, and BCCs will recur after treatment discontinuation (Table S4; see Supporting Information). Recently, small phase II clinical trials on topical HPIs have been conducted. Results from larger trials need to confirm whether topical HPIs could be a valuable addition to the treatment modalities.

### Minimal excision technique for epidermoid (sebaceous) cysts [^f54229b1]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Epidermoid cysts are asymptomatic, dome-shaped lesions that often arise from a ruptured pilosebaceous follicle. The minimal excision technique for epidermoid cyst removal is less invasive than complete surgical excision and does not require suture closure. The procedure is easy to learn, and most physicians experienced in skin surgery can perform the procedure after three to five precepted sessions. It involves making a 2- to 3-mm incision, expressing the cyst contents through compression and extracting the cyst wall through the incision. Gauze or a splatter shield should be used to protect the physician from spraying of cyst contents. The rarity of associated cancer makes histologic evaluation necessary only if unusual findings or clinical suspicion of cancer is present. Inflamed cysts are difficult to excise, and it is often preferable to postpone excision until inflammation has subsided.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

It is not known whether mupirocin is present in human milk, has effects on the breastfed child, or has effects on milk production. However, breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to the drug due to the minimal systemic absorption of mupirocin in humans following topical administration of mupirocin cream [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mupirocin cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mupirocin cream or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

To minimize oral exposure of the drug to children, a breast and/or nipple being treated with mupirocin cream should be thoroughly washed prior to breastfeeding.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of mupirocin cream have been established in the age-groups of 3 months to 16 years. Use of mupirocin cream in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of mupirocin cream in adults with additional data from 93 pediatric subjects studied as part of the pivotal trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

In 2 adequate and well-controlled trials, 30 subjects older than 65 years were treated with mupirocin cream. No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of mupirocin cream was observed in this patient population when compared with that observed in younger patients.

### Interventions for impetigo [^c3299915]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this. For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08). There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference. Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.

### Clinical efficacy of dialkylcarbamoylchloride-coated cotton acetate dressing versus combination of normal saline dressing and 2% mupirocin ointment in infected wounds of epidermolysis bullosa [^70762c15]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Dialkylcarbamoylchloride (DACC)-coated cotton acetate dressing works directly through hydrophobic interaction to reduce the number of bacteria without the risk of resistance. It is easy to use and therefore expected to improve patient's compliance. This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of DACC-coated cotton acetate dressing compared to a combination of normal saline dressing and 2% mupirocin ointment. A single-blind controlled trial was conducted and included 14 infected epidermolysis bullosa (EB) wounds which were divided into two groups. Group I received DACC-coated cotton acetate dressing, and Group II received the combination of normal saline dressing and 2% mupirocin ointment. Study results showed that the average time required for complete wound closure was 8.6 and 11.1days in Groups I and II, respectively (p = .014), which was statistically significant. Both groups showed complete bacterial elimination on Day 3 based on negative Gram stain results and on Day 6 based on clearance of clinical manifestations (p = 1.000). This is a novel study in EB-infected wounds, which shows that DACC-coated cotton acetate dressing promotes faster wound closure and is as effective as the combination of normal saline dressing and 2% mupirocin ointment in eliminating bacterial infection.

### Pediatric patient with linearly distributed bullae [^fe75c523]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is a first-line treatment option for this disease process?
A. High-dose prednisone
B. Dapsone
C. Aspirate the fluid and apply mupirocin ointment
D. Oral doxycycline
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin

Answers:
A. High-dose prednisone – Incorrect. BD is not an inflammatory process. Steroids would worsen hyperglycemia and increase risk of infection.
B. Dapsone – Incorrect. Although in this patient biopsies rare neutrophils were present, neutrophils are not thought to be the primary driving force of the disease process as biopsies typically show minimal to no inflammation.
C. Aspirate the fluid and apply mupirocin ointment – Correct. Although treatment is not required as it is a self-limiting disease, some use a small-bore needle to aspirate fluid and apply topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infections while others leave the bullae intact.
D. Oral doxycycline – Incorrect. BD is not an inflammatory or infectious process. Oral antibiotics would only be required if secondary infection was suspected.
E. Intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. BD is not an autoantibody mediated disease.

Question 3: What is the typical sequalae of this disease process?
A. Resolution of bullae with localized scarring
B. Diffuse spreading of bullae and vesicles
C. Develop systemic symptoms including fever and malaise
D. Nonscarring, relapsing, and remitting bullae
E. Chronic bullae formation

Answers:
A. Resolution of bullae with localized scarring – Incorrect. While the level of separation of the skin in BD can occur at different levels, the dermis remains intact and therefore scarring does not occur.
B. Diffuse spreading of bullae and vesicles – Incorrect. While the etiology of BD remains unclear, it is uncommon for bullae to spread diffusely.
C. Develop systemic symptoms including fever and malaise – Incorrect. BD is not associated with systemic symptoms. If present though, it can be a sign of an underlying infection as diabetic patients are at increased risk of infection.
D. Nonscarring, relapsing, and remitting bullae – Correct. No scarring develops unless repeated episodes with ulceration occurs. The bullae can reappear at the same location or different locations with future episodes.
E. Chronic bullae formation – Incorrect. The bullae self-resolve over weeks without treatment. Typically, once an episode resolves, there is a period of remission before additional bullae form.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin cream for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions (e.g., lacerations, sutured wounds, and abrasions not more than 10 cm in length or 100 cm² in total area) was compared with that of oral cephalexin in 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials. Clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 96.1% for mupirocin cream (n = 231) and 93.1% for oral cephalexin (n = 219). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations were 100% for both mupirocin cream and oral cephalexin.

Pediatrics

There were 93 pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the secondarily infected skin lesion trials, although only 3 were younger than 2 years of age in the population treated with mupirocin cream. Subjects were randomized to either 10 days of topical mupirocin cream 3 times daily or 10 days of oral cephalexin (250 mg 4 times daily for subjects greater than 40 kg or 25 mg per kg per day oral suspension in 4 divided doses for subjects less than or equal to 40 kg). Clinical efficacy at follow-up (7 to 12 days post-therapy) in the per-protocol populations was 97.7% (43 of 44) for mupirocin cream and 93.9% (46 of 49) for cephalexin.

### Characterization of wound microbes in epidermolysis bullosa: results from the epidermolysis bullosa clinical characterization and outcomes database [^c898ce1f]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) require care of wounds that are colonized or infected with bacteria. A subset of EB patients are at risk for squamous cell carcinoma, and bacterial-host interactions have been considered in this risk. The EB Clinical Characterization and Outcomes Database serves as a repository of information from EB patients at multiple centers in the United States and Canada. Access to this resource enabled broad-scale analysis of wound cultures.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 739 wound cultures from 158 patients from 13 centers between 2001 and 2018.

Results

Of 152 patients with a positive culture, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was recovered from 131 patients (86%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) from 56 (37%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) from 34 (22%). Sixty-eight percent of patients had cultures positive for methicillin-sensitive SA, and 47%, methicillin-resistant SA (18 patients had cultures that grew both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant SA at different points in time). Of 15 patients with SA-positive cultures with recorded mupirocin susceptibility testing, 11 had mupirocin-susceptible SA and 6 patients mupirocin-resistant SA (2 patients grew both mupirocin-susceptible and mupirocin-resistant SA). SCC was reported in 23 patients in the entire database, of whom 10 had documented wound cultures positive for SA, PA, and Proteus species in 90%, 50%, and 20% of cases, respectively.

Conclusions

SA and PA were the most commonly isolated bacteria from wounds. Methicillin resistance and mupirocin resistance were reported in 47% and 40% of patients tested, respectively, highlighting the importance of ongoing antimicrobial strategies to limit antibiotic resistance.

Simple abscess

Cutaneous abscesses are collections of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues.

To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its the borders of the abscess. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Epidermoid cysts, often named "sebaceous cysts", are usually due to infection of pilosebaceous gland and are present anywhere in the body lined by squamous epithelium.

Furuncles also named "boils" are superficial infections with suppuration of the hair follicle, usually caused by S. aureus. They extend through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where form a small abscess. Furuncles can occur anywhere on hairy skin. A group of infected hair follicles with pus is named carbuncle. Carbuncles are larger and deeper than furuncles. Furuncles often rupture and drain spontaneously or following treatment with moist heat. Most large furuncles and all carbuncles should be treated with incision and drainage. Excision of carbuncle with primary split-thickness skin grafting is an alternative treatment modality.

A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection may be caused by local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material. Therefore, it always requires research of a local cause.

Treatment
Incision and drainage
Antibiotic therapy only in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days

Incision, evacuation of pus and debris, and probing of the cavity to break up loculations provide effective treatment of cutaneous abscesses. The resultant wound should be left open and lightly packed with roll gage soaked with antiseptic solution.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for abscesses greater than 5 cm, in an area difficult to drain (e.g. face, hand, and genitalia), if there is lack of response to incision and drainage alone, if there are multiple localizations and in patients with immunosuppression.

### Eruptive epidermoid cysts resulting from treatment with imiquimod [^bb26fc06]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Because of its unique mechanism of action and safety profile, imiquimod, a topical immune response modifier, is used for many benign and malignant dermatologic conditions. Adverse effects are typically limited to treatment site erythema and erosion.

Objective

To describe a newly recognized adverse effect of imiquimod.

Methods

A 79-year-old woman being treated with imiquimod 5 days per week for a nodular basal cell developed a verrucous plaque over the treatment area after 7 weeks of therapy.

Results

Scouting biopsies demonstrated multiple comedones and ruptured epidermoid cysts. There was no evidence of residual basal cell carcinoma.

Conclusions

Imiquimod is a new and novel treatment option for cutaneous malignancies. We report its successful use in the treatment of a nodular basal cell carcinoma. The multiple comedones and ruptured epidermoid cysts are newly reported adverse effects of imiquimod therapy.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^da9af8aa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.

### Methods and materials… [^555d2206]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

There are many surgical approaches to epidermoid cysts. While complete surgical excision can ensure removal of the sac and prevent recurrence, this technique is time-consuming and requires suture closure. The minimal excision technique has been proposed as a less invasive and successful intervention. The minimal excision technique involves a 2- to 3-mm incision, expression of the cyst contents, and extraction of the cyst wall through the incision. Simple incision and drainage of cysts frequently results in recurrence. Two iodine crystals can be placed in the center of the cyst and, during the next few weeks, the cyst will become dark brown and hard. This hard nodule can then be expressed from the skin. This simple technique is inexpensive, but the need for a follow-up visit and the length of time for lesion removal may make this technique less desirable to many patients.

5-mL syringe, filled with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine with a 30-gauge needle 25-gauge, 1 ¼-inch needle Sterile Tray for the Procedure Place the following items on a sterile drape covering a Mayo stand: Procedure Description 1. The skin overlying the site is cleansed with povidone-iodine solution. The skin overlying the cyst and the tissue to the sides and beneath the cyst are anesthetized with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine.
2. A fenestrated drape can be placed on the patient, with the lesion beneath the fenestration. A no. 11 blade is used to create a stab incision into the center of the cyst. A small-tipped hemostat is placed into the cyst, the tips gently opened and compression applied to allow the cyst con tents to pass through the opening. The sac may break, and several pieces may need to be removed.
5.

At the end of the procedure, the wound should be inspected to ensure that all of the cyst wall has been removed. The cyst wall can be pieced together to provide additional confirmation of complete removal.
6. Direct pressure is applied to the site with gauze. Antibiotic ointment is applied and gauze is taped over the site. The patient is encouraged to hold direct pressure to the site for one to two hours following the procedure. Most small incisions do not require suture closure.

### Mupirocin ointment (Sx pre-Op prep pouch) [^fc474ad2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in 2 trials. In the first, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or vehicle placebo 3 times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.

In the second trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment 3 times daily or 30 to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day (this was an unblinded trial) for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups.

Pediatrics

There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial described above, all subjects were pediatric except 2 adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for mupirocin ointment (n = 27) was 96%, and for erythromycin it was unchanged (78.5%).

### A rare case of a subungual epidermoid cyst treated by surgical excision maintaining maximal functionality [^42adc72e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Epidermoid cyst is a frequent benign growth that is commonly found on the trunk but can occur anywhere on the body. There are only a few case reports describing palmar, plantar, or, as in our case, epidermoid subungual cysts. The clinically indistinguishable isthmus catagen cyst, also referred to as trichilemmal cyst, can be histologically distinguished by the missing granular layer and is found on the head in up to 90% of cases. The term "onycholemmal cysts", which sometimes occurs in the literature, refers to isthmus catagen cysts that are found in the area of the nail unit of the finger or the toe. Onycholemmal cysts are frequent incidental findings that are up to 1 mm in diameter and lined with concentric keratin.

The pathologic mechanism of epidermoid cysts in the subungual space is still controversial. Two main hypotheses under discussion are previous trauma with entrapment of epidermal tissue and embryonic cell rest. Epidermoid cyst of the thumb was first described in 1930 by Harris. Since then, several more cases of epidermoid cysts of the terminal phalanx have been reported, the majority with a history of previous trauma of the affected finger.

This case report should raise awareness of epidermoid cysts in the differential diagnosis of subungual tumors and share our experience from clinical presentation to final diagnosis. Epidermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause tremendous pain and consequently handicap when located in the subungual space. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, which is also performed to confirm the diagnosis histologically. In this particular location, a very precise excision to remove the complete cyst wall helps to avoid recurrence and consequent reoperation in this delicate area. Although horizontal or longitudinal incisions of the matrix were favored in the past for fear of fissuring of the nail, in our experience, an arcuate incision is best suited to allow for complete removal of submatrical growth with no risk to subsequent nail growth when performed delicately, as demonstrated here. This case report provides an elegant example of an excision where the finger regained functionality immediately after surgery due to stabilization of the surgical site by the laterally remaining untouched nail splints and the application of cyanoacrylate adhesive immediately after surgery and later gel coating to protect the nail plate.

### Intrafamilial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^cce9b90a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection was first described in our region over 15 years ago. More recently, CA-MRSA has become a global concern and is now a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States. An association between severe CA-MRSA infection (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis and pneumonia) and the synergohymenotrophic exotoxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been made. Reports have documented CA-MRSA transmission among household members; however, most cases have been mild or moderate infections or asymptomatic colonization. We describe intrafamilial transmission of a PVL-containing CA-MRSA clone common in Australia (ST30-MRSA-IV) between a nurse who suffered recurrent abscesses and her husband, who died of severe pneumonia.

In July 2006, a 61-year-old previously healthy nurse (Mrs A) sought treatment for an infected seborrheic cyst of the scalp. Culture of pus yielded MRSA that was susceptible to clindamycin. She was treated with oral clindamycin. After resolution of the infection, topical MRSA decolonization therapy with 3% hexachlorophane body wash (daily), 20% cetrimide shampoo (3×/wk), and 2% mupirocin nasal ointment (3×/d) was administered for 10 days, as per our institutional protocol for MRSA-colonized healthcare workers. Subsequently, MRSA surveillance swabs from the nose, throat, and scalp obtained weekly for 10 weeks and cultured on selective MRSA chromogenic agar and in selective broth enrichment media were negative. Household members were not screened for MRSA colonization.

### Cutaneous cysts of the head and neck [^f0888f0a]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article reviews the types of cutaneous cysts in patients referred to the Facial Lesion Clinic at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, TX, and proposes effective treatment modalities based on lesion and patient variables. Cyst variables included proper identification, size of the lesion, and acute or chronic processes. Patient considerations included age, skin type, and location. Medical and social histories were not noted.

Patients and Methods

Eighty-two patients who had 1 or more cysts removed over the 5-year period from July 15, 1998 to July 14, 2003 were reviewed for age, gender, histologic diagnosis, anatomic location of the lesion, and complications.

Results

Patients with epidermal inclusion cysts (79%), followed by pilar cysts (9%), hidrocystomas and dermoid cysts (3% each), and multiple other diagnoses (less than 2%) were treated. Neither complications nor recurrent infections were reported during the 5-year interval. There were no recurrent cyst formations noted by return appointment.

Conclusion

Cystic lesions of the head and neck may be treated effectively as long as they are correctly identified and treated in a specific manner.

### A primer on topical antibiotics for the skin and eyes [^c8e8b803]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

A thorough knowledge of all topical antibiotics treatment options is important as more pathogens become resistant to standard therapies. As resistance to mupirocin increases, it seems that triple antibiotic ointments and retapamulin (the newest FDA-approved agent) will have greater roles in treating impetigo and skin infections. Awareness of all these agents provides a dermatologist additional tools with which to treat skin infections. As a wide variety of topical antibiotics, combination antibiotics, and combination anti-inflammatory preparations used by ophthalmologists are not part of the therapeutic armamentarium of most dermatologists, this review will provide the knowledge needed to rationally use such ophthalmologic preparations. Finally, information related to the topical nadifloxacin for acne and skin infections, which is in clinical use in Japan, is summarized.

### Plasma exeresis treatment for epidermoid cysts: a minimal scarring technique [^b21163f0]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epidermoid cysts are cutaneous benign tumors commonly seen in young or middle-aged adults. Plasma exeresis is an innovative technique for several skin conditions: it causes ionization of the atmospheric gas between the proximal tip of the device and the tissue to be treated, creating sublimation of the tissue.

Objective

To remove the cyst with a novel technique that allows a good cosmetic result.

Materials and Methods

Patients with clinical diagnosis of at least one epidermal cyst, aged between 18 and 70 years were enrolled. A standardized procedure was used. After administration of topical and sometimes local anesthesia (for cysts bigger than 1 cm), a tiny hole was created with plasma exeresis. The content of the cyst was then extruded and Micro Hartman Alligator Ear Forceps pulled out the loosened capsule.

Results

Twenty patients aged between 18 and 68 years were enrolled: 11 males (55%) and 9 females (45%). Twenty-eight cysts were successfully removed. The diameter ranged from 3 to 24 mm. No side effects were observed. The scar measured not more than 3 mm.

Conclusion

This study suggests that plasma exeresis could represent a good and safe option to remove noninfected cysts on cosmetic areas, although further study is required.

### Resection of large recurrent third ventricular epidermoid tumors through the posterior interhemispheric transcallosal approach [^d0900f69]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Epidermoid cysts or tumors comprise 1% of intracranial tumors with a predilection for the cerebellopontine angle or parasellar cisterns. These tumors are derived from an ectopic ectodermal implant seeded between fusing ectodermal surfaces. This results in a benign proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium along a cyst wall with a lumen composed of hyperkeratotic material derived from the desquamating cells. Surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients. There is no role for radiotherapy or chemotherapy in the treatment of these lesions, including for residual or recurrent disease. The inherent adhesion of the proliferating epithelial lining to surrounding neurovascular structures significantly complicates attempts at gross-total resection. Epidermoid tumors or cysts are rarely reported within the third ventricular region. In this video, the authors demonstrate the technique of right-sided posterior interhemispheric transcallosal approach for maximal resection of a complex recurrent third ventricular epidermoid tumor with lateral ventricular extension.

CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment USP, 2% in impetigo was tested in two studies. In the first, patients with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment USP, 2% or vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric patients included) were 71% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% and 62% for vehicle placebo. There were no side effects reported in the group receiving mupirocin ointment USP, 2%.

In the second study, patients with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment USP, 2% three times daily or 30 to 40 mg/kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day (this was an unblinded study) for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric patients included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable patient populations were 100% for both test groups. There were no side effects reported in the group receiving mupirocin ointment.

Pediatrics -

There were 91 pediatric patients aged 2 months to 15 years in the first study described above. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second study described above, all patients were pediatric except two adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment USP, 2%. The age range of the pediatric patients was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for mupirocin ointment USP, 2% (n = 27) was 96%, and for erythromycin it was unchanged (78.5%).

### Nonparasitic splenic cysts: pathogenesis, classification, and treatment [^bf9b0609]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Nonparasitic splenic cysts (NPSCs) are uncommon lesions of the spleen, many being reported in anecdotal fashion. Early classifications of this disorder have been based on the presence or absence of an epithelial lining, indicating either a congenital or traumatic etiology. This criterion has led to confusion and mistaken reporting because the lining alone is not a reliable criterion.

Study Design

Over a 28-year period, the author has observed and studied 23 patients with NPSC. Special attention has been given to the role of trauma in the history, the nature (or absence) of a cyst lining, the gross pathology, and the preferred method of treatment.

Results

NPSC present as lesions with a very characteristic gross appearance and lining. The trabeculated interior can be lined with epidermoid, transitional, or mesothelial epithelium. Desquamation of the lining can lead to a spurious diagnosis, but careful search usually discloses the lining remnant. Although most NPSC in this series were treated by open partial splenectomy, the more recent approach by laparoscopic techniques offers great promise.

Conclusions

A new classification of NPSC is offered, based on characteristic gross findings. NPSC are of congenital origin, with a lining derived from mesothelium. Trauma does not play a primary role in pathogenesis. Cysts that are symptomatic or over 5 cm in diameter should be removed by partial splenectomy or near-total cystectomy "decapsulation", either by the open or laparoscopic approach.

### A systematic review of clinical features of intradiploic epidermoid cysts and strategies for patient management [^5a016bb9]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Intradiploic epidermoid cysts (IECs) are rare cystic calvarial lesions. Due to their rarity, there is a clinical need to aggregate the collective experience reported in the literature to characterize typical clinical features, clinical predictors of patient outcomes, and management strategies used for this entity. Following PRISMA guidelines, 127 patients from 94 studies (77 case reports, 17 case series) were included with individual patient data. Clinical data on demographics, clinical presentation, imaging features, management approaches, and outcomes were characterized, and predictors of outcome were evaluated. The cohort had a median age of 44 years (range = 18–81). Common presenting clinical features included headache (50%) and a palpable mass (48%), with half reporting antecedent head trauma. Lesions most frequently involved the occipital (28%), frontal (26%), and parietal bones (15%), with 13% localizing to multiple bones of the calvarium. Surgical resection was performed in all but one case, achieving a gross total resection (GTR) in 92% and complete cyst capsule removal in 87%. The rate of recurrence was significantly lower in those who received a GTR versus a subtotal resection (4% vs. 57%, p < 0.001) and in cases where the capsule was completely versus incompletely removed (2% vs. 66%, p < 0.001). IECs should be suspected in patients presenting with headaches or palpable skull masses with osteolytic non-enhancing and diffusion-restricting T2 hyperintense calvarial lesions. Complete surgical excision with total cyst capsule removal is the goal for IEC management. Close long-term monitoring remains essential, particularly in lesions that have been subtotally resected.

### Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis [^7b0a877b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as, not only an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer people with cystic fibrosis with a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including P aeruginosa) or increased adverse effects from drugs, or both.

Search Methods

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE, clinical trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN Registry), handsearching article reference lists and through contact with experts in the field. Date of the last search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 27 July 2017. Ongoing trials registries were last searched: 07 August 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials with the primary aim of eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently assessed all search results for eligibility. They used the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

The review includes two trials with a total of 106 participants with MRSA infection. In both trials the active treatment was oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin; however, one trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. In both trials the control arm was observation only. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with CF as an outcome; however, the definition used for MRSA eradication differed. The first trial (n = 45) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that, when compared to control, oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures, odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence); however, by day 168 of follow-up there was no difference in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative in either treatment arm, OR 1.17 (95% CI 0.31 to 4.42) (low-quality evidence). In the second trial, successful eradication was defined as the absence of MRSA following treatment (oral co-trimoxazole and rifampicin with intranasal mupirocin or observation) in at least three cultures over a period of six months. At the time of reporting, 40 out of 61 participants had completed follow-up, but results showed no difference between groups. Eradication was achieved in 12 out 29 participants (41%) receiving active treatment, and in 9 out of 32 participants (28%) on the observation arm, OR 1.80 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.25) (very low-quality evidence). With regards to this review's secondary outcomes, these were reported in the first trial only. The trial reports that no differences were observed between the two arms in terms of pulmonary exacerbations (from screening to day 28), nasal colonisation, lung function, weight or participant-reported outcomes. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control, rate ratio 0.22 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.72) (P = 0.0102).

Authors' Conclusions

Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, by six months, the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative did not differ between treatment arms in either trial. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care, remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design and unclear detail reported in one trial. Based on the available evidence, it is the opinion of the authors that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

For topical therapy, "Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high)". For systemic therapy, "Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high)", and "dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended", while "When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate)". Additionally, "Systemic antimicrobials should be used for infections during outbreaks of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis to help eliminate nephritogenic strains of S. pyogenes from the community (strong, moderate)".

### A rare case of a subungual epidermoid cyst treated by surgical excision maintaining maximal functionality [^f982c115]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Some typical but nonspecific clinical manifestations of benign or malignant tumors of the subungual nail unit are tenderness of the nail plate, increased sensation of pain, slow nail growth, dyspigmentation, and nail dystrophy up to partial or complete nail loss. Differential diagnoses of tumors of the subungual nail unit can be classified into benign solid tumors, such as glomus tumor, keratoacanthoma, hemangioma, subungual exostosis, and soft tissue chondroma; benign cystic tumors, such as epidermoid cysts and mucoid cysts; and malignant tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Given the rarity of some of these lesions, clinical diagnosis can be difficult, and further diagnostic steps are necessary to rule out slowly growing malignant tumors of the nail unit.

Physical examination and radiological imaging are noninvasive tools for more accurate differentiation between benign and malignant tumors of the nail bed. High-resolution ultrasonography with color doppler and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful to rule out vascularity or bone involvement in subungual tumors.

If a tumor of unknown origin is suspected, it is necessary to obtain tissue for histologic examination. Even if the origin is suspected to be benign, surgery is usually needed because of pain or functional limitations. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nail unit, combined with minimally invasive techniques, will help to avoid permanent damage, ranging from dystrophic growth to complete nail loss.

### Mupirocin [^d3b1e8c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mupirocin TOP (also known as Bactroban, Bactroban Nasal, Centany, Pirnuo):
- **Anaphylaxis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and generalized rash, have been reported with mupirocin.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including mupirocin, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Ethylene glycol poisoning**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as mupirocin ointment can contain polyethylene glycol, which can be absorbed from open wounds and damaged skin. Do not use in conditions where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible, especially in the presence of moderate or severe renal impairment.
- **Skin irritation**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as severe local irritation may occur.
- **Superinfection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as prolonged use may lead to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.

### Female genital mutilation: what every American dermatologist needs to know [^6b2a116f]. Dermatologic Clinics (2011). Low credibility.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) has become more common in the United States with increased immigration to the United States of individuals from areas where the practice is endemic. Although the root causes of FGM may be multiple, the practice is banned in the United States on all women under age 18 and is increasingly being outlawed by individual state legislatures. American dermatologists should expect to see a growing number of patients having undergone FGM who may present with complications ranging from keloids and epidermal cysts to clitoral neuromas and abscess formation. While treatment of such complications is often elusive and unsuccessful, recognition of the practice may prevent future patient abuse and death. The eradication of FGM will require the concerted efforts of many individuals, both within and outside of the health care field, with dermatologists poised to play a crucial role in diagnosis and management in the near future.

### Safely and effectively. see full prescribing information for… [^e73f8207]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer RNA synthetase. Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration. Mupirocin is highly protein bound and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mupirocin has not been determined. Cross Resistance Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial Activity Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes, both in vitro and in clinical trials. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in 2 trials.

In the first, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or vehicle placebo 3 times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 71% for mupirocin ointment and 35% for vehicle placebo. In the second trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment 3 times daily or 30 to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day for 8 days. There was a follow-up visit 1 week after treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations were 93% for mupirocin ointment and 78. 5% for erythromycin. Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups. What is Mupirocin Ointment USP, 2%.

Mupirocin Ointment USP, 2% is a prescription medicine used on the skin to treat a skin infection called impetigo that is caused by bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.

### What is hiding in the hindgut sac? Looking beyond rectal carcinoma [^b1501a58]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Developmental retro-rectal cysts

Developmental cysts are benign epithelial cysts in the retro-rectal space, arising from caudal embryonic vestiges. Often these are incidentally detected in middle-aged women. Developmentally these are sub-typed in to epidermoid cysts, dermoid cysts, enteric cysts and neuroenteric cysts. These cysts, when large, can create a mass effect on the rectum and can indent the rectum mimicking sub-mucosal mass.

Enteric cysts are most frequent among these and are lined with enteric mucosa. It includes retro-rectal cystic hamartoma (RRCH), also known as tail gut cyst and rectal duplication cyst. Enteric cysts typically are unilocular or multilocular lesions that are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 without internal enhancement (Fig. 1). RRCH is often multiloculated and may have a small peripheral cyst with honeycomb appearance, which is an important differentiating feature from the other types of developmental cysts. Rectal duplication cysts are different from RRCH in that they have muscular layer and the only lesion in contiguity or continuity with the rectum. They can be associated with genitourinary anomalies.

Fig. 1
Retrorectal or tailgut cyst in a 42-year-old woman. a Sagittal T2-weighted MRI reveals unilocular cystic lesion (arrow) in the retrorectal location. b Sagittal T1-weighted MRI image reveals the lesion (arrow) to be hypointense. c Axial T2-weighted MRI again demonstrates the cystic lesion (arrow)

Neuroenteric cysts are differentiated from other cysts only on histology and are indistinguishable on imaging. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and they have classical features as in any other body location. Epidermoid cysts are unilocular with thin wall and clear fluid. Tiny discrete and linear T2 hypointense areas suggesting keratin and diffusion restriction is characteristic of epidermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts contain fat with skin appendages, such as tooth buds, sweat glands and hair follicles. Fat suppression MRI is helpful in confirming the dermoid cyst and can show diffusion restriction.

Role of MRI is to locate the cysts in relation to the rectal wall, its continuity with rectal lumen and assess complications. Complications of developmental cysts include infection, haemorrhage, fistula formation and malignant degeneration. High signal on T1-weighted images can be due to mucus, proteinaceous material, haemorrhage or fat. Low-signal areas on T2-weighted images can be due to haemorrhage and aggregates of keratin. Mural nodularity, asymmetric wall thickening and enhancement suggest malignant change.

### Epidermal cyst causing facial asymmetry [^000e5a7b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Epidermoid cysts are rare benign tumors that are derived from the development of abnormally situated ectodermal tissue and are often an incidental finding. They are usually diagnosed between 15 and 50 years of age, with both sexes equally affected. In epidermoid cyst management, complete excision is the therapy of choice. The authors reported a case of a 24-year-old man with an epidermoid cyst located on the left side of the face, on the region of mandibular body, which was treated by complete surgical excision. The patient has been followed up for 2 years without signs of recurrence.

CONCLUSIONS

Although epidermoid and dermoid cysts are rare, they can present in a variety of craniofacial locations. Classification by location is helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Despite benign pathology, epidermoid and dermoid cysts can invade adjacent structures. Clinical features of the cysts according to anatomic location should be considered. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions in the craniofacial region.

### Repeated aspiration and sclerotherapy to manage recurrent spinal epidermoid cyst [^09474982]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Spinal epidermoid cysts are rare lesions and epidermoid cyst in intramedullary location is even rarer. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment; however, in cases of recurrence, repeat surgery becomes quite difficult. Treatment of recurrent intramedullary epidermoid cyst by surgery alone is a challenge. We managed one such rare case with repeated aspiration and sclerotherapy. Here, we have highlighted hypertonic saline sclerotherapy as a promising tool to treat recurrent spinal epidermoid cysts.

### A rare case of a subungual epidermoid cyst treated by surgical excision maintaining maximal functionality [^985682f3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig 2
With a right-handed and left-handed scissors and the flat part of the scissors always facing toward the middle, the middle third of the thumbnail is cut and lifted up so that the matrix becomes visible. A small arcuate incision in the matrix is used to extirpate the tumor. Then the incision is closed with 1 or 2 single button sutures. The nail is then repositioned, and a cyanoacrylate adhesive on top seals the incision in the nail.

Light microscopy revealed fragments of a cyst with epithelium, showing a granular cell layer toward the interior compact orthokeratotic horn (Fig 3). The dermis showed extended infiltrates dominated by multinuclear giant cells containing phagocytized keratin. This confirmed the diagnosis of an (irritated) epidermoid cyst, with granulomatous foreign body reaction, after previous rupture, and no indication of malignancy.

### Endoscope-controlled microneurosurgery to treat middle fossa epidermoid cysts: technical case report [^0aa85c83]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To present an alternative technique of endoscope-controlled microneurosurgery for the treatment of middle fossa epidermoid cysts.

Methods

The three operations described were performed through an approximately 2-cm diameter temporal craniotomy after a straight skin incision was made. Resection was then performed under the magnification of a 30-degree rigid endoscope, which mandated the use of exclusively conventional microsurgical instruments.

Results

Total resection was accomplished in all three patients with large middle fossa epidermoid cysts through a small temporal corticectomy, without damage to neurovascular structures.

Conclusion

This procedure allowed the association of a smaller craniotomy, better cosmetic results, and minor retraction of the brain to wide resection of the tumor and satisfactory functional outcomes.

### Epidermoid cyst of the brainstem in children: case-based update [^6122860c]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Epidermoid cysts are rare, slow growing, space-occupying lesions of early adulthood. Among the various locations, involvement of the brainstem is quite exceptional. In children, these tumors are extremely uncommon; only 4 purely intrinsic brainstem epidermoids are reported in the literature. The pathogenesis of true intraaxial brainstem epidermoid is unclear and is usually not considered in the preoperative differential diagnosis of brainstem tumors. We report 2 additional cases of brainstem epidermoid cysts occurring in children, underlining their clinical characteristics, the difficulties faced in the diagnostic work-up, and the surgical treatment adopted. These tumors pose a surgical challenge and attempts at aggressive removal of the cyst wall are fraught with increased risks of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, cases treated more conservatively show good or excellent results with minimal complications. Neurosurgical judgment at the time of surgery is warranted to ensure maximum resection while minimizing postoperative neurologic deficits.

### Interdigital pilonidal cyst and its clinical and ultrasonographic aspects [^8a3ca6a9]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

The interdigital pilonidal cyst should be considered alongside other cystic skin lesions, such as epidermoid cysts, subcutaneous abscesses, and foreign body granulomas. These conditions share clinical features, however they can have differing ultrasonographic findings. Epidermoid cysts, for example, appear as well-defined, oval or round structures in the superficial subcutaneous tissue, often showing posterior acoustic enhancement and internal echogenicity due to keratin and cholesterol. Subcutaneous abscesses typically present with thickened walls and increased peripheral vascularity, while foreign body granulomas often have thick, avascular walls with echogenic material. Ultrasonography can aid in accurate diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of these entities.

Total excision of the sinus tissue is considered the most effective treatment method, and prevention is the most efficient way to avoid the disease and its recurrence, as performed in this case. Prevention involves proper hygiene routine, including hand cleaning and drying, glove use, and removal of any hairs that may penetrate the skin during work.

### Infectious diseases associated with organized sports and outbreak control [^e8d1113f]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus skin infections — management and decolonization — are addressed as follows: skin abscesses are "best managed by incision and drainage", with antibiotic selection guided by local susceptibility; pediatric use notes that "Doxycycline can be used safely in children ages 2 years and older when given for durations less than 2 weeks", and "Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used as a single agent in the initial treatment of cellulitis". For impetigo, "Topical mupirocin may be used for localized and nonbullous impetigo". During outbreaks, decolonization attempts "may be accomplished by use of topical nasal mupirocin therapy (twice daily for 5–7 days)", but resistance has been observed with "low-level (minimum inhibitory concentration, 8–256 μg/mL) and high-level (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 512 μg/mL) resistance", and "High-level resistance has been associated with subsequent failure of decolonization".

### Testicular epidermoid cysts: a reevaluation [^f3e6c5a1]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Testicular epidermoid cysts may occur in two different forms, the benign subtype, called "simple TEC", clinically, and the other subtype representing an epidermoid cyst that occurs in association with invasive germ cell tumours (GCNIS), called the "complex TEC", clinically. Urologic surgeons must be aware of the second type because conservative surgery would be inappropriate in these cases.

### Intraspinal epidermoid cyst successfully treated with radiotherapy: case report [^c100ad56]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Epidermoid cysts are benign lesions that account for 0.7% of all intraspinal tumors. Standard treatment is complete resection. The recurrence rate after surgery cannot be estimated from the scarce literature, but it has been acknowledged that, in some patients, curative surgery may be impossible and temporary relief of symptoms is the only aim.

Clinical Presentation

In 1996, a 59-year-old woman presented with a 30-year history of a spinal epidermoid cyst, for which she had previously undergone eight operations. Spastic paraplegia of the lower limbs had been present from initial diagnosis, and the neurological level had moved upward to C6. At the time of presentation, paresthesia in her arms and hands had developed. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed typical sequelae of previous surgery and a fibrotic region starting at the level of C5-C6 with formation of a cyst that extended to the conus terminalis. The spinal cord could not be visualized caudally at C7.

Intervention

Because both patient and surgeons did not want further surgical interventions that might comprise upper limb function, radiotherapy was performed. A dose of 46 Gy was delivered to the cervicothoracic spine (C4-T1) by opposing anteroposterior high-energy photon beams. The treatment was well tolerated, and after treatment, the patient's clinical symptoms improved slightly, without evolution on magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusion

Irradiation was effective in stabilizing the patient's disease. Although radiotherapy is not established in the treatment of epidermoid cysts, it should be considered as an alternative to palliative surgery and in patients who cannot undergo operations.

### The metastatic dissemination of a squamous cell carcinoma arising from an epidermal cyst and subsequent failure to respond to programmed death 1 inhibition [^6ec022a4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case demonstrates the rare clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings of an aggressive SCC arising from a ruptured epidermal inclusion cyst, and it is the first report, to our knowledge, documenting the use of PD-1 inhibition in this unusual disease state.

The pathologic findings of these cases often depict carcinoma arising within the chronic inflammatory environment of an inclusion cyst. This inflammatory, immunosuppressive environment likely creates a favorable milieu for malignant growth. Although complete surgical resection is often curative, this case highlights the potential for rapid local progression of these lesions as well as distant metastasis. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration–approved regimens for unresectable cutaneous SCC, including those arising from an epidermoid cyst. However, recent data demonstrates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic cutaneous SCC. In this phase I/II study, patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC received intravenous cemiplimab, a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1. The duration of treatment was up to 48 weeks in the phase I study and up to 96 weeks in the phase II study or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. In the metastatic disease cohort of the phase II study, a response was observed in 28 of 59 patients (47%; 95% confidence interval, 34 to 61) with 57% of patients experiencing a durable response of ≥ 6 months. Based on these data, and lack of alternative approved treatment options, this patient was started on first-line off-label PD-1 inhibition with pembrolizumab. However, after 4 cycles of therapy, scans found disease progression.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^dc9daeaa]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Patients commonly present with cosmetic concerns or symptoms related to compression of surrounding tissue. A single incision or punch excision will generally allow manual expression of the lipoma without difficulty when standard excision is not required.
12. There is long-standing controversy over whether keratoacanthomas are benign, spontaneously self-limited tumors or a variant of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that have the potential for metastasis. 17 Pyogenic granulomas are yellow to purplish, pulpy vascular lesions often surrounded by a scaly collarette. They are usually removed because of their rapid growth and tendency to bleed. The differential diagnosis includes Spitz nevi, amelanotic melanoma, and squamous or basal cell carcinoma. Treatment options include shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base, and laser ablation 18. Epidermal Inclusion Cysts Epidermal inclusion cysts are the most common type of cutaneous cyst.

They are discrete nodules resulting from the implantation and proliferation of epidermal elements within the dermis. However, they display no sebaceous component and are not truly sebaceous cysts. They typically present on the head, neck, or trunk, and may remain stable or enlarge over time. 22 Diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cysts is based on appearance and palpation of a discrete, freely movable cyst or nodule. Careful inspection often reveals a central punctum. Treatment is unnecessary unless desired by the patient, and can be accomplished via simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Inflamed or ruptured cysts often resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur. Intralesional steroid injections can hasten resolution of inflamed cysts and should be followed by interval excision.
23. Seborrheic keratoses generally do not require treatment unless they become irritated or the patient has cosmetic concerns.

They may be treated with electrodesiccation, laser ablation, curettage, cryosurgery, or shave excision if biopsy is required. They can be treated effectively with electrodesiccation or laser ablation.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline: reconstruction after skin cancer resection [^3f9db737]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Skin cancer reconstruction — evidence on prophylaxis and decolonization: One randomized controlled trial that compared the utility of 2 g of cephalexin to placebo delivered 1 hour before flap or graft reconstructions of the nose or ear found that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of surgical-site infections but not of tissue necrosis nor wound dehiscence. A randomized study of 203 Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers found that decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlor- hexidine body wash before skin cancer excision did not reduce the rate of surgical-site infections after reconstruction.

What are the possible side effects of mupirocin ointment?

Mupirocin ointment may cause serious side effects, including:

severe allergic reactions. Stop using mupirocin ointment and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of a severe allergic reaction:
hives
trouble breathing or wheezing
swelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue
dizziness, fast heartbeat, or pounding in your chest
a rash over your whole body
eye irritation. Do not get mupirocin ointment in your eyes. If mupirocin ointment gets in your eyes, rinse your eyes well with water.
irritation in the area mupirocin ointment is used. Stop using mupirocin ointment and call your healthcare provider if you develop an irritation, severe itching, or a rash while using mupirocin ointment.
a type of diarrhea called clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD). CDAD may happen in people who use or have used medicine to treat bacterial infections. The severity of CDAD can range from mild diarrhea to severe diarrhea that may cause death (fatal colitis). Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room right away if you have diarrhea while using or after you stop using mupirocin ointment.
risk of absorption of polyethylene glycol through the skin. Mupirocin ointment contains polyethylene glycol, which in large amounts can cause kidney damage. You should not apply mupirocin ointment to open skin wounds or damaged skin, especially if you have kidney problems.
increased risk of infection at IV (intravenous) sites. Mupirocin ointment should not be used on skin that is near an IV (intravenous) site

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^6f5804ea]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — pre-operative skin preparations — describes benefits, harms, and specific cautions: the potential benefit of pre-operative skin preparations is prevention of surgical site and deep infection, whereas potential harms include skin reactions or allergies (including anaphylaxis), mupirocin resistance, and microbiome disturbances. Alcohol-based solutions should not be used on neonates or come into contact with mucosa or eyes, and caution should be exercised because of their flammable nature. CHG solutions can cause skin irritation and must not be allowed to come into contact with the brain, meninges, eye, or middle ear. Alcohol based antiseptics are not recommended for open wounds or those with related allergy.

### Mupirocin ointment for preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections in nasal carriers [^40fdf64f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading nosocomial (hospital acquired) pathogen in hospitals throughout the world. Traditionally, control of S. aureus has been focused on preventing cross-infection between patients, however, it has been shown repeatedly that a large proportion of nosocomial S. aureus infections originate from the patient's own flora. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is now considered a well defined risk factor for subsequent infection in various groups of patients. Local antibiotic treatment with mupirocin ointment is often used to eradicate nasal S. aureus.

Objectives

To determine whether the use of mupirocin nasal ointment in patients with identified S. aureus nasal carriage reduced S. aureus infection rates.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (May 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008) and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). To identify unpublished trials, abstract books from major scientific meetings (ICAAC, ESCMID and SHEA) were handsearched, researchers and manufacturers of mupirocin were contacted and other electronic databases were searched (SIGLE, ASLIB Index, mRCT, USA Clinical Trials).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal mupirocin with no treatment or placebo or alternative nasal treatment in the prevention of S. aureus infections in nasal S. aureus carriers were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Titles, abstracts and full-text articles of studies retrieved from the search process were independently assessed by two authors for inclusion. From included studies a data extraction form was made and the quality of the trial was assessed. The primary outcome was the S. aureus infection rate (any site). Secondary outcomes were time to infection, mortality, adverse events and infection rate caused by micro-organisms other than S. aureus.

Main Results

Nine RCTs involving 3396 participants met the inclusion criteria. Patient populations varied and several types of nosocomial S. aureus infection were described including bacteraemia, exit-site infections, peritonitis, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, surgical site infections (SSI) and urinary tract infections. After pooling the eight studies that compared mupirocin with placebo or with no treatment, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of S. aureus infection associated with intranasal mupirocin (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70). A planned subgroup analysis of surgical trials demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of nosocomial S. aureus infection rate associated with mupirocin use (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89) however this effect disappeared if the analysis only included surgical site infections caused by S. aureus (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.04), possibly due to a lack of power. The infection rate caused by micro-organisms other than S. aureus was significantly higher in patients treated with mupirocin compared with control patients (RR 1.38 95% CI 1.118 to 1.72).

Authors' Conclusions

In people who are nasal carriers of S. aureus, the use of mupirocin ointment results in a statistically significant reduction in S. aureus infections.
