## Question

Administration of bumex nursing consideration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nursing considerations for administering bumetanide (Bumex). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the medication's identity, pharmacology, and potency. Then, I should verify labeled indications and contraindications. Next, I will review dosing principles and routes, including special populations. After that, I need to examine monitoring priorities and adverse effects. Then, I should confirm drug interactions and safety precautions. Finally, I will integrate patient education and documentation requirements, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the medication identity and core pharmacology. Bumetanide is a potent loop diuretic that inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb, producing rapid natriuresis and diuresis with onset within minutes IV and 30–60 minutes orally, peaking at 15–30 minutes IV and 1–2 hours orally, with a short duration of 4–6 hours, which explains the need for divided dosing in many cases [^5e24016d] [^a748a8d2]. I should double-check potency: 1 mg bumetanide is approximately equivalent to 40 mg furosemide, which is crucial for dose conversions and safety thresholds [^5e24016d] [^ecf9008b].

> Next, I should review labeled indications and contraindications. Bumetanide is indicated for edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic disease, and renal disease including nephrotic syndrome; it is contraindicated in anuria, hepatic coma, and states of severe electrolyte depletion, and should be avoided in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, with caution in sulfonamide allergy due to potential cross-reactivity [^4833929a] [^8b328e6c] [^31fb88df] [^713942bd]. Hold on, I should verify hepatic cautions: use low starting doses and titrate slowly in cirrhosis, and avoid use in hepatic coma, given the risk of precipitating encephalopathy with rapid electrolyte shifts [^fe959bfc] [^27447deb].

> I will now examine dosing principles and routes. For oral therapy, typical total daily doses are 0.5–2 mg, often as a single dose, with the option to repeat every 4–5 hours to a maximum of 10 mg/day; intermittent schedules (e.g., 3–4 days on, 1–2 days off) are recommended to mitigate electrolyte losses and nephron adaptation [^7d0843e0]. For IV therapy, 0.5–4 mg boluses every 8–12 hours or continuous infusion 0.5–2 mg/hour are standard, with transition to oral therapy as soon as feasible; higher bolus doses may be used in monitored settings, but I need to ensure we stay within evidence-based ranges and monitor closely for adverse effects [^9629d4d6] [^42882be1]. Wait, let me verify pediatric and neonatal contexts: neonatal dosing has been studied at 0.005–0.1 mg/kg, with maximal diuretic effect around 0.035–0.040 mg/kg, but this remains investigational and requires specialist oversight given ototoxicity risk and limited evidence [^a2becc27] [^ba3fb82c].

> Let me consider special populations and adjustments. In chronic kidney disease or dialysis, no routine dose adjustment is required, but I should confirm residual kidney function and urine output because diuretic responsiveness depends on delivery to the nephron; in anuric patients, loop diuretics are ineffective and should be avoided [^aa6d54db] [^7f524b6a] [^e4ef6c25]. In hepatic cirrhosis, start low and go slow to avoid encephalopathy, and consider spironolactone to mitigate hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis; in older adults, clearance is reduced and sensitivity to volume shifts is higher, so I should use lower initial doses and monitor orthostatic vitals frequently [^fe959bfc] [^a2becc27]. For pregnancy, bumetanide is Category C; use only if benefits outweigh risks, with close maternal-fetal monitoring [^61158f4f].

> Next, I should review monitoring priorities and adverse effects. I need to ensure strict intake and output tracking, daily weights, and frequent electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO₃−, Mg, Ca), BUN/creatinine, and glucose during initiation and titration, with heightened vigilance in older adults and those with CKD or liver disease [^notfound]. Very common effects include hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, dehydration, hyperuricemia, and increased BUN; serious risks include ototoxicity (especially with high-dose IV or renal impairment), orthostatic hypotension, and rare thrombocytopenia, so I should confirm baseline hearing when feasible and reassess if tinnitus or hearing changes occur [^cb3f25ca] [^cda66020] [^cfbf2e71] [^8927b837] [^28f2ae89]. Hold on, I should verify ototoxicity guidance: avoid rapid high-dose IV pushes, coadministration with aminoglycosides, and use caution in renal impairment; ototoxicity is generally reversible if recognized early and the drug is stopped [^dbd8f732] [^acf99f83].

> I need to check drug interactions and safety precautions. Concurrent aminoglycosides increase ototoxic risk and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary; NSAIDs like indomethacin blunt natriuresis and should be avoided; probenecid antagonizes bumetanide secretion and effect and should not be coadministered; lithium clearance is reduced and toxicity risk rises, so lithium should generally be avoided with bumetanide; bumetanide may potentiate antihypertensives, so I should anticipate dose reductions and monitor blood pressure closely [^dbd8f732] [^f3f9f134]. But wait, what if the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor? Dapagliflozin can enhance hypokalemia with bumetanide, so I should monitor potassium more frequently and adjust supplementation as needed [^65d7055e].

> Let me think about patient education and practical nursing actions. I should teach patients to weigh themselves daily at the same time, track strict I&O, recognize signs of hypokalemia (muscle cramps, weakness, palpitations), and report dizziness or hearing changes promptly; I should also advise timing doses to avoid nocturia and coordinate with the pharmacy for potassium supplements or potassium-sparing agents when indicated [^notfound]. I should confirm fall-risk mitigation: rise slowly from supine or seated positions, use assistive devices as needed, and ensure home environments are safe given orthostatic hypotension risk, especially in older adults [^713942bd].

> I should double-check documentation requirements. I need to record baseline vitals, weight, edema assessment, lung sounds, and neurologic status; document dose, route, and time of administration; and chart electrolytes, renal function, and glucose results with clinical interpretation and any interventions (e.g., potassium replacement, dose holds, or physician notification) [^notfound]. If I observe oliguria, rising creatinine, or new tinnitus, I should escalate promptly and hold therapy pending evaluation, aligning with contraindication and warning language in the label [^8b328e6c] [^28f2ae89].

> Finally, let me synthesize the key nursing considerations succinctly. Bumetanide is a high-potency, short-acting loop diuretic requiring individualized dosing, vigilant monitoring of volume status, renal function, and electrolytes, and proactive prevention of hypokalemia and hypotension; use the lowest effective dose, avoid high-dose IV pushes, and transition to oral therapy promptly, with special caution in hepatic cirrhosis, CKD, older adults, and when interacting drugs are present; educate patients on self-monitoring and red flags, and maintain meticulous documentation to ensure safe, effective decongestion while minimizing adverse effects [^7d0843e0] [^b252c856] [^9629d4d6] [^4b55320a].

---

Administering bumetanide (Bumex) requires **careful monitoring** of electrolytes, renal function, and volume status due to risks of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and dehydration [^28f2ae89]. Nurses should confirm the correct dose and route, **administer IV doses slowly** over 1–2 minutes, and monitor for ototoxicity, especially with high doses or renal impairment [^cfbf2e71]. Assess for allergies to sulfonamides, monitor for orthostatic hypotension, and educate patients on signs of electrolyte imbalance and when to seek care [^713942bd]. Document intake/output, daily weights, and adverse effects to guide safe, effective therapy [^notfound].

---

## Pre-administration nursing considerations

### Patient assessment

- **Indication and appropriateness**: Confirm the indication (edema from heart failure, renal, hepatic disease, or nephrotic syndrome) and ensure the dose is appropriate for the patient's condition and renal function [^4833929a].

- **Contraindications**: Screen for contraindications, including anuria, hepatic coma, severe electrolyte depletion, or hypersensitivity to bumetanide or sulfonamides [^8b328e6c].

- **Baseline vital signs and weight**: Record baseline vital signs, weight, and edema assessment to monitor response and detect adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte and renal function**: Review baseline electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium), renal function (BUN, creatinine), and glucose, as bumetanide can cause significant electrolyte disturbances and renal effects [^cb3f25ca].

---

### Medication preparation and verification

- **Dose verification**: Confirm the prescribed dose and route; typical oral doses are 0.5–2 mg once daily, with a maximum of 10 mg/day; IV doses are usually 0.5–1 mg, repeated as needed based on response [^7d0843e0].

- **Dilution and compatibility**: For IV administration, dilute to a concentration of 0.5–1 mg/mL in normal saline or dextrose 5% in water; avoid mixing with other medications in the same syringe or infusion bag.

- **Expiration and integrity**: Check the medication's expiration date and inspect for discoloration or particulates before administration.

---

## Administration techniques

### Oral administration

Oral tablets should be **swallowed whole with water**; they can be taken with or without food, though taking them consistently with respect to meals helps maintain stable absorption.

---

### Intravenous administration

- **Injection technique**: Administer IV bumetanide slowly over 1–2 minutes to minimize the risk of ototoxicity and other adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Infusion pumps**: If using an infusion pump, program the pump accurately and monitor for leaks or malfunctions during administration.

- **Site care**: Rotate IV sites regularly to prevent phlebitis and infiltration; monitor the site for redness, swelling, or pain.

---

## Monitoring during and after administration

### Clinical monitoring

- **Vital signs**: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate frequently during and after IV administration due to the risk of hypotension and orthostatic changes [^713942bd].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Check electrolytes within 2–4 hours after IV administration and periodically during therapy, especially potassium, sodium, and calcium [^notfound].

- **Renal function**: Monitor BUN and creatinine regularly, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving high doses [^c99de932].

- **Fluid balance**: Strictly monitor intake and output, and document daily weights to assess diuretic response and detect dehydration or over-diuresis [^notfound].

---

### Adverse effects monitoring

- **Hypokalemia**: Watch for muscle cramps, weakness, arrhythmias, and ECG changes; hypokalemia is a common and potentially serious adverse effect [^28f2ae89].

- **Hyponatremia**: Monitor for confusion, lethargy, seizures, and other neurologic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Ototoxicity**: Assess for hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo, particularly with high IV doses or in patients with renal impairment [^cfbf2e71].

- **Allergic reactions**: Be alert for rash, pruritus, and anaphylaxis, especially in patients with sulfonamide allergies [^713942bd].

---

## Patient education

- **Purpose and expectations**: Explain the reason for bumetanide, expected diuretic effects, and the importance of adherence to therapy [^b252c856].

- **Signs of electrolyte imbalance**: Educate patients on symptoms of hypokalemia (muscle cramps, weakness), hyponatremia (confusion, headache), and dehydration (dizziness, dry mouth) [^f17b346a].

- **Activity and safety**: Advise patients to rise slowly from lying or sitting positions to prevent orthostatic hypotension and to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if they experience dizziness [^713942bd].

- **Dietary considerations**: Encourage a diet low in sodium and provide guidance on potassium-rich foods or supplements if needed [^923ebfe4].

---

## Documentation

Record the **date, time, dose, route, and site** of administration, along with the patient's response and any adverse effects observed. Also document pre- and post-administration vital signs, weight, and fluid balance, and note any patient education provided and the patient's understanding.

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Use caution due to increased risk of electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, and orthostatic hypotension; consider lower initial doses and closer monitoring [^a2becc27].

- **Patients with renal impairment**: Adjust dosing based on renal function and monitor closely for electrolyte disturbances and ototoxicity [^c99de932].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Use caution and monitor closely for electrolyte disturbances and hepatic encephalopathy [^fe959bfc].

---

Administering bumetanide requires **careful preparation, slow IV administration, and vigilant monitoring** of electrolytes, renal function, and volume status. Patient education and thorough documentation are essential to ensure safe and effective therapy.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Individualize dosage with careful monitoring of patient response.

Oral Administration

The usual total daily dosage of Bumex tablets is 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.

If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex tablets is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex tablets are given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, keep the dosage to a minimum.

Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide in proportion to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.

Parenteral Administration

Bumetanide injection may be administered parenterally (intravenously and intramuscularly) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical.

Terminate parenteral treatment and institute oral treatment as soon as possible.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^a2becc27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The degree of protein binding of bumetanide in cord sera from healthy neonates was approximately 97%, suggesting the potential for bilirubin displacement. A study using pooled sera from critically ill neonates found that bumetanide at concentrations of 0.5 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL, but not 0.25 μg/mL, caused a linear increase in unbound bilirubin concentrations.

In 56 infants aged 4 days to 6 months, bumetanide doses ranging from 0.005 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg were studied for pharmacodynamic effect. Peak bumetanide excretion rates increased linearly with increasing doses of drug. Maximal diuretic effect was observed at a bumetanide excretion rate of about 7 μg/kg/h, corresponding to doses of 0.035 mg/kg to 0.040 mg/kg. Higher doses produced a higher bumetanide excretion rate but no increase in diuretic effect. Urine flow rate peaked during the first hour after drug administration in 80% of patients and by 3 hours in all patients.

Geriatric Pharmacology

In a group of ten geriatric subjects between the ages of 65 and 73 years, total bumetanide clearance was significantly lower (1.8 ± 0.3 mL/min·kg) compared with younger subjects (2.9 ± 0.2 mL/min·kg) after a single oral bumetanide 0.5 mg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations were higher in geriatric subjects (16.9 ± 1.8 ng/mL) compared with younger subjects (10.3 ± 1.5 ng/mL). Urine flow rate and total excretion of sodium and potassium were increased less in the geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects, although potassium excretion and fractional sodium excretion were similar between the two age groups. Nonrenal clearance, bioavailability, and volume of distribution were not significantly different between the two groups.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of Bumex should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of Bumex administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to Bumex.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

Almost equal diuretic response occurs after oral and parenteral administration of bumetanide. Therefore, if impaired gastrointestinal absorption is suspected or oral administration is not practical, bumetanide should be given by the intramuscular or intravenous route.

Successful treatment with bumetanide injection, USP following instances of allergic reactions to furosemide suggests a lack of cross-sensitivity.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Bumetanide is contraindicated in anuria. Although bumetanide can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with bumetanide. Bumetanide is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected. Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^5e24016d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Bumex is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg Bumex has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of Bumex action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumex inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH₂O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TCH₂O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by Bumex, and Bumex is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by Bumex, in a dose-related fashion.

Bumex may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during Bumex induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of Bumex by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumex does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumex decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Following oral administration of Bumex the onset of diuresis occurs in 30 to 60 minutes. Peak activity is reached between 1 and 2 hours. At usual doses (1 mg to 2 mg) diuresis is largely complete within 4 hours; with higher doses, the diuretic action lasts for 4 to 6 hours. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.

Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1½ hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.

Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled Bumex to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of Bumex amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.

Drug Interactions

Drugs with Ototoxic Potential (see WARNINGS)

Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.

Drugs with Nephrotoxic Potential

There has been no experience with the concurrent use of Bumex with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.

Lithium

Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as Bumex) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

Probenecid

Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by Bumex. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on Bumex natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with Bumex.

Indomethacin

Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during Bumex treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with Bumex is thus not recommended.

Antihypertensives

Bumex may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.

Digoxin

Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels.

Anticoagulants

Interaction studies in humans have shown Bumex to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility

Bumex was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in the presence or absence of an in vitro metabolic activation system. An 18-month study showed an increase in mammary adenomas of questionable significance in female rats receiving oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (2000 times a 2-mg human dose). A repeat study at the same doses failed to duplicate this finding.

Reproduction studies were performed to evaluate general reproductive performance and fertility in rats at oral dose levels of 10, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day. The pregnancy rate was slightly decreased in the treated animals; however, the differences were small and not statistically significant.

Loop diuretics in dialysis patients — Large doses of potent loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide) can be administered to promote loss of sodium and water, but therapy is effective only when RKF is high enough to provide daily urine output of at least 100 mL and its effectiveness may not last long. Loop diuretics should be used with caution because of the possibility of ototoxicity, with the incidence appearing greater with furosemide and much less with bumetanide or torsemide.

### Geriatric trauma management [^7cf42b91]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Geriatric trauma — cardiac assessment and fluid strategy emphasizes that when possible, obtain a prior or baseline ECG, echocardiogram, or cardiology notes to guide care, and consider noninvasive cardiac output monitoring or ultrasound to help assess volume status during an acute resuscitation. For patients cleared for physical mobilization, perform a straight leg-raise test to assess for fluid responsiveness; for patients with evidence of shock, obtain a new echocardiogram or even repeated echocardiograms during hospitalization to ensure that patients are not given too much fluid; and for patients with known or newly diagnosed structural abnormalities of the heart, use echocardiogram findings to determine a treatment strategy. After resuscitation, use noninvasive measures to monitor patients with poor cardiac output who are mobilizing fluids back into the intravascular space; for patients who are sensitive to large fluid shifts, consider continuous loop diuretic administration (e.g., furosemide or bumetanide) that is titrated to prevent large fluid shifts; add acetazolamide to those patients with acute heart failure that are at high risk for loop diuretic resistance; and for patients with oliguric renal failure, consider renal replacement therapy (RRT) for fluid removal. Patients at extremely high risk are those with severe heart failure, severe pulmonary artery disease, or a ventricular assist device, and consider transfer to a center with appropriate expertise if the facility is not experienced in caring for this population.

### Don't get BUM' D out: bumetanide may yet prove beneficial for neonatal seizures [^e533a09d]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

The study by Soul et aladds considerable important new information. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial was performed on neonates who already had established PHB-resistant electrographic seizures of any etiology. The infants were then randomized to additional PHB plus placebo (control group) vs additional PHB plus various doses of BUM (.1,.2, or.3 mg/kg). This add-on study design allowed comparison of PHB monotherapy (control group) directly with BUM exposure. Continuous electroencephalographic (cEEG) monitoring was used for seizure verification at baseline and during treatment. The investigators enrolled 16 neonates in the PHB plus placebo arm and 27 infants in the PHB plus BUM arm. The primary outcome measure was the pharmacokinetics and safety of BUM as add-on therapy to treat neonatal seizures, while the "exploratory endpoint" was the effect of dose and drug exposure on seizure burden. Seizure burden was defined as the minutes of seizure per hour of cEEG recording. Baseline cEEG was recorded for 2 hours prior to study dose administration, then for an additional 48 or more hours.

Study results are complicated, partly because BUM-randomized patients had a higher baseline seizure burden (by chance), prior to drug administration. On the other hand, this situation might be considered fortuitous, because any beneficial effect of BUM would then be even stronger evidence for its efficacy. Neonates in both arms of the study had similar demographics and side effect profiles, except that BUM-exposed babies had more diuresis, as expected. Though seizure burden was quite variable in both arms, the seizure burden both 0 to 4 hours after BUM exposure and 2 to 4 hours after BUM exposure, was decreased significantly in BUM-exposed babies, and the reduction of seizure burden was dose related. In regard to safety and pharmacokinetic issues, the primary endpoint, there was no excess hearing impairment attributed to BUM (only 2/26 survivors developed hearing loss and both received concurrent aminoglycosides).

F. Bumetanide — If furosemide is not available, bumetanide is an acceptable alternative; like furosemide, bumetanide requires delivery into the tubular fluid for access to its site of action. One milligram of bumetanide is equivalent to approximately 40 mg of furosemide.

### Specialist intervention is associated with improved patient outcomes in patients with decompensated heart failure: evaluation of the impact of a multidisciplinary inpatient heart failure team [^0c78d1ec]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

An interesting observation was that post-HFT patients received more intensive diuretic therapy. The HFT goal was always to relieve congestion using whatever dose or combination of diuretics was necessary, whereas it is our experience that general physicians use diuretics more cautiously, particularly in the setting of renal dysfunction. Such patients treated by HFT received more intravenous and higher doses of loop diuretics and were more likely to be treated with a combination of thiazide and loop diuretics. Although furosemide was the most frequently prescribed loop diuretic on discharge, a greater proportion of post-HFT patients received bumetanide, which has a more predictable bioavailability. Diuretic dose has been shown to predict mortality in HF; however, one study suggested that clinical stability may be more important than baseline diuretic dose. Reducing cardiac filling pressures in HF reduces sympathetic activation, and as such it is biologically plausible that using higher dose diuretics to achieve euvolaemia could improve outcome. Indeed freedom from congestion has been shown to predict survival in class IV patients.

The multidisciplinary nature of the HFT is also likely to be an important factor with different healthcare professionals complimenting one another. HF nurses are at the centre of the HFT and are key to many aspects of care previously shown to improve outcome, including education and improved patient self-care, follow-up monitoring and access to specialised HF clinics.

We did not observe a reduction in readmissions seen as a result of multidisciplinary team care in previous studies. This difference may be a result of our HFT focusing on inpatient care and the first 2 weeks following discharge; community HFTs were available to manage HF patients postdischarge in both cohorts. Also relevant is the fact that by markedly reducing inpatient mortality in our HFT cohort, many sicker patients survived to discharge. In this context maintaining the same level of HF readmissions could be considered a success.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals, bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^38e5275d]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^663332f1]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Since common electrolyte disturbances could be encountered during diuretic therapy, it is important to monitor electrolytes levels and also to assess acid-based status. In order to avoid hypokalemia, administration of oral potassium it is easy. Measuring urinary potassium concentration and calculating the daily losses of potassium, which require replacement is a strategy that can be used to estimate daily potassium requirements. Another strategy is the use of potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. Hypomagnesemia is frequently found during diuretic therapy, magnesium replacement can be achieved either intravenously or orally, typically with 20–30 mmoL per day. Finally in some patients, chloride losses exceed sodium losses and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis develops; this is usually corrected with the administration of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride.

A recent comprehensive review have shown that torsemide and bumetanide have more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles than furosemide, and in the case of torsemide it could be more efficacious than furosemide in patients with heart failure (decreased mortality, decrease hospitalizations, and improved New York Heart Association functional classification). In AKI patients, as compared with torsemide the use of furosemide was associated with a significant improvement in urine output. Moreover, two trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide showed conflicting results.

Finally, in patients with AKI the response to furosemide may be reduced due to multiple mechanisms including a reduced tubular secretion of furosemide and blunted response of Na-K-2Cl co-transporters at the loop of Henle. This reduced response to furosemide in AKI patients often requires the use of higher doses that may increase the risk of ototoxicity, especially as the clearance of furosemide is severely reduced in AKI. High doses of furosemide may also result in myocardial dysfunction secondary to furosemide induced vasoconstriction.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^3f6ba6dd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there may not be differences in clinical outcomes associated with different loop diuretic medications, there are relevant and important pharmacokinetic differences in relative potencies and bioavailability. These differences dictate relative conversions between loop diuretics and as shown in the current analysis, as the magnitude of dose increases, the likelihood of receiving optimal initial IV dosing decreases. This finding may reflect either a discomfort in practice when selecting an initial dose that surpasses a particular threshold or inadequate pharmacokinetic equipotent conversions between loop diuretics. Both potential mechanisms are further supported in our study by the 20 to 25% lower probability of optimal dosing with the use of bumetanide as a home oral diuretic or as an initial IV diuretic. This may indicate a misinterpretation of pharmacokinetic equivalences between bumetanide and furosemide. Furthermore, results remained consistent in our sensitivity analysis with an alternative diuretic dosing conversion. While these mechanisms may be driven by the goal of minimizing medication-related side effects, there are limited reports of adverse events from exceeding dosing thresholds for IV loop diuretics in patients with ADHF. Hearing loss or tinnitus, rare side effects of loop diuretics, are only notable in rapid IV bolus doses exceeding 500 mg of FEs, which is rarely seen within current HF management. Furthermore, acute kidney injury in the setting of volume overload and diuresis is not associated with long-term worsening renal function, which diverges from the pedagogical "nephrotoxicity" side effect of loop diuretics during initial ADHF volume management. In fact, a retrospective analysis of the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure trail demonstrated that worsening acute kidney injury biomarkers among those with ADHF were associated with an improvement in survival vs those without acute kidney injury biomarker changes.

### Is it safe to use a diuretic to treat seizures early in development? [^8bf304ff]. Epilepsy Currents (2011). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in using bumetanide, a diuretic chloride importer NKCC1 antagonist, to reduce intracellular chloride ([Cl⁻]ᵢ) in epileptic neurons, thereby shifting the polarity of GABA from excitatory to inhibitory and ameliorating the actions of GABA-acting antiepileptic drugs. However, a recent study raises the important issue of potential deleterious actions of bumetanide on immature neurons, because reduction of (Cl(-))(i) also alleviates a major source of excitation in developing neurons, upon which GABA exerts a trophic action. This review considers the importance of separating intrauterine from postnatal effects of bumetanide in normal versus pathologic neurons.

### Novel intranasal loop Diuretic [^b70f2613]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Intranasal bumetanide was safe and generally well-tolerated with no overt signs of nasal irritation across the study population. Following intranasal or oral administrations, bumetanide was absorbed with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) ranging from 1.02 to 1.50 hours post dose. Plasma bumetanide concentration remained steady between 1.0 and 2.0 hours post dose, followed by a slow decline. Increases in bumetanide exposure seemed to be dose proportional over the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range after intranasal administration. Furthermore, bumetanide exposure after a 2.0-mg intranasal administration was similar to a 1.0-mg intravenous or a 2.0-mg oral dose. For intranasal vs oral administration, particularly in the 2.0 mg intranasal group, the intranasal t max did occur sooner compared to oral, although differences in t max were not statistically significant. There is no significant difference in the maximum concentration and area under the curve 0-last between the intranasal route and the oral route at the 2.0-mg dose level (Figure 1B). An exploratory observation of the study demonstrated similar urine output for the intranasal arms as compared with the oral and intravenous cohorts.

### The daily challenges to patients posed by diuretic therapy: what they are and what do patients do? [^fa3dd96e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Diuretics play a central role in the management of patients with heart failure. In fact, they are used to achieve and maintain euvolaemia through adequate fluid balance. The effects, clinical benefits and implications of diuretic therapy are well established. However, little is known about the inconveniences posed to patients by diuretics and the adaptations adopted by them to counteract these challenges.

We conducted a study to investigate the patient impact of diuretic therapy.

A comprehensive questionnaire was formulated and distributed to patients with established heart failure (with reduced and preserved ejection fraction) attending a specialized heart failure service. Questionnaires were given to patients once they had been established on heart failure disease‐modifying therapy and diuretic therapy for at least 3 months and had received self‐care education including information on medication and adherence to drug regimens. Patients were established either on oral furosemide or bumetanide with doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg daily and 0.5 to 6 mg daily, respectively. The questionnaire encompassed information on inconvenience from the use of diuretics, what those manifestations were (if any) and what the patients did to overcome the inconvenience (if something was done). The patients also commented on whether they felt that the benefits were worth the inconvenience of the diuretics.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

Table 13 — Diuretics–loop — provides dosing and when they are preferred: bumetanide 0.5–2 with daily frequency 2; furosemide 20–80 with daily frequency 2; torsemide 5–10 with daily frequency 1. These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Superiority and cost-effectiveness of monthly extended-release buprenorphine versus daily standard of care medication: a pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^07fad49e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results of this and other economic analyses of BUP-XR (Sublocade® and Buvidal®) appear to be sensitive to medicine acquisition and administration costs, both of BUP-XR and the comparator, typically BUP or BUP-NLX. In Scotland, a Markov-model based analysis of Buvidal® and BUP-NLX with a one-year time horizon, with equal outcomes assumed, and with costs limited to medicine acquisition, administration/pharmacy, and other health resource use, Buvidal® was considered cost-saving (−£140); however, changing the comparator from BUP-NLX to mono BUP reversed this, with an incremental cost of £213. In Wales, the All-Wales Medicine Strategy Group assessment for Buvidal® suggests that it dominates BUP-NLXbased on the assumption that Buvidal® would have lower administration costs.

What might the underlying mechanism be for BUP-XR's comparative clinical superiority? It is likely that several processes are at work and further studies are needed — but the levels of BUP exposure driving BUP μ-OR occupancy may turn out to be key. A clinically responding patient should not experience any opioid withdrawal symptoms due to BUP agonist properties; in the past, onset of these symptoms may well have initiated a cognitive-affective cycle of distress and motivated drug-seeking and consumption. Therapeutic control of withdrawal symptoms has been found to be achieved with BUP plasma concentration levels ≥ 1 ng/mL (corresponding to ≥ 50% μ-OR occupancy). A second likely mechanism of effect is through the blockade of the subjective (euphoric) effects of opioids, so that any lapsed drug use is not directly reinforcing. Opioid blockade is best achieved by BUP plasma levels ≥ 2–3 ng/mL occupying ≥ 70% of μ-OR receptors. A study that had pooled phase II and phase III studies with a total of 570 participants treated for up to one year estimated that the BUP-XR 300/100 mg dosing regimen achieves and sustains BUP plasma levels ≥ 2–3 ng/mL over the inter-dosing interval, enabling both control of withdrawal symptoms and opioid blockade. This dual control of withdrawal symptoms (for all patients) and blockade of euphoria (for those lapsing reducing drug liking) translates to greater potential for cognitive control over craving and drug seeking, as supported by other clinical data.

### A comprehensive review of the loop diuretics: should furosemide be first line? [^2f95fdee]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the pharmacokinetic profiles, comparative safety and efficacy, and comparative costs of loop diuretics to evaluate the current clinical usefulness of furosemide.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2009) was conducted using the terms furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, and loop diuretics. Articles were limited to those written in English.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were reviewed. Studies were eligible if they encompassed pharmacokinetics, comparative safety and efficacy, or comparative costs of the loop diuretics.

Data Synthesis

In patients with heart failure (HF), torsemide demonstrated decreased mortality compared with furosemide in 1 study (2.2% vs 4.5% in the furosemide group; p < 0.05), decreased hospitalizations in 1 study (23 in the torsemide group vs 61 in the furosemide group; p < 0.01), and improved New York Heart Association functional classifications in 2 studies. In the first, 45.8% with torsemide versus 37.2% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.00017). In the second, 40.2% with torsemide and 30.7% with furosemide demonstrated improvement in at least one functional class (p = 0.014). In 2 of 3 studies of patients with cirrhosis, torsemide increased natriuresis and total volume diuresed compared with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis; however, no significant difference between the agents with respect to plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations was demonstrated. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, central venous pressure, capillary wedge pressure, and stroke volume significantly improved from baseline among patients who received torsemide, but not in those who received furosemide, although the intergroup analysis failed to reach statistical significance. Among patients with chronic kidney disease, no significant differences were noted with respect to natriuresis and blood pressure control between the 2 agents; however, in patients with acute kidney injury, patients who received furosemide had a significant improvement in urine output versus the torsemide group. Additionally, 2 trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide were identified, although the results were conflicting. In patients with nephrotic syndrome, bumetanide significantly improved weight loss in the first 4 weeks and in week 20, compared with furosemide. In patients with HF, significant improvement in dyspnea at rest and on exertion was exhibited in the bumetanide group, but not in the furosemide group; no significant difference was noted between the 2 groups when evaluating global assessment.

Conclusions

Growing evidence demonstrates more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles of torsemide and bumetanide compared with furosemide. Furthermore, torsemide may be more efficacious and safer than furosemide in patients with HF. A trial comparing all 3 drugs would be required to confirm torsemide as the primary loop diuretic in patients with HF, but based upon limited current evidence, we recommend torsemide over furosemide. Currently, little evidence exists to support either torsemide or bumetanide as first-line treatment over furosemide in patients with other edematous disease states.

### Decreased seizure activity in a human neonate treated with bumetanide, an inhibitor of the Na (+)-K (+)-2Cl (-) cotransporter NKCC1 [^86fbca76]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures have devastating consequences for brain development and are inadequately treated by available antiepileptics. In neonates, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an excitatory neurotransmitter due to elevated levels of intraneuronal chloride achieved by robust activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). This depolarizing action of GABA likely contributes to the lowered seizure threshold, increased seizure propensity, and poor efficacy of GABAergic anticonvulsants among infants. The diuretic bumetanide inhibits NKCC1 and silences seizure activity in rodent models of neonatal seizures, but its effect on seizures in human neonates is unknown. Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring was used to quantify the number, duration, and frequency of seizures 2 hours before and after the administration of bumetanide in a neonate with intractable multifocal seizures. Significant reductions in mean seizure duration and frequency were noted following treatment, with no associated clinical side effects or metabolic imbalances. These results suggest bumetanide may exert antiepileptic effects in human neonates.

### Natriuresis-guided therapy in acute heart failure: rationale and design of the pragmatic urinary sodium-based treatment algoritHm in acute heart failure (PUSH-AHF) trial [^0abaeb2e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Baseline loop diuretic dose

Baseline loop diuretic dose (the first in‐hospital dose of loop diuretics administered at the emergency department, irrespective of loop diuretic administration in the pre‐hospital setting) in both groups will be determined based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the patient at presentation and his/her outpatient loop diuretic dose (Table 2). A maximum bolus dose of 5 mg of bumetanide will be used. The bolus dose will be continued in twice daily dosing (every 12 h). Use of continuous administration of loop diuretics is actively discouraged. In the standard of care group this is not adjusted according to protocol, yet can be altered by the treating physician if clinically indicated, for instance based on congestion status or fluid balance according to best practice consensus. The urinary sodium values (of all spot and timed urine collections) in the standard of care group will be blinded till the end of the study.

Table 2
Determination of loop diuretic starting dose in all patients

Natriuresis‐guided treatment protocol

Based on the spot urinary sodium values obtained from 2 h onwards in the natriuresis‐guided group, decongestive therapy will be adjusted using the PUSH‐AHF treatment algorithm (Figure 3). In brief, if spot urinary sodium is < 70 mmol/L and/or diuresis < 150 ml/h, patients will be eligible (if still congested) for an additional bolus of loop diuretic, which is double the previous dose with a maximum bolus of 5 mg bumetanide. If a patient has received two doses of 5 mg of bumetanide at the two previous time points and has insufficient natriuresis or diuresis at two consecutive time points, the initiation of combination diuretic therapy is indicated (Figure 3A). More details are provided in online supplementary Methods S1. The above protocol will be repeated at 12, 18, 24, and 36 h (Figure 3B). At every time point physicians will first assess the congestion status before administering additional doses of diuretics. After 48 h, adjustment of the decongestive therapy is left at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^65d7055e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the combination of bumetanide and dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, although dapagliflozin enhanced the hypokalemia with bumetanide. There was no apparent first‐dose additive natriuresis with dapagliflozin and bumetanide. However, 1 week of accommodation to dapagliflozin increased in Na + excretion with bumetanide, likely reflecting an adaptive increase in Na + /K + /2Cl after inhibition of Na + /glucose cotransport in the upstream proximal tubule. Moreover, 1 week of accommodation to bumetanide increased Na + excretion with dapagliflozin, likely reflecting enhanced proximal tubule Na + reabsorption after some volume depletion after 1 week of bumetanide administration. Further studies will be required to probe the clinical significance of these interactive effects in patients with CHF and T2DM.

Perspective

An SGLT2 inhibitor given to patients with T2DM reduces cardiovascular events 10 and BP, 23 which have been attributed to volume loss. 23 The positive natriuretic effect of bumetanide added to dapagliflozin in subjects adapted to a loop diuretic therefore may extend the volume‐depleting and antihypertensive actions of loop diuretics, which could be beneficial for patients with resistant CHF and hypertension, as shown recently for patients with nephrotic edema. 43 Dapagliflozin's uricosuric action more than compensated for the reduction in urate excretion with bumetanide when given in combination. Thus, dapagliflozin should address favorably both inadequate correction of blood volume and hypertension and 2 adverse metabolic consequences of loop diuretics: hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^9c631ce6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings could have a positive clinical impact in management of volume overload in the chronic kidney disease population, whose prognosis has already been proven to improve with a reduction in volume overload. Szu-Chun Hung et al. employed a model to predict mortality based on patients' extracellular water to total body water ratio. This ratio expresses the amount of extracellular water that exists compared to total body water. In healthy people, the index is between 0.36 and 0.39, however, it has been observed that it is increased in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with multiple adverse outcomes. Patients were classified into two groups based on the extracellular water to total body water ratio with a cutoff of ± 48%, and after four years of follow-up, they observed twice the mortality rate in those with levels ≥ 48%. These results could be of particular interest when applied to this trial since, before the intervention, both groups had an ECW/TBW ratio > 50%; however, at the end of follow-up, only the combined treatment group exhibited a reduction to 46%, which could be impactful as a possible benefit in terms of mortality in this population.

Another finding was that treatment with loop diuretics alone was insufficient for blood pressure and volume overload control compared with bumetanide plus chlorthalidone. This was evidenced by the fact that in our trial, all patients had a history of chronic loop diuretic use (most were on furosemide); however, when they were randomized, furosemide was changed to bumetanide, a more potent loop diuretic with a dose equivalent to 160 mg furosemide QD. This protocol, along with our findings, allowed us to demonstrate that high doses of loop diuretics are not sufficient by themselves to achieve adequate blood pressure and volume overload in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease without renal replacement therapy. When employing high doses of bumetanide, the possibilities of poor efficacy of the loop diuretic secondary to pharmacokinetic processes associated with diuretic resistance, such as insufficient dosage, reduced absorption, low bioavailability, and interaction with uremic toxins, are diminished. We consider that this difference could be explained by chronic loop diuretic use and previously described adaptive changes at the distal convoluted tubule, in which patients exhibit higher sodium reabsorption, lower natriuresis, and, as a consequence, loss of loop diuretic efficacy.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^3c166dc6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

We observed the same phenomenon in plasma urea levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), both associated with a nonsignificant deterioration in patients on bumetanide plus chlorthalidone treatment compared with bumetanide plus placebo. The proportion of patients in the bumetanide plus chlorthalidone group who experienced an increase in plasma creatinine levels could be conceptually defined as having acute kidney injury. Nevertheless, grading by AKIN or RIFLE classifications (utilized for acute kidney failure diagnosis) has not been applied in advanced chronic kidney disease populations. Among the reasons for not applying these criteria to diagnose acute kidney failure in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and chronic diuretic use is the fact that urinary volume measurements, considered part of the diagnostic criteria for acute kidney failure, cannot be applied because urinary volume in this population is variable and dependent on residual renal tubular function. Employing serum creatinine elevation as a diagnostic criterion for acute kidney failure, considering that basal creatinine levels in the patients included in our study were near 4 mg/dL, would not be adequate, as serum creatinine in these stages of kidney disease is more a marker of nutritional status than of kidney function. However, we decided to use two cut-off points for serum creatinine levels to assess renal function impairment. The first, an elevation greater than 0.3 mg/dl, a cut-off point with high sensitivity, to detect differences in creatinine elevation between both groups, as was the case in the study. The second, a double elevation of baseline creatinine levels, a cut-off point with high specificity that could be more related to a clinically significant elevation, which did not occur in any of the groups.

Pharmacotherapy

On admission there were no differences in the prescription rates of ACE inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), ACE-I and/or ARB, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) or loop diuretics between the pre-HFT and post-HFT groups, respectively (table 2). There was a significantly higher proportion of patients taking thiazides on admission in the post-HFT group.

Table 2
Admission medications

On discharge, the prescription rates of both medications with known prognostic benefit (ACE-I, ACE-I and/or ARB, and MRA) and medications with a symptomatic benefit (loop and thiazide diuretics) were significantly higher in patients in the post-HFT cohort (table 3). During their hospital stay, post-HFT patients were more likely to receive intravenous loop diuretics, more likely to be discharged on a diuretic and were discharged on higher doses of loop diuretic. Intravenous loop diuretic was used in 76% of pre-HFT versus 88% of post-HFT patients (p < 0.002). Eighty-four per cent of the pre-HFT patients were discharged on a loop diuretic (70% furosemide and 14% bumetanide) compared with 98% of post-HFT patients (54% furosemide and 45% bumetanide) (p < 0.0001).

Table 3
Discharge medications

Post-HFT patients received higher doses of oral diuretics on discharge: the mean bumetanide equivalent dose (bumetanide 1 mg = furosemide 40 mg) was 2.4 mg in the post-HFT cohort versus 1.6 mg in the pre-HFT cohort (p < 0.001). Discharge prescription rates of thiazide diuretics were also more frequent in the post-HFT patients: 5% pre-HFT versus 17% post-HFT (p < 0.001).

### Bumetanide [^f3f9f134]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Interactions

Drugs with Ototoxic Potential [See Warnings]

Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.

Drugs with Nephrotoxic Potential

There has been no experience with the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.

Lithium

Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

Probenecid

Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with bumetanide.

Indomethacin

Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with bumetanide is thus not recommended.

Antihypertensives

Bumetanide may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.

Digoxin

Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels.

Anticoagulants

Interaction studies in humans have shown bumetanide to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility

Bumetanide was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in the presence or absence of an in vitro metabolic activation system. An 18-month study showed an increase in mammary adenomas of questionable significance in female rats receiving oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (2000 times a 2-mg human dose). A repeat study at the same doses failed to duplicate this finding.

Reproduction studies were performed to evaluate general reproductive performance and fertility in rats at oral dose levels of 10, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day. The pregnancy rate was slightly decreased in the treated animals; however, the differences were small and not statistically significant.

Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy — Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss, and fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present; a formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) are the mainstay of diuretic treatment of cirrhotic ascites, and the recommended initial dose of spironolactone is 100 mg/day. Two studies addressing the best way to use these diuretics showed that for the first episode of ascites, treatment with aldosterone antagonists alone generated an adequate response with fewer side effects, whereas those with long-standing ascites responded better to a combined diuretic treatment.

### Diuretic treatment in heart failure [^b252c856]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diuretic treatment in heart failure:

- **Definition**: Diuretic treatment in HF is used to promote renal sodium and water excretion, thereby reducing intravascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and elevated filling pressures. Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide are the cornerstone of therapy, with thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics added for additional effect when needed. The primary goal is to achieve rapid symptomatic relief and restoration of euvolemia while avoiding excessive volume loss, renal dysfunction, or electrolyte imbalance.
- **Pathophysiology**: In HF, neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems causes sodium and water retention, leading to increased venous pressures and pulmonary or systemic congestion. Diuretics counteract these effects by lowering preload and reducing ventricular filling pressures, which alleviates dyspnea and edema. However, excessive diuresis can decrease renal perfusion and stimulate further neurohormonal activation, diminishing long-term efficacy.
- **Disease course**: Diuretic therapy provides rapid improvement in symptoms, often within hours of initiation, particularly in acute decompensated HF. Treatment usually begins with intravenous loop diuretics, titrated according to urine output, weight reduction, and renal function. Thiazide-type diuretics may be combined with loop agents in cases of diuretic resistance. Once euvolemia is achieved, therapy is transitioned to the lowest effective oral dose while guideline-directed agents for HF are optimized.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Diuretic therapy is recommended in patients with HF and fluid retention to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity, and reduce the risk of hospital readmission. In HFrEF, early and effective decongestion improves QoL and functional status, although diuretics do not confer a direct survival benefit. Prompt administration in acute HF may shorten hospitalization and lower in-hospital mortality, provided the diagnosis of volume overload is certain. Combination therapy with a thiazide such as metolazone is reserved for patients unresponsive to high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte disturbances and renal dysfunction.

### Bumetanide for the treatment of seizures in newborn babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (NEMO): an open-label, dose finding, and feasibility phase 1 / 2 trial [^ba3fb82c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical data suggest that the loop-diuretic bumetanide might be an effective treatment for neonatal seizures. We aimed to assess dose and feasibility of intravenous bumetanide as an add-on to phenobarbital for treatment of neonatal seizures.

Methods

In this open-label, dose finding, and feasibility phase 1/2 trial, we recruited full-term infants younger than 48 h who had hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and electrographic seizures not responding to a loading-dose of phenobarbital from eight neonatal intensive care units across Europe. Newborn babies were allocated to receive an additional dose of phenobarbital and one of four bumetanide dose levels by use of a bivariate Bayesian sequential dose-escalation design to assess safety and efficacy. We assessed adverse events, pharmacokinetics, and seizure burden during 48 h continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The primary efficacy endpoint was a reduction in electrographic seizure burden of more than 80% without the need for rescue antiepileptic drugs in more than 50% of infants. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01434225.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 28, 2013, we screened 30 infants who had electrographic seizures due to hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. 14 of these infants (10 boys) were included in the study (dose allocation: 0·05 mg/kg, n = 4; 0·1 mg/kg, n = 3; 0·2 mg/kg, n = 6; 0·3 mg/kg, n = 1). All babies received at least one dose of bumetanide with the second dose of phenobarbital; three were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to bumetanide, and one because of dehydration. All but one infant also received aminoglycosides. Five infants met EEG criteria for seizure reduction (one on 0·05 mg/kg, one on 0·1 mg/kg and three on 0·2 mg/kg), and only two did not need rescue antiepileptic drugs (ie, met rescue criteria; one on 0·05 mg/kg and one on 0·3 mg/kg). We recorded no short-term dose-limiting toxic effects, but three of 11 surviving infants had hearing impairment confirmed on auditory testing between 17 and 108 days of age. The most common non-serious adverse reactions were moderate dehydration in one, mild hypotension in seven, and mild to moderate electrolyte disturbances in 12 infants. The trial was stopped early because of serious adverse reactions and limited evidence for seizure reduction.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that bumetanide as an add-on to phenobarbital does not improve seizure control in newborn infants who have hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and might increase the risk of hearing loss, highlighting the risks associated with the off-label use of drugs in newborn infants before safety assessment in controlled trials.

### Loop diuretics for patients receiving blood transfusions [^29ab1b28]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Blood transfusions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic administration of loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or torsemide) is common practice, especially among people who are at risk for circulatory overload, pulmonary oedema or both.

Objectives

This review aimed to determine if the prophylactic administration of loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, ethacrynic acid, or torsemide) provides a therapeutic advantage (that is, a favourable risk benefit ratio) in adults and children who are recipients of any blood product transfusion versus placebo, no treatment, or general fluid restriction measures.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 13 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing a loop diuretic in patients receiving any blood transfusion were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Mean effect sizes were to be calculated using the random-effects models.

Main Results

We included four studies that involved 100 participants. Furosemide was the only diuretic investigated in all four studies. None of the included studies assessed the clinically important outcomes noted in our protocol. The studies focused on various markers of respiratory function. An improvement in fraction of inspired oxygen (in favour of furosemide) was noted in one study. An improvement in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (in favour of furosemide) was noted in two studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to determine whether premedicating people undergoing blood transfusion with loop diuretics prevents clinically important transfusion-related morbidity. Due to the continued use of prophylactic loop diuretics during transfusions, and because this review highlights the absence of evidence to justify this practice, well-conducted RCTs are needed. Given the high mortality, severe morbidity and increasing incidence of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, determining the therapeutic utility of pre-transfusion loop diuresis is an urgent need.

Supportive management of amyloidosis-associated nephrotic syndrome — Management is similar to other glomerulopathies and includes dietary sodium restriction, loop diuretic agents sometimes with a thiazide such as metolazone, and compression stockings to reduce edema and increase tolerability of diuretics. Torsemide or bumetanide orally, or intravenously administered loop diuretics, may be more effective than oral furosemide in intestinal wall edema, and intravenous albumin can facilitate diuresis when there is marked hypoalbuminemia (eg, serum albumin < 1.5–2 g/dL). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can be used for antiproteinuric effects if blood pressure is not prohibitively low. Although sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors slow decline in chronic kidney disease and in HFrEF, this class has not been studied in amyloid-associated kidney dysfunction. Managing volume overload requires balancing fluid removal with hemodynamic changes that reduce kidney perfusion and GFR, and lipid-lowering agents can have some effect though many patients continue to have markedly elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic complications is generally not recommended specifically for amyloidosis-associated nephrotic syndrome in the absence of other indications.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^1305f39c]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

We performed a sensitivity analysis in the primary outcome where we utilized an alternative diuretic dosing conversion that is commonly used in practice (bumetanide 1 mg oral = furosemide 80 mg oral = torsemide 20 mg oral; furosemide 40 mg oral = furosemide 20 mg IV). Additional sensitivity analyses were performed in those who did not receive oral metolazone or IV chlorothiazide ("thiazide") within the first 24 hours of admission as well as those who did not transfer from an outside facility.

Two-sided hypothesis tests were used with a significance level of 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using a standard software package (Stata, version 17.0, StataCorp).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Diuretics in heart failure — classes and pharmacology describe that diuretics interfere with sodium retention by inhibiting sodium or chloride reabsorption in renal tubules; loop agents (bumetanide, furosemide, torsemide) act at the loop of Henle and increase sodium excretion up to 20% to 25% of the filtered load, whereas thiazides (including metolazone) and potassium-sparing agents (e.g., spironolactone) act distally and increase fractional sodium excretion to only 5% to 10%, losing effectiveness with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL per min); consequently, loop diuretics have emerged as the preferred agents for most HF patients, although thiazides may be preferred in hypertensive HF with mild fluid retention; controlled trials demonstrate diuretics increase urinary sodium excretion and decrease physical signs of fluid retention.

### Evaluation of furosemide regimens in neonates treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^d585ba48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, are the mainstay in the enhancement of diuresis in patients treated with ECMO. In contrast to the extensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) research on (loop) diuretics in preterm and term neonates, very limited research has been performed on (loop) diuretics in neonates treated with ECMO. Wells and colleagues studied the PK/PD of bumetanide in 11 term neonates treated with ECMO and reported that the steady-state volume of distribution and the elimination half-life were greater than comparable values reported in previous studies of bumetanide disposition in premature and term neonates without ECMO and that the plasma clearance was similar for both groups. Although significant diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis were observed with 0.1 mg/kg, the duration of the effects was less than expected given by the prolonged renal elimination.

Since the observation that continuous IV furosemide might be superior (especially in haemodynamically unstable patients) to intermittent administration in infants and children after CPB surgery, continuous furosemide infusions have been increasingly used in patients after cardiac surgery. Trials assessing efficacy and safety of continuous versus intermittent IV furosemide in paediatric patients after CPB surgery revealed that the total furosemide dose administered by continuous infusion was generally less than the dose by intermittent administration. No significant difference was observed in the main pharmacodynamic outcome parameter: urine production. However, significantly less variance in urine output was observed in the patients who received a continuous infusion (overview in Table 2). Studies in critically ill adult patients also showed that there was no difference in urine production with continuous IV versus intermittent IV furosemide administration. However, the diuresis was more controlled with fewer haemodynamic and electrolyte variations during continuous furosemide infusion.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^254454a9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) diuretic therapy — There are no specific disease-modifying medical therapies (or guideline Class I medical recommendations) for the treatment of TR, although the magnitude of TR can be reduced in many patients with management of left-sided heart disease and atrial fibrillation (AF), and because TR was the strongest multivariable predictor of persistent congestion in acute heart failure (HF), management of congestion should be a primary treatment goal. Loop diuretic effectiveness may be limited by impaired kidney function and, in chronic kidney disease, by reduced activity of the organic anion transporter and decreased renal blood flow that lower intratubular diuretic concentrations; severe TR can cause renal venous hypertension with lower glomerular filtration rate and diuretic resistance, and neurohormonal activation with lower cardiac output and higher central venous pressure increases active sodium and water reabsorption, perpetuating congestion and reducing responsiveness. For gut congestion with impaired absorption, an oral loop diuretic with higher bioavailability (torsemide, bumetanide) may be considered, although the TRANSFORM study did not demonstrate a benefit of torsemide over furosemide in chronic HF and was not stratified by TR. In patients refractory to high-dose oral diuretic therapy, changing to an intravenous loop diuretic with a bolus infusion can reduce PA pressures and increase venous capacitance; higher doses may sometimes be needed but may not be predictably effective in advanced chronic kidney disease. Add-on options include thiazide-like diuretics (oral metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide; intravenous chlorothiazide) for dual nephron blockade, and more recent data suggest a benefit of adding acetazolamide or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to enhance decongestion; aggressive diuretic management may require the input of a pharmacist.

### Bumetanide [^a748a8d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Bumetanide is a loop diuretic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that 1 mg bumetanide has a diuretic potency equivalent to approximately 40 mg furosemide. The major site of bumetanide action is the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The mode of action has been determined through various clearance studies in both humans and experimental animals. Bumetanide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, as shown by marked reduction of free-water clearance (CH₂O) during hydration and tubular free-water reabsorption (TcH₂O) during hydropenia. Reabsorption of chloride in the ascending limb is also blocked by bumetanide, and bumetanide is somewhat more chloruretic than natriuretic.

Potassium excretion is also increased by bumetanide, in a dose-related fashion.

Bumetanide may have an additional action in the proximal tubule. Since phosphate reabsorption takes place largely in the proximal tubule, phosphaturia during bumetanide induced diuresis is indicative of this additional action. This is further supported by the reduction in the renal clearance of bumetanide by probenecid, associated with diminution in the natriuretic response. This proximal tubular activity does not seem to be related to an inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Bumetanide does not appear to have a noticeable action on the distal tubule.

Bumetanide decreases uric acid excretion and increases serum uric acid. Diuresis starts within minutes following an intravenous injection and reaches maximum levels within 15 to 30 minutes.

Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that bumetanide, administered orally or parenterally, is eliminated rapidly in humans, with a half-life of between 1 and 1½ hours. Plasma protein-binding is in the range of 94% to 96%.

Oral administration of carbon-14 labeled bumetanide to human volunteers revealed that 81% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine, 45% of it as unchanged drug. Urinary and biliary metabolites identified in this study were formed by oxidation of the N-butyl side chain. Biliary excretion of bumetanide amounted to only 2% of the administered dose.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^73d6fc3d]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Diuretic therapy for ascites — dosing and titration: Spironolactone may be increased up to 400 mg/day, the full effect of a dose change may not be seen for up to 3 days, and dose increases should be made with an interval of at least 72 hours; the dose of furosemide (initially 40 mg/day) may be progressively increased toward 160 mg/day, which is the generally accepted threshold to determine medical treatment refractoriness. Torsemide or bumetanide may improve natriuresis in patients with a suboptimal response to furosemide, and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in general are switched to high-dose loop diuretics and lower doses of aldosterone antagonists. Adverse effects of diuretic therapy may occur in 20% and 40% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and painful gynecomastia caused or exacerbated by spironolactone may respond to switching to amiloride or eplerenone.

Results

Demographics

Among the 5,349 adults hospitalized for ADHF between January 1, 2014, and December 21, 2021, 3,269 were included in the final analysis (Figure 1). Of the 2,080 patients excluded, 1,580 (76.0%) were excluded for no baseline oral loop diuretic at home and 435 (20.9%) were excluded due to end-stage renal disease. Among included patients, 1,750 (53.5%), 868 (26.6%), and 651 (19.9%) had a low (≤ 40 mg FEs), medium (> 40–80 mg FEs), and high (> 80 mg FEs) home oral loop diuretic dose, respectively. The mean age of the population was 63.1 ± 15.4 years, with 37.9% female, and 82.3% non-Hispanic White (Table 1). The median home oral diuretic dose was 40 mg (IQR: 40–80). Baseline characteristics between home oral dosing groups were similar, with the exception of patients with higher home oral dosing had higher use of bumetanide or torsemide (vs furosemide) as a home oral diuretic (P < 0.001) and higher use of bumetanide (vs furosemide) as the initial IV diuretic (P < 0.001). Patients receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing had higher home oral loop diuretic dosing and had higher use of furosemide as the home oral loop diuretic and initial IV loop diuretic (Supplemental Table 1).

### Renal tubular resistance is the primary driver for loop diuretic resistance in acute heart failure [^9583ec4c]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Loop diuretic resistance is a common barrier to effective decongestion in acute heart failure (AHF), and is associated with poor outcome. Specific mechanisms underlying diuretic resistance are currently unknown in contemporary AHF patients. We therefore aimed to determine the relative importance of defects in diuretic delivery vs. renal tubular response in determining diuretic response (DR) in AHF.

Methods and Results

Fifty AHF patients treated with intravenous bumetanide underwent a 6-h timed urine collection for sodium and bumetanide clearance. Whole-kidney DR was defined as sodium excreted per doubling of administered loop diuretic and represents the sum of defects in drug delivery and renal tubular response. Tubular DR, defined as sodium excreted per doubling of renally cleared (urinary) loop diuretic, captures resistance specifically in the renal tubule. Median administered bumetanide dose was 3.0 (2.0–4.0) mg with 52 (33–77)% of the drug excreted into the urine. Significant between-patient variability was present as the administered dose only explained 39% of variability in the quantity of bumetanide in urine. Cumulatively, factors related to drug delivery such as renal bumetanide clearance, administered dose, and urea clearance explained 28% of the variance in whole-kidney DR. However, resistance at the level of the renal tubule (tubular DR) explained 71% of the variability in whole-kidney DR.

Conclusion

Defects at the level of the renal tubule are substantially more important than reduced diuretic delivery in determining diuretic resistance in patients with AHF.

### Anticipatory prescribing in community end-of-life care: systematic review and narrative synthesis of the evidence since 2017 [^b7b65f22]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Patient and family caregiver experiences of anticipatory prescriptions and their involvement in decisions to administer medication with nurses require urgent investigation. This was also a key recommendation from the original systematic review findings; this priority area has still received inadequate research attention, possibly due to ethical concerns about interviewing dying patients and their families. Recent published research has focused primarily on the views of bereaved family caregivers of patients who received specialist palliative care; many patients and families do not receive this level of specialist input and care, and may have diverse experiences. We have recently completed in-depth longitudinal interviews exploring patients', family caregivers' and their healthcare professionals' views and experiences of decisions to prescribe and use of anticipatory medications.

Having access to anticipatory medications may not, by itself, adequately resolve the issues the intervention sets out to address: ensuring timely, effective symptom control in the community. Building on the knowledge from our earlier review, it is now clear anticipatory prescribing is a complex intervention involving multiple steps, several layers of teamwork and nuanced, skilled judgements about both when to prescribe and use medication. These processes are prone to miscommunication and adverse patient safety events, especially when multiple healthcare professionals and services are involved. Studies have repeatedly identified that families are unsure when to access professional help with symptom control; when they do, they report experiencing difficulties in getting nurses to visit to administer injectable medications in a timely way. Community nurses also struggle with decisions to administer anticipatory medications and less experienced nurses' report being over-cautious when giving injections, fearing causing over-sedation or hastening death. Paramedic experiences of using anticipatory medications remain unknown and require exploration as the workforce is involved in crisis end-of-life symptom management at home. How lone-working nurses and paramedics can be best supported in assessing risk and making skilled, nuanced decisions to use anticipatory medications warrant careful consideration in practice and policy.

### The use of bumetanide for oliguric acute renal failure in preterm infants [^073e5b7e]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of bumetanide in preterm infants with oliguric acute renal failure (OARF).

Study Design

Retrospective data review and multivariate analysis of urine output and serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, Na, K, Cl, and Ca levels before, during, and after bumetanide therapy in preterm infants with OARF whose conditions did not respond to furosemide therapy.

Results

A total of 35 infants received bumetanide for OARF after an initial trial of furosemide. Their birth weight, gestational age at birth, and postconceptional age at OARF were 811 ± 326 g, 26 ± 2.75 wks, and 29.2 ± 2.7 wks, respectively. Twenty-nine of the 35 infants (83%) responded to bumetanide. Seventeen of the 35 infants subsequently died in the hospital due to multiorgan dysfunction. For the survivors (n = 18) and 11 of 17 of nonsurvivors, urine output increased from 0.6 ± 0.6 mL/kg/hr to 3.0 ± 2.1 mL/kg/hr during bumetanide therapy (p < .0005). Serum creatinine levels increased from 2.13 ± 0.83 mg/dL to 2.3 ± 0.92 mg/dL (p = .04) during bumetanide treatment, whereas blood urea nitrogen levels decreased after bumetanide therapy from 38 ± 19 mg/dL to 31.67 ± 21.6 mg/dL (p = .049). No significant changes were noted in serum sodium, chloride, or calcium concentration.

Conclusions

Bumetanide therapy significantly increased urine output within 24–48 hrs, but its use was associated with a transient increase in serum creatinine level. Bumetanide can be used in preterm infants to reverse oliguria when therapy with furosemide fails. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials with long-term follow-up in preterm infants are necessary to establish the usefulness of bumetanide for OARF.

Overdose and transfer considerations — Recommendations G-17 to G-19 state that if health care staff are not available onsite to manage the minimum required frequency of clinical assessments, the patient should be transferred to an appropriate medical facility, and well-trained and supervised custody staff may monitor withdrawal signs and symptoms and administer validated tools, such as the COWS and CIWA-Ar. Where nursing, medical, psychiatric, or urgent care resources are recommended and not immediately available onsite, the provider should be consulted to determine the necessary timing for transferring the patient to a higher level of care for further assessment and treatment, and if a provider is not available, the patient should be immediately transferred to a hospital. For suspected substance overdose, follow the principles of first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and transfer to a local emergency department; if the patient is not breathing, or their breathing is not sufficient, naloxone should be administered.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^b06d0b74]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Main exposures and outcomes

In the first analysis, the main exposure was home oral loop diuretic dosing and the outcome was optimal initial IV diuretic dosing. In the second analysis, the main exposure was receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing and the outcome was LOS and 30-day readmission.

Home oral loop diuretic dosing was abstracted from the prior-to-admission medication lists recorded in the EHR. The prior-to-admission medication list is collected by trained medication reconciliation technicians, interns, or pharmacists and is ultimately verified by a clinical pharmacist upon admission. Home oral loop diuretics were identified on the prior-to-admission medication list and was calculated as a single scheduled dose, which was used to determine optimal initial IV dosing. For example, a patient who uses 3 20-mg tablets of furosemide twice daily, the single scheduled home oral diuretic dose would be 60 mg of furosemide. All loop diuretics were calculated as oral furosemide equivalents (FEs) based on the following conversions used in the DOSE trial: bumetanide 1 mg oral = furosemide 40 mg oral = torsemide 20 mg oral; furosemide 40 mg oral = furosemide 20 mg IV. The main exposure was home oral loop diuretic dose defined as FEs ≤ 40 mg (low home dose) vs > 40 to 80 mg FEs (medium home dose) and > 80 mg FEs (high home dose).

Receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing, which was defined per DOSE and Randomized Evaluation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction Patients with Acute Heart Failure and Dopamine as at least 2 times the home oral loop diuretic dose in IV formulation. For example, if a patient was on 40 mg twice daily of torsemide at home, then the optimal initial IV dosing would be ≥ 80 mg IV FEs. Hospital LOS was defined as the number of nights a patient stayed in the hospital. In this analysis, 30-day readmission rates were defined based on all-cause admissions and HF-related readmissions. HF readmissions were collected based on International Classification of Diseases-9th/10th Revision codes for I50.x. In these analyses, receiving optimal initial IV diuretic dosing was used as the exposure variable.

### A novel prodrug-based strategy to increase effects of bumetanide in epilepsy [^d6e524cc]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

There is considerable interest in using bumetanide, a chloride importer Na-K-Cl cotransporter antagonist, for treatment of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy or ischemic and traumatic brain injury, that may involve deranged cellular chloride homeostasis. However, bumetanide is heavily bound to plasma proteins (~98%) and highly ionized at physiological pH, so that it only poorly penetrates into the brain, and chronic treatment with bumetanide is compromised by its potent diuretic effect.

Methods

To overcome these problems, we designed lipophilic and uncharged prodrugs of bumetanide that should penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily than the parent drug and are converted into bumetanide in the brain. The feasibility of this strategy was evaluated in mice and rats.

Results

Analysis of bumetanide levels in plasma and brain showed that administration of 2 ester prodrugs of bumetanide, the pivaloyloxymethyl (BUM1) and N, N-dimethylaminoethylester (BUM5), resulted in significantly higher brain levels of bumetanide than administration of the parent drug. BUM5, but not BUM1, was less diuretic than bumetanide, so that BUM5 was further evaluated in chronic models of epilepsy in mice and rats. In the pilocarpine model in mice, BUM5, but not bumetanide, counteracted the alteration in seizure threshold during the latent period. In the kindling model in rats, BUM5 was more efficacious than bumetanide in potentiating the anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbital.

Interpretation

Our data demonstrate that the goal of designing bumetanide prodrugs that specifically target the brain is feasible and that such drugs may resolve the problems associated with using bumetanide for treatment of neurological disorders.

### Diuretic response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: characteristics and clinical outcome – an analysis from RELAX-AHF [^06c35710]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Definitions

Diuretic response was defined as change in weight (kg) from baseline to day 5/[(total i.v. dose)/40 mg] + [(total oral dose)/80 mg] furosemide up to day 5. The last available weight was substituted for a missing day 5 weight. Additional comparative analyses were performed on diuretic response from baseline to 48 h. Loop diuretic doses considered equivalent to 40 mg of furosemide were 2 mg of bumetanide, 20 mg of torasemide, and 50 mg of ethacrynic acid. Worsening renal function was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL to day 5 (or day 4, if day 5 was missing)).

### Errors in the administration of intravenous medications in hospital and the role of correct procedures and nurse experience [^9ca37144]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

We used an undisguised observational technique and nurses were aware that our study was investigating problems in medication administration procedures and errors. It is possible that nurses changed their behaviours when observed. The outcomes of this possible bias would be to lead to an underestimation of the 'true' error and procedural failure rates. The length of the study, which involved researchers being on the wards for many months, reduces the likelihood of sustained behaviour change by nurses on busy hospital wards. Further, observational studies of clinicians in situ have suggested that the extent of behaviour change is minimal. For example, Dean Franklin and Barberfound no difference in the rate of omitted medication doses when nurses in a UK hospital were observed versus those times when they were not. Our sample also only relates to Australian nurses and thus may not be generalisable to countries with very different nursing practice.

Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of IV administration errors reflect knowledge and/or skill deficiencies, with errors reducing in the first few years of clinical experience. A proportion of errors are also associated with routine violationswhich are likely to be learnt workplace behaviours which persist regardless of increased clinical experience. Both areas suggest specific targets for intervention. Such interventions could include more training and supervision of new nurse graduates and consideration of a reduced use of bolus intravenous infusions. Raising nurses' awareness of the high intravenous administration error rate is also likely to be helpful in reinforcing compliance with correct procedures. Nurses receive very limited feedback of outcome data about performance and the nearly total absence of studies on this topic in the last 5 years is likely to have contributed to its low profile as an important safety issue.
