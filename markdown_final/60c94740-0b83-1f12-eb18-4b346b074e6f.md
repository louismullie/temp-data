## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of coronary arteriosclerosis in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating coronary arteriosclerosis in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and whether this is primary prevention, secondary prevention, or chronic coronary disease. Then, I should verify the core pharmacologic pillars: statins, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure management. Next, I will extract dosing from authoritative sources and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I should consider special populations and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant regimen and highlight monitoring and shared decision-making points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Coronary arteriosclerosis in adults spans primary prevention (no established ASCVD), secondary prevention (established CAD, prior MI, revascularization), and chronic coronary disease/stable angina; dosing and intensity differ by category, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring recommendations to the right prevention tier and guideline set.

> I will now examine statin therapy, the cornerstone for slowing atheroma progression and reducing events. For secondary prevention or chronic coronary disease, high-intensity statins are preferred in adults ≤ 75 years unless contraindicated, with examples including atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily; if high-intensity is not tolerated, moderate-intensity statins are appropriate, and in adults > 75 years, a clinician–patient discussion balances benefits, interactions, and preferences, with continuation reasonable if tolerated [^1114nMiT] [^115YG7LC] [^113yvSgn]. Wait, let me verify the treat-to-target versus high-intensity debate: the LODESTAR randomized trial showed that a treat-to-target LDL-C 50–70 mg/dL strategy was noninferior to high-intensity statins for 3-year MACE, supporting flexibility when high-intensity therapy is not feasible or tolerated, though high-intensity remains first-line in most U.S. guidance [^111QzQMo] [^1114nMiT].

> Next, I should review antiplatelet therapy. For secondary prevention or chronic coronary disease without an indication for oral anticoagulation, lifelong low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily is recommended; in patients with prior MI or PCI, this follows an initial period of DAPT, whereas in those without prior MI/PCI but with significant obstructive CAD, ESC 2024 supports lifelong aspirin 75–100 mg daily after shared decision-making, and in primary prevention, routine aspirin is discouraged given bleeding risk, with selective use only in carefully chosen high-risk, low-bleeding-risk adults after clinician–patient discussion [^116PgChc] [^111zMxq7] [^113HFECB] [^1169KHVQ]. Hold on, I should verify dosing nuance: multiple high-quality sources converge on 75–100 mg daily as the optimal secondary prevention dose balancing ischemic benefit and bleeding risk, with no advantage to higher doses and increased bleeding at higher doses [^111zWgQn] [^111fkfXz].

> I need to check blood pressure management because hypertension accelerates atherogenesis. In chronic coronary disease, target blood pressure is < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, with first-line agents including ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and beta-blockers for compelling indications such as recent MI or angina; add-on therapy with dihydropyridine CCBs, thiazide diuretics, or MRAs is reasonable to reach goal, and nonpharmacologic measures are foundational [^111uNVAq] [^111yyMDk] [^113rpZLc]. Let me reconsider whether beta-blockers are broadly indicated in stable CAD without prior MI: contemporary guidance reserves beta-blockers for compelling indications rather than routine use, aligning with more selective deployment in this population [^111yyMDk].

> Now, I should extract specific dosing from authoritative labels and reconcile any discrepancies. For atorvastatin, FDA labeling supports 10–80 mg daily for cardiovascular risk reduction in CAD, which encompasses both moderate and high intensity; clinically, 40–80 mg is used for high intensity and 10–20 mg for moderate intensity, consistent with guideline intensity definitions [^111b1ZbZ] [^1114nMiT]. For rosuvastatin, 20–40 mg daily corresponds to high intensity, and 5–10 mg to moderate intensity, again aligning with guideline schemas [^notfound] [^1114nMiT]. For lovastatin, the FDA lists 10–80 mg daily in 1–2 divided doses; however, hold on, I should verify intensity mapping: lovastatin is not categorized as high-intensity in contemporary U.S. guidelines, so it is generally considered moderate intensity at 20–40 mg daily, and the 80 mg dose is rarely used due to myopathy risk and lack of modern outcome data, so I should not overstate its role in current practice [^115PhvH7] [^1114nMiT]. For simvastatin, I initially thought 80 mg might be acceptable, but wait, I need to correct that: the 80 mg dose is restricted to patients already on it chronically without toxicity, and the recommended range is 20–40 mg daily, with lower maxima when interacting drugs are present, so I should not recommend 80 mg routinely [^115DEmJb].

> I should confirm antiplatelet dosing specifics. Low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily is the standard for secondary prevention; the ADAPTABLE trial found no difference between 81 mg and 325 mg for MACE but higher bleeding with 325 mg, reinforcing the preference for 81–100 mg in routine practice [^117PWgMq]. In patients at high ischemic risk and low-to-moderate bleeding risk with chronic coronary disease, adding low-dose rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily to aspirin can be considered to reduce MACE, but I need to ensure careful bleeding risk assessment before escalating antithrombotic therapy [^112k3bpm].

> Let me consider special populations and interactions. In adults > 75 years, statin decisions should be individualized; the LODESTAR post hoc analysis suggests a treat-to-target approach achieves comparable outcomes with less high-intensity statin use, supporting tailored therapy when tolerance or safety is a concern [^114wkEeP]. For simvastatin, I should double-check interaction limits: do not exceed 20 mg daily with amlodipine, and avoid 80 mg with CYP3A4 inhibitors; these constraints matter when combining with common antihypertensives or antiarrhythmics [^115DEmJb]. For aspirin, I need to ensure no history of major GI bleeding, high bleeding risk on HAS-BLED, or concurrent anticoagulation before prescribing for secondary prevention, and in primary prevention, avoid routine use altogether [^113HFECB] [^1169KHVQ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and LDL-C goals. Even when using fixed-intensity statins, checking a lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or change, then periodically, is prudent to assess adherence and percent LDL-C reduction; while the U.S. moved away from strict LDL-C targets, many clinicians operationalize ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high-risk secondary prevention and consider < 70 mg/dL as a reasonable threshold for very high risk, with the LODESTAR treat-to-target arm explicitly aiming for 50–70 mg/dL and achieving noninferior outcomes [^111QzQMo]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary guidance: yes, percent reduction and absolute LDL-C levels are both used to guide intensity and add-on therapy decisions in practice, especially when considering ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors for persistent elevation [^117PWgMq].

> I will now synthesize a practical regimen by scenario. For established CAD or chronic coronary disease in adults ≤ 75 years: start high-intensity statin such as atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily if tolerated; if not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statin and consider a treat-to-target approach to 50–70 mg/dL LDL-C; add low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily lifelong unless contraindicated; and target blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg with ACEi/ARB, adding beta-blocker for recent MI or angina and other agents as needed [^1114nMiT] [^116PgChc] [^111uNVAq]. For adults > 75 years with established CAD: individualize statin intensity, consider treat-to-target to 50–70 mg/dL, and continue aspirin if already on it and bleeding risk is acceptable; prioritize tolerability and drug–drug interactions [^113yvSgn] [^114wkEeP]. For primary prevention: do not start aspirin routinely; use statins based on 10-year ASCVD risk, risk enhancers, and consider CAC scoring to refine decisions, with moderate-intensity statins for intermediate risk and high-intensity for high risk or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [^111QWr6D] [^117PWgMq].

> But wait, what if the patient has advanced subclinical atherosclerosis with high CAC and no established events? Emerging expert opinion suggests that patients with CAC ≥ 300 have event rates akin to secondary prevention and may reasonably be considered for aspirin after shared decision-making if bleeding risk is low, though this extends beyond traditional primary prevention and should be framed as individualized, evidence-informed care rather than routine practice [^117MbuM1] [^111WaHQH].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan emphasizes adherence and follow-up. Poor statin adherence is common and strongly linked to worse outcomes; reinforcing adherence, checking for interactions, and reassessing goals at each visit improves real-world effectiveness and aligns with guideline-directed medical therapy principles [^113V4pk1] [^115kuAvy]. I should double-check that the patient understands bleeding signs with aspirin and muscle symptoms with statins, and I should schedule labs to verify LDL-C response and liver enzymes when clinically indicated, adjusting therapy accordingly [^117PWgMq].

For adult coronary arteriosclerosis, use **high-intensity statins** (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL when tolerated; if not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statins and add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as needed [^1114nMiT] [^111QzQMo] [^112QMZmt]. Aspirin **75–100 mg daily** is indicated for secondary prevention unless contraindicated [^116PgChc] [^111zMxq7]. For hypertension, target < 130/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers as first-line, adding calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics as needed [^111uNVAq] [^113rpZLc]. Adjust doses for age, comorbidities, and drug interactions, and monitor lipids, liver enzymes, and renal function regularly [^117PWgMq].

---

## Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)

Statins are the cornerstone of therapy for coronary arteriosclerosis, lowering LDL-C and reducing cardiovascular events [^113V4pk1]. High-intensity statins are **first-line** for secondary prevention in adults ≤ 75 years unless contraindicated [^1114nMiT].

| **Statin** | **High-intensity dose** | **Moderate-intensity dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Atorvastatin | 40–80 mg daily | 10–20 mg daily |
| Rosuvastatin | 20–40 mg daily | 5–10 mg daily |
| Simvastatin | Not recommended | 20–40 mg daily |
| Pravastatin | Not recommended | 40–80 mg daily |
| Lovastatin | Not recommended | 20–40 mg daily |

---

High-intensity statins are preferred to achieve **≥ 50% LDL-C reduction** and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; if not tolerated, use moderate-intensity statins and add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as needed [^111QzQMo] [^112QMZmt].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin is indicated for secondary prevention in coronary arteriosclerosis to reduce recurrent events [^116PgChc]. The **recommended dose** is 75–100 mg daily [^111zWgQn].

---

## Antihypertensive therapy

Hypertension management is critical; target **< 130/80 mmHg** when tolerated [^111uNVAq]. First-line agents include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, with calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics added as needed [^111yyMDk].

---

## Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers are indicated for patients with coronary arteriosclerosis, particularly after myocardial infarction or with ongoing angina. The **recommended dose** of metoprolol is 50–200 mg daily in divided doses.

---

## Calcium channel blockers

Calcium channel blockers are used for symptomatic management, particularly in vasospastic angina. The **recommended dose** of amlodipine is 5–10 mg daily [^111q5LQX].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustments

Regular monitoring of lipid profiles, liver enzymes, and renal function is essential. Adjust doses based on **tolerance, efficacy, and safety** [^115gmsjj].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Use caution with high-intensity statins; consider moderate-intensity statins and adjust doses based on tolerance and renal function [^113yvSgn].
- **Drug interactions**: Simvastatin and lovastatin interact with CYP3A4 inhibitors; adjust doses accordingly [^115DEmJb].
- **Adherence**: Emphasize adherence to therapy to maximize cardiovascular benefits [^113V4pk1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Medication class** | **Recommended dose** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Statins | High-intensity (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg daily) | First-line therapy for secondary prevention |
| Aspirin | 75–100 mg daily | Secondary prevention |
| Beta-blockers | Metoprolol 50–200 mg daily | Post-MI, angina |
| Calcium channel blockers | Amlodipine 5–10 mg daily | Vasospastic angina, symptomatic management |
| Antihypertensives | ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers | Blood pressure control |

---

The recommended dosage for treating coronary arteriosclerosis in adults includes **high-intensity statins**, aspirin, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antihypertensives, with dosing individualized based on patient characteristics and tolerance.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^111QzQMo]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In patients with coronary artery disease, some guidelines recommend initial statin treatment with high-intensity statins to achieve at least a 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). An alternative approach is to begin with moderate-intensity statins and titrate to a specific LDL-C goal. These alternatives have not been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial involving patients with known coronary artery disease.

Objective

To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in patients with a coronary disease diagnosis treated at 12 centers in South Korea (enrollment: September 9, 2016, through November 27, 2019; final follow-up: October 26, 2022).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the LDL-C target strategy, with an LDL-C level between 50 and 70 mg/dL as the target, or high-intensity statin treatment, which consisted of rosuvastatin, 20 mg, or atorvastatin, 40 mg.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was a 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization with a noninferiority margin of 3.0 percentage points.

Results

Among 4400 patients, 4341 patients (98.7%) completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9.9] years; 1228 females [27.9%]). In the treat-to-target group (n = 2200), which had 6449 person-years of follow-up, moderate-intensity and high-intensity dosing were used in 43% and 54%, respectively. The mean (SD) LDL-C level for 3 years was 69.1 (17.8) mg/dL in the treat-to-target group and 68.4 (20.1) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin group (n = 2200) (P = 0.21, compared with the treat-to-target group). The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with coronary artery disease, a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the suitability of a treat-to-target strategy that may allow a tailored approach with consideration for individual variability in drug response to statin therapy.

### Adherence with cardiovascular medications and the outcomes in patients with coronary arterial disease: "Real-world" evidence [^113R1j7N]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In general, the impact of age on "statin adherence" in the secondary prevention of CAD remains controversial. Actually, statins are generally not sufficient to recommend among older patients (aged ≥ 75) with known CVD by current guidelines. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelinerecommend and the US Preventive Services Task Force did not recommend it. A recent meta‐analysis of RCTs showed significant reductions in major coronary events in all age groups (including those older than 75 years) among participants with known vascular disease. However, in a propensity‐adjusted analysis of real‐world data, Rothschild et al.found statin therapy had no significant effect on long‐term survival in older adults hospitalized patients with CAD, but without adjustment for medication adherence. In contrast, another observational study based on patients withatherosclerotic CVD found high‐intensity statins were associated with a small but significant survival advantage compared with moderate‐intensity statins (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94) compared with those receiving submaximal doses. In the current study, we found that good adherence was associated with reduced mortality in patients with CAD regardless of age (< 65 or > 65 years), which suggested the benefit of statins persisted in older patients with CAD. However, due to the scarcity of data, we can't perform a subgroup analysis based on sex over 75 years. Therefore, the benefit of the effect of good adherence to statin in CAD patients with older age needs to be further investigated.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111urNer]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy with ACEis, ARBs, or β-blockers as first-line therapy for compelling indications (such as recent myocardial infarction or angina) in adult patients with chronic coronary disease and hypertension (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), in addition to nonpharmacological strategies. Initiate additional antihypertensive medications (such as dihydropyridine CCBs, long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) as needed to optimize BP control.

### Optimizing statin treatment for primary prevention of coronary artery disease [^112WL8Uc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although treating to lipid targets ("treat to target") is widely recommended for coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention, some have advocated administering fixed doses of statins based on a person's estimated net benefit ("tailored treatment").

Objective

To examine how a tailored treatment approach to statin therapy compares with a treat-to-target approach.

Design

Simulated model of population-level effects of treat-to-target and tailored treatment approaches to statin therapy.

Data Sources

Statin trials from 1994 to 2009 and nationally representative CAD risk factor data.

Target Population

U.S. persons aged 30 to 75 years with no history of myocardial infarction.

Time Horizon

Lifetime effects of 5 years of treatment.

Perspective

Societal and patient.

Intervention

Tailored treatment based on a person's 5-year CAD risk (simvastatin, 40 mg, for 5% to 15% CAD risk and atorvastatin, 40 mg, for CAD risk > 15%) versus treat-to-target approaches that escalate statin dose per National Cholesterol Education Program [NCEP] III guidelines (including an intensive approach that advances treatment whenever intensification is optional by NCEP III criteria).

Outcome Measures

Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).

Compared with the standard NCEP III approach, the intensive NCEP III approach treated 15 million more persons and saved 570,000 more QALYs over 5 years. The tailored strategy treated a similar number of persons, as did the intensive NCEP III approach, but saved 500,000 more QALYs and treated fewer persons with high-dose statins.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

No circumstances were found in which a treat-to-target approach was preferable to tailored treatment.

Limitation

Model assumptions were based on available clinical data, which included few persons 75 years or older.

Conclusion

A tailored treatment strategy prevents more CAD events while treating fewer persons with high-dose statins than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-based target approaches. Results were robust, even with assumptions favoring a treat-to-target approach.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: It is time to start stepping away [^115yQDFN]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

When interpreting these findings, there are some caveats to note. First, the dose of aspirin therapy varied across trials although it is reassuring that in a sensitivity analysis, there was no significant difference in risk of MI or of major bleeding with aspirin ≤ 100 mg/d vs > 100 mg/d. Furthermore, this meta-analysis was based on aggregate data from trials with varied participants, outcomes, and follow-up. Similarly, ASCVD and bleeding risk were based on aggregate-level data, which may not accurately reflect individual-level risk.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings of this analysis have important implications for clinicians. Ultimately, in primary prevention patients — especially those already on statin therapy — the absolute risks of aspirin appear to outweigh the benefits at every level of risk. However, this unfavorable risk-benefit ratio is not reflected in aspirin use in the general population. Indeed, among primary prevention adults aged ≥ 40 years, 23.4% (approximately 29 million individuals) take aspirin for prevention of ASCVD; of these, nearly one-quarter (6.6 million individuals) do so without a clinician's recommendation. Furthermore, nearly half of the people older than 70 years without known ASCVD report taking aspirin for primary prevention. These sobering statistics underscore the widespread prevalence of inappropriate aspirin use.

However, before we stop aspirin in all primary prevention patients, we must consider the increasing number of patients who fall in the "grey zone" between primary and secondary prevention, such as those with subclinical atherosclerosis found on imaging. Several epidemiologic studies indicate that individuals with elevated coronary artery calcification scores may have more favorable risk-benefit ratios with aspirin therapy than those without any calcification. Similarly, observational studies suggest that people with elevated lipoprotein(a) may benefit from aspirin therapy, even in the absence of known ASCVD. However, rigorous, randomized trials of aspirin therapy in these high-risk populations are lacking. Thus, shared decision-making and personalized risk classification are still of utmost importance when deciding about any therapy for ASCVD prevention.

Overall, the analysis by Khan et alprovides added insights into the decreasing role of aspirin therapy in primary prevention, helping to guide our discussions with patients who are understandably confused about whether or not they should take aspirin daily. This study highlights that while decision-making about preventive therapies should be tailored to and made in conjunction with patients, we need to start stepping away from the routine use of aspirin therapy in primary prevention, especially in the modern era of statins.

### Statin adherence and effects on Outcome in premature coronary Artery Disease [^113V4pk1]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Lipid lowering therapy with statins is the cornerstone of treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Meta-analysis of secondary prevention trials showed an average 21% reduction of major cardiovascular events for every 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent national guidelines recommend earlier age of lipid screening and treatment, intensification of LDL-lowering goals, and maintaining that target long term to prevent recurrent CV ischemic events.

Adherence to statin therapy in real world stands is in sharp contrast to the guidelines with only 30% adherence at 2 years after acute coronary syndrome. There is a graded inverse association between statin adherence and intensity with mortality in stable atherosclerotic CV disease. Adherence has been found to be lower in women, younger and older adults, Blacks and Hispanics vs Whites, and best compliance rates are seen in the 65- to 74-year-old adults.

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin treatment in older adults with coronary artery disease: a post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial [^114wkEeP]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal statin treatment strategy that is balanced for both efficacy and safety has not been clearly determined in older adults with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

In the post hoc analysis of the LODESTAR (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) trial, the impact between a treat-to-target strategy versus a high-intensity statin therapy strategy was compared in older adults (aged 75 years or older). The goal of treat-to-target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 50–70 mg/dl. The primary endpoint comprised the three-year composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke or coronary revascularisation.

Results

Among 4,400 patients with CAD enrolled in the LODESTAR trial, 822 (18.7%) were aged 75 years or older. Poor clinical outcomes and risk factors for atherosclerosis were more frequently observed in older adults than in younger population (< 75 years old). Among these older adults with CAD, the prescription rate of high-intensity statin was significantly lower in the treat-to-target strategy group throughout the study period (P < 0.001). The mean LDL-C level for three years was 65 ± 16 mg/dl in the treat-to-target strategy group and 64 ± 18 mg/dl in the high-intensity statin group (P = 0.34). The incidence of primary endpoint occurrence was 10.9% in the treat-to-target strategy group and 12.0% in the high-intensity statin group (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.61–1.38, P = 0.69).

Conclusions

High-intensity statin therapy is theoretically more necessary in older adults because of worse clinical outcomes and greater number of risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, the primary endpoint occurrence with a treat-to-target strategy with an LDL-C goal of 50–70 mg/dl was comparable to that of high-intensity statin therapy and reduced utilisation of a high-intensity statin. Taking efficacy as well as safety into account, adopting a tailored approach may be considered for this high-risk population.

### Strategies for the prevention of coronary artery disease complications: can we Do better? [^112K46mM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Billions of dollars have been spent over the past 25 years on developing new therapies for the prevention/treatment of adverse cardiac events related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although some therapies have been lifesaving, several mega-randomized studies have shown only a < 2% absolute reduction in adverse events with a large residual event rate. Is all this money well spent? Atherosclerosis develops decades before an adverse event, and the trials previously alluded to have nearly always been applied to secondary prevention, decades after disease initiation. Will earlier intervention result in a lower incidence of events? Individuals with an absence of the usual cardiac risk factors have a lifelong low incidence of events. Early initiation of strategies against the common cardiovascular risk factors in primary or primordial prevention will lower the incidence of adverse events, although many groups have not been well studied, including individuals younger than 40 years of age. New strategies are required to realize a radical reduction in events, and this article proposes new methods of prevention/treatment for coronary artery disease complications.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^117MbuM1]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent publication by our writing group highlighted a novel category within the CV risk continuum — advanced subclinical atherosclerosis. These asymptomatic patients are at a high risk of CV events due to the presence of substantial underlying subclinical atherosclerosis as determined exclusively by their plaque burden. As such, they are best thought of as distinct from traditional primary prevention (where aspirin has a limited role) and secondary prevention (where aspirin is categorically recommended). For example, patients with CAC > 300 have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events equivalent to patients with known obstructive CAD, even without exploration for degree of coronary stenosis.

If patients with asymptomatic coronary stenosis of 50% are considered to have CCS and, therefore, benefit from low-dose aspirin, then should these recommendations also apply to those with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis who have been demonstrated to have similar event rates? We think the answer is yes. We believe that the concepts of advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and asymptomatic CCS overlap, and the recent guideline regarding the management of asymptomatic CCS with low-dose aspirin can be reasonably extended to advanced subclinical atherosclerosis when there are no bleeding risk factors (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Correlation Between Asymptomatic Chronic Coronary Syndrome, Advanced Subclinical Atherosclerosis, and Low-Dose Aspirin

ACS = acute coronary syndrome; ANOCA = angina with no obstructive CAD; CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CAC = coronary artery calcium; CAD = coronary artery disease; CCS = chronic coronary syndrome; CCTA = coronary computed tomography angiography; CPS = carotid plaque ultrasound; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; INOCA = ischemia with no obstructive CAD; LV = left ventricular; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention.

As it is almost never recommended to actively search for obstructive CAD in asymptomatic patients, we propose to consider patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis, determined by any proven method, as having CCS, even if the degree of coronary stenosis has not been evaluated. Moreover, since low-dose aspirin is associated with a risk of bleeding, we recommend weighing the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin therapy and prescribing low-dose aspirin only for patients aged < 70 years who are projected to obtain a clear net clinical benefit from preventive therapy. As such, patients with no detectable atherosclerosis should rarely if ever take aspirin.

### Coronary artery calcium in 2023: guidelines for LDL-C goals, non-statin therapies, and aspirin use [^111WaHQH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Personalizing risk assessment and treatment decisions for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) rely on pooled cohort equations and increasingly coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. A growing body of evidence supports that elevated CAC scores correspond to progressively elevated ASCVD risk, and that scores of ≥ 100, ≥ 300, and ≥ 1000 denote risk that is equivalent to certain secondary prevention populations. This has led consensus guidelines to incorporate CAC score thresholds for guiding escalation of preventive therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals, initiation of non-statin lipid lowering medications, and use of low-dose daily aspirin. As data on CAC continues to grow, more decision pathways will incorporate CAC score cutoffs to guide management of blood pressure and cardiometabolic medications. CAC score is also being used to enrich clinical trial study populations for elevated ASCVD risk, and to screen for subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in patients who received chest imaging for other diagnostic purposes.

### Major global coronary artery calcium Guidelines [^114qPkCA]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the framework behind global guidelines of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment, for applications in both the clinical setting and preventive therapy. By comparing similarities and differences in recommendations, this review identifies most notable common features for the application of CAC presented by different cardiovascular societies across the world. Guidelines included from North America are as follows: 1) the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease; and 2) the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for Prevention of Adult Cardiovascular Disease. The authors also included European guidelines: 1) the 2019 European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias; and 2) the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guidelines. In this comparison, the authors also discuss: 1) the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Guidelines on CAC; 2) the Chinese Society of Cardiology Guidelines; and 3) the Japanese Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases. Last, they include statements made by specialty societies including the National Lipid Association, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Utilizing an in-depth review of clinical evidence, these guidelines emphasize the importance of CAC in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. International guidelines all empower a dynamic clinician-patient relationship and advocate for individualized discussions regarding disease management and pharmacotherapy treatment. Some differences in precise coronary artery calcium score intervals, risk cut points, treatment thresholds, and stratifiers of specific patient subgroups do exist. However, international guidelines employ more similarities than differences from both a clinical and functional perspective. Understanding the parallels among international coronary artery calcium guidelines is essential for clinicians to correctly adjudicate personalized statin and aspirin therapy and further medical management.

### Does lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin restore low risk in middle-aged adults? Analysis of the observational Mesa study [^113pYgbB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unclear if statin therapy in midlife can restore low cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic individuals.

Methods and Results

At baseline, we grouped 5687 MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants aged ≥ 50 years without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) by Adult Treatment Panel III statin treatment recommendation and statin treatment status. We used Cox regression to compare the risks for coronary heart disease and CVD between the untreated group with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) < 100 mg/dL (reference) and other groups, adjusting for CVD risk factors. We also grouped participants by LDL‐C level (< or ≥ 100 mg/dL), coronary artery calcium score (0 or > 0 Agatston units), and statin status (untreated or treated) with the untreated LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL and coronary artery calcium = 0 Agatston units as the reference. There were 567 coronary heart disease and 848 CVD events over 15 years of follow‐up. The hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary heart disease and CVD in the group with statin‐treated LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL were 1.16 (95% CI, 0.85–1.58) and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78–1.32), respectively. However, participants with coronary artery calcium > 0 Agatston units, treated to LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL had HRs of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.7–4.2) for coronary heart disease and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2–2.6) for CVD.

Conclusions

Individuals treated with statins to LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL had similar levels of risk for atherosclerotic CVD as individuals with untreated LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL. However, individuals with coronary artery calcium > 0 Agatston units have substantially higher risks despite lipid‐lowering therapy, suggesting that statin treatment in midlife may not restore a low‐risk state in primary prevention patients with established coronary atherosclerosis.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — coronary artery calcium (CAC)–guided statin decisions — in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk) adults or selected borderline-risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults in whom a CAC score is measured for the purpose of making a treatment decision, if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years so long as higher-risk conditions are absent; if the CAC score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the CAC score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. Additionally, in intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention — adult risk categories, statins, and coronary artery calcium (CAC): Three higher-risk categories are severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and adults 40 to 75 years; patients with severe hypercholesterolemia or diabetes mellitus aged 40 to 75 years are candidates for immediate statin therapy without further risk assessment, and adults with diabetes mellitus should start with a moderate-intensity statin with possible escalation to high-intensity as risk factors accrue. In other adults 40 to 75 years, 10-year ASCVD risk should guide therapy; when risk is uncertain or statin therapy is problematic, measuring CAC can help refine risk, and a CAC score equal to zero is useful for reclassifying to lower risk, often allowing statin therapy to be withheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are present. For patients > 75 years, RCT evidence for statins is not strong, necessitating clinician-patient risk discussion to decide on initiation or continuation.

### Statin therapy: where are we? Where do we go next? [^111U5HL4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention trials including patients with elevated and average cholesterol levels. The association between reduction of total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and preventive benefit is well established. However, additional risk factors for coronary artery disease need to be incorporated into risk assessment to provide an accurate measure of global risk for use in lifestyle intervention and drug therapy guidelines. Assessment of outcomes in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study primary prevention trial, which involved patients with average cholesterol levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), suggests the importance of on-treatment values of apolipoproteins B and A-I in predicting first major events in such a population. Other data, including trials of fibrate therapy showing reduction in coronary artery disease events, support the importance of triglycerides and HDL-C in coronary artery disease risk. Challenges for future treatment guidelines include incorporation of emerging and novel risk factors into risk assessment, refinement of global risk measurement, and simplification for application to clinical practice.

Nonetheless, for patients or clinicians who are concerned about uncertainty after a global risk estimation is made, a coronary artery calcium score could be especially useful, particularly if the number of coronary arteries with calcified plaque — indicating increasingly "diffuse" multivessel subclinical atherosclerosis — is used to enhance the prediction of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events. 19

### Rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease: secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial [^113Me9xH]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Study procedures

Adherence to the assigned statin type (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) was strongly recommended during the entire follow-up period. The intensity of statin treatment was classified on the basis of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemia. In each statin type group, the intensity of statin was titrated or maintained following the assigned statin intensity strategy, and the principles for titration or maintenance were identical for both groups. Briefly, in the group assigned to receive the treat-to-target strategy, statin naïve participants were started on moderate intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg), and those already using a statin received a corresponding intensity of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin based on their LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation (equivalent intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels < 1.8 mmol/L or an up-titrated intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L). During follow-up, we titrated statin intensity based on the obtained LDL cholesterol levels: up-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.8 mmol/L, maintenance of the same intensity without titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.3 mmol/L and < 1.8 mmol/L, and down-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were < 1.3 mmol/L. For participants assigned to receive the high intensity statin strategy, high intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg) was initiated and maintained irrespective of patients' LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation and follow-up. Adding non-statin agents, such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, was strongly not recommended to focus on data for statin treatment and to prevent confounding. Data on the use of the study drugs were collected from doctors' records of prescriptions, and drug adherence was measured by participants' self-reported pill count. For other medical treatments, guideline directed treatment was strongly recommended, and modification of risk factors, including blood pressure or glucose control, weight reduction, exercise, dietary changes, and smoking cessation, was also encouraged.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk — recommendations for adults. For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk-enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (e.g., statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), if risk-based decisions for preventive interventions remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30-year ASCVD risk may be considered.

Assessment of cardiovascular risk (2019 ACC/AHA) — For adults 40 to 75 years of age, clinicians should routinely assess traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calculate 10-year risk of ASCVD by using the pooled cohort equations (PCE). For adults 20 to 39 years of age, it is reasonable to assess traditional ASCVD risk factors at least every 4 to 6 years. In adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) or intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk), it is reasonable to use additional risk‑enhancing factors to guide decisions about preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy). In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‑year ASCVD risk) or selected adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk), if risk‑based decisions for preventive interventions (eg, statin therapy) remain uncertain, it is reasonable to measure a coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician–patient risk discussion. For adults 20 to 39 years of age and for those 40 to 59 years of age who have < 7.5% 10‑year ASCVD risk, estimating lifetime or 30‑year ASCVD risk may be considered; among those at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, further testing to document subclinical coronary atherosclerosis is reasonable to more accurately reclassify the risk estimate upward or downward.

Statin therapy selection and intolerance — although high-intensity statin therapy is preferred, it may not be tolerated or may be contraindicated due to clinically significant drug–drug interactions; statin intolerance is defined as adverse effects that improve or resolve with dose modification or discontinuation and requires a trial of at least 2 statins with one at the lowest approved daily dose; clinicians should also consider the possibility of a "nocebo effect"; for patients unable to tolerate a high-intensity statin, a moderate-intensity statin should be used, and additional strategies (eg, low-intensity statin, alternative daily dosing) may also be used to identify a tolerable regimen, though it is unclear if these strategies reduce ASCVD events.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^111wE4gP]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Stable CAD

Aspirin remains the cornerstone for secondary prevention of patients with stable CAD, irrespective of the management strategy. In a large meta-analysis including 16 secondary prevention trials and 17 000 high-risk patients, low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE (cardiovascular (CV) death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)) (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88), a 31% relative risk reduction in MI (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and a 22% relative risk reduction in ischaemic stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), at the expense of an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90) and major extracranial bleeding (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.76). Aspirin marginally reduced CV mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, p = 0.06), resulting in a 10% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, p = 0.02). At variance of the antiplatelet effects, the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin increase at higher doses. The optimal risk:benefit ratio appears to be achieved with an aspirin dosage of 75–150 mg daily.

### Total angiographic regression of coronary atherosclerosis with optimal medical therapy [^115BNRJE]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery disease has shown a dramatic increase worldwide. According to the current guidelines, optimal medical therapy (OMT) is recommended as the first-line treatment for stable angina; with revascularisation being reserved for those with persistent or progressive symptoms despite intensive medical therapy. We report the case of a young man with stable angina, who was advised percutaneous coronary intervention for stenosis of left anterior descending artery. As he was not willing for the same, he was treated with OMT (according to the then relevant Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines) and therapeutic lifestyle changes, following which he became asymptomatic along with total regression of the atherosclerotic plaque on coronary angiogram. This case highlights that OMT can be an effective line of management in patients with stable angina; and interventions like angioplasty, stents and surgery may be reserved for those who do not respond adequately.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement — intermediate-risk adults and statin decision thresholds: In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be effective for meaningfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of individuals, and in such intermediate-risk adults, those with coronary artery calcium = 100 AU or coronary artery calcium ≥ 75th percentile have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event rates for which initiation of statin therapy is reasonable. Those with coronary artery calcium scores of zero appear to have 10-year event rates in a lower range for which statin therapy may be of limited value. For those with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99 AU, 10-year ASCVD event rates are 3.8%, 6.5%, and 8.3% for adults 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 years of age, respectively, indicating that risk reclassification is modest for individuals with scores of 1 to 99; therefore, for patients with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99, it is reasonable to repeat the risk discussion, and if these patients remain untreated, repeat CAC measurement in 5 years may have some value, but data are limited.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115qCcBH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for 1 of every 3 deaths among adults.

Objective

To update the 2008 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of dyslipidemia in adults 21 years and older; the benefits and harms of statin use in reducing CVD events and mortality in adults without a history of CVD events; whether the benefits of statin use vary by subgroup, clinical characteristics, or dosage; and the benefits of various treatment strategies in adults 40 years and older without a history of CVD events.

Conclusions and Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater (B recommendation). The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer low- to moderate-dose statins to adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to 10% (C recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older (I statement).

Clinical recommendations for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) state that high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be used, when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A). In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate ASCVD risk-reduction benefits, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it (Class IIa; Level of Evidence: A). Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

ACC/AHA primary prevention — risk-based statin therapy and coronary artery calcium (CAC) use in adults: For age 40–75 y with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL without diabetes mellitus, a 10-year ASCVD risk discussion is initiated and actions align with risk strata: < 5% "Low Risk" emphasizes lifestyle (Class I); 5% - < 7.5% "Borderline Risk" considers moderate-intensity statin if risk enhancers are present (Class IIb); ≥ 7.5% - < 20% "Intermediate Risk" favors initiating moderate-intensity statin to reduce LDL-C by 30% - 49% (Class I); and ≥ 20% "High Risk" initiates statin to reduce LDL-C ≥ 50% (Class I). When risk decision is uncertain, CAC = zero lowers risk and clinicians may consider no statin unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, or cigarette smoking are present; CAC = 1–99 favors statin (especially after age 55); CAC = 100+ and/or ≥ 75th percentile indicates statin therapy. Additional branches specify LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL warrants high-intensity statin without risk assessment (Class I), diabetes mellitus age 40–75 y warrants moderate-intensity statin (Class I) with risk assessment to consider high-intensity statin (Class IIa), and age > 75 y requires clinical assessment and risk discussion.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Effect of recombinant human growth hormone therapy on blood lipid and carotid intima-media thickness in children with growth hormone deficiency [^1129Go3o]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is an endocrine disease that can affect an individual's life during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) replacement therapy is a standard treatment option for normalizing the final adult height in GHD children. Growth hormone (GH) can promote linear growth, accelerate protein synthesis, and stimulate bone growth; moreover, it has specific effects on the body composition, muscle strength, bone density, blood lipid level, and endothelial function.

Dyslipidemia in childhood is a risk factor for adult cardiovascular diseases, such as arteriosclerosis. Adults and adolescents with severe GHD also frequently exhibit dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and changes in cardiac structure and function. cIMT is a non-invasive predictive indicator of atherosclerotic processes in the coronary arteries. Previous research has shown that both short-term and long-term rhGH therapies have specific effects on abdominal fat, blood lipids, and intimal thickness regardless of age in adults or children.

Few data are available regarding the blood lipid and cIMT levels as well as the variations in these parameters following rhGH therapy in GHD children from Asian, particularly those from Chinese populations. In addition, the dose of rhGH for treating GHD children, as recommended by the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Chinese Short Stature Children, is 0.23–0.35 mg/kg/week, which can promote linear growth in a dose-dependent manner. However, which dose of rhGH is more effective in improving blood lipid and cIMT in GHD children remains unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of different doses of rhGH therapy on blood lipid and cIMT levels in Chinese GHD children.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. 1 One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. 1 With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Statin benefit groups identified in the 2013/cholesterol management guideline./indicates American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association;, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;‐C, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Several studies have been conducted since the guideline was introduced in an attempt to identify the potential impact of the guideline. In studies evaluating statin prescribing in which the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was determined by coronary imaging, a greater proportion of patients were eligible for a statin based on the ACC/AHA guideline compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline. 2, 3 Chia et al compared the Pooled Cohort Risk Score with actual practice data from 1998 to 2007 and found that statin use would need to increase under the new guideline. 4, 5 Preguideline data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008–2012) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005 to 2010 were assessed to estimate the impact of the guideline on statin practice patterns. This analysis found that compliance with the new guideline should result in a meaningful increase in statin use, especially in the group of patients with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. 6, 7

ACC/AHA statin therapy performance measure for chronic stable coronary artery disease defines the "Percentage of patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were offered moderate- to high-intensity statin", with a numerator including those who "Have been offered* high-intensity statin†" or "Have been offered* moderate-intensity statin† and have documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing high-intensity statin". A statin is "offered" if it is prescribed or if a patient reason exception is documented. The denominator is "All patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were seen within a 12-mo period", with "Denominator Exclusions: None" and "Denominator Exceptions: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not prescribing a statin (e.g., allergy, intolerance to statin(s), other medical reasons)". The period of assessment is "12 mo", attribution is "Clinician practices caring for patients with CAD", and "Moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin doses are defined in Table 5 of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults (5)".

Based on newer clinical trial data, the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension guidelines for the elderly recommend a less aggressive approach of < 145/90 mm Hg in those over the age of 80 years. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at an increased risk of coronary artery disease using the both the 2007 AHA and the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines. We used a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 participants. Participants were 10198 adults aged 18 to 85 years. Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), 72 million Americans (35%) have hypertension. Using the 2007 AHA guidelines, an additional 7 million American adults (5%) have elevated BP requiring treatment, for a total of 79 million adults (40%). Although individuals at a higher risk for coronary artery disease are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertension medication, they are less likely to have their BP under control. Additional efforts are needed in the treatment of elevated BP, especially among individuals with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

### Cardiovascular risk estimation and eligibility for statins in primary prevention comparing different strategies [^117NCuPG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations for statin use for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on estimation of the 10-year CHD risk. It is unclear which risk algorithm and guidelines should be used in European populations. Using data from a population-based study in Switzerland, we first assessed 10-year CHD risk and eligibility for statins in 5,683 women and men 35 to 75 years of age without cardiovascular disease by comparing recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology without and with extrapolation of risk to age 60 years, the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the US Adult Treatment Panel III. The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12.5% (15.4% with extrapolation), 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively. Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9.2% (11.6% with extrapolation), 13.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. Assuming full compliance to each guideline, expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10-year period would be 16.4% (17.5% with extrapolation), 18.7%, and 19.3%, respectively; the corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations. Following the International Atherosclerosis Society and the Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations might prevent more CHD deaths at the cost of higher numbers needed to treat compared with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^113mBF3R]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Dietary advice from a certified dietitian/nutritionist given to the parents should start after age 2 of the child. Dietary recommendations are similar to those given to adults with FH; particular caution is however needed to avoid caloric restriction (if weight is normal) and to monitor the growth curve.

Priorities for cholesterol-lowering drugs in children are given earlier. However, it is unknown at what age atherosclerotic lesions become irreversible, only short-term follow-up data are available that low dosages of statins are safe in children, and there is no long-term study evaluating the cardiovascular benefit of cholesterol-lowering drugs in children. Therefore, as is common in paediatrics, the therapeutic decision is based on extrapolation from adult studies and on short-term paediatric studies evaluating the safety and the efficacy of pharmacotherapy on LDL cholesterol lowering or intermediate endpoints. Thus, a registry of statin-treated children to collect meaningful follow-up data is urgently needed. Studies in children have shown this medication to be safe when started from age 8 to 10 and, based on the graphical assumption in Figure 8, we therefore recommend initiation of statin therapy at age 8–10, that is, when the diagnosis of FH is supported by a genetic test or by strong clinical arguments including LDL cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L (> 135 mg/dL). As mentioned earlier, the LDL cholesterol target in children is < 3.5 mmol/L (< 135 mg/dL); however, the presence of very high LDL cholesterol or additional cardiovascular risk factors (Figure 8) may lower this target or the age at initiation of statin therapy. Importantly, lipoprotein apheresis should be offered in children with homozygous FH.– Despite initial enthusiasm, the therapeutic potential of double heart–liver transplantation in children with homozygous FH should be considered with caution.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium [^1172yRWG]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

Chronic Stable Angina

Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.

Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina)

Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents.

Angiographically Documented CAD

In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%, amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.

Atorvastatin

Therapy with HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (lipid-altering agents) should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease from hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet restriction.

1.3 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Adults

In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI)
Reduce the risk of stroke
Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina

In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction
Reduce the risk of stroke

In adult patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:

Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction
Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke
Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures
Reduce the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF)
Reduce the risk of angina

### Current options in the management of coronary artery disease [^1131ki7M]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

World Health Organization projections suggest that, for the foreseeable future, coronary artery disease (CAD) will remain the largest element of global disease burden, reflecting the aging of the population. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines estimate that 16.6 million Americans currently have stable angina. Chronic stable angina is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, thus highlighting the need for accurate and early detection and treatment. Clinical examination is the single most important step in evaluating risk. Age, sex, pain type, coexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or known vascular disease are powerful predictors of prognosis and, except for special patient groups, are more reliable than ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, or electron-beam computed tomography. Cost-effective methods for screening the general population for "silent" risk factors predisposing them to atherosclerotic disease in later life are nevertheless required. Aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents are currently the backbone of pharmacologic therapy, supplemented by lifestyle changes aimed at promoting exercise, weight reduction, and increased fruit and vegetable intake. However, side effects of chronic drug treatment, especially for those taking multidrug regimens, may affect quality of life and are the principal reason for poor compliance. Coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty are frequently used interventional procedures for CAD, although they can be invasive and costly, and they often need to be repeated. Current options for the management of CAD have their limitations, thus confirming the appropriateness of continuing the search for improved therapies to reverse the disease process and reduce the global burden.

### Effect of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids added to statin therapy on coronary artery plaque in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^114HTS3e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although statins reduce cardiovascular events, residual risk remains. Therefore, additional modalities are needed to reduce risk. We evaluated the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in pharmacologic doses added to statin treatment on coronary artery plaque volume.

Methods and Results

A total of 285 subjects with stable coronary artery disease on statins were randomized to omega-3 ethyl-ester (1.86 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.5 g of docosahexaenoic acid daily) or no omega-3 (control) for 30 months. Coronary plaque volume was assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography. Mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.7) years; mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤ 80 mg/dL. In the intention-to-treat analysis, our primary endpoint, noncalcified plaque volume, was not different between groups (P = 0.14) but approached significance in the per protocol analysis (P = 0.07). When stratified by age in the intention-to-treat analysis, younger omega-3 subjects had significantly less progression of the primary endpoint, noncalcified plaque (P = 0.013), and fibrous, calcified and total plaque. In plaque subtype analysis, controls had significant progression of fibrous plaque compared to no change in the omega-3 ethyl-ester group (median % change [interquartile range], 5.0% [-5.7, 20.0] versus -0.1% [-12.3, 14.5], respectively; P = 0.018). Among those on low-intensity statins, omega-3 ethyl-ester subjects had attenuation of fibrous plaque progression compared to controls (median % change [interquartile range], 0.3% [-12.8, 9.0] versus 4.8% [-5.1, 19.0], respectively; P = 0.032). In contrast, those on high-intensity statins had no difference in plaque change in either treatment arm.

Conclusions

High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid provided additional benefit to statins in preventing progression of fibrous coronary plaque in subjects adherent to therapy with well-controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The benefit on low-intensity statin, but not high-intensity statin, suggests that statin intensity affects plaque volume.

### European and US guideline-based statin eligibility, genetically predicted coronary artery disease, and the risk of major coronary events [^115jP2Kt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of death worldwide. The European and US guidelines on primary prevention of CVD recommend lifestyle modification and lipid‐lowering treatment for individuals at high risk of future CVD based on clinical risk scores including the European‐Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (European‐SCORE2) and US‐Pooled Cohort Equation (US‐PCE) models. However, many individuals who develop CVD have an estimated clinical risk score below the guideline‐recommended thresholds whereas many of those who are judged to be at high risk of future CVD will not develop the disease. Therefore, strategies to accurately identify those who will be over‐ or undertreated with lipid‐lowering treatment are of clinical importance.

Recently, common genetic variants have emerged as risk factors for CVD that provide information on disease predisposition from an earlier age. By summing each of the common genetic variants in the form of polygenic risk scores (PRSs), genetic testing may significantly contribute to the prediction of disease onset that may outperform traditional risk factors. However, the added value of PRS for CAD on established clinical risk scores has been modest and a broad genetic testing strategy has been discouraged.

The most relevant questions in this context would be (1) is there a specific population in whom targeted genetic testing will impact contemporary management, and (2) if so, to what extent would the genetic testing added to established clinical risk scores prevent over‐ or undertreatment? To address these questions, we investigated the predictive power of CAD‐PRS added to clinical risk scores across European and US guideline‐based statin eligibility strata and assessed the extent to which over‐ or undertreatment would have been prevented.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115YMVov]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Incremental benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease [^115hha2z]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical trials found that high-dose statin therapy, compared with conventional-dose statin therapy, reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the actual benefit and cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy are unknown.

Methods and Results

We designed a Markov model to compare daily high-dose with conventional-dose statin therapy for hypothetical 60-year-old cohorts with ACS and stable CAD over patient lifetime. Pooled estimates for major clinical end points (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, rehospitalization, and revascularization) from relevant clinical trials were incorporated. Incremental benefit was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Threshold analyses determined at what price difference high-dose statins would yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained. In ACS patients, a high-dose versus conventional-dose statin strategy resulted in a gain of 0.35 QALYs. In threshold analyses, a high-dose statin strategy consistently yielded incremental cost-effective ratios below $30,000 per QALY even under conservative model assumptions. In stable CAD patients, a high-dose statin strategy yielded a gain of only 0.10 QALYs and was sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy. The daily cost difference between a high- and conventional-dose statin would need to be < $1.70, $2.65, and $3.55 to yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY.

Conclusions

High-dose statin therapy is potentially highly effective and cost-effective in patients with ACS. In patients with stable CAD, however, the cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy is highly sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy and cost. Use of high-dose statins can be supported on health economic grounds in patients with ACS, but the case is less clear for patients with stable CAD.

### High-dose versus low-dose pitavastatin in Japanese patients with stable coronary artery disease (REAL-CAD): a randomized superiority trial [^113HLL23]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Editorials, see pand p

Clinical Perspective

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, and lowering LDL-C with statins has proved effective for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). – Several previous "more versus less statins" trials in patients with CAD demonstrated that high-intensity statin therapy significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy. – On the basis of these results, the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends high-intensity statin therapy in patients ≤ 75 years of age with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, whereas the current European Society of Cardiology guideline recommends an LDL-C target of ≤ 70 mg/dL for patients with very high cardiovascular risk. However, high-intensity statin therapy is not widely implemented in daily clinical practice, particularly in Asia, at least partly because there has been no previous trials of more versus less statins in Asia. – Therefore, we conducted a large outcome trial comparing the efficacy of high-dose versus low-dose statin therapy in patients with established stable CAD in Japan. Our goal was to determine whether higher-dose statin therapy would be beneficial and safe in Japanese patients.

### Aspirin resistance: current status and role of tailored therapy [^112C9Ryz]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Aspirin is integral in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome. Given the high clinical importance of aspirin in the management of coronary artery disease, much attention has been directed towards the concept of "aspirin resistance". Unfortunately, the term aspirin resistance is ill-defined in the literature, leading to a large variance in the reported prevalence of this phenomenon. In this review, the current understanding of aspirin resistance is discussed. Commonly used functional and diagnostic tests of platelet function, including their strengths and weakness, are reviewed. We next discuss several proposed mechanisms of aspirin resistance and special high-risk groups at risk for aspirin treatment failure. We then discuss optimal dosing and diagnostic strategies for those populations at risk for aspirin resistance with a focus on tailored aspirin therapy for high-risk groups. Finally, future topics of interest in the field of aspirin resistance are considered.

### Life course approach for managing familial hypercholesterolemia [^115xKS4d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes lifelong exposure to elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and consequent risk of premature coronary artery disease (CAD). About 1:200 to 1:500 individuals in any population are typically affected, with higher rates in populations with founder effects. Current recommendations emphasize the need for cholesterol‐lowering therapy from a young age to prevent CAD, starting earliest for those with homozygous (HoFH) and heterozygous FH (HeFH) with severe elevations of LDL‐C, as events are directly related to the duration of chronic LDL‐C exposure. Patients who initiate treatment in childhood have the best long‐term outcomes. Fortunately, many medications to lower LDL‐C have now been approved for prescribing to children and adolescents, with new medications currently being tested in clinical trials. Initiating care at a young age is cost effective. The ability to lower LDL‐C to concentrations not previously achievable together with improved capacity to detect subclinical atherosclerosis by vascular imaging provides a unique opportunity to better understand the natural history of FH and develop optimal therapeutic strategies.

While current guidelines are useful for guiding the initiation of treatment in youth and provide treatment targets at various ages on the basis of LDL‐C, many questions remain regarding lifelong management. Should risk stratification beyond LDL‐C level guide intensity of treatment? Is there a role for atherosclerosis imaging to monitor treatment outcomes? What happens during pregnancy when many lipid‐lowering medications are contraindicated and suspended, and should women who choose to breastfeed remain off lipid‐lowering therapy for as long as they breastfeed? Can there be "drug holidays" where treatment can be deferred (or less intense) for a period of time? In the future, when newborn screening may identify children at birth, what should be done with regard to prevention in the first decade of life? How do personal circumstances and the family's experience with FH impact care? How do you manage the older patient with FH without a prior heart attack and no atherosclerosis? And how does the diversity of international health care resources impact the earliest possible initiation of FH care?

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111zWgQn]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = 0.05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### Applying the evidence: do patients with stroke, coronary artery disease, or both achieve similar treatment goals? [^115wuCiK]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The importance of early and aggressive initiation of secondary prevention strategies for patients with both coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is emphasized by multiple guidelines. However, limited information is available on cardiovascular protection and stroke prevention in an outpatient setting from community-based populations. We sought to evaluate and compare differences in treatment patterns and the attainment of current guideline-recommended targets in unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with CAD, CVD, or both.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, cohort study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2004 among ambulatory patients in a primary care setting. The prospective Vascular Protection and Guidelines-Oriented Approach to Lipid-Lowering Registries recruited 4933 outpatients with established CAD, CVD, or both. All patients had a complete fasting lipid profile measured within 6 months before enrollment. The primary outcome measure was the achievement of blood pressure (BP) < 140/90 mm Hg (or < 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L (< 97 mg/dL) according to the Canadian guidelines in place at that time (similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program's value of 100 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include use of antithrombotic, antihypertensive, and lipid-modifying therapies.

Results

Of the 4933 patients, 3817 (77%) had CAD only; 647 (13%) had CVD only; and 469 (10%) had both CAD and CVD. Mean ± SD age was 67 ± 10 years, and 3466 (71%) were male. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 130 ± 16 and 75 ± 9 mm Hg, respectively. Minor but significant differences were observed on baseline BP, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol measurements among the 3 groups. Overall, 83% of patients were taking a statin and 93% were receiving antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents). Compared with patients with CAD, those with CVD only were less likely to achieve the recommended BP (45.3% vs 57.3%, respectively; P < 0.001) and lipid (19.4% vs 30.5%, respectively; P < 0.001) targets. Among patients with CVD only, women were less likely to achieve the recommended BP and lipid targets compared with their male counterparts (for LDL cholesterol < 2.5 mmol/L, 18.7% vs 23.8%, respectively; P = 0.048). In multivariable analysis, patients with CVD alone were less likely to achieve treatment success (BP or lipid targets) after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, and use of pharmacologic therapy.

Conclusions

Despite the proven benefits of available antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapies, current management of hypertension and dyslipidemia continues to be suboptimal. A considerable proportion of patients failed to achieve guideline-recommended targets, and this apparent treatment gap was more pronounced among patients with CVD and women. Quality improvement strategies should target these patient subgroups.

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^113JBjgv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Antiplatelet drugs are the cornerstone of treatment in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce the risk of future ischemic events. However, there has been controversy about the optimal dose of aspirin for secondary prevention in ASCVD. The ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient‐Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long‐Term Effectiveness) was a phase 3 multicenter randomized controlled trial that compared low‐dose aspirin (81 mg) with high‐dose aspirin (325 mg) and found no overall difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) or bleeding. However, it remains unknown whether concomitant therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor modifies the effect of aspirin dose on future risk of cardiovascular events and major bleeding in a stable population of patients with ASCVD.

Dual‐antiplatelet therapy, which typically includes oral aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is commonly prescribed in patients after an acute coronary syndrome and those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as these patients are at a high risk of recurrent thrombotic events. By providing additional platelet inhibition, dual‐antiplatelet therapy mitigates the risk of stent thrombosis and reduces the risk of MACEs in such patients. However, the optimal dose of aspirin in patients also receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor remains unclear. Given their potent antiplatelet effects, P2Y12 inhibitors can provide substantial ischemic risk reduction but may lead to higher bleeding risk. Therefore, concomitant therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor may tip the balance in favor of low‐dose aspirin, especially with regard to reduction in bleeding risk. On the other hand, a need for P2Y12 inhibitor therapy may be representative of patients at increased risk of ischemic events (eg, recent myocardial infarction [MI]), who may benefit from higher‐dose aspirin for ischemic risk reduction. Prior studies of the relative effectiveness of aspirin dosing in patients also receiving P2Y12 inhibitors have been primarily conducted in patients who were discharged from a hospital with acute coronary syndrome. The relative effectiveness of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin in patients taking concomitant P2Y12 inhibitors with stable ASCVD remains less clear.

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis of the ADAPTABLE to address whether the relative effectiveness and safety of low‐ versus high‐dose aspirin differs in patients who were also receiving P2Y12 inhibitor at randomization.
