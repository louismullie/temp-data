## Question

Signs and symptoms of pertussis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the signs and symptoms of pertussis across age groups, including diagnostic implications and complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic three-stage clinical course and how it manifests in typical cases. Then, I should verify how age modifies presentation, especially in infants versus adolescents and adults. Next, I will examine the diagnostic value of specific clinical features and the role of overall clinical impression. After that, I need to check complications by age and severity. Finally, I will integrate testing implications and synthesize a practical, age-stratified clinical approach with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the canonical staging framework, because anchoring on the catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent phases helps structure expectations of timing and symptoms. The catarrhal stage typically lasts 1–2 weeks with nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms such as coryza, sneezing, mild cough, and low-grade or absent fever, and patients are most infectious during this period, which is why early recognition is hard but crucial for transmission control [^117CSxDr] [^1124hVrH]. The paroxysmal stage follows with characteristic bursts of rapid coughs ending in an inspiratory whoop, posttussive vomiting, cyanosis, and exhaustion, often peaking in frequency and severity over 1–2 weeks before gradually declining; this is the stage that gives the disease its name and is most diagnostically recognizable when present [^117CSxDr] [^112k5aEC]. The convalescent stage features a slow improvement over weeks to months, with cough gradually lessening but prone to recurrence with intercurrent viral infections, which explains persistent cough long after the acute phase [^117CSxDr] [^1165nwv7].

> Wait, let me verify how age alters this classic picture, because missing infant presentations is a common pitfall. In infants under 6 months, and especially under 2 months, the whoop is often absent and apnea may be the predominant or only manifestation; cyanosis, bradycardia, feeding difficulties, and poor intake are common, and the disease can progress rapidly to severe complications, so a high index of suspicion is essential even without classic features [^117CSxDr] [^1165nwv7]. In older children, the classic triad of paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and posttussive vomiting is more likely to appear, though vaccination attenuates severity and modifies the course, shortening cough duration and reducing paroxysm severity compared with unvaccinated peers [^112YoqrH]. In adolescents and adults, the presentation is frequently atypical: a prolonged cough without whoop or vomiting is common, and systemic symptoms such as sweating between paroxysms, weight loss, insomnia, and rib pain may dominate, which is why pertussis is often overlooked in this group [^1138m6W7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single symptom being pathognomonic. I need to check the diagnostic accuracy of individual clinical features. In adults, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever are highly sensitive but nonspecific, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting are less sensitive but more specific; practically, the presence of whoop or posttussive vomiting should raise suspicion, while the absence of paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever lowers the likelihood of pertussis [^111JQLJM]. In children, posttussive vomiting is the most studied feature and shows only moderate sensitivity and specificity, underscoring that no single sign reliably rules in or out pertussis in pediatrics without laboratory support [^112Ghk3v]. I should double-check that overall clinical impression often outperforms individual features; indeed, clinician gestalt has been shown to be the most accurate single predictor at presentation, which reinforces the need to integrate duration, pattern, age, and epidemiology rather than relying on a single sign [^114hiz5m].

> Let me consider the infant-specific red flags and laboratory correlates, because early recognition changes outcomes. In young infants, the combination of afebrile illness, persistent or worsening cough, and watery coryza should prompt strong suspicion, and the addition of apnea, cyanosis, seizures, or pneumonia increases specificity; marked leukocytosis with lymphocytosis, often with WBC counts exceeding 20,000/µL, is highly suggestive and correlates with severe disease risk in this age group [^114zDAK6] [^112k5aEC]. I should confirm that apnea can be the only symptom in neonates, which means absence of cough does not exclude disease; this is precisely where early PCR testing and inpatient observation are critical to prevent deterioration [^117CSxDr] [^111Bwb7m] [^116wA1fr].

> Next, I should review complications by age, because they both inform prognosis and guide urgency of therapy and monitoring. In infants, pulmonary complications predominate, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension linked to lymphocytosis, encephalopathy from hypoxia, seizures, and death; nutritional compromise from feeding difficulties and recurrent vomiting is also common and can be life-threatening in the youngest patients [^1165nwv7] [^114VKUv8]. In older children, complications are less frequent but still significant, including pneumonia, otitis media, syncope, and rib fractures during severe paroxysms, while in adolescents and adults, mechanical complications such as rib fractures, pneumothorax, urinary incontinence, and severe sleep disturbance are well described, with hospitalization occurring in a minority but with substantial morbidity and healthcare utilization [^114VKUv8] [^1138m6W7].

> I need to ensure I integrate diagnostic testing implications with the clinical picture, because timing and age determine test choice. Early in the course, particularly within the first 2–3 weeks of cough, PCR from a properly collected nasopharyngeal specimen is preferred due to higher sensitivity than culture; culture remains 100% specific but is less sensitive and logistically challenging, whereas serology becomes more useful after 2–3 weeks, especially in older children and adults, and is not reliable in infants [^115JfKgH] [^111Bwb7m]. But wait, what if the patient presents late? After about 3 weeks, PCR sensitivity declines and serology or paired titers may be needed; nonetheless, treatment decisions should not be delayed when clinical suspicion is high, given the public health imperative to reduce transmission even if symptom benefit is limited [^115JfKgH] [^111yX4m5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, age-stratified approach, and I should confirm alignment with guideline-based recommendations. For adults with acute or subacute cough, I should actively assess for paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whoop, and absence of fever; the presence of whoop or posttussive vomiting rules in pertussis, while the absence of paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever makes it less likely, prompting alternative diagnoses or deferral of testing unless risk is high [^111oZbpS] [^111zU7JA]. For children with acute cough, I should ask about the classic triad and consider pertussis more likely with posttussive vomiting, recognizing that no single feature is definitive and that testing should be guided by pretest probability and duration of illness [^112AmyVT] [^112Ghk3v]. For infants, I should maintain a low threshold to test and treat based on compatible features even without the whoop, given the risk of rapid deterioration and the frequency of atypical presentations in this group [^117CSxDr] [^1165nwv7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fever was uncommon in pertussis and therefore a useful rule-out, but I should verify the strength of that claim. While fever is typically absent or low-grade, especially early, its diagnostic utility as a standalone rule-out is limited by low specificity; the absence of fever modestly increases likelihood, but its presence does not reliably exclude pertussis, so I should avoid overinterpreting a single temperature finding without the broader clinical context [^111JQLJM]. I should also remember that vaccinated patients often have attenuated or atypical courses, so absence of classic features cannot safely exclude disease when epidemiology or duration is suggestive, reinforcing the need for integrated clinical judgment and timely testing [^112YoqrH] [^114hiz5m].

> Finally, I will now examine the public health implications briefly, because recognizing pertussis in older individuals changes infant outcomes. Adolescents and adults are frequently the reservoir for infant cases, and household transmission studies show that siblings and parents are the most common sources; therefore, diagnosing and treating older cases promptly, along with appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for high-risk contacts, directly reduces infant morbidity and mortality, which is why maintaining clinical suspicion in prolonged cough is not just diagnostic prudence but a prevention strategy [^112aHnT1] [^113ktKik].

Pertussis presents in **three stages** — catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent — with symptoms varying by age and vaccination status [^117CSxDr]. The **catarrhal stage** features mild, nonspecific URI symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, and a mild cough) that last 1–2 weeks [^11312S6m]. The **paroxysmal stage** is defined by violent coughing fits ending in a high-pitched "whoop", post-tussive vomiting, cyanosis, and exhaustion; infants may have apnea without a whoop [^117CSxDr] [^11312S6m]. The **convalescent stage** shows a gradual decline in cough frequency and severity over weeks to months, with lingering fatigue and recurrent cough [^117CSxDr]. Fever is typically absent or low-grade; complications are most severe in infants, including pneumonia, apnea, seizures, and death [^1165nwv7].

---

## Clinical stages and symptoms

### Catarrhal stage (stage 1)

- **Duration**: 1–2 weeks [^11312S6m].
- **Symptoms**: Mild, nonspecific URI symptoms — runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever, and a mild, occasional cough [^11312S6m].
- **Infectiousness**: High; bacteria are easily transmitted via respiratory droplets [^112vwsiw].

---

### Paroxysmal stage (stage 2)

- **Duration**: 1–6 weeks (can extend to 10 weeks) [^11312S6m].
- **Symptoms**: Characteristic paroxysmal coughing fits ending in a high-pitched "whoop" upon inspiration; post-tussive vomiting, cyanosis, and exhaustion are common [^111yJXpL] [^11312S6m].
- **Infant-specific symptoms**: Apnea, bradycardia, and feeding difficulties; the "whoop" may be absent [^116wA1fr] [^112k5aEC].
- **Nighttime predominance**: Coughing fits are more frequent at night [^117CSxDr].

---

### Convalescent stage (stage 3)

- **Duration**: Weeks to months [^114VKUv8].
- **Symptoms**: Gradual decline in cough frequency and severity; lingering fatigue and recurrent cough [^1124hVrH].
- **Triggers**: Intercurrent respiratory infections can temporarily worsen cough [^1165nwv7].

## Age-specific clinical manifestations

| **Age group** | **Typical symptoms** | **Atypical/attenuated symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Infants (< 6 months) | - Apnea <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Cyanosis <br/> - Poor feeding <br/> - Minimal or absent cough [^11312S6m] [^1165nwv7] | - Classic "whoop" is often absent <br/> - Symptoms may mimic viral infections [^113wveex] |
| Children (6 months–12 years) | - Paroxysmal cough <br/> - Post-tussive vomiting <br/> - Inspiratory whoop <br/> - Cyanosis [^111yJXpL] [^11312S6m] | - Milder symptoms in vaccinated children <br/> - Shorter duration of cough [^112YoqrH] |
| Adolescents and adults | - Prolonged cough <br/> - Milder paroxysms <br/> - Post-tussive vomiting <br/> - Fatigue [^111yJXpL] [^11312S6m] | - Classic "whoop" is rare <br/> - Often misdiagnosed as bronchitis or asthma [^112HJQnn] [^115QxfS7] |

---

## Complications

Complications vary by age and severity, with infants bearing the highest risk:

- **Pulmonary complications**: Pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax, and pulmonary hypertension [^117CSxDr].
- **Neurologic complications**: Seizures, encephalopathy, and intracranial hemorrhage [^114VKUv8].
- **Nutritional complications**: Weight loss, dehydration, and feeding difficulties [^117CSxDr].
- **Musculoskeletal complications**: Rib fractures, muscle strains, and urinary incontinence [^114VKUv8].
- **Death**: Most common in infants under 6 months [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Clinical suspicion**: Essential, especially in prolonged cough or in infants with apnea or feeding difficulties [^114CbpV3] [^113YUd2o] [^112vwsiw].
- **Laboratory confirmation**: PCR is preferred; culture is specific but less sensitive; serology is useful later in the course [^115JfKgH] [^115wRHEH].
- **Leukocytosis**: Elevated WBC with lymphocytosis is common, especially in infants [^114zDAK6].

---

Pertussis has a **prolonged, stage-based course** with age-dependent features; **early recognition** is critical to reduce transmission and complications, particularly in infants [^117CSxDr].

### Pertussis symptoms in adolescents and children versus infants: the influence of vaccination and age [^112ybzrP]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

This study compared the influence of age and immunization status on symptoms in pediatric patients with pertussis. The files of 60 children, aged 7 to 18 years and 20 infants aged up to 6 months, admitted to our pediatric hospital with a diagnosis of pertussis were reviewed. There were no between-group differences in day and night cough or vomiting. The older group had a longer mean interval to diagnosis than the infants, and the infant group had more symptoms of whooping cough, facial redness during cough, cyanosis, a higher white blood count, a higher percentage of lymphocytes, and more abnormal chest X-rays. Statistically significant differences were found between vaccinated and unvaccinated older children for whooping cough and white blood cell count. Daytime and nighttime coughs are common symptoms of pertussis in all pediatric age groups, regardless of vaccination status. High white blood count is related to immunization status, and percentage of lymphocytes is related to age. In infants, symptoms are more grave but are typical, leading to early diagnosis.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^111i5URA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a respiratory infection caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria. Classic pertussis is a cough illness that may last for many weeks and is marked by paroxysms of repeated coughs that end with a gasping "whoop". Historical records describing a pertussis-like disease go back approximately 1000 years [1], and genetic analyses suggest that the bacterium has been associated with humans for millions of years [2]. Outbreaks of pertussis were recorded in Persia in the 15th century [3], and an outbreak that resulted in many deaths among infants and young children was documented in Paris in the summer of 1578 [4]. British records from the early 16th century and the 1701 London Bills of Mortality reported whooping cough [5]. (Please note that the complete references are available as online Supplemental Materials.)

Pertussis is endemic worldwide, with epidemic peaks every 2–5 years, and is highly contagious. Up to 90% of household contacts and 50% to 80% of schoolroom contacts will become infected after exposure.

### Morbidity and mortality due to Bordetella pertussis: a significant pathogen in west Africa? [^112C34w2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings are recorded for all patients who meet surveillance criteria. Clinical diagnoses that may overlap with pertussis infection in children aged 0–23 months include a clinician's diagnosis of pertussis, whooping cough, croup, and apnea in infants aged < 2 months. The surveillance system enrolled 13 192 children aged 0–23 months from 12 May 2008 to 31 October 2015. The reported diagnoses included pertussis in 4 cases, croup in 6, and apnea in 3. Thus, there is little clinical evidence of significant pertussis transmission in this population.

### Adults are whooping, but are internists listening? [^113cNkJb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although studies have shown that pertussis is responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of cases of cough lasting more than 2 weeks in adults and adolescents, physicians have generally considered pertussis a disease that affects only children. Epidemiologic trends demonstrate that the incidence of pertussis has been rising, especially in adolescents and adults. Consequently, pertussis is not a "zebra" diagnosis but deserves a place among the community-acquired list of adult pathogens. Increased awareness among physicians about pertussis is important because adults may transmit the infection to infants, in whom the disease often leads to hospitalization and may result in death. Reporting this disease to the local health department is critical to its control because both case-patients and their close contacts should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis. A booster vaccine for adolescents and adults is likely to become available in the near future, so this is an important time to ensure that all physicians, not just pediatricians, are knowledgeable about the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting requirements for pertussis.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^116eiaDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

For evidence-based decision making, primary care physicians need to have specific and reliable information on the pre-test probabilities of underlying diseases and a symptom's course. We performed a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies in primary care, following three research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of the symptom cough in children consulting primary care physicians? (2) What are the underlying aetiologies of cough and the respective frequencies? (3) What is the prognosis of children with cough?

Methods

Following a pre-defined algorithm and independent double reviewer ratings we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE. All quantitative original research articles in English, French or German were included if they focused on unselected study populations of children consulting a primary care physician for cough. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis in subgroups, if justifiable in terms of heterogeneity.

Results

We identified 14 eligible studies on prevalence, five on aetiology and one on prognosis. Prevalence estimates varied between 4.7 and 23.3% of all reasons for an encounter, or up to estimates of 60% when related to patients or consultations. Cough in children is more frequent than in adults, with lowest prevalences in adolescents and in summer. Acute cough is mostly caused by upper respiratory tract infections (62.4%) and bronchitis (33.3%); subacute or chronic cough by recurrent respiratory tract infection (27.7%), asthma (up to 50.4% in cough persisting more than 3weeks), and pertussis (37.2%). Potentially serious diseases like croup, pneumonia or tuberculosis are scarce. In children with subacute and chronic cough the total duration of cough ranged from 24 to 192days. About 62.3% of children suffering from prolonged cough are still coughing two months after the beginning of symptoms.

Conclusion

Cough is one of the most frequent reasons for an encounter in primary care. Our findings fit in with current guideline recommendations supporting a thoughtful wait-and-see approach in acute cough and a special awareness in chronic cough of the possibility of asthma and pertussis. Further evidence of aetiological pre-test probabilities is needed to assess the diagnostic gain based on patient history and clinical signs for differential diagnoses of cough in children.

Cough is a frequent presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. The differential diagnosis for cough is variable depending on patient age and symptom duration. We report the case of an elderly gentleman with a history of asthma who presented with cough, with the ultimate diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection. The management of the patient in the Emergency Department placed hospital staff at risk for infection from a virulent pathogen. Details regarding typical and atypical presentations of pertussis and the establishment of transmission-based precautions are discussed.

### Pertussis: common questions and answers [^113ktKik]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, remains a public health concern despite expanded immunization recommendations over the past three decades. The presentation of pertussis, which is variable and evolves over the course of the disease, includes nonspecific symptoms in the catarrhal stage, coughing with the classic whooping in the paroxysmal stage, and persistent cough in the convalescent stage. When there is clinical suspicion for pertussis, the diagnosis should be confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing, which has replaced culture as the preferred confirmatory test. Recent evidence has confirmed a waning of acquired immunity following pertussis immunization or infection, leading to changes in tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization recommendations. Patients 11 years or older should receive at least one dose of Tdap, although Tdap may replace any dose of the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine. All pregnant patients should receive Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation with each pregnancy to convey immunity to the newborn. Cocooning (vaccinating close contacts of high-risk individuals) is no longer recommended because immunized patients can still contract and transmit pertussis. A history of seizure or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after a prior pertussis vaccination is no longer a contraindication to immunization. Antibiotic treatment is intended to prevent transmission of pertussis to others and does not shorten the disease course or improve symptoms. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for household contacts of someone with pertussis and for those exposed to pertussis who are at high risk of severe illness (e.g., infants, people who are immunocompromised or in the third trimester of pregnancy) or in close contact with someone at high risk. Azithromycin is the preferred antibiotic for treatment or prophylaxis.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JfKgH]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis laboratory diagnosis and treatment context: There are several recognized laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis; culture (100% specific), polymerase chain reaction (88%-100% specific), serology (72%-100% specific), and oral fluid testing (91%-99% specific). There are several effective antibiotics; these eliminate B pertussis but do not alter the clinical course of the illness. However, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of illness to prevent spread of the disease. The decision to treat with antibiotics is therefore frequently based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.

HOW DO ADVANCES IN DIAGNOSTICS IMPACT CLINICAL PRACTICE?

In persons with pertussis, the median time from cough onset to seeking medical care differs by age group. For example, in 1 study setting, children aged 7–12 years were seen after 7.8 days of coughing, whereas adolescents aged 13–18 years were seen after 12.5 days and adults 17.3 days after symptoms began [and Riffelmann M, et al. unpublished data]. The interval from the onset of cough to when the patient seeks medical care has a major effect on the laboratory diagnosis of B. pertussis infection. Culture obtained during the first 3 weeks of cough has 100% specificity, but low sensitivity, ranging from 20% to 80%, when compared with PCR and/or serology. In general, culture and PCR sensitivity is inversely related to age. Other factors that may influence the sensitivity of culture are the type and quality of specimen, the type of transport media, and the duration of transport (optimally within 48 hours).

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^111MxqzP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

Introduction

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused predominantly by infection with the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, as well as other bacteria of the Bordetella genus. Historically, this common childhood disease led to high infant mortality, until the development and widespread use of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines significantly reduced reported cases during the second half of the twentieth century. While wP vaccines remain recommended by the WHO and widely used globally, many high-income countries have switched to acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines that became available in the 1990s –. Despite relatively high vaccine coverage worldwide (~ 85% for the primary series in the last ten years), the burden of pertussis remains considerable, with an estimated 19.9 million new cases in children aged 0–14 in 2019. Unexpectedly, a long-term resurgence of pertussis has been observed in several high-income countries with sustained high vaccination coverage, including the USA, Sweden, and Denmark. Although reported pertussis cases plummeted shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic –, many countries — especially in Europe — are now witnessing large epidemics, resulting in infant deaths. These alarming trends highlight the ongoing threats of pertussis, which remains one of the least controlled vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide.

A major challenge in pertussis epidemiological research is to estimate accurately the rates of pertussis infections. Standard surveillance systems often fall short because infections are reported only when patients exhibit symptoms, seek healthcare, and receive a clinical or laboratory diagnosis — with potential case loss at every step. For pertussis, this problem is thought to be acute for at least three reasons. First, asymptomatic infections may be common, especially (but not only) among vaccinated age groups. Second, clinical diagnosis based on typical pertussis symptoms — such as paroxysmal coughing, whooping, and posttussive vomiting — can be inaccurate. Third, non-pediatricians may lack awareness of pertussis disease and fail to diagnose it in adult patients. These factors collectively contribute to case underreporting, which is estimated to be substantial for pertussis –.

Conclusion

Health care professional should be in alert to identify new cases of pertussis. The early recognition of pertussis index cases by health care professionals, the treatment of the cases and prophylaxis of the contacts is fundamental to control an outbreak in the community.

### Pertussis in young infants throughout the world [^112k5aEC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In typical pertussis in young infants, the child will appear deceptively well; he or she will have coryza, sneezing, and a mild cough. There is no fever. This progresses to gagging, gasping, eye bulging, bradycardia, cyanosis, and vomiting. There is leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and apneic episodes. Deaths relate to leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia. The source of pertussis in young infants is most often a family member with cough illness that is not recognized as pertussis. Diagnosis is based on culture/polymerase chain reaction and leukocytosis with lymphocytosis. Treatment depends on macrolide antibiotic therapy and intubation, with assisted ventilation and oxygen. Prevention is based on prophylactic macrolide treatment, immunization starting at 6 weeks of age, and immunization of all pregnant women in the second or third trimester.

### Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? [^111yJXpL]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pertussis is often overlooked as a cause of chronic cough, especially in adolescents and adults. Several symptoms are classically thought to be suggestive of pertussis, but the diagnostic value of each of them is uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence regarding the diagnostic value of 3 classically described symptoms of pertussis: paroxysmal cough, posttussive emesis, and inspiratory whoop.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

We searched MEDLINE (January 1966-April 2010), EMBASE (January 1969 to April 2010), and the bibliographies of pertinent articles to identify relevant English-language studies. Articles were selected that included children older than 5 years, adolescents, or adults and confirmed the diagnosis of pertussis among patients with cough illness (of any duration) with an a priori-defined accepted reference standard. Two authors independently extracted data from articles that met selection criteria and resolved any discrepancies by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Five prospective studies met inclusion criteria; 3 were used in the analysis. Presence of posttussive emesis (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.2) or inspiratory whoop (summary LR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6) increases the likelihood of pertussis. Absence of paroxysmal cough (summary LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.0) or posttussive emesis (summary LR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77) reduced the likelihood. Absence of inspiratory whoop was less useful (summary LR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66–0.93). No studies evaluated combinations of findings.

Conclusions

In a nonoutbreak setting, data to determine the diagnostic usefulness of symptoms classically associated with pertussis are limited and of relatively weak quality. The presence or absence of posttussive emesis or inspiratory whoop modestly change the likelihood of pertussis; therefore, clinicians must use their overall clinical impression to decide about additional testing or empirical treatment.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113Q31bD]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several findings of the current study were important for clinical practice: (a) laboratory confirmed pertussis can be present in children irrespective of cough duration; (b) children with pertussis with different cough durations have clinical features that are influenced by the child's age and immunization state; and(c) those with chronic cough have nonspecific cough, lacking characteristic symptoms. This may suggest that in the context of the likely underestimation of the burden of pertussis, the "one-size-fits-all" clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal to recognize this disease in a population and large comprehensive studies of children with all types of cough is required to confirm or refute our findings. This may make substantial inroads into increasing both the sensitivity and specificity in pertussis diagnosis, will impact public health.

This study also suggests that amoxicillin maybe an alternative for children with marolide-resistant B.pertussis infection. But these analysis were only based on the in vitro test, as the dose and course of treatment were not clear. Clinical studies should be designed and performed to confirm that this alternative drug could eliminate the bacteria in vivo effectively.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^113JyYoZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In a previous report, Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) participants described the difficulties in defining pertussis from a clinical perspective. Today, many different case definitions are used throughout the world. Most case definitions are supplemented with laboratory and epidemiologic data so that reports may be categorized as confirmed, probable, or suspect. Case definitions also vary depending on the situation in which they are used. For example, in vaccine efficacy trials, specificity is expected to be close to 100%. Yet, in outbreak situations in states or countries, specificity is sacrificed to achieve high sensitivity, which is important for disease prevention and control.

In the prevaccine era, pertussis was considered a disease of children, and all the present clinical case definitions reflect this bias. With the current awareness that pertussis is common in adolescents and adults and that disease manifestations may be different in older persons, it is apparent that the "one-size-fits-all" clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal. In addition, there is an increasing awareness that pertussis in early infancy has many unique characteristics that should be recognized in a separate case definition in order to improve recognition of disease in this population. In this communication, we provide background data relating to current case definitions and then propose age-stratified case definitions that we believe will increase diagnostic specificity without decreasing sensitivity.

### Pertussis deaths – United States, 2000 [^114uuQmg]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Pertussis (i.e., whooping cough) is associated typically with an inspiratory "whoop", prolonged paroxysmal cough, and posttussive vomiting; however, persons infected with Bordetella pertussis sometimes experience atypical symptoms, making prompt recognition difficult and probably increasing infection transmission. All infants aged < 6 months and any infants who have not yet received 3 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine are especially vulnerable to B. pertussis infection. This report summarizes the investigations of two pertussis deaths that occurred in 2000. Clinicians should consider pertussis as a cause of illness, especially among vulnerable infants who present with cough illness, respiratory distress, or apnea. Timely diagnosis of pertussis in caregivers and other contacts of infants could prevent infant pertussis fatalities.

### Clinical diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection: a systematic review [^114hiz5m]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis (BP) is a common cause of prolonged cough. Our objective was to perform an updated systematic review of the clinical diagnosis of BP without restriction by patient age.

Methods

We identified prospective cohort studies of patients with cough or suspected pertussis and assessed study quality using QUADAS-2. We performed bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary estimates of accuracy and created summary receiver operating characteristic curves to explore heterogeneity by vaccination status and age.

Results

Of 381 studies initially identified, 22 met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 had a low risk of bias. The overall clinical impression was the most accurate predictor of BP (positive likelihood ratio [LR+], 3.3; negative likelihood ratio [LR-], 0.63). The presence of whooping cough (LR+, 2.1) and posttussive vomiting (LR+, 1.7) somewhat increased the likelihood of BP, whereas the absence of paroxysmal cough (LR-, 0.58) and the absence of sputum (LR-, 0.63) decreased it. Whooping cough and posttussive vomiting have lower sensitivity in adults. Clinical criteria defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were sensitive (0.90) but nonspecific. Typical signs and symptoms of BP may be more sensitive but less specific in vaccinated patients.

Conclusions

The clinician's overall impression was the most accurate way to determine the likelihood of BP infection when a patient initially presented. Clinical decision rules that combine signs, symptoms, and point-of-care tests have not yet been developed or validated.

### About whooping cough… [^117N65YX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a very contagious respiratory illness.
- Whooping cough may begin like a common cold, but unlike a cold, the coughing can last for weeks or months.
- Treating whooping cough early with antibiotics may make the infection less serious. What it is Whooping cough is a respiratory illness caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. The disease is only found in humans. Whooping cough bacteria attach to the cilia that line part of the upper respiratory system. The bacteria release toxins, which damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. Symptoms Symptoms of whooping cough can vary for people based on their age and if they've been vaccinated or not. Keep Reading: Symptoms. Risk factors Age and underlying medical conditions can increase someone's risk for getting a severe case of whooping cough. It's especially important to prevent these people from getting sick.

Age Babies younger than 1 year old are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough and having severe complications from it. Medical conditions People with pre-existing health conditions that may be worsened by whooping cough are at high risk for developing a severe infection. Some conditions that could be made worse by whooping cough include, but are not limited to:

- Immunocomproming conditions
- Moderate to severe medically treated asthma. How it spreads The bacteria that cause whooping cough spread easily from person to person through the air. When a person with whooping cough sneezes or coughs, they release small particles with the bacteria in them. Other people can then breathe in the bacteria. These bacteria can spread when people spend a lot of time together or share breathing space. Testing and diagnosis Whooping cough can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms are often similar to other respiratory illnesses.

It can be helpful to know if you've been in contact with someone who has whooping cough. Healthcare providers can diagnose whooping cough by doing a
- History of typical signs and symptoms
- Physical exam
- Laboratory test of a mucus sample from the back of the throat
- Blood test. Treatment and recovery It's very important to treat whooping cough early, before coughing fits begin. Healthcare providers generally treat whooping cough with antibiotics. Further treatment in the hospital may be required if symptoms are serious. Keep Reading: Treatment.

Children with chronic cough — diagnostic testing recommendations: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-β2 agonist) be undertaken (Grade 1B). For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected (Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement). For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (Grade 1B). For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) be considered (Grade 2C).

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1124hVrH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Epidemiology of Pertussis

Pertussis is an acute respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Classic pertussis disease is characterized by three phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. During the catarrhal phase, infected persons experience coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities), mild occasional cough, and low-grade fever. The paroxysmal phase is characterized by spasmodic cough, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop. Symptoms slowly improve during the convalescent phase, which generally lasts 7–10 days, but can last for months. Factors that affect the clinical presentation of pertussis include age, the level of immunity, history of vaccination, and use of antimicrobials early during the course of the illness.

B. pertussis is transmitted primarily from person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. Persons with pertussis are most infectious during the catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases of illness. Pertussis generally is treated with antibiotics, which are used to control the signs and symptoms and to prevent infected persons from spreading the infection to others. Recommended antibiotics for pertussis include azithromycin, clarithroymycin, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Guidance for the treatment of pertussis has been published previously. Guidance on postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis is available at.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^111eT4Xm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory disease that continues to infect individuals and cause deaths despite available vaccines. While there have been increases in case numbers every 2–5 years, 2024 proved to be a significant year in terms of both incidence and deaths from pertussis. Preliminary CDC data from 2025 shows a continuation of this trend with 8,472 pertussis cases through April — twice as many as the same time period in 2024. Given the high risk of severe disease and death among young infants and in un‐ or under‐vaccinated individuals, vaccination is a prevention strategy that remains a mainstay in protecting the most vulnerable.

THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF CLINICAL CASE DEFINITIONS

Recently, Ghanaie and associates studied the sensitivity and specificity of the WHO pertussis clinical case definition in 328 children aged 6–14 years with a persistent cough for ≥ 2 weeks. Pertussis was diagnosed by culture and an IS481 PCR for B. pertussis or IS1001 PCR for B. parapertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs. All but 1 of these children had received 3 or more doses of whole-cell DTP vaccine. The sensitivity was 95.2% and the specificity was 15.0% with cough ≥ 2 weeks plus ≥ 1 of the WHO clinical criteria. With an increasing number of clinical findings, sensitivity decreased and specificity increased. Posttussive emesis was the symptom that had the most pronounced effect in increasing specificity. As the entry criterion for this study was cough of > 2 weeks' duration, the mean duration of cough in the study population was 20 days, and because diagnosis was made by PCR without serologic study, it is likely that cases were missed. This would lead to an artificially low specificity.

### What's old is new again: pertussis [^116Ld8xd]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of a vaccine, pertussis is a particularly difficult disease to control. Improvements in molecular diagnosis, changes in vaccine components, and missed opportunities for vaccination have resulted in rising pertussis disease incidence. Young infants are at the highest risk of severe complications and mortality, but immunization of mothers during pregnancy can provide protection. The presentation of infant pertussis differs somewhat from the traditional catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages seen in adults. By understanding the clinical presentation of pertussis in all age groups, providers can more quickly prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy and postexposure prophylaxis. Providers are also an essential source of evidence-based vaccination counseling for pregnant women and families, and understanding the complications of this disease is an important part of these sometimes difficult but critical conversations.

If a patient meets 1 or more of the criteria for pertussis diagnosis, the physician should treat the patient and report the case to the appropriate health agencies. General comments on the clinical presentation of pertussis and its laboratory diagnosis are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

Table 4.
General Comments on Clinical Presentation of Pertussis

Table 5.
General Comments on Laboratory Diagnostics of Pertussis

There are a number of strong indicators of pertussis that differ by age group. In young infants, the occurrence of coryza and cough in an afebrile child is usually not alarming. When these young infants are seen by physicians, they are thought to have a viral respiratory infection, and the parents are reassured. However, over the next day or two, the parents recognize the worsening of symptoms, but more often than not, the physicians do not (based on author experience in California in 2010 [J. D. C.]). The key indicators of pertussis in these young infant cases are the afebrile nature of the illness combined with a cough that is increasing in frequency and severity and a coryza that remains watery. Therefore, the presence of this triad would be expected to have high sensitivity and good specificity. The addition of apnea, seizures, cyanosis, emesis, or pneumonia would result in both high sensitivity and specificity. In these young infant cases, an elevated white blood cell count (≥ 20 000 cells/µL) with absolute lymphocytosis is virtually diagnostic.

In older children (4 months to 9 years), the presence of a worsening paroxysmal, nonproductive cough of ≥ 7 days' duration in an afebrile child with coryza that has not become purulent also would indicate high sensitivity and good specificity for pertussis. As noted with current case definitions, the addition of whoop, apnea, and posttussive emesis will each increase specificity. In those persons ≥ 10 years of age, the same triad listed above for those 4 months to 9 years would also result in high sensitivity with good specificity. In addition, the notation of sweating episodes between paroxysms will significantly increase specificity. In dealing with adult patients, it is important to ask specific questions about productive cough. Adults will often say that the cough is productive, but on further questioning, it is apparent that they actually do not produce purulent sputum.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^116Zbrhy]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine-preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

### Unsuspected neonatal killers in emergency medicine [^116wA1fr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A neonate presenting to the emergency department can present a challenge to even the most experienced clinician. This article has focused on four deceiving and potentially devastating neonatal diseases. 1. Neonatal herpes is a potentially devastating illness without pathognomonic signs or symptoms. Early recognition and therapy can reduce mortality markedly. Although no specific sign or symptom is diagnostic, the diagnosis should be strongly considered in the presence of HSV risk factors, atypical sepsis, unexplained acute hepatitis, or focal seizure activity. Acyclovir therapy should be initiated before viral dissemination or significant CNS replication occurs. 2. Pertussis is a disease in which infants are at greatest risk of death or severe complication. Neonatal pertussis often presents in an atypical manner, lacking the classic signs and symptoms such as the "whoop". More common signs and symptoms include cough, feeding difficulty, low-grade fever, emesis, increasing respiratory distress, apnea, cyanosis, and seizures. Management should include hospitalization, supportive care, and antibiotics. 3. Congenital heart defects, particularly ductal-dependent lesions, may have an initial asymptomatic period that culminates in a rapidly progressive and fatal course. A neonate with CHD presents with shock refractory to volume resuscitation or pressor support. Resuscitative efforts are ineffective unless PGE, is administered. 4. Inborn errors of metabolism often are unsuspected because of their protean and heterogeneous nature. Signs and symptoms are subtle, are nonspecific, and often mimic other, more common diseases. An elevated index of suspicion, along with application and correct interpretation of a select few laboratory tests, is the key to making a diagnosis. Therapy is relatively straightforward and focused on resuscitation followed by prevention of catabolism and correction of specifically identified abnormalities. Although these disorders are relatively uncommon, prompt diagnosis and therapy can lead to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. The key is to maintain a high index of suspicion.

### Health burden of pertussis in adolescents and adults [^1138m6W7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Pertussis in adolescents and adults is common, endemic, and epidemic worldwide, and its incidence is reportedly increasing. Although a number of individuals suffer only a mild cough, many others have symptoms typical of pertussis, causing prolonged cough illness, frequent use of health care resources, missed work and a variety of complications. Symptoms experienced by adolescents and adults include sleep disturbance, weight loss, pharyngeal discomfort, influenza-like symptoms, sneezing attacks, hoarseness, sinus pain, headaches and sweating attacks. Even when symptoms are typical of pertussis, the diagnosis is often not considered in adolescents and adults because of a low awareness of the disease in these age groups. Contrary to common perceptions, complications of pertussis, including some that are serious, are not infrequent in adolescents and adults. These include urinary incontinence, rib fracture, pneumothorax, inguinal hernia, aspiration, pneumonia, seizures and otitis media. Despite underreporting, hospitalization of adults and adolescents does occur. Many believe that adolescents and adults are the groups most commonly infected with pertussis and are now the major source of contagion to infants and young children. Because of the considerable health burden, there is a need for improved vaccination strategies to prevent disease in adolescents and adults and to reduce the risk of transmission to vulnerable infants.

SUGGESTED CASE DEFINITIONS FOR PERTUSSIS

In recognition of the fact that the signs and symptoms of pertussis differ by age, we have tailored criteria for pertussis diagnosis in 3 different age cohorts (0–3 months, 4 months–9 years, and ≥ 10 years). These criteria are presented in Figure 1. In Figure 2, clinical case definitions of pertussis for surveillance purposes are presented.

Figure 1.
Algorithm for the diagnosis of pertussis. Abbreviations: IgG, immunoglobin G; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PT, pertussis toxin; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; WBC, white blood cell. a In resource-limited areas where PCR is not available, samples may be sent to a reference laboratory for culture confirmation. b False-negatives possible. c Serology not useful in this age cohort.

Figure 2.
Clinical case definition of pertussis for surveillance purposes.

These case definitions are intended to: (1) be more specific and/or more sensitive than existing case definitions of pertussis (which were developed more than 40 years ago and were primarily designed either for surveillance purposes or for vaccine efficacy studies), (2) be applicable to both resource-rich and resource-poor settings, (3) encourage the increased use of laboratory confirmation, and (4) increase the sensitivity and specificity of pertussis reporting.

### Clinical features of pertussis… [^117CSxDr]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- **There are three stages of clinical pertussis**: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent.
- Clinical presentation, complications, and risk of death can differ based on age and vaccination status. Stages to the clinical course Stage 1: Catarrhal Characterized by:

- Coryza
- Low-grade fever
- Mild, occasional cough
- Gradually becomes more severe
- Apnea. Stage 2: Paroxysmal Characterized by:

- Paroxysms of numerous, rapid coughs
- Long inspiratory effort with a high-pitched "whoop" at the end of paroxysmal cough
- Cyanosis
- Exhaustion
- Vomiting Paroxysmal attacks occur frequently at night, with an average of 15 attacks per 24 hours. They increase in frequency during the first 1 to 2 weeks. The attacks remain at the same frequency for 2 to 3 weeks, then gradually decrease.

Stage 3: Convalescent Characterized by:

- Gradual recovery
- Less persistent, paroxysmal coughs that disappear in 2 to 3 weeks Paroxysms often recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many months after pertussis onset. Differences in clinical presentation Age In infants, apnea may be the only symptom and the cough may be minimal or absent. Healthcare providers often overlook pertussis in the differential diagnosis of cough illness in adolescents and adults. Illness is generally less severe, and the typical "whoop" less frequently seen in these populations. Vaccination status The illness can be milder and the characteristic paroxysmal cough and "whoop" may be absent in anyone who was previously vaccinated. Complications Pertussis complications can include:

- Anorexia
- Dehydration
- Difficulty sleeping
- Epistaxis
- Hernias
- Otitis media
- Syncope
- Weight loss
- **Urinary incontinence More severe complications can include**:

- Apnea
- Encephalopathy
- Death
- Pneumonia
- Pneumothorax
- Rectal prolapse
- Refractory pulmonary hypertension
- Rib fractures from severe coughing
- Seizures/convulsions
- Subdural hematomas.

CHEST guideline — clinical rule-in and rule-out use of symptoms: In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out; in children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113YUd2o]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that patients with pertussis often experience diagnostic delays. For example, 18% of pertussis patients had a delay of at least 20 days, and the average delay was 12 days. These delays have important implications for patient health because, if caught quickly, pertussis is treatable, and early treatment can also prevent transmission of the disease. On average, patients had almost 2 visits prior to diagnosis, and some had many more visits. At each of these visits, multiple healthcare professionals and other patients were potentially exposed to pertussis, and between these visits, many community and household exposures undoubtably occurred.

The frequency and duration of diagnostic delays varied across age groups. In general, the percentage of patients experiencing a delay tended to increase with age from 2–4 years up to adulthood (≥ 18 years). Both the number of missed opportunities per patient and the duration of delays increased monotonically from age < 2 years through adulthood. Thus, diagnostic delays for pertussis among adults appear to be both longer and more frequent compared to younger children. Pertussis has long been viewed as a childhood illness. Thus, it is not surprising that older individuals are more likely to experience a diagnostic delay. Although most hospitalizations and deaths occur among infants, – in the postvaccination era, cases commonly occur among adolescents and adults. Indeed, diagnosing pertussis in adults is more difficult because these cases may present with mild cough and other respiratory symptoms. This is further complicated because cough is a leading cause of outpatient visits. Up to 17% of adolescents and adults with a prolonged history of cough (eg, > 2 weeks) have pertussis. Thus, pertussis should be part of the differential diagnosis for patients with prolonged cough. While patients with symptoms longer than a few weeks may no longer benefit from treatment themselves, identification of these cases will help the public health response. Specifically, more timely diagnosis can facilitate contact tracing, help minimize contacts, and inform the administration of chemoprophylaxis among exposures.

### Pertussis and persistent cough: practical, clinical and epidemiologic issues [^111yX4m5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic issues of testing, treatment, prevention, immunization, mandated reporting, and post-exposure prophylaxis do not often intrude on the Emergency Department management of the well-appearing adolescent or adult with a couple of weeks of cough.

Objectives

Considering that waning immunity to pertussis, the only vaccine-preventable disease with increasing cases and deaths in the United States, is responsible for 12–35% of such illness, such issues need to be considered.

Discussion

Mostly self-limited in adults, transmission of pertussis to infants places them at risk for hospitalization and death. Pertussis is highly contagious (80% transmission), and atypical presentations are the rule in adults (cough alone) and infants (apnea, bradycardia, poor feeding). Treatment in the first few weeks can impact the clinical course, and later treatment can still prevent transmission. Clinical features like paroxysmal cough, inspiratory "whoop", and post-tussive emesis have mildly increased predictive values and may be absent in adults. Testing is unreliable after 3 weeks of cough. Treatment reduces communicability within 5 days and is suggested without regard to test results within 3 weeks of cough onset for those aged > 1 year (within 6 weeks of cough for < 1 year). Reporting requirements are based on the clinical case definition: ([Cough ≥ 2 weeks] + [paroxysms OR whoop OR post-tussive emesis]). Lower reporting thresholds are appropriate during an outbreak or when vulnerable populations are at risk. Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for at-risk contacts. Tdap is encouraged for all adults.

Conclusion

Practical recommendations consistent with the most current guidelines are offered.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^1177DJmJ]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pertussis testing in children with cough — study eligibility and indications are summarized as follows: although several studies evaluated the prevalence of recent B pertussis infection in children with cough, these did not fulfill the systematic review's inclusion criteria of cough duration; the studies reported a mean cough duration of > 4 weeks and the inclusion criteria for both studies was > 2 weeks. Nevertheless, these primary care studies suggested that appropriate tests to evaluate for recent pertussis infection should be undertaken when clinically appropriate, with the most appropriate test (culture, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic analysis) dependent on the child's age and duration of symptoms, and the 2006 ACCP guideline advocated that testing for recent B pertussis infection be undertaken when clinically suspected (eg, contact, posttussive vomiting, whoop).

### Respiratory viruses frequently mimic pertussis in young infants [^113wveex]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Bordetella pertussis is prevalent among infants, but its diagnosis is complicated by the fact that its signs and symptoms overlap with respiratory viruses. Indeed, when evaluating the etiology of infants less than 1 year of age suspected of having pertussis, we found that respiratory viruses frequently mimic B. pertussis and are more likely to be the causative agent.

### Pertussis: a reemerging infection [^115q3NkG]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory tract infection that has increased in incidence in recent years. The initial catarrhal stage presents with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, rhinorrhea, sneezing, lacrimation, and mild cough. During the paroxysmal stage, severe outbreaks of coughing often lead to the classic high-pitched whooping sound patients make when gasping for breath. The paroxysmal stage is followed by the convalescent stage and resolution of symptoms. Complications vary by age, with infants more likely to experience severe complications such as apnea, pneumonia, seizures, or death. In adolescents and adults, complications are the result of chronic cough. The diagnosis depends on clinical signs and laboratory testing. Both culture and polymerase chain reaction testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis; serologic testing is not standardized or routinely recommended. Although antibiotics have not shown clear effectiveness in the treatment of pertussis, they eradicate nasal bacterial carriage and may reduce transmission rates. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin are first-line treatments to prevent transmission; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an alternative in cases of allergy or intolerance to macrolides. Immunization against pertussis is essential for disease prevention. Current recommendations in the United States consist of administering five doses of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine to children before seven years of age, and administering a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster between 11 and 18 years of age. Recent efforts have focused on the vaccination of adolescents and adults, with new recommendations for a single dose of the Tdap booster if it has not been previously administered.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111oZbpS]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For adult patients complaining of acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 4 key characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever in ruling in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is likely to be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting or is associated with an inspiratory whooping sound (Grade 2C). Fever is defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Epidemiology of pertussis [^1125bKyM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommended that a pertussis incidence of < 1 case per 100,000 population be achieved in Europe by 2000. Available data indicate that this goal has generally not been achieved, and the incidence is actually rising in some countries. Understanding the reasons for this increased incidence may lead to better global control of pertussis. In the majority of countries where pertussis is a notifiable disease, a case-based national surveillance system is in place. However, different case definitions, methods of diagnosis and reporting and surveillance systems make direct intercountry comparisons difficult, and pertussis is not a statutory notifiable disease in every country. Nevertheless the general consensus is that reported incidences are probably considerably lower than the actual incidence of pertussis; underreporting is common. Prolonged cough may be the only clinical feature in adolescents or adults, who may present for diagnosis late (precluding laboratory confirmation) or not at all. When they do present, their condition is often misdiagnosed because, in part, clinicians continue to perceive pertussis as a childhood disease. Despite underreporting, an increased incidence of infant, adolescent and adult pertussis has been observed worldwide since the introduction of widespread vaccination. This is of concern because adolescents and adults have been identified as a source of transmission of pertussis to very young infants who are unimmunized or partially immunized and thus more vulnerable to disease-related complications and higher mortality. In recent years, acellular pertussis vaccines have been incorporated into the immunization schedules of many developed countries, gradually replacing whole cell vaccines. Dosing schedules vary between countries, although primary immunization with 3 doses of the pertussis vaccine within the first 6 months of life exists in most countries. Only Australia, Austria, Canada, France and Germany have incorporated an adolescent booster dose into their current immunization schedules, in recognition of the rising incidence of pertussis in adolescents and adults. Despite high coverage rates for primary immunization in infants and children, pertussis continues to be a global concern, with increased incidence widely noted. This global epidemiologic summary highlights differences worldwide in pertussis reporting, incidence and approaches to prevention. It underscores a general shift in the age distribution of pertussis toward older groups. Understanding the link between these observations may lead to better informed global control strategies, especially those pertaining to immunization schedules and use of pertussis vaccine.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113SvYSi]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pertussis, or whooping cough, in clinical practice continues to be a challenge worldwide as the symptoms are variable. Pragmatically, it is an overlooked cause of cough in children after several decades of universal immunization. The symptoms and its subsequent clinical diagnosis are influenced by age and presence of underlying co-morbidities such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, etc. In addition, immunization status or history of natural infection, presence of passively acquired antibody, and antibiotic treatment may also have a role.

Pertussis is caused by the fastidious Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is estimated that there are 30 to 50 million cases of pertussis worldwide every year, leading to more than 300,000 deaths. Pertussis is a class B reportable infectious disease in China (according to the epidemiological characteristics and damage degree, the law of the People's Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases divides infectious diseases into three categories: A, B and C). According to data from the Chinese infectious disease reporting system, the incidence of pertussis has been less than 1 per 100 000 since the 1990s with only 2183 and 2517 pertussis cases being reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In China, pertussis is mainly diagnosed by the physicians based on the typical clinical symptoms, as most of the Chinese hospitals do not have dedicated specific tests for pertussis(e.g. bacterial culture, serology test and molecular methods). Thus the reported low incidence may be related to the clinical and laboratory methods used for diagnosis, suggesting an underestimation of the disease prevalence.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^117R1TCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the absence of systematic vaccination with pertussis vaccine, essentially every person will suffer whooping cough during infancy or childhood; many will suffer serious sequelae or die. No medical intervention is risk-free, but modern pertussis vaccines are both effective and safe — indeed, vastly safer than avoiding vaccination. Pertussis is an endemic and highly contagious disease; outbreaks will continue to occur. In an outbreak, vaccinated children are less likely to be infected; if infected, illness will be less severe [51–53, 332]. Unvaccinated children are at much higher risk of infection and, if infected, at much higher risk of adverse outcome. A number of approaches to new vaccines with more durable protection are under investigation.

Children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough — diagnostic testing guidance: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-β2 agonist) be undertaken (Grade 1B), we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected (Ungraded, Consensus Based Statement), and we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (Grade 1B). For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) be considered (Grade 2C).

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^115RC9AU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

CHALLENGES TO CURRENT CRITERIA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CLINICAL DEFINITIONS OF PERTUSSIS

The present clinical case definitions of pertussis are inconsistent and are not used everywhere. In addition, they are not universally applicable. Different age groups must be evaluated by different clinical criteria. Pertussis case definitions may also differ between endemic and outbreak situations. Furthermore, resource-rich and resource-limited countries have unique problems related to the control of pertussis and its diagnosis. However, in all situations, the true burden of pertussis is unknown and is significantly underestimated.

In resource-rich countries, a major priority relates to the education, awareness, and recognition of pertussis in adolescents and adults and its transmission to infants. In order to improve the awareness and recognition of the disease in these populations, precise criteria for clinical manifestations of pertussis are needed (Table 2). Awareness of proper sampling techniques for obtaining nasopharyngeal specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspiration) for culture and PCR, as well as the usefulness of single-serum serology in diagnosis should also be fostered. Finally, awareness of appropriate treatment and chemoprophylactic regimens for pertussis should be promulgated.

Table 2.
Considerations Related to Adolescent and Adult Pertussis

In resource-limited countries, pertussis burden is especially underestimated because of a number of factors, including misdiagnosis, lack of recognition, and absent requirements for notification. As a result, the burden of pertussis is not recognized as clinically significant. Adding to the problem is that surveillance systems are often not established or data are collected only sparsely. Nevertheless, pertussis continues to be a serious health problem, especially among infants, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. In addition, because adolescent and adult pertussis is largely unrecognized, these age groups are not targeted for prevention and infected individuals are not treated, thereby facilitating spread of the disease in the community, including to vulnerable young infants. Finally, laboratory access for confirmatory diagnosis is very limited.

Until healthcare professionals in both resource-rich and research-poor countries diagnose their adolescent and adult pertussis patients correctly, the burden of disease will continue to be significantly underestimated. Without knowing that the disease predominantly occurs in this population, attempts to increase vaccine use in adolescents and adults are unlikely to be made.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^112enVt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough in adults and Children: a diagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PvBEr]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly infective cause of cough that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping, and posttussive vomiting, but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough.

Methods

We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction, and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic, RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. The bivariate meta-analysis method was used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Of 1,969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity (93.2% [CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [CI, 8.1–37.9]), whereas posttussive vomiting and whooping have low sensitivity (32.5% [CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [CI, 8.0–45.2]) and high specificity (77.7% [CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [CI, 69.4–86.9]). Posttussive vomiting in children is moderately sensitive (60.0% [CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adult patients, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children, posttussive vomiting is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test.

### Coughing children in family practice and primary care: a systematic review of prevalence, aetiology and prognosis [^1127nPoj]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute cough in children is mostly caused by upper RTI and bronchitis, which is confirmed by the current literature. Its self-limiting course justifies a "wait-and-see" strategy, if no warning signs are present. Transient RTI is still a frequent cause of disease in chronic cough (despite the high share of prolonged courses as outlined above). Therefore, primary care guidelines recommend a 3–8 weeks' observational period (as long as no signs of specific aetiologies are present). In contrast to chronic cough in adults, the other two big causes of disease in children are asthma and pertussis. Their importance is confirmed by studies conducted on chronic cough in hospitals. However, potential overdiagnosis and unnecessary long-term medication in children seem to occur frequently, since, especially in younger children, spirometry anti-asthma therapy trials are not sufficiently valid. A frequency of 1 in 2 for asthma, as shown by Movsowith et al. (a study with a high risk of bias) should not tempt us to be less critical before initiating anti-asthma therapy for children. Instead, working with a category of "chronic non-specific persistent cough" is recommended as a more adequate way of facing the diagnostic uncertainty. Any cough in children with no signs of serious diseases can be summarized in this category. This supports primary care physicians in keeping awareness combined with regular re-evaluation, instead of jumping into hasty therapeutic processes. A more valid outcome is the high prevalence of pertussis found in a multicentre study in the UK with a low risk of bias. In contrast to asthma, underdiagnosis of pertussis seems likely. This is especially relevant within the first 14 days, since antibiotics can reduce spread and school exclusion when given at an early stage of the disease – after that no specific treatment has been shown to be effective. For evaluation of chronic cough, guidelines recommend relying on signs ("pointers") in patient history or clinical examination for specific causes, like wheezing for asthma or a paroxysmal spasmodic cough for pertussis-like illness. Still, we need more aetiological evidence, because the diagnostic gain of all signs depends on setting specific pre-test probabilities.

### Global childhood deaths from pertussis: a historical review [^111FM29a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical syndrome of whooping cough has been recognized for at least 500 years, although the causative organism, Bordetella pertussis, was not identified until 1906. As physician diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of whooping cough, in its typical form in unimmunized children, is highly specific when judged against culture as gold standard and an episode of whooping cough is reliably recalled by mothers, even in resource-poor settings, historical data on trends in whooping cough incidence should have acceptable validity, if reporting and recording have remained consistent over time.

Similarly, interpretation of historical data on deaths due to pertussis assumes that recognition of the preceding clinical syndrome and recording of deaths has been consistent over time. In countries with good infrastructure, these data come from statistical reports derived from statutory death certificates. More recently, measurement of pertussis-related deaths has been supplemented by data on mortality from routine public health surveillance, often including laboratory confirmation, and capture-recapture methodology has suggested significant underascertainment in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In resource-poor settings, attribution of deaths following clinically diagnosed pertussis may be problematic, especially when death occurs some time later, as other factors such as concomitant infection (eg, malaria, measles), and comorbidities (eg, malnutrition) are often present. Attribution is much clearer when it is in the context of well-established surveillance with clear diagnostic criteria, supplemented by laboratory diagnostic tests, as occurred in study sites in Senegal and Kenya before and after vaccine introduction. However, population-based studies of severe morbidity from pertussis in resource-poor settings are sparse, especially several years after achievement of acceptable vaccine coverage through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Recognizing the limitations of the available data sources, deaths due to pertussis have been estimated by modeling, using age-specific estimates of cases, case fatality rate, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness as the main parameters. In 1999, these methods estimated 295 000 deaths worldwide (52% in Africa and South Asia), but with substantial uncertainty in sensitivity analyses. In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated mortality due to pertussis in the first year of life to be approximately 400 per million live births, or approximately 56 000 deaths, whereas average annual pertussis mortality rates per 1 million births supplied by 15 (mainly high-income) countries to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the decade 2003–2012 ranged from 0.1 to 38.6, with most between 3.0 and 10.0.

Pediatric chronic cough — initial investigations and targeted testing: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken. For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyper-responsiveness be considered. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance to the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected, and CHEST guidelines suggested clinicians consider pertussis if there is post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cough or inspiratory whoop.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^114VKUv8]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS

The classic clinical course of pertussis occurs in three stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The initial catarrhal stage begins with nonspecific viral upper respiratory tract symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, sneezing, and mild dry cough) and lasts about 1–2 weeks before progressing to the paroxysmal stage. The paroxysmal stage is well‐known for the spasmodic, repetitive cough that occurs with the same breath and ends in an inspiratory whoop or gasp resulting from a breath taken against a swollen glottis. This stage is where the name "whooping cough" was derived from, and it is often associated with post‐tussive emesis and cyanosis. Following the paroxysmal stage is the convalescent stage, where individuals slowly improve over a few weeks to even months. Fever is generally not associated with pertussis, and the most common lab abnormality is lymphocytosis.

Pertussis can affect all ages, but the most severe presentation/course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, who account for most of the hospital admissions and deaths. Older children, adolescents, and adults tend to have a more varied presentation than the classic clinical course. Typically, symptoms consist of a mild respiratory illness; prolonged cough often prompts adults to seek care.

Pertussis can cause pulmonary, neurologic, and nutritional complications. Even with treatment with antibiotics, the course of serious illness with pertussis can be long and significant. Table 1 describes the clinical complications and frequency seen by age group. Approximately 50% of infants and 12% of adults with pertussis will require hospitalization. The paroxysmal cough can be associated with cyanosis, vomiting, and bradycardia. Pneumonia is a common complication due to the lungs becoming filled with inflammatory cells and fibrous material. Pulmonary hypertension can also result from the formation of lymphocyte aggregates in the setting of lymphocytosis, leading to an increase in pulmonary vasculature. Encephalopathy can result from hypoxia/apneic episodes that occur during paroxysmal coughing episodes. Patients can also develop intracranial bleeding or new onset seizures. Nutritional complications result from difficulty eating or recurrent vomiting with the paroxysmal cough. In adults, prolonged and intense coughing can lead to pulled muscles, broken ribs, pneumothorax, temporary urinary incontinence, and syncope. Additional complications that have been reported are subcutaneous emphysema, umbilical and inguinal hernias, subconjunctival hemorrhages, otitis media, insomnia, carotid artery dissection, and death.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^1119Uc9M]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a contagious, respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, a fastidious gram‐negative coccobacillus. The infection is spread from person to person by exposure to large respiratory droplets released in the air by coughing or sneezing. The incubation period is generally 7–10 days, but infection can occur up to 21 days after exposure. Pertussis is more prominent in the fall and winter months, though in contrast to common respiratory viruses, there is no true seasonality. Pertussis can cause a disruptive, sometimes debilitating, cough in adults, though hospitalization is exceedingly rare. Infants, in contrast, are at high risk for developing severe disease, leading to hospitalization and death. The widespread use of vaccination has led to a significant decrease in disease incidence. However, due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity, pertussis incidence has begun to rise again. This clinical progress note reviews the epidemiology, clinical course, management, and complications of pertussis.

### Effects of pertussis vaccination on disease: vaccine efficacy in reducing clinical severity [^116PEviw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We estimated the effectiveness of pertussis vaccination in reducing the clinical severity of breakthrough disease among vaccinated individuals from a comprehensive follow-up study of a community of 30,000 residents of Niakhar, Senegal, in 1993. A physician examined all children with potential pertussis (cough of > 7 days' duration). Samples were collected from 97% of these children for culture or serologic testing as part of the active surveillance for a pertussis vaccine trial. Cases of pertussis were defined by confirmation through culture or serologic testing or by a history of contact with a person with culture-confirmed pertussis. Among children with confirmed cases, severity of illness was assessed according to a scale that combined clinical signs and symptoms. The efficacy of the vaccine in reducing disease severity was 48% (95% confidence interval, 39%-55%) among children vaccinated with 3 doses of whole-cell (67%) or acellular (32%) vaccine. Primary cases were more severe than secondary cases in residential compounds. Pertussis vaccination is effective in reducing the severity of illness.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Mcz8W]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Infectious causes of chronic cough in children — pertussis and atypical bacteria are documented with defined durations and detection limits: wheezing should not exclude pertussis and these infections may present as chronic cough without other symptoms; the median duration of cough in unvaccinated children aged < 6 years was 52 to 61 days and 29 to 39 days for vaccinated children. In a prospective study of children aged 3–34 months triggered by household cough > 7 days, etiological agents were identified in 64% (99/155) of episodes with cough for < 100 days; B pertussis accounted for 56% (64/115) with a median cough period of 51 days, followed by M pneumoniae 26% (30/115) with a mean of 23 days, C pneumoniae 17% (19/115) with 26 days, and B parapertussis 2% (2/115). Other microbial studies were not performed and other etiologies of cough were not considered, and in a cohort of 1211 children repeatedly tested for C pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction and enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA), the percentage of asymptomatic infections was very high at 54% of all positive PCR-EIA.

### Histopathology of Bordetella pertussis in the baboon model [^117UA3jj]. Infection and Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Pertussis is a severe respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis The classic symptoms of pertussis include paroxysmal coughing with an inspiratory whoop, posttussive vomiting, cyanosis, and persistent coryzal symptoms. Infants under 2 months of age experience more severe disease, with most deaths occurring in this age group. Most of what is known about the pathology of pertussis in humans is from the evaluation of fatal human infant cases. The baboon model of pertussis provides the opportunity to evaluate the histopathology of severe but nonfatal pertussis. The baboon model recapitulates the characteristic clinical signs of pertussis observed in humans, including leukocytosis, paroxysmal coughing, mucus production, heavy colonization of the airway, and transmission of the bacteria between hosts. As in humans, baboons demonstrate age-related differences in clinical presentation, with younger animals experiencing more severe disease. We examined the histopathology of 5- to 6-week-old baboons, with the findings being similar to those reported for fatal human infant cases. In juvenile baboons, we found that the disease is highly inflammatory and concentrated to the lungs with signs of disease that would typically be diagnosed as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchopneumonia. In contrast, no significant pathology was observed in the trachea. Histopathological changes in the trachea were limited to cellular infiltrates and mucus production. Immunohistostaining revealed that the bacteria were localized to the surface of the ciliated epithelium in the conducting airways. Our observations provide important insights into the pathology of pertussis in typical, severe but nonfatal pertussis cases in a very relevant animal model.

### Defining pertussis epidemiology: clinical, microbiologic and serologic perspectives [^111YUNe4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In the past decade, numerous sources have noted an increase in reported pertussis in highly immunized populations. This has been accompanied by a perceived change in disease epidemiology, characterized by a significant increase in reported pertussis incidence among adolescents and adults. In populations where children are routinely immunized, adolescents and adults now constitute the main source of infection in infants. However, a range of factors makes delineation of these epidemiologic trends difficult. Reported cases of pertussis represent only a fraction of the actual number of Bordetella pertussis symptomatic infections, because underconsulting, underrecognition and underdiagnosis are widespread and are a particular problem in adolescents and adults. Possible explanations for failure to diagnose pertussis include the heterogeneity in pertussis disease expression and low physician awareness and index of suspicion. Consequently defining pertussis from a clinical perspective is difficult, and this is reflected by a lack of consistency between case definitions. Although case definitions for specific circumstances have been established by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control, these are not universally useful, making intercountry comparisons and global evaluation difficult. Less-than-optimal and poorly performed laboratory tests, or their lack of availability, also make confirmation of B. pertussis infection difficult. To overcome these problems, clinical case definitions should be standardized for outbreak and endemic situations. Rapid, easy-to-use and inexpensive laboratory diagnostic techniques also must be made available and be widely implemented. In particular, polymerase chain reaction and single serum serology are 2 techniques that should be more widely adopted.

### Symptoms of whooping cough… [^11312S6m]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Early symptoms of pertussis can look like a common cold.
- Whooping cough is known for the "whoop" noise when someone gasps for air after a coughing fit.
- Babies and young children may not cough but may have difficulty breathing instead. Early symptoms It usually takes 5 to 10 days for symptoms to appear after exposure to the bacteria that cause whooping cough. Sometimes symptoms don't develop for as long as 3 weeks. Appears like a common cold Whooping cough appears similar to a common cold early on. Healthcare providers often don't suspect or diagnose it until more severe symptoms appear. Early symptoms can last for 1 to 2 weeks and usually include:

- Runny or stuffed-up nose
- Low-grade fever
- Mild, occasional cough. Babies may struggle to breathe Many babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead, they may have apnea.

The apnea may cause cyanosis or they may struggle to breathe. For some babies, whooping cough may seem like a common cold for the entire illness, not just at the beginning. Later symptoms Rapid, violent, and uncontrolled coughing fits One to 2 weeks after the first symptoms start, people may develop paroxysms, known as coughing fits. These coughing fits usually last 1 to 6 weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks. The cough generally gets worse and becomes more common as the illness continues. Coughing fits can cause people to
- Make a high-pitched "whoop" when they inhale after a coughing fit
- Vomit during or after coughing fits
- Feel very tired after the fit, but usually seem well in-between fits
- Have difficulty sleeping at night
- Struggle to breathe
- Fracture a rib Those who get these coughing fits say it's the worst cough of their lives.

Apnea: 2 in 3 Pneumonia: 1 in 5 Convulsions: 1 in 50 Encephalopathy: 1 in 150 One in 100 will die from their complications.

### Incidence of severe and nonsevere pertussis among HIV-exposed and-unexposed Zambian infants through 14 weeks of age: results from the Southern Africa mother infant pertussis study (SAMIPS), a longitudinal birth cohort study [^112yEG5s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

So if we accept that the results are probably not due to false positives or false attribution, another plausible explanation for the unusual symptomatology is ascertainment bias. This relates to how we selected samples for testing compared with how this is generally done in accordance with testing guidelines for clinical practice. For example, the CDC's screening guidelines recommend testing for pertussis if a child presents with ≥ 2 weeks of cough plus whooping and/or apnea, cyanosis, or posttussive vomiting, a constellation of symptoms that meets the definition of "severe pertussis" on the Preziosi Scale. The CDC criteria are intended to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (ie, to maximize specificity at the expense of sensitivity) when used for routine disease surveillance.

While this is intended to reduce false-positive rates, it has the unintended consequence of introducing a logical circularity: by only testing individuals who are clinically suspected to have severe pertussis, all cases so found will, by definition, have severe pertussis. That approach to screening answers the epidemiologic question, "What proportion of infants who look like they might have severe pertussis actually do have severe pertussis?" But that is a fundamentally different question from "What proportion of infants with pertussis have or go on to develop severe pertussis?" And that is because the full spectrum of disease presentations has not previously been assessed systematically and longitudinally. SAMIPS was designed to identify cases across the full spectrum of severity and to observe the evolution of symptoms over time. We tested at the first sign of respiratory symptoms, hence, 100% of our cases had cough durations < 2 weeks before the first positive PCR because we saw our clients at 2-week intervals. But the upside to this approach is that it also allowed us to observe the proportion that later developed severe disease (and would presumably have been the kinds of individuals detected per CDC guidelines). In addition, it allowed us to see whose symptoms resolved spontaneously without developing into severe disease.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^113Jv6uh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative bacterium, and is the pathogen of the highly contagious pertussis known as 'whooping cough'. Since 2011, the increasing incidence of pertussis despite high vaccination coverage has given rise to discussion across the world. Suggested reasons for the resurgence of pertussis include higher awareness, improved diagnostic tests, emergence of new B. pertussis strains with greater virulence or resistance to vaccination, and rapidly waning immunity after vaccination.

Pertussis is primarily dangerous for infants; 16 of 26 reported pertussis-related deaths in Europe in 2016 and all deaths in 2017 occurred in children younger than 3 months. Therefore, the focus must be placed on disease prevention, especially to reduce the risk of transmission to infants.

Pertussis infection is known to proceed through three typical stages: first, catarrhal, second, paroxysmal with classic paroxysms of coughing and an inspiratory 'whoop' noise, and third, the convalescent stage. Adults and vaccinated patients may, however, present with mild or atypical symptoms. Here, we describe the case of an unvaccinated adult who presented with angioedema as a rare atypical symptom of B. pertussis infection.

### Diagnosis and laryngeal complications of bordatella pertussis infection in the ambulatory adult population [^115QxfS7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Bordatella pertussis infection leads to a chronic, debilitating, and paroxysmal cough that can last for months to years. Incidence of B pertussis in the immunized adult population is rising nationwide, but many otolaryngologists are unfamiliar with the diagnosis and management of this disease. Adults often present late in the disease process when traditional diagnostic testing is ineffective and without the classic pediatric symptoms of whooping cough. As a result, B pertussis infections in adults are often overlooked or misdiagnosed as asthma exacerbations or viral bronchitis, leading to increased morbidity, unnecessary testing, and additional exposure of vulnerable populations to the pathogen. This commentary describes 3 adult cases of B pertussis confirmed with serum testing in the ambulatory population and describes varied presentations based on time from initial infection. Specific emphasis is presented on the physical manifestations of the disease in laryngeal structures, methods of diagnosis, and recommendations for treatment.

### Pertussis disease burden in the household: how to protect young infants [^112aHnT1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a population-based, nation-wide, prospective study to identify who introduced pertussis into the household of infants aged 6 months admitted to the hospital for pertussis in the Netherlands.

Methods

During the period 2006–2008, a total of 560 household contacts of 164 hospitalized infants were tested by polymerase chain reaction, culture, and serological examination to establish Bordetella pertussis infection. Clinical symptoms and vaccination history were obtained by a questionnaire submitted during sample collection and 4–6 weeks afterwards.

Results

Overall, 299 household contacts (53%) had laboratory-confired pertussis; 159 (53%) had symptoms compatible with typical pertussis infection, and 42 (14%) had no symptoms. Among children vaccinated with a whole-cell vaccine, 17 (46%) of 37 had typical pertussis 1–3 years after completion of the primary series, compared with 9 (29%) of 31 children who had been completely vaccinated with an acellular vaccine. For 96 households (60%), the most likely source of infection of the infant was established, being a sibling (41%), mother (38%), or father (17%).

Conclusions

If immunity to pertussis in parents is maintained or boosted, 35%-55% of infant cases could be prevented. Furthermore, we found that, 1–3 years after vaccination with whole-cell or acellular vaccine, a significant percentage of children are again susceptible for typical pertussis. In the long term, pertussis vaccines and vaccination strategies should be improved to provide longer protection and prevent transmission.

### When to discharge children hospitalized with pertussis? [^111AqnN8]. Academic Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

It is difficult to know when children hospitalized with pertussis can be safely discharged. We sought to identify clinical features of children hospitalized with pertussis that are associated with readmission.

Methods

A case series of 207 children hospitalized with pertussis was studied. The 33 children readmitted with pertussis were compared with the 174 who did not require readmission.

Results

Demographic characteristics and immunization status of the children with pertussis requiring readmission did not differ from the children who were not readmitted. Median duration of initial hospital stay was 4 days for both groups (P = 0.11). The children who were readmitted had more cyanotic episodes per day (0.8 vs 0.0 episodes, P = 0.03) and on greater proportion of hospital days (0.5 vs 0.1, P = 0.01). On the last day of admission, the children subsequently readmitted had more coughing episodes (4 vs 0, P < .001), and a larger proportion had a cyanotic episode (30% vs 10%, P = 0.003). The risk of readmission was increased in children who had ≥ 1 cyanotic episode per day (relative risk [RR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3–4.6); cyanosis on ≥ 50% of days (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.4–4.8); ≥ 2 coughing paroxysms on the last hospital day (RR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.4); or any cyanosis on the last day (RR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.5–5.2).

Conclusions

Paroxysmal cough and cyanosis are clinical signs that can be used in children hospitalized with pertussis to help decide when to discharge them from hospital.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^1165nwv7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

WHY PERTUSSIS IS IMPORTANT

Infants and Children

Pertussis affects all ages, but most severely infants, who experience the highest age-specific incidence and account for almost all pertussis hospitalizations and deaths. Even now, more than 80% of US infants younger than 2 months with reported pertussis are hospitalized [6].

Pertussis typically begins like a mild upper respiratory infection. An occasional cough progresses within 1 week or 2 to become paroxysmal, increasing in frequency and severity before gradually subsiding over a period of several weeks or longer. Paroxysms are marked by a series of rapid coughs without taking a breath followed by the characteristic whoop, a desperate effort to draw breath through a swollen glottis. During a paroxysm, the patient may become cyanotic and vomiting may follow the paroxysm. Several paroxysms may occur successively within a few minutes, leaving the patient exhausted. Paroxysms may be induced by stimuli such as eating, laughing, or crying, and are typically worse at night. Between paroxysms, the patient appears normal. Pertussis is not usually associated with fever, but it is associated with lymphocytosis, especially among infants and young children. As the illness resolves, nonparoxysmal cough may persist for many weeks and intercurrent viral infections can trigger a recurrence of the paroxysms.

One large study of pertussis in infants and children in Germany, before universal pertussis vaccination, found that 90% of unvacccinated patients with proven pertussis had paroxysmal cough, 79% had whooping, 53% experienced posttussive vomiting, but only 6% had fever [7].

The fearsome reputation of pertussis does not rest merely on its being widespread, prolonged, and highly unpleasant; it can bring permanent disability or death. In the German study, the overall rate of major complications in infants and children was 6%, and it was 24% among infants younger than 6 months [7]. These complications fall into 3 major groups: pulmonary, neurologic, and nutritional. The most frequent are pulmonary complications including both interstitial and alveolar pneumonia and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. Autopsy findings demonstrate lungs filled with inflammatory cells, fibrinous edema, and abundant pertussis bacteria [8]. Pulmonary hypertension can ensue [9–17]; infants younger than 6 weeks of age with pulmonary hypertension have the highest mortality. Patients who survive pneumonia or pulmonary complications typically are left with no permanent lung damage [18].

### Signs and symptoms… [^113gBWLc]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and Symptoms Whooping cough may begin like a common cold, but unlike a cold, the coughing can last for weeks or months. Symptoms of whooping cough usually develop within 5 to 10 days after you come into contact with the bacteria that cause it. Sometimes symptoms do not develop for as long as 3 weeks. Early symptoms: Stage 1 See a doctor if you or your child are:

- Struggling to breathe
- Turning blue or purple
- Coughing violently
- Coughing rapidly, over and over
- Not drinking enough fluids Any time someone is struggling to breathe, it is important to. get them to a doctor right away. Early symptoms can last for 1 to 2 weeks and usually include:

- Runny or stuffed-up nose
- Low-grade fever
- Mild, occasional cough
- Apnea and cyanosis in babies and young children In its early stages, whooping cough appears to be nothing more than the common cold.

Therefore, doctors often do not suspect or diagnose it until the more severe symptoms appear. Later symptoms: Stage 2 One to 2 weeks after the first symptoms start, people with whooping cough may develop paroxysms — rapid, violent, and uncontrolled coughing fits. These coughing fits usually last 1 to 6 weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks. Coughing fits generally get worse and become more common as the illness continues. Coughing fits can cause people to
- Make a high-pitched "whoop" sound when they are finally able to inhale at the end of a coughing fit
- Vomit during or after coughing fits
- Feel very tired after the fit, but usually seem well in-between fits
- Struggle to breathe. Babies may struggle to breathe, while teens and adults usually have mild symptoms Many babies with whooping cough don't cough at all. Instead it may cause them to turn blue or struggle to breathe. It may seem like a common cold for the entire illness, not just the beginning.

The infection is generally milder in teens and adults than in babies and children, especially those who have gotten vaccinated against whooping cough. It may seem like a common cold. The "whoop" is often not there for people who have a milder illness.

### Could this be whooping cough? [^1162LgWK]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Whooping cough is a notifiable bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis It may produce serious disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals and very young children. The number of reported cases increases in the winter months and the incidence peaks every 4–5 years. However, this periodicity is variable and is inconsistent between different geographical regions. Bordetella pertussis infection (BPI) may be underdiagnosed because of its seasonality and the fact that clinical features may be indistinguishable from other respiratory disorders in the paediatric ED setting. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the period of infectivity but may not shorten the illness. This review discusses the epidemiology of the disease, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and the disposition of patients with BPI.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^114wgCRr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pertussis is a respiratory infection caused by the fastidious, gram-negative coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis is associated with a long-lasting cough. It is spread person to person primarily through respiratory droplets and is extremely contagious among susceptible individuals. – Historically, pertussis was a common childhood illness. Until the 1940s, ∼250,000 cases were reported annually, with a mortality rate approaching 10%. After the introduction of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine, the incidence of pertussis declined, reaching a nadir in the United States in 1976. However, due to concerns about reactions associated with whole-cell vaccine, – an acellular vaccine was introduced in the 1990s, but this vaccine was less effective. Coinciding with the introduction of a less-effective vaccine, the number of pertussis cases reported in the United States has increased. – Other reasons for the increase in cases include lower vaccination rates and the emergence of strains not included in the vaccine.

Because pertussis is extremely contagious, it is critical to diagnose cases early to prevent further transmission. Delays in diagnosing pertussis have been associated with outbreaks, especially in healthcare settings. – Early identification is important for 3 reasons. First, if patients can be identified early enough, treatment may ameliorate symptoms. Second, treatment within the first 3 weeks can prevent the spread of pertussis. Finally, earlier identification of cases (ie, without delay) can help identify individuals who have been exposed to pertussis to facilitate chemoprophylaxis. Unfortunately, efforts involving chemoprophylaxis and treatment are limited because substantial transmission has usually occurred prior to diagnosis. Adults and adolescents may be difficult to diagnose, especially if they were vaccinated as children because they may experience milder symptoms. Although delays in diagnosing pertussis, in the context of outbreaks, are commonly reported, the incidence, duration, and risk factors for delays remain unknown. In this study, we used a population-based approach to estimate the incidence and duration of diagnostic delays associated with pertussis and to describe potential risk factors associated with patients experiencing a diagnostic delay.

### Pertussis: what the pediatric infectious disease specialist should know [^114CbpV3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis is a bacterial disease that is transmitted very efficiently from human to human by droplets. It occurs at any age, is endemic in any population, and can cause outbreaks in highly variable frequencies. Hallmark of the disease is cough with or without paroxysms, whoop, and vomiting. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion followed by laboratory confirmation (PCR, Serology) and should be followed by prompt antibiotic treatment to stop spread of the bacteria to contact persons. Control of pertussis by acellular vaccines is possible to some extent if immunization coverage is high and booster doses are given lifelong. However new vaccines with higher efficacy rates are warranted.

### Pertussis of adults and infants [^114qQVGP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Bordetella pertussis continues to circulate even in populations where a high vaccine coverage of infants and children is achieved. Cases in adolescents and adults are reported with increasing frequency in many countries. Adults are a reservoir for infections in very young infants, in whom pertussis may be severe and life-threatening. The salient clinical feature of pertussis in adolescents and adults is prolonged coughing, and recognising that pertussis does occur in these age groups is the most important step in its diagnosis. A laboratory diagnosis can be made by bordetella-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs or secretions and by detection of antibodies, mainly to pertussis toxin; laboratory diagnosis is, however, not well standardised. Vaccination of adolescents and adults is now possible with acellular pertussis vaccines, which are well tolerated, immunogenic, and effective. Adolescent boosters and the vaccination of health-care workers are already included in vaccination calendars in some countries. Vaccine-recommending bodies and national health-care organisations must have locally relevant information on the transmission of pertussis from adults to infants to be able to make decisions on the advisability, feasibility, and priority for booster immunisation against pertussis.

### Pertussis – a re-emerging infection? [^113AKG2a]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Seven cases of pertussis in patients aged between 1 and 6 months detected over 3 months were reported. Paroxysmal cough (six cases), post-tussive vomiting (three cases) and poor feeding (three cases) were the most common presenting symptoms. Bordetella pertussis was isolated from six patients. The total leucocyte counts were mildly increased (10.8–15.6×10⁹/L). The lymphocyte counts were markly raised (59–73%) and appear to be useful indicators of pertussis. It appears that herd immunity does not offer adequate protection to the vulnerable group even in well-vaccinated populations. High vaccination coverage should be maintained, and vaccination should be given as early an age as possible. Aggressive efforts to identify cases and contacts are essential. Health care workers should have a high index of suspicion for pertussis, in particular for those with paroxysmal cough and high lymphocyte counts so as to give timely diagnosis and treatment.

Despite widespread vaccination, the United States has seen a stark increase in pertussis cases over the past year. Disease profiles vary across age groups, with infants at the greatest risk.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zU7JA]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis-associated cough in adults — clinical feature-based diagnosis: For adult patients with acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever to help rule in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis; paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity and low specificity, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity but high specificity, and for adult patients with acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature, with fever defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Clinical presentation of pertussis in unvaccinated and vaccinated children in the first six years of life [^112YoqrH]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Identifying the determinants of the clinical presentation of pertussis is important for the purposes of diagnosis, therapy, and control and for predicting the disease's clinical course and choosing an appropriate case definition for surveillance. Potential determinants include vaccination status, antibiotic treatment, age at diagnosis, and sex, although the available data are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical course of pertussis in unvaccinated and vaccinated children in a well-defined and strictly studied population and to identify determinants of the disease's clinical presentation.

Methods

The clinical presentation of pertussis was studied in children who participated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccine. The children belonged to the same birth cohort and were followed from infancy to 6 years of age in 3 distinct periods (stages 1, 2, and 3). Children had received 1 of 2 three-component acellular pertussis vaccines produced by 2 manufacturers (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis from, Chiron Biocine [DTaP CB]; DTaP from SmithKline Beecham [DTaP SB]) or a diphtheria-tetanus vaccine only (DT; Chiron Biocine). Pertussis was confirmed through culture or serology. For each pertussis episode, information was collected on age at onset, sex, type of vaccine received, antibiotic treatment, culture results, duration of cough, spasmodic cough, and other symptoms. The simultaneous effect of potential determinants of clinical presentation of pertussis on the duration of cough and spasmodic cough was studied through analysis of variance models.

Results

The analysis was conducted on 788 laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis. The median duration of cough in DT recipients varied from 52 to 61 days across the 3 stages, whereas the median duration of cough in DTaP recipients varied from 29 to 39 days. The median duration of spasmodic cough varied from 20 to 45 days in DT recipients and from 14 to 29 days in DTaP recipients. The results of the analysis of variance models showed that vaccination against pertussis reduced the length of cough from 3 to 10 days and the length of spasmodic cough from 4 to 8 days. Culture-positive patients had a cough 11 to 22 days longer and a spasmodic cough 12 to 22 days longer than culture-negative patients. Children who received an antibiotic had a duration of cough 6 to 11 days longer and spasmodic cough 4 to 13 days longer than untreated patients. Girls had a duration of spasmodic cough 7 days longer than boys only after 3 years of age. Age was directly related to duration of cough, whereas it was inversely related to duration of spasmodic cough after 3 years of age.

Conclusions

Duration of cough can be greatly influenced by vaccination status. A positive culture for Bordetella pertussis is more frequently found in patients with long duration of cough, and antibiotic therapy may be a marker of severe disease. Gender may affect the clinical presentation of pertussis only after infancy. Pertussis in older children may be characterized by short duration of spasmodic cough. These results should be taken into account in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected pertussis. Clinical case definitions for the purpose of surveillance based on the presence of 2 weeks of spasmodic cough may not be appropriate where pertussis vaccination uptake is high.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^115wRHEH]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSIS

The suggested criteria for testing for pertussis are those with a cough for greater than 2 weeks with either associated paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory whoop, post‐tussive emesis, or apnea. The gold standard for diagnosing pertussis was traditionally culture from nasopharyngeal respiratory swabs. However, cultures have grown out of favor due to the need for special transport media and techniques because of the fastidious nature of the bacteria. Cultures are also less helpful later in the illness course, which is typically when individuals present due to ongoing symptoms. As a result, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, or alveolar lavage fluid have become more favorable given the ease in performing the test and ability to detect the infection several weeks into the illness course. The negative aspects of PCR testing include the inability to perform typing and susceptibility testing, which may prove necessary given concerns of antibiotic resistance in other countries.

Serology can also be used for diagnosis, especially later in an illness course. This method is the most useful when both acute and convalescent samples are available to monitor for a fourfold increase in the pertussis toxin serum immunoglobulin G antibody.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^112oJDTL]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine‐preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^116tDUa3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

SELECTED CURRENTLY USED CASE DEFINITIONS

Selected, currently used, clinical case definitions and additional laboratory and epidemiologic requirements are presented in Table 1. Most primary clinical case definitions, such as those by the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Massachusetts Department of Health, European Union (EU), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and Australian Department of Health and Ageing, have in common a requirement for 2 weeks of cough. To increase specificity, most definitions require at least 1 additional symptom, such as paroxysms, inspiratory whoop, or posttussive vomiting.

Table 1.
Selected Presently Used Pertussis Case Definitions

France requires that cough be present for more than 7 days, whereas Australia accepts cough of any duration if it is accompanied by paroxysms, whooping, or vomiting. The EU also accepts any physician's diagnosis of pertussis and apnea as a clinically defining symptom in infants.

Almost all case definitions require laboratory or epidemiologic linkage data, and such data may affect whether the case is categorized as confirmed, probable, or possible. Laboratory confirmation tests include culture of Bordetella pertussis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that are specific for B. pertussis. Some countries, such as Australia, also accept direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, whereas the PAHO definition specifically discourages DFA. Differences are also found concerning confirmation by serology: the CDC definition does not include serology, the WHO definition requires paired serology, and the EU definition elegantly compromises by requiring a " B. pertussis –specific antibody response". France and Massachusetts also accept single serum serology with an elevated anti–pertussis toxin (anti-PT) titer, and Australia accepts an immunoglobin A (IgA) response to whole B. pertussis.

### Clinical features… [^112HJQnn]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Stages to the Clinical Course of Pertussis Characterized by:

- Coryza
- Low-grade fever
- Mild, occasional cough
- **Apnea Characterized by**:

- Paroxysms of numerous, rapid coughs due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the tracheobronchial tree
- Long inspiratory effort accompanied by a high-pitched "whoop" at the end of the paroxysms
- Cyanosis
- Vomiting Exhaustion. Paroxysmal attacks:

- Occur frequently at night, with an average of 15 attacks per 24 hours
- Increase in frequency during the first 1–2 weeks, remain at the same frequency for 2–3 weeks, and then gradually decrease Characterized by:

- Gradual recovery
- Less persistent, paroxysmal coughs that disappear in 2–3 weeks Paroxysms often recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many months after the onset of pertussis.

Incubation period and disease progression Pertussis symptoms usually develop within 5 to 10 days after exposure, but sometimes not for as long as 21 days. Pertussis has an insidious onset with catarrhal symptoms that are indistinguishable from those of minor respiratory tract infections. The cough, which is initially intermittent, can become paroxysmal. In typical cases, paroxysms terminate with "inspiratory whoop" and posttussive vomiting can follow. Paroxysms of cough, which may occur more at night, usually increase in frequency and severity as the illness progresses. The cough typically persists for 1 to 6 weeks or more. After paroxysms subside, a nonparoxysmal cough can continue for 2 to 6 weeks or longer. Disease may present differently in certain people Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants younger than 12 months of age have the highest risk for severe complications and death.

In infants, apnea may be the only symptom and the cough may be minimal or absent. There is increasing awareness and recognition of pertussis as a disease that affects adolescents and adults. However, clinicians often overlook pertussis in the differential diagnosis of cough illness in this population. Illness is generally less severe, and the typical "whoop" less frequently seen in adolescents and adults.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^112vwsiw]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pertussis is an illness caused by Bordetella pertussis characterized by a prolonged cough. The typical incubation period for pertussis is 7–10 days, although rarely it can be as long as 21 days. Pertussis may start with a runny nose, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. Although during this initial phase a person's cough may be mild, the high volume of the germ in their nose and throat increases the likelihood of transmission. During the next phase, people may begin to show classic signs of pertussis, including severe, episodic coughing with a "whooping" sound during their inhalation and forceful coughing followed by vomiting. Young infants who have pertussis may have difficulty feeding or may experience apnea (breath holding) during coughing spells. Pertussis infection can be life threatening or fatal in infants who have very small airways and are too young to be protected by immunization.

Immunity wanes 5–10 years after immunization, leaving adolescents and adults susceptible to getting pertussis. Although adolescents or adults may develop pertussis, they may have mild cough without the "whooping" sound on inhalation. The cough may sound like a "smoker's cough", bronchitis, or asthma.

Outbreaks of pertussis have been reported in hospitals, schools, childcare centers, and other residential facilities. Pertussis spreads through large respiratory droplets that a person expels during coughing or sneezing. These droplets then contact another person's mouth or eyes, or they are breathed in. Transmission also can occur after touching infectious droplets on a surface or object. Patients without classic or severe symptoms may transmit pertussis. Typically, infected people typically are infectious for 3 weeks if they do not get treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Vaccines are available to prevent pertussis in children and adults. A single dose of tetanus toxoid-reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended for all adults who have close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age.

### Population-based study of pertussis incidence and risk factors among persons > 50 years of age, Australia [^112ixM4J]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, a bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, is typically characterized by paroxysms of coughing with a whooping sound during inhalation. In Australia, pertussis is one of the least well-controlled vaccine-preventable diseases. Robust childhood and maternal immunization programs prevent pertussis-related hospitalizations and mortality in infants and children, but breakthrough disease can occur at any age, because naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity against pertussis is not lifelong. Although older adults can be a source of transmission and adversely affected by infection, vaccination programs are prioritized for pregnant women (preferably 20–32 weeks' gestation), infants and children (i.e. ages 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, and 4 years), and adolescents (11–13 years of age). Consequently, pertussis in older adults constitutes a considerable reservoir of infection and contributes to substantial disease burden, healthcare utilization, and other pertussis-associated costs.

Recent research has offered a clearer assessment of pertussis cases among adults ≥ 50 years of age. In Australia, pertussis-containing (i.e. combined diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) vaccines are recommended for adults at 50 years and 65 years of age by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation but are not funded by the National Immunisation Program. Both confirmed and probable cases of pertussis must be reported to the Commonwealth's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). However, pertussis infections are often underdiagnosed and underreported, owing to difficulties in diagnosis because of unspecific symptoms, delays in seeking healthcare, underuse of diagnostic testing by general practitioners (GPs), and other coexisting respiratory diseases. Accordingly, NNDSS notification data tend to underestimate the true number of pertussis infections and are more likely to capture persons with severe disease, posing serious challenges to policy considerations for pertussis vaccination in adults ≥ 50 years of age. Given the underuse of diagnostic testing by GPs, pertussis diagnoses are based frequently on clinical evidence. Beyond NNDSS data, alternative sources of data, including electronic medical records (EMRs), may inform understanding of the burden of pertussis in persons ≥ 50 years of age in Australia (hereafter Australians > 50 years) in the primary care setting.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^115vJKNB]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There is little published data that has described the clinical characteristics in children with pertussis of various cough duration. We found that apnea and cyanosis were more common in the acute cough group, whilst whoop was more common in the sub-acute cough group. However, we did not find any specific characteristic in the chronic cough group. This highlights that a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is not appropriate as also described by several others. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that the existing WHO clinical case definitions of pertussis(a case diagnosed as pertussis by a physician, or a person with a cough lasting ≥ 2 weeks with ≥ 1 of the following symptoms: paroxysms (ie, fits) of coughing, inspiratory "whooping", and posttussive vomiting (ie, vomiting immediately after coughing) without other apparent cause) may be not appropriate anymore.

The spectrum of illness for pertussis can vary widely with atypical pertussis commonly found in adolescents, adults, and in infants under 1 year of age. A small study of 76 adult patients with cough of more than 2 weeks found 14 patients (18.4%) had laboratory evidence of pertussis infection, and classic symptoms of pertussis were not significantly common in confirmed patients. A case-control study in children0 to 18 years of age found only 42% of confirmed cases met a clinical definition of pertussis and typical symptoms were not common in confirmed cases, and the atypical symptoms were likely moderated by high immunization rates or may have been caused by other respiratory pathogens. A small study of 7 neonates with confirmed pertussis by bacterial culture reported cyanosis and apnea were the characteristic symptoms displayed after 4–7 days of the onset. These findings may reflect that 'classic' symptoms of pertussis may not necessarily be evident, and that clinical symptomatology is influenced by patient age, immunization status and underlying co-morbidities, but the clinical characteristics of patients with pertussis of different cough durations were unreported in these studies. With consideration of patient age, immunization status and underlying co-morbidities, our study found clinical symptomatology of pertussis was associated with cough duration. Our results raise questions regarding the possible need to reexamine the existing diagnostic criteria for pertussis, and possibly identify new sets of criteria specific to particular subgroups based on cough duration.

### Pertussis: an old disease that is still with us [^113wjLtw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Our knowledge of pathogenesis, clinical presentation and prevention of pertussis has improved substantially over recent years. We now better understand the function of long-known virulence factors for Bordetella pertussis, and genome sequencing has identified a multitude of new proteins; their functions are yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, improved diagnostic tools have revealed the broad spectrum of disease, and new insights into the host's immune response have been gained. Finally, the development, evaluation, licensing and implementation of several new acellular pertussis vaccines with high acceptance have changed the epidemiology of pertussis in many countries (i.e. a shift towards an increasing burden of disease in adolescent persons and adults). These developments are likely to have great impact on the daily practice not only of paediatricians, but also of general practitioners, internists, gynaecologists and many other specialists in adolescent and adult medicine. The present review provides an update on recent progress.

### Pertussis: review of epidemiology, diagnosis, management and prevention [^111neyS8]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis — the cause of pertussis or whooping cough — is an exclusively human pathogen. Disease elimination by vaccination should, therefore, be possible, but has proved elusive. Many industrialised countries with long established immunisation programs are currently seeing a resurgence of pertussis, despite universal vaccination with high uptake, with the highest burden in the least immunised age groups (infants under 6 months of age and persons over 10 years old). However, low recognition and reporting and insensitive diagnostic tests mean that the true burden of pertussis is still underestimated. Recently, efforts to improve diagnostic yield include the expanded use of polymerase chain reaction and serological tests but both have significant limitations. The range of antibiotics available for treatment and prophylaxis has expanded to include the newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and a range of universal and targeted vaccination strategies have been implemented or proposed. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of pertussis in developed countries, including modes of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and potential vaccination strategies.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^113NdPkM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The case definitions of pertussis delineated here should first be tested in clinical trials to determine their utility to the average clinician and then be compared with existing case definitions to determine whether they confer increased sensitivity and/or specificity. Although retrospective analyses are subject to bias, such analyses could be performed first in a "proof-of-principle" approach. If the new case definitions appear promising, a prospective study should be conducted to evaluate the proposed diagnostic criteria in the 3 different age categories (0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, ≥ 10 years).

The protocol we propose would involve the prospective evaluation of all persons in a defined population with cough illnesses of ≥ 7 days' duration stratified into the 3 different age categories. The study populations should include geographic regions with different vaccine usage patterns (acellular, whole-cell, or both). Protocols could be adopted from the Adult Pertussis Trial (APERT) and the vaccine efficacy trial in Erlangen, Germany. In both of these studies, investigators contacted participants every 2 weeks, and all subjects with cough illness of ≥ 7 days that was not improving were evaluated. Intensive education programs will be necessary to prevent observer bias. Studies should be of such duration that they cover the cyclical epidemiologic patterns of pertussis and include populations of sufficient size to allow statistical analysis.

The development and utilization of 3 age-related definitions for pertussis can be expected to increase both the sensitivity and specificity in its diagnosis, which will result in the recognition of pertussis in all age groups, potentially leading to better control of pertussis.

### Incidence and burden of pertussis among infants less than 1 year of age [^112iUKWE]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pertussis/whooping cough, a contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, can result in serious clinical and economic consequences. – Typical symptoms include frequent paroxysmal coughing attacks followed by the characteristic inspiratory whoop. Other pertussis complications in infants include pneumonia, seizures, encephalopathy, dehydration and death.

Despite effective pertussis vaccines – and high rates of pediatric vaccination in the US, the number of reported pertussis cases has increased steadily. In the US, pertussis is the least controlled of all bacterial vaccine-preventable diseases for which universal childhood immunization is recommended. The reasons for the recent rise in pertussis cases are not fully elucidated, but potential contributing factors include: increased awareness and disease reporting, improved diagnosis methods, waning immune protection after vaccination, genetic changes in B. pertussis and reduced duration of protection of acellular compared with whole cell vaccines.

Infant-specific pertussis data, especially among neonates, are limited and highly variable. Studies of pertussis risk factors are often limited to 1 geographic region or outbreak. These studies are valuable for identifying environmental factors that may contribute to disease, such as community immunity, but their generalizability is challenging. Comparisons across countries, in particular, are difficult because of differences in vaccination uptake, and schedules, and clinical practice. The present study was designed to address knowledge gaps by utilizing large geographically diverse US health plan databases to estimate the incidence, health care resource use (HCU) and costs, and subsequently to identify factors associated with pertussis diagnosis among infants less than 12 months of age. The geographically diverse study sample provides incidence rates and measures of disease burden that are more generalizable to the entire US population than those from previous studies.
