## Question

How long after starting iron supplementation should hemoglobin be checked

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long after starting iron supplementation hemoglobin should be checked, with context-specific adjustments and emphasis on the 2-week response check. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnostic baseline and when to start iron. Then, I should verify the earliest on-treatment checkpoints (especially the 2-week hemoglobin rise) and what to do if it's inadequate. Next, I will review how monitoring frequency should adapt across general outpatients, CKD, pregnancy, IBD, and patients on ESAs. After that, I need to confirm how long to continue therapy beyond normalization and how to surveil for recurrence. Finally, I will synthesize a succinct timeline and call out pivotal decision points like when to switch to IV iron and how to interpret special scenarios such as blood donors and critical illness [^113G7PHB] [^114wkrGu] [^111ryvCv] [^11529EC7] [^113Ch7CH] [^115VPcNR] [^116xnrbz] [^115jdb58] [^117TVcio] [^116DWek1].

> Let me first confirm the baseline work-up before therapy, because I need to ensure we are truly treating iron deficiency anemia and not an alternative cause of anemia. The BSG 2021 guideline recommends confirming iron deficiency with iron studies, using ferritin as the most useful marker and considering transferrin saturation when ferritin may be misleading, and it is reasonable not to defer oral iron while awaiting evaluation unless a colonoscopy is imminent, which affects timing but not the need for baseline labs to anchor subsequent monitoring [^115bHVQo] [^113G7PHB] [^1114eHoJ].

> Now, I should verify the earliest critical on-treatment check, which is at 2 weeks. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check that the ≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) rise is truly predictive of success and that failure at this point warrants a change in course. The BSG 2021 guidance states that the absence of an Hb increase of at least 10 g/L at 2 weeks strongly predicts subsequent failure to achieve a sustained response, and a rise ≥ 10 g/L is itself a supportive diagnostic indicator of absolute iron deficiency when initial studies are equivocal; this 2-week rule is also supported by pooled trial analyses showing day-14 response predicts outcomes at day 42–56, and obstetric guidance uses the same 2-week reassessment to decide on further work-up or escalation [^114wkrGu] [^114J4SK1] [^1163DhwD] [^113Ch7CH].

> Wait, let me verify the next early timepoint because I noticed a mistake in the original phrasing. The initial note read "Continue Early Monitoring Through Week", which is incomplete; I should correct it to "monitor in the first 4 weeks" per BSG so we don't miss early nonresponders or intolerance, and this early window helps confirm that the 2-week trajectory is sustained while guiding adherence, absorption, and etiology reassessment if the curve is off [^113G7PHB].

> Next, I will examine the standard outpatient cadence beyond the early phase. I should confirm that after the initial 2–4 week checks, monitoring every 4–12 weeks until hemoglobin normalizes is reasonable, then widening intervals as stability is demonstrated; BSG advises continuing iron for around 3 months after Hb normalization and endorses periodic counts thereafter, which practically translates to a 4–12 week cadence during correction followed by longer intervals once stable, tailored to clinical context and ongoing blood loss risk [^113G7PHB] [^111ryvCv].

> For CKD, I need to check guideline-specific intervals and ESA-related monitoring because the physiology and risks differ. KDIGO recommends monthly Hb checks for stage 5 hemodialysis and every 3 months for stage 3–5 non-dialysis or peritoneal dialysis, while ESA labels require weekly Hb monitoring after initiation and after each dose change until stable, with ongoing iron assessment and supplementation as needed to keep ferritin and TSAT adequate for erythropoiesis and to minimize transfusion requirements [^11529EC7] [^116xnrbz] [^117TVcio] [^115jdb58].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm the early reassessment pattern and triggers to escalate. The RCOG obstetric guidance supports a 2-week hemoglobin check after starting oral iron to ensure a demonstrable rise; if the rise is absent and adherence is confirmed, evaluate for alternative causes and consider IV iron, integrating these checks with routine antenatal visit cadences that often occur at roughly 4-week intervals early in care [^113Ch7CH].

> For IBD, let me consider how inflammation alters kinetics and thus the monitoring rhythm. ECCO recommends IV iron as first-line in active disease or when Hb < 10 g/dL, intolerance to oral iron exists, or ESAs are required, with more frequent checks — about every 2–4 weeks — given inflammation-driven variability in response; in clinically inactive disease with mild anemia, oral iron is reasonable with close follow-up to ensure response and tolerability [^115VPcNR] [^112puEXA] [^114rZfZL].

> I should double-check the expected timeline for IV iron response to calibrate the first on-treatment assessment. BSG notes that parenteral iron produces a clinically meaningful hemoglobin response within a week, so a 2-week check is appropriate to verify adequacy and trajectory, and an absent early rise under IV iron should prompt evaluation for ongoing losses, alternative diagnoses, or marrow disorders rather than simply persisting with the same regimen [^114wkrGu].

> Now, I need to ensure I state clearly how long to continue treatment beyond normalization and what labs to recheck. BSG advises continuing iron for about 3 months after hemoglobin normalization to replete marrow stores, and follow-up iron studies at completion to confirm repletion; in many disease-specific contexts, thresholds such as ferritin > 100 µg/L and TSAT > 20% are used to guide adequacy and maintenance decisions, particularly in CKD and IBD or in ESA-treated patients, which I should align with ESA labeling and ECCO guidance when applicable [^113G7PHB] [^116xnrbz] [^117TVcio] [^115jdb58] [^114k8Tww].

> Next, I should review long-term surveillance for recurrence because missing reIDA is common. BSG recommends periodic blood count monitoring, perhaps every 6 months initially after restoration of hemoglobin and iron stores, and considering long-term maintenance iron if the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible, with intervals individualized based on the durability of source control and patient risk [^111ryvCv] [^11332BaN] [^113jDSob].

> But wait, what about special populations like blood donors where recovery kinetics differ from disease states. In frequent donors, daily low-dose ferrous gluconate after donation substantially shortens the time to recover 80% of the hemoglobin decrement and to restore ferritin to baseline, so closer follow-up over weeks to months is justified, particularly in those with low baseline ferritin who otherwise experience protracted recovery [^116DWek1].

> Let me synthesize the operational timeline to ensure it is actionable and internally consistent. Baseline: obtain Hb and iron studies to confirm deficiency, and do not delay oral iron unless colonoscopy is imminent; First reassessment: at 2 weeks, expect ≥ 10 g/L Hb rise with oral iron, and if not achieved, verify adherence and absorption, evaluate for ongoing blood loss or alternative etiologies, and consider switching to IV iron; Early phase confirmation: recheck around 4 weeks to confirm trajectory; Ongoing correction: recheck every 4–12 weeks until Hb normalizes, adjusting intervals by clinical context; CKD: check monthly on hemodialysis and every 3 months in non-dialysis/peritoneal dialysis, with weekly Hb checks after ESA initiation or dose changes until stable; Pregnancy: recheck at 2 weeks, then align with antenatal visit cadence, escalating to IV iron if inadequate response; IBD: use IV iron first-line in active disease or Hb < 10 g/dL, with checks every 2–4 weeks; Duration: continue iron for about 3 months after Hb normalization, then confirm iron store repletion; Surveillance: monitor every 6 months initially to detect recurrence and consider long-term maintenance when causes are irreversible or unknown [^113G7PHB] [^114wkrGu] [^114J4SK1] [^11529EC7] [^116xnrbz] [^117TVcio] [^115jdb58] [^113Ch7CH] [^115VPcNR] [^111ryvCv] [^11332BaN] [^116DWek1].

> Key clinical pearl, and I should double-check this emphasis: the 2-week hemoglobin check is the most actionable inflection point; if the rise is < 10 g/L on oral iron, do not continue indefinitely without reassessment — verify adherence, rule out malabsorption and ongoing losses, broaden the differential, and pivot early to IV iron when indicated, especially in settings like active IBD or when rapid correction is needed [^114wkrGu] [^114J4SK1] [^115VPcNR].

---

Hemoglobin should be checked **2–4 weeks after starting iron** [^113G7PHB] to confirm an early rise [^114wkrGu] and guide adherence or escalation [^113Ch7CH]. A rise of **≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) by 2 weeks** [^114J4SK1] is highly predictive of a satisfactory response; if there is no rise by 2 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss [^113G7PHB] and consider IV iron [^1163DhwD]. After normalization, **continue iron for ~3 months** [^113G7PHB] to replete stores and monitor periodically to detect recurrence [^111ryvCv].

---

## Recommended timing for hemoglobin monitoring

- **Initial monitoring (2–4 weeks)**: Check hemoglobin 2–4 weeks after starting iron [^113G7PHB] to confirm an early rise and assess adherence/absorption [^114wkrGu].

- **Early response (≥ 10 g/L at 2 weeks)**: A rise of ≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) by 2 weeks [^114J4SK1] strongly predicts a satisfactory response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3%) [^1163DhwD].

- **No rise at 2 weeks**: If no rise at 2 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss and consider IV iron [^113G7PHB] [^114wkrGu].

- **Normalization and repletion**: After normalization, continue iron for ~3 months [^113G7PHB] to replete stores and monitor periodically to detect recurrence [^111ryvCv].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring earlier or more frequent monitoring

Certain clinical scenarios may necessitate **earlier or more frequent hemoglobin monitoring** [^115bHVQo]:

- **Severe anemia**: Monitor more frequently in severe anemia or high-risk patients (e.g. cardiovascular disease, pregnancy) [^113Ch7CH].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: In CKD, monitor hemoglobin every 2–4 weeks initially, then monthly once stable.

- **Pregnancy**: Monitor every 4 weeks during pregnancy due to increased iron demands and risk of anemia recurrence.

- **Intravenous iron therapy**: Monitor hemoglobin within 1–2 weeks after IV iron to assess rapid response and adjust dosing [^114wkrGu].

---

## Factors influencing hemoglobin response to iron supplementation

Several factors can influence the **timing and magnitude of hemoglobin response** to iron supplementation [^114DruxY]:

| **Factor** | **Influence on hemoglobin response** |
|-|-|
| Baseline hemoglobin level | Lower baseline levels may show faster initial rises but take longer to normalize [^112c8s2E] |
| Iron formulation and dosage | IV iron produces faster rises than oral; higher doses yield larger responses [^113fTqjh] |
| Patient adherence | Poor adherence delays or blunts response [^114wkrGu] |
| Underlying conditions | CKD, IBD, and chronic inflammation can slow or blunt response [^11529EC7] [^114cKCfs] |
| Ongoing blood loss | Continued bleeding delays normalization [^114ZYX35] |

---

## Clinical implications of delayed hemoglobin response

A **delayed hemoglobin response** to iron supplementation may indicate:

- **Non-adherence**: Poor adherence to therapy [^114wkrGu].

- **Malabsorption**: Gastrointestinal malabsorption or intolerance [^114ZYX35].

- **Ongoing blood loss**: Continued bleeding or unresolved underlying conditions [^113BEyM7].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: Incorrect diagnosis or alternative causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic disease anemia) [^113h86KQ].

In such cases, **reassess adherence, absorption, and ongoing blood loss**, and consider alternative therapies — such as IV iron [^114wkrGu] — or further diagnostic evaluation [^113BEyM7].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Initial monitoring should occur **2–4 weeks after starting iron** [^113G7PHB]. An early response — defined as a **≥ 10 g/L (1 g/dL) rise by 2 weeks** [^114J4SK1] — predicts treatment success; if there is no rise at 2 weeks, reassess and consider IV iron [^114wkrGu]. After normalization, **continue iron for ~3 months** [^113G7PHB] and monitor periodically, adjusting therapy based on response [^111ryvCv].

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to follow-up, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend monitoring patients in the first 4 weeks for hemoglobin response to oral iron and continuing treatment for a period of around 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin level to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA) because most patients with slowly developing anemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful hemoglobin (Hb) response within a week and should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable hematological response to the initiation of iron replacement therapy (IRT), and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant of oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes, including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, hemolysis, continued bleeding, and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained hematological response, with a sensitivity of 90.1% and specificity of 79.3% for adequate subsequent response. In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). Low credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status. However, the methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory, and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate the determination of other contributory causes of anemia, such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10^9/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear, or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate.

### Preoperative iron supplementation in pediatric cardiac surgical patients: A preliminary single-center experience [^116GgAoY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

This study aimed to assess preoperative hemoglobin and perioperative red blood cell transfusion in children undergoing cardiac surgery. It followed the implementation of a preoperative patient blood management (PBM) clinic with oral iron supplementation.

The study was a retrospective analysis conducted at a single tertiary hospital. It involved patients who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada) during a 12-month period before and after the implementation of the PBM clinic. Notably, patients younger than 3 months of age, or those admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit preoperatively, were excluded as they were not systematically assessed by the PBM clinic.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: A total of 296 patients were included in the analysis. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age at surgery, preoperative oxygen saturation, type of congenital heart disease, and surgery type, it was found that preoperative hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in children treated with iron supplementation (n = 201) compared to historic controls (n = 95) with levels of 13.9 [12.8–15.1] g/dL vs. 12.9 [11.7–15.0] g/dL (adjusted p = 0.001). The exposure rate to red blood cell transfusion (50% vs. 61%, adjusted p = 0.930) was not significantly different between groups. However, the volumes of allogeneic red blood cells (1.4 [0.0–14.0] mL/kg vs. 12.5 [0.0–23.0] mL/kg, adjusted p = 0.004) and autologous blood (11.0 [6.8–17.0] vs. 17.0 [11.0–31.0], adjusted p < 0.001) transfused were significantly reduced in children receiving iron supplementation.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with IBD, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV iron as first-line therapy in patients with clinically active IBD, those with previous intolerance to oral iron, hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dL, and in patients requiring ESAs.

---

### Procrit [^116xnrbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Procrit. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Procrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112DJXiC]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

A 2015 systematic review found that iron supplementation greatly increased maternal haemoglobin. However, it did not differentiate participants based on initial haemoglobin status, making it unclear whether this benefit was confined only to anaemic women. Given the well-established benefit of iron supplementation for anaemic women, it is unsurprising that the average effect of supplementation across the whole pregnant population was positive. We have shown that the benefits of iron supplementation also extend to non-anaemic women. This benefit may be explained by a subpopulation of women who are iron deficient at the start of pregnancy but are not yet anaemic. For these women, iron supplementation could prevent progression to anaemia by treating the underlying deficiency. If this is the case, these women represent a clinically important population who are currently undetected and untreated in countries where antenatal iron status is not routinely assessed.

Many women do not receive sufficient dietary iron to meet the increased requirements of pregnancy, and iron deficiency can arise even among initially iron-replete women. A 2023 systematic review found that iron supplements reduce anaemia even for women who are not iron deficient at the start of their pregnancy. Therefore, antenatal screening of iron status may be insufficient to identify all women who could benefit from iron supplements. One solution is to stratify patients by risk factors for iron deficiency, such as multiple pregnancies, diet, and age when recommending iron supplements. However, further efforts are necessary to fully understand the implications and optimize iron supplementation strategies.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^114DruxY]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients and non-anemic blood donors suggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L, often requires longer treatment.

- **Ferrous salts**: Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate is recommended as a first-line treatment for IDA in adults by the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines.

### Complex anemia in tuberculosis: The need to consider causes and timing when designing interventions [^1155ckre]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in tuberculosis, and multiple etiologies necessitate targeted interventions. The proportion of iron-responsive anemia due to iron deficiency, compared with iron-unresponsive anemia due to impaired iron absorption or redistribution from tuberculosis-associated immune activation or inflammation, is unknown. This impedes the selection of safe and effective treatment and appropriate intervention timing.

- **Methods**: Baseline hemoglobin, ferritin, hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and transferrin were measured in 45 patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (cases), 47 tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive controls, and 39 TST-negative controls in The Gambia. Tuberculosis cases were additionally followed 2 and 6 months after tuberculosis treatment initiation. Mutually exclusive anemia categories based on iron biomarker concentrations were iron deficiency anemia (IDA), anemia of inflammation (AI), and multifactorial anemia (IDA+AI).

- **Results**: Anemia was more frequent in tuberculosis cases (67%) than in TST-positive (36%) or TST-negative (21%) controls. AI was the predominant anemia at tuberculosis diagnosis, declining from 36% to 8% after 6 months of treatment; however, a corresponding reduction was not evident for anemia with iron-responsive components (IDA, IDA+AI). Iron biomarkers discriminated between active tuberculosis and TST-positive or TST-negative controls, as well as between active untreated and treated tuberculosis. This was most noticeable for hepcidin, which decreased from a median of 84.0 ng/mL at diagnosis to 9.7 ng/mL after 2 months.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn [^114cnuws]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Taking into account the lack of availability of MRI in many countries and the costs for ESRD patients in others (e.g. USA, Israel), data from published studies with these new research tools were extrapolated in this article into practices (e.g. mg of IV iron infused per month and levels of iron biomarkers for follow-up such as ferritin and transferrin saturation). My goal is to help physicians manage anemia and protect patients from potential harm while minimizing the cost of anemia treatment. A number of specific scenarios are addressed.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children should be screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but they should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Randomized controlled trial of 2 prenatal iron supplements: Is there a dose-response relation with maternal hemoglobin [^1154Gou2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). High credibility.

The most appropriate dose of iron to prevent maternal anemia is still unclear. We assessed the dose-response relation between maternal hemoglobin and two prenatal iron supplements through an intention-to-treat, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. This trial compared 30 mg Fe + folic acid and 13 other micronutrients (UNIMMAP; UNICEF/WHO/UNU multiple micronutrient supplement for pregnant and lactating women) with 60 mg Fe + folic acid (IFA) only, in rural Burkina Faso. Home visitors directly observed tablet intake, and mixed-effects models were used for data analysis.

At inclusion, 43.2% of the 1268 participants were anemic. On average, the hemoglobin concentration decreased over gestation by 0.019 g/dL (95% CI: 0.012, 0.025 g/dL) per week in the IFA and UNIMMAP groups. An increment in hemoglobin concentration per micronutrient tablet [β (± SE) = 0.006 ± 0.001 g/dL; P < 0.0001] was observed only in women who were anemic at inclusion, whereas a decrease was observed in the other mothers (-0.003 ± 0.001 g/dL; P = 0.002), with the finding being similar in both the IFA and UNIMMAP groups.

Women with baseline anemia achieved the same hemoglobin concentration (mean ± SD: 11.1 ± 0.64 g/dL) as their counterparts who received ± 180 tablets of either UNIMMAP or IFA. Despite this, micronutrient intake did not significantly prevent anemia (51.0% in the third trimester). It was, however, a risk factor for hemoconcentration (odds ratio per tertile of tablet intake: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.94), independently of supplement type or initial hemoglobin level.

### Oral iron for patients receiving dialysis: What is the evidence [^114KXEyX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the effectiveness of oral iron in patients receiving dialysis. Four small randomized controlled trials, involving a total of 105 evaluated patients, compared oral iron supplements with placebo or no treatment. Hemoglobin and ferritin levels did not differ significantly between groups at the end of the studies, while transferrin saturation levels decreased in the placebo group in two studies. One trial, which evaluated 46 patients and compared different ferrous iron preparations, found that hemoglobin levels and iron indices were maintained, though not increased. Another trial, involving 54 evaluated patients, compared heme iron polypeptide with ferrous sulfate. Results indicated that hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels remained stable with both agents; however, ferritin levels fell with heme iron polypeptide, but not with ferrous sulfate.

Two observational studies found that iron supplements can maintain hemoglobin and iron indices. Oral iron supplements were generally poorly tolerated by patients. These sparse data suggest that oral iron is of little or no benefit in increasing hemoglobin and iron indices in patients undergoing dialysis. Further data are required to determine if oral iron can maintain adequate iron indices following iron replenishment using intravenous iron supplements.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn [^116KYVpt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Most hepatologists avoid iron therapy (oral and parenteral) in HCV‐infected patients without kidney disease to prevent a rise in viral replication, aggravation of histological lesions, and HCC development. However, in ESRD patients, it is impossible to withhold iron supplementation due to blood loss, which invariably results in iron store depletion and severe iron deficiency. Thus, iron replacement should be used cautiously with careful monitoring in HCV‐infected ESRD patients. It was recently proposed to utilize the minimalist Japanese strategy for iron therapy in this setting.

The Japanese Society for Dialysis, out of concern for iron overload, proposed as early as 2011 that minimal IV iron (up to 650 mg in the induction phase) be administered to hemodialysis patients only in cases of true iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg/L), and also warned against maintenance IV iron therapy. This careful strategy of iron repletion allowed for adequate hemoglobin levels with low ferritin and moderate transferrin saturation without any detrimental effect on survival and was again advocated this year for Japanese dialysis populations.

For specific circumstances of iron deficiency anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the 2015 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines recommend considering the administration of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for patients with anemia when hemoglobin levels are 7 g/dL if symptoms or particular risk factors are present. This should be followed by subsequent intravenous (IV) iron supplementation.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: Analysis of five trials [^1163DhwD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

- **Methods**: Pooled data from five randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple timepoints.

- **Results**: Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes. This proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

- **Conclusion**: Hemoglobin responses < 1.0

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, with at least half of these cases attributed to iron deficiency. The introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade has led to uncertainty about when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Numerous guidelines exist; however, none provide detailed information on therapeutic start and end points or on the optimal treatment of iron-deficiency anemia based on the underlying cause of iron deficiency and the presence of concomitant or additional diseases.

The study highlights significant issues that should be addressed in future guideline revisions for optimal iron replacement therapy. These include assessing the need for treatment, determining the appropriate timing for initiation and cessation of therapy, establishing follow-up protocols for relapse, and recommending suitable dosages and types of therapy. Additionally, it questions whether certain patients should not receive treatment.

### Iron status markers in nonanemic pregnant women with and without iron supplementation [^1123DTxV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

To measure levels of markers of anemia before and after delivery, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 244 women with high hemoglobin levels (13.2 g/dL or greater) during the early stage of the second trimester of pregnancy. These women did not receive iron supplementation during their pregnancies and had a serum ferritin level higher than 15 µg/L between the 13th and 18th week of pregnancy. Participants were administered either one 150-mg tablet of ferrous sulfate daily or a placebo. Markers of anemia were measured at the time of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum.

Results showed statistically significant differences between the two groups in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and ferritin levels both at the time of delivery and 6 weeks postpartum (P < 0.05). However, these differences were not clinically significant.

The conclusion drawn from the study is that not using iron supplementation did not cause a considerable decrease in markers of anemia in women with a hemoglobin concentration of 13.2 g/dL or greater during the second trimester of pregnancy.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management.

Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age.

Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function.

Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Mircera [^115jdb58]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Individualization of dosing**: Individualize and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL for adult patients. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Safety and benefits of antenatal oral iron supplementation in low-income countries: a review [^1142pzf3]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

A major limitation of these meta-analyses is that they were based on randomized trials that excluded women with anaemia or iron deficiency; or women received iron as rescue therapy during intervention (including those in the placebo group); or initial anaemia status and iron status had not been specified. As a consequence, the results do not apply to iron-deficient women, and they cannot be extrapolated to populations with a high prevalence of iron deficiency or anaemia.

To our knowledge, the study in Kenyan women cited previously (Mwangi et al, 2015) is the only placebo-controlled trial conducted so far that enrolled women with iron deficiency and anaemia at baseline. In that trial, antenatal iron supplementation increased birth weight by 150 g (95% CI: 56–244 g). It was anticipated that iron absorption and thus effects of administered iron would depend on baseline iron status. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the effect of iron on birth weight was larger in women with iron deficiency at baseline than in those who were initially iron-replete (234 g vs. 39 g; difference, 195 g; 95% CI, −3 to 393 g; P = 0.05). The risk of low birth weight decreased by 58%. The absolute risk reduction was 6.0% (95% CI, 0.8–11.1%), indicating that, on average, 16.8 women (95% CI, 9.0–61.3%) needed to receive supplementation to prevent 1 case of low birth weight.

Additional results indicated that the improvements in birth weight were achieved at least in part through an increased gestational duration, a decreased risk of prematurity, and an increased neonatal length.

### Jesduvroq [^115WBDrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating Jesduvroq. Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment with Jesduvroq. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

- **Liver testing**: Assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to initiation of Jesduvroq. Repeat the liver tests if the patient develops signs or symptoms that could be consistent with liver disease during treatment with Jesduvroq.

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Jesduvroq sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin higher than 11 g/dL. Jesduvroq can be taken with or without food, and without regard to concomitant administration of iron or phosphate binders [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Jesduvroq should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. Jesduvroq can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If a dose of Jesduvroq is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose.

### A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of IV iron supplementation for anemia of traumatic critical illness [^1122toaN]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of IV iron supplementation in anemic, critically ill trauma patients. This multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in four trauma ICUs.

Anemic patients, with hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dL, were enrolled within 72 hours of ICU admission and had an expected ICU stay of five days or more. The patients were randomized to receive either 100 mg of iron sucrose IV or a placebo thrice weekly for up to two weeks.

A total of 150 patients participated in the study. Baseline iron markers were consistent with functional iron deficiency; 134 patients (89.3%) were hypoferremic, 51 (34.0%) were hyperferritinemic, and 64 (42.7%) exhibited iron-deficient erythropoiesis, as evidenced by elevated erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin levels. The median baseline transferrin saturation was 8% (range, 2–58%).

In patients who received all six doses of the study drug (n = 57), serum ferritin concentrations significantly increased in the iron group compared to the placebo group on both day 7 (808.0 ng/mL vs. 457.0 ng/mL, p < 0.01) and day 14 (1,046.0 ng/mL vs. 551.5 ng/mL, p < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between groups in transferrin saturation, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, or packed RBC transfusion requirements. Additionally, no significant differences were observed between groups in the risk of infection, length of stay, or mortality.

In conclusion, iron supplementation significantly increased serum ferritin concentrations.

### Recombinant erythropoietin for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy: A systematic review [^115xk88X]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Synthesis of results**: Individual study outcomes are summarized here. Three studies found that serial recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) combined with iron supplementation was more effective at raising hematologic laboratory parameters, such as hemoglobin or hematocrit, than iron alone. Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. and Estemberg et al. noted a significant increase in hemoglobin after treatment in the intervention group (rEPO + iron) compared with the control group (iron alone). In the study by Breymann et al, patients in the intervention group had a more significant change in hematocrit at day 28 than those in the control group (8.3% ± 1.0% versus 6.0% ± 0.7%; P = 0.003). Additionally, patients in the intervention group reached the target hemoglobin level faster with a mean duration of therapy of 18 days versus 25 days. Only one patient in the intervention group did not reach target hemoglobin levels after 4 weeks, compared with five patients in the control group.

- **Findings by Sanchez-Gonzalez et al**: This study suggests that the effect of rEPO supplementation persists even after discontinuation. Treatment was stopped when the target hemoglobin level (12.0 g/dL) was reached or following a maximum of 4 weeks. At the time of delivery, patients in the intervention group (rEPO + iron) still had a higher mean increase in hemoglobin from baseline compared with those in the control group (1.9 g/dL versus 1.2 g/dL; P = 0.013).

- **Krafft et al**: This study reported no difference in hemoglobin levels by day 28. However, treatment group assignment was based on baseline hemoglobin level.

### Effects of daily iron supplementation in 2- to 5-year-old children: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V7sKv]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common cause of anemia worldwide, with the highest prevalence among preschool-aged children. Despite being widely administered to children with or at risk for ID, the evidence of benefit among 2- to 5-year-old children has not been thoroughly evaluated by systematic review. This study summarizes the evidence for the benefit and safety of daily iron supplementation with regard to hematologic, growth, and cognitive parameters in children aged 2 to 5 years.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases, regional databases, thesis repositories, gray literature, and references of studies and previous reviews were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing daily oral iron supplementation with control in 2 to 5-year-olds were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to synthesize predefined outcomes reported by at least two studies.

- **Results**: Out of 9169 references, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. None of these studies were at low risk of bias. Children receiving iron supplementation had a mean endpoint hemoglobin of 6.97 g/L (P < .00001; I(2) = 82%) greater than those in the control group, while mean endpoint ferritin was 11.64 µg/L (P < .0001; I(2) = 48%) greater. No trials reported the effects of iron supplementation on ID or iron deficiency anemia, and only one reported on anemia. Limited evidence suggested that iron supplementation produced a small improvement in cognitive development but had no effect on physical growth.

- **Conclusions**: In 2 to 5-year-olds, daily iron supplementation increases hemoglobin and ferritin levels. There is a concerning lack of data on the effect of iron supplementation on iron deficiency and anemia in this age group.

### Iron supplementation in nephrology and oncology: What do we have in common [^113fTqjh]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Anemia is frequently seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and also in those with cancer. There are factors in the pathogenesis of anemia that are common to both clinical conditions, with iron insufficiency, inflammation, and upregulation of hepcidin activity playing a part in both chronic disease states.

- **Diagnostic challenges**: Diagnostic laboratory markers for detecting functional iron deficiency in renal disease and oncology are not ideal. The most widely available tests, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, have poor sensitivity and specificity. Other tests incorporating a surrogate for iron sufficiency in the RBC and reticulocyte (such as percentage hypochromic RBCs or reticulocyte hemoglobin content) have greater sensitivity and specificity, but unfortunately, these tests are not widely available in many hospital laboratories.

- **Iron supplementation methods**: Iron supplementation may be given via the oral route, intramuscularly (i.m.), or intravenously (i.v.). However, it is now clear that, in both the nephrology and oncology settings, i.v. iron is superior to oral iron in terms of efficacy. Oral iron is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Although large epidemiological studies of i.v. iron are reassuring, the long-term safety of parenteral iron is not established in well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). IDA can be caused by a range of gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies, including cancer, and urgent GI investigation should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). It is recommended that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). A good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### VAFSEO [^111fD6P7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Following the initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, it is critical to monitor hemoglobin (Hb) levels every two weeks until they stabilize. After stabilization, monitoring should occur at least monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dose titration**: Increase the dose no more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Dose decreases can occur more frequently. Adjust the dose in increments of 150 mg to achieve or maintain Hb levels within 10 g/dL to 11 g/dL. Doses may range from 150 mg to a maximum of 600 mg. When adjusting the dose, consider factors such as the patient's Hb variability, Hb rate of rise and decline, and VAFSEO responsiveness. A single Hb excursion may not necessitate a dosing change. If the Hb rises rapidly (e.g. more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period or more than 2 g/dL in 4 weeks), interrupt or reduce the dose. If the Hb level exceeds 11 g/dL, interrupt the dose of VAFSEO until Hb is less than or equal to 11 g/dL, then resume with a dose that is 150 mg less than the dose prior to interruption. Treatment with VAFSEO should not continue beyond 24 weeks if a clinically meaningful increase in Hb level is not achieved. It is advisable to seek alternative explanations for an inadequate response before re-starting therapy.

- **Dosage adjustments due to drug interactions**: VAFSEO should be administered at least 1 hour before dosing oral iron supplements, products containing iron, or iron-containing phosphate binders [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Iron status during pregnancy: Setting the stage for mother and infant [^113osqLy]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Supplementation with iron is generally recommended during pregnancy to meet the iron needs of both mother and fetus. When detected early in pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with a more than twofold increase in the risk of preterm delivery. Maternal anemia diagnosed before midpregnancy is also associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Results of recent randomized clinical trials in the United States and Nepal that involved early supplementation with iron showed some reduction in risk of low birth weight or preterm low birth weight, but not preterm delivery.

During the third trimester, maternal anemia usually is not associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and may be an indicator of an expanded maternal plasma volume. High levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin are associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. While iron supplementation increases maternal iron status and stores, factors that underlie adverse pregnancy outcomes are considered to result in this association, not iron supplements. On the other hand, iron supplements and increased iron stores have recently been linked to maternal complications, such as gestational diabetes, and increased oxidative stress during pregnancy.

Consequently, while iron supplementation may improve pregnancy outcomes when the mother is iron deficient, it is also possible that prophylactic supplementation may increase risk when the mother does not have iron deficiency or IDA. Anemia and IDA are not synonymous, even among low-income minority groups.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112s7Cr6]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

In the context of diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically regarding the evaluation for functional iron deficiency, the 2013 guidelines by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) recommend viewing a reticulocyte hemoglobin content value of less than 29 pg as predictive of functional iron deficiency in patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy, and a value of less than 25 pg as suggestive of classical iron deficiency. A reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent value below 30.6 pg is predictive of the likelihood of response to intravenous (IV) iron therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.

### Effect of iron intake on iron status: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112c8s2E]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The response of status biomarkers to an increase in iron supply depends on several physiological and environmental factors, making it difficult to predict the outcome of an intervention.

- **Objective**: We assessed the effects of baseline iron status, sex, menopausal status, duration of intervention, iron form, and daily dose on the change in iron status in response to iron supplementation.

- **Design**: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on iron supplementation and fortification was conducted. These trials assessed effects on hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF), soluble transferrin receptor, or body iron. Subgrouping, straight-line, and curved meta-regression were used to describe the magnitude and dose-responsiveness of effect modifiers with respect to changes in status.

- **Results**: Forty-one RCTs were included; none of the RCTs were judged at low risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analyses demonstrated that iron supplementation significantly improved iron status, albeit with high heterogeneity. Meta-regression explained approximately one-quarter of the between-study variance in effect size. There were clear effects on SF with study duration (increase in SF concentration per week: 0.51 μg/L; 95% CI: 0.02, 1.00 μg/L; P = 0.04) and dose (increase in SF concentration per gram Fe: 0.10 μg/L; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.20 μg/L; P = 0.036), as well as on hemoglobin concentrations with baseline iron status [-0.08 g/dL (95% CI: 0.15, 0.00 g/dL) per 10-μg/L increase in baseline SF concentration; P = 0.02]. Insufficient data were available to assess effects on body iron, sex, or menopausal status.

Regarding medical management for cancer-related anemia, particularly with respect to iron replacement, ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend considering iron replacement to improve hemoglobin response and reduce RBC transfusions in patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) with or without iron deficiency. Obtain baseline and periodic monitoring of:

- **Iron**: Regularly check iron levels to assess and adjust treatment as necessary.
- **Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)**: Essential for understanding iron-binding potential and iron status.
- **Transferrin saturation**: Monitors the ratio of serum iron to TIBC, providing a clearer picture of iron availability.
- **Ferritin**: Periodic assessment of ferritin is crucial to determine stored iron levels and guide therapy adjustments.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cancer-related anemia, particularly in the context of initial assessment, the ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following tests for baseline evaluation in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy:

- **Thorough drug exposure history**: Obtain a comprehensive history of the patient's drug exposure.

- **Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination**: Conduct these tests in certain cases to gather more information.

- **Laboratory tests**: Include TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin, folate, vitamin B12, and hemoglobinopathy screening, where indicated.

- **Reticulocyte count, occult blood loss, and renal insufficiency assessment**: Evaluate these factors as part of the diagnostic process.

- **Baseline EPO level**: Measure the initial erythropoietin level for baseline reference.

- **Serum TSH**: Check thyroid-stimulating hormone levels when indicated.

- **Direct Coombs test**: Perform this test in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a history of autoimmune disease.

### Oral iron supplementation after blood donation: A randomized clinical trial [^116DWek1]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Although blood donation is allowed every 8 weeks in the United States, recovery of hemoglobin to the currently accepted standard (12.5 g/dL) is frequently delayed, and some donors become anemic. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of oral iron supplementation on hemoglobin recovery time (days to recovery of 80% of hemoglobin removed) and recovery of iron stores in iron-depleted ("low ferritin", ≤ 26 ng/mL) and iron-replete ("higher ferritin", > 26 ng/mL) blood donors.

This randomized, nonblinded clinical trial involved blood donors stratified by ferritin level, sex, and age, conducted in four regional blood centers in the United States in 2012. A total of 215 eligible participants aged 18 to 79 years, who had not donated whole blood or red blood cells within 4 months, were included.

- **Interventions**: Participants received either one tablet of ferrous gluconate (37.5 mg of elemental iron) daily or no iron for 24 weeks (168 days) after donating a unit of whole blood (500 mL).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main measures were the time to recovery of 80% of the postdonation decrease in hemoglobin and recovery of ferritin level to baseline as a measure of iron stores.

The results indicated that the mean baseline hemoglobin levels were comparable in both the iron and no-iron groups. These levels declined from a mean (SD) of 13.4 (1.1) g/dL to 12.0 (1.2) g/dL after donation in the low-ferritin group, and from 14.2 (1.1) g/dL to 12.9 (1.2) g/dL in the higher-ferritin group. Participants receiving iron supplementation showed a shortened time to 80% hemoglobin recovery compared with those who did not receive iron supplementation.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^111f7YBB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre. These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

- **Course of haemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT levels**: Figure 2 presents data on three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3), while the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels.
	- **Case 1**: This patient was monitored over 6 years. Initially, she received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow-up. At age 26, six years post-diagnosis (time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin levels (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range.
	- **Case 2**: Hb and iron metrics were tracked over 4 years, including two pregnancies, indicated by horizontal bars in Figure 2. At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32-year-old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at the time of the last administration). During the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable, and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than in non-pregnancy periods.
	- **Case 3**: Hb, CRP, and iron metrics were recorded over 20 years. Unfortunately, the text is truncated and incomplete, ending with "IV iron (total" leaving further details about the treatment course unexplained.

### U-shaped curve for risk associated with maternal hemoglobin, iron status, or iron supplementation [^1151gRVX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Both iron deficiency (ID) and excess can lead to impaired health status. There is substantial evidence of a U-shaped curve between the risk of adverse birth outcomes and maternal hemoglobin concentrations during pregnancy; however, it is unclear whether these relations are attributable to conditions of low and high iron status or to other mechanisms. We summarized evidence from human studies regarding the association between birth outcomes and maternal hemoglobin concentrations or iron status. We also reviewed the effects of iron supplementation on birth outcomes among women at low risk of ID and the potential mechanisms for adverse effects of high iron status during pregnancy.

Overall, we confirmed a U-shaped curve for the risk of adverse birth outcomes with maternal hemoglobin concentrations, but the relations differ by trimester. For low hemoglobin concentrations, the link with adverse outcomes is more evident when hemoglobin concentrations are measured in early pregnancy. These relations generally become weaker or nonexistent when hemoglobin concentrations are measured in the second or third trimesters. Associations between high hemoglobin concentration and adverse birth outcomes are evident in all three trimesters, but evidence is mixed. There is less evidence for the associations between maternal iron status and adverse birth outcomes. Most studies used serum ferritin (SF) concentrations as the indicator of iron status, which makes the interpretation of results challenging because SF concentrations increase in response to inflammation or infection.

### The complex relationship between iron status and anemia in pregnant and postpartum women in India: Analysis of two Indian study cohorts of uncomplicated pregnancies [^113JDYBZ]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

In India and other LMICs, low hemoglobin in pregnancy is used as an indication for iron supplementation and treatment, although anemia and iron deficiency do not completely overlap. Our study demonstrates this and shows that low hemoglobin is not a useful indicator of iron deficiency anemia. There is a need to measure iron biomarkers to ascertain the need for supplementation and treatment. Non-anemic iron deficiency has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in non-pregnant populations. If based on hemoglobin measurement only, pregnant women who are iron deficient but not anemic are not treated for iron deficiency, this would put them at greater risk of developing anemia later and could increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Conversely, others who are anemic but not iron deficient are being unnecessarily supplemented, putting them at risk of being exposed to excess iron.

- **Ineffective erythropoiesis**: Observed in hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia, hereditary sideroblastic anemias, and certain myelodysplastic syndromes, where anemia is associated with iron overload. This results from increased iron absorption and mobilization of iron from the stores mediated by relative hepcidin deficiency. A significant proportion of our study population with high ferritin had abnormal hemoglobin types (35% in the antenatal and 41% in the postnatal cohort). Therefore, these conditions should be investigated before treating women with iron, assuming that the observed anemia is due to iron deficiency.

Hepcidin levels are known to increase dramatically.

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^115rYBb2]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The elemental iron content, which is the actual amount of iron available for absorption, differs between commercial iron formulations. Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing approximately 60–70 mg of elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach to reach a daily dose of about 200 mg of elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies have provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple doses per day. These studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aimed at preventing iron overload. These responses are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption.

The effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study involving non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate on different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, allowing each participant to serve as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg of elemental iron or higher triggered the induction of hepcidin for up to 24 hours. This decreased the further absorption of iron within that period.

### Iron deficiency resolution and time to resolution in an American health system [^11589t2f]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is a global health problem with consequences independent of anemia, including impaired cognition and exercise tolerance. The time from laboratory diagnosis to resolution of ID has not been defined. In a retrospective review of electronic medical record data from a Minnesota statewide health system, we identified patients with ID (ferritin level ≤ 25 ng/mL). Patients with at least 1 follow-up ferritin level within 3 years were included. Patients with a subsequent ferritin of ≥ 50 ng/mL were classified as having resolved ID.

Descriptive statistics and time-to-event analyses were used to determine the proportion of ID resolution and time to resolution, and to evaluate characteristics predictive of resolution. We identified 13,084 patients with ID between 2010 and 2020. We found that 5,485 (41.9%) had resolution within 3 years of diagnosis, whereas 7,599 (58.1%) had no documented resolution. The median time to resolution was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.8–3.9).

Factors associated with greater likelihood of resolution included age of ≥ 60 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.44–1.69), male sex (aHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.48–1.70), and treatment with intravenous iron (aHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.66–3.30). Black race was associated with a lower likelihood of resolution (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66–0.80).

We observed a high proportion of persistent ID and prolonged time to resolution overall, with a greater risk of lack of resolution among females and Black individuals. Targeted knowledge translation interventions are required to facilitate improvement.

### Multivitamin-mineral supplementation is not as efficacious as is iron supplementation in improving hemoglobin concentrations in nonpregnant anemic women living in Mexico [^112qTf27]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Iron supplements improve hemoglobin status and reduce anemia due to iron deficiency. It is not known whether multiple micronutrient (MM) supplements are as efficacious as iron supplements alone in improving hemoglobin concentrations.

- **Objective**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind community trial in Mexico to compare the efficacy of MM supplements containing iron with that of iron alone in improving hemoglobin concentrations in nonpregnant women.

- **Design**: Nonpregnant women (n = 158) were recruited from a semirural community in Mexico and were randomly assigned to receive iron alone (60 mg; Fe group) or MM supplements (vitamins A, B complex, C, D, E, and K and iron, zinc, and magnesium; MM group) 6 days per week in their home for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin concentrations were measured in capillary blood samples at baseline and follow-up.

- **Results**: The treatment groups (MM: n = 75; Fe: n = 77) did not differ significantly at recruitment in age, schooling, literacy, or socioeconomic status. There were no significant differences between groups in compliance (median: 97.5%), baseline hemoglobin concentrations, or prevalence of anemia (20%). Losses to follow-up (4%) and mean (± SD) changes in hemoglobin (MM group: 6.7 ± 10.6 g/L; Fe group: 7.1 ± 13.6 g/L) were not significantly different between groups. However, the change in hemoglobin in anemic subjects was greater in the Fe group than in the MM group (P < 0.05 for interaction), and there was no significant difference in nonanemic subjects.

- **Conclusions**: MM supplements may not be as efficacious as iron alone in improving hemoglobin concentrations.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112KFCtq]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, particularly in evaluating functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend against measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in isolation to predict responsiveness to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD.

- **Recommendations for evaluations**: Consider assessing the percentage saturation of transferrin to monitor response to ESAs and/or iron therapy in these patients. It is also advised to measure the percentage saturation of transferrin in combination with either the serum ferritin concentration or other measurements, such as the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content, for diagnosing functional iron deficiency.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, specifically with respect to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an anemia workup if the hemoglobin level is below normal. The workup should include at least red blood cell (RBC) indices such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. An extended workup should also consider serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of anemia and iron stores should be conducted by correcting and excluding other causes of anemia, such as vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, and bleeding, before initiating VAFSEO. It is important to evaluate iron status in all patients both before and during treatment. Supplemental iron therapy should be administered when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Hemoglobin (Hb) should be measured at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels should be measured prior to initiating VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months. Monitoring should continue as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if the ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. It is advised not to target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food and should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of meal.

### The benefits and harms of oral iron supplementation in non-anaemic pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Pevcn]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

This review was inspired by the author's encounters with patients in primary care, which highlighted the importance of the topic. However, patients were not specifically involved in the design and interpretation of the study. Therefore, it is possible that outcomes important to patients were missed; for example, the focus on once-daily iron intake as the most common dosing regimen may not align with real-world preferences. This limitation was partially mitigated by including all reported outcomes from included studies. However, future research should be co-designed with patients.

Researchers had an ethical obligation to treat participants in the control group if they became anaemic during the trial. Some studies excluded these participants, which artificially increased the control groups' haemoglobin, while other studies analyzed these participants in their original group. This may have obscured differences between control and intervention groups. Consequently, our analysis may underestimate both the benefits and harms of iron supplementation, though this effect is probably less significant given the high variability observed between studies.

To maximize the quantity of data included in this review, a wide range of studies were included. This introduced methodological heterogeneity, with substantial differences in variables such as dose, duration, and authors' definitions of anaemia. These differences may have altered the true effect of intervention in each study, so the combined effect estimate may not correspond to a clinical reality.

### Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial [^112653gH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discontinuation visit:

This visit will take place only in case of the participant's withdrawal from the study at any time outside the scheduled timetable. The exact date and reason for discontinuation will be registered. If possible, the healthcare professional will assess the woman's health status via clinical history notes and an ultrasound. A blood sample will be solicited for routine tests. The adherence to the iron supplementation up until the discontinuation of the treatment will be recorded, as will any adverse events. All the questionnaires will be filled in, including FFQ, IPAQ, STAI, and Fagerstrom_Q. In case of having given birth, all the variables related to delivery and the newborn will be collected, and a questionnaire on postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) will be applied.

- **Outcomes**:

- **Primary outcomes**: The principal variables in the pregnancy are the iron status of the mother at each clinical visit (anemia, ferropenic anemia, risk of hemoconcentration) and the birth weight of the baby.

- **Definition of main outcome variables**: Anemia is defined as Hb < 110 g/L in the 2nd and 3rd trimester.

- **Participant timeline**:

Clinical follow-up of the pregnancy in the PCC will be according to the program set by ASSIR. The participant timeline is detailed in Figure 1.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113jDSob]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin (Hb) levels normalize with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Recommendation on long-term IRT**: We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA (reIDA) is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Monitoring post-IRT**: After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically, perhaps every 6 months initially, to detect reIDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should be addressed appropriately. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative bidirectional endoscopy (BDE), no evidence of coeliac disease (CD), no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favorable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for reIDA. In an era of limited resources, we suggest checks perhaps at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

Further investigation is warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers, and persistent…

### Monitoring recovery from iron deficiency using total hemoglobin mass [^113S6cwS]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Using hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) to diagnose borderline iron deficiency and monitor the progress of its treatment is difficult because of the confounding effects of plasma volume. Because hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is not affected by plasma volume, it may be a more sensitive parameter. The aim of this study was to monitor Hbmass, iron storage, and maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) during and after oral iron therapy in subjects with severe and moderate iron deficiency.

Methods: Three groups of female recreational athletes were monitored for at least 22 weeks, as follows: 1) severe iron deficiency group (SID) (n = 8; ferritin, ≤ 12 ng·mL), 2) moderate iron deficiency group (MID) (n = 14; ferritin, ≤ 25 ng·mL), and 3) control group (n = 8; ferritin, > 25 ng·mL). Hbmass and iron status were determined before, during, and up to 12 weeks after at least 10 weeks of oral iron supplementation. In total, five V˙O2max tests were performed before, during, and after the supplementation period.

Results: Hbmass increased markedly in the SID group (15.6% ± 11.0%, P < 0.001) and slightly in the MID group (2.2% ± 3.7%, P < 0.05) by the end of the supplementation period and remained at this level for the following 12 weeks. [Hb] and Hbmass were similarly affected, but Hbmass was more closely related to mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin than [Hb]. The SID group incorporated 534 ± 127 mg of iron into ferritin and hemoglobin, whereas the MID group incorporated 282 ± 68 mg of iron. V˙O2max increased only in the SID group by 0.20 ± 0.18 L·min (P < 0.05) and was closely monitored.
