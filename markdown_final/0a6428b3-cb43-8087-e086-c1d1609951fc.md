## Question

What can cause paroxysmal attacks of tachycardia, palpitations, heat flushing, mild hand tremor, and dizziness in a patient with a fever of unknown origin and unintentional weight loss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause paroxysmal attacks of tachycardia, palpitations, heat flushing, mild hand tremor, and dizziness in a patient with a fever of unknown origin and unintentional weight loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which conditions best explain the full symptom complex, especially the paroxysmal adrenergic spells and systemic features. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and actively exclude mimics. Next, I will outline a prioritized diagnostic workup with first-line and second-line tests. Finally, I will consider immediate management priorities and red flags that warrant urgent action, while double-checking that each step aligns with guideline-level sources and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma fits the paroxysmal spells of palpitations, tachycardia, flushing, tremor, and dizziness, and can also produce fever and weight loss via catecholamine-driven hypermetabolism and vasoconstriction physiology; importantly, spells can be triggered by posture, exercise, anesthesia, or medications, and patients may be normotensive between attacks, so I should not anchor on sustained hypertension to exclude this diagnosis [^4de6d5e4] [^3b25cea5] [^450616e6].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for fever and weight loss in pheochromocytoma. The NEJM review notes fever as a recognized manifestation, and catecholamine excess drives hypermetabolism with weight loss; case-based literature also describes pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis with fever and systemic involvement, reinforcing that fever and weight loss, while not universal, are plausible and reported features in this disease spectrum [^4de6d5e4] [^952d13e9] [^3b25cea5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; hyperthyroidism is a close mimic and must be actively excluded. Hyperthyroidism explains tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, heat intolerance/flushing, dizziness, weight loss, and can present with low-grade fever or even thyroid storm; I should confirm with TSH and free T4, and consider uptake scan if Graves' disease is suspected, keeping in mind that thyroid storm is a medical emergency if mental status changes occur [^199baa97] [^58ab33c5] [^2f3ecde6].

> I need to check other endocrine causes of flushing and palpitations. Carcinoid syndrome and medullary thyroid carcinoma can cause flushing and systemic symptoms, but the absence of watery diarrhea and wheeze makes carcinoid less likely here, and the lack of a neck mass or calcitonin elevation reduces the probability of medullary thyroid carcinoma; still, if symptoms persist and initial workup is unrevealing, I should reconsider these entities with targeted testing [^541808bc].

> Let me consider autonomic and dysautonomic syndromes. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome can cause palpitations, tremor, dizziness, and flushing, but it does not explain fever or weight loss; thus, POTS is unlikely to be the unifying diagnosis here, though it could coexist and should be assessed with orthostatic vitals if dizziness predominates [^7a4637e3] [^997f8106].

> I should double-check medication and substance contributors. Excess levothyroxine or liothyronine can produce thyrotoxicosis with palpitations, tremor, weight loss, and flushing; stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine can cause paroxysmal tachycardia, flushing, tremor, and hyperthermia; even therapeutic epinephrine can precipitate adrenergic symptoms, so a meticulous medication and supplement history is essential before labeling this as primary endocrine disease [^71fd6b2b] [^563d4a3c] [^4ec666c4].

> Next, I should review the infectious and neoplastic causes of fever of unknown origin to ensure I am not missing a parallel process. Tuberculosis, lymphoma, and other occult infections or malignancies can drive fever and weight loss; however, the paroxysmal adrenergic spells with flushing and tremor are not typical for these entities, so while I must keep FUO etiologies in mind, the symptom pattern still points most strongly to a catecholamine-secreting tumor or hyperthyroidism as the unifying diagnosis [^f96d6e00] [^264fd7d6].

> I will now examine the first-line diagnostic strategy. For pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, I should order 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines and plasma free metanephrines, given their high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity; I need to ensure proper collection conditions and consider that intermittent secretion can yield false negatives, so if clinical suspicion remains high, repeating testing or using clonidine suppression may be warranted [^4de6d5e4].

> For hyperthyroidism, I should confirm with TSH and free T4; if TSH is suppressed, I will assess free T3 and consider thyroid antibodies and uptake scanning to distinguish Graves' disease from thyroiditis or nodular disease, recognizing that thyroid storm is an emergency if altered mentation or severe hyperthermia is present [^199baa97] [^58ab33c5].

> Let me think about second-line testing if initial results are equivocal but suspicion remains high. CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis can localize adrenal or extra-adrenal paragangliomas, and functional imaging such as 123-I MIBG or PET may be needed for metastatic or multifocal disease; for hyperthyroidism, radioactive iodine uptake and scan help differentiate etiologies when the cause is unclear from labs alone [^4de6d5e4] [^199baa97].

> I should confirm immediate management priorities while awaiting results. If pheochromocytoma is suspected, I must avoid beta-blockade until adequate alpha-blockade is established to prevent unopposed alpha-mediated vasoconstriction; phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin should be started first, with close hemodynamic monitoring, and I should avoid triggers such as metoclopramide, glucagon, or contrast until the tumor is controlled [^4de6d5e4].

> If hyperthyroidism is confirmed, I should initiate thionamide therapy such as methimazole and consider beta-blockade for symptom control, escalating to urgent endocrinology input if thyroid storm is suspected; if thyroid storm is present, I need to treat with antithyroid drugs, iodine, glucocorticoids, and supportive care in a monitored setting [^199baa97] [^58ab33c5].

> But wait, what if the spells are actually due to a cardiac arrhythmia rather than catecholamine excess. I should obtain a 12-lead ECG and consider ambulatory monitoring, because AVNRT and other SVTs can present with paroxysmal palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, and even flushing, and symptom–rhythm correlation is key; however, the coexisting fever and weight loss still push me to prioritize endocrine etiologies first while not delaying arrhythmia evaluation if unstable [^a8a19a85] [^52455a54].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, clue-directed workup: pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is the most likely unifying diagnosis given the paroxysmal adrenergic spells with flushing and tremor plus systemic features of fever and weight loss, but hyperthyroidism is a critical differential that must be excluded early with TSH and free T4; medication-induced thyrotoxicosis and stimulant use should be screened, and FUO etiologies considered if the endocrine workup is negative or if red flags emerge, with management tailored to the confirmed diagnosis and hemodynamic stability [^4de6d5e4] [^199baa97] [^f96d6e00].

---

The most likely cause of paroxysmal tachycardia, palpitations, heat flushing, mild hand tremor, and dizziness with fever of unknown origin and unintentional weight loss is **pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma** [^4de6d5e4], given the classic episodic catecholamine surge and systemic features. Hyperthyroidism (especially Graves' disease) [^199baa97] is a close alternative, explaining the adrenergic and metabolic symptoms, including fever and weight loss. Other considerations include carcinoid syndrome [^541808bc], mastocytosis, anxiety/panic disorder [^a8a19a85], and stimulant or medication effects [^563d4a3c]. Initial workup should include **24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines** [^4de6d5e4], plasma free metanephrines, thyroid function tests, and a 12-lead ECG; if positive, proceed to adrenal imaging and targeted therapy [^4de6d5e4].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Key features** | **Relevance to symptoms** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Endocrine | Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma | - Paroxysmal hypertension <br/> - Palpitations <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Tremor <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Flushing <br/> - Fever <br/> - Weight loss [^4de6d5e4] | Highly consistent with episodic adrenergic symptoms and systemic features |

## Pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that cause **paroxysmal symptoms** via episodic release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, producing tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, tremor, anxiety, flushing, and hypertension [^4de6d5e4]. Catecholamines increase metabolic rate, causing weight loss, and can elevate body temperature, explaining fever in some cases [^3b25cea5].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed characterization of spells, triggers, family history, and medication use [^4e99678d].
- **Laboratory tests**: 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines, plasma free metanephrines, thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4), CBC, metabolic panel, ECG [^4de6d5e4] [^199baa97].
- **Imaging**: If biochemical tests are positive, adrenal CT/MRI and functional imaging (MIBG or PET) to localize tumor [^notfound].

---

### Confirmatory tests

Confirmatory testing includes a **clonidine suppression test** to differentiate pheochromocytoma from other causes of elevated catecholamines and genetic testing for hereditary syndromes (e.g. MEN2, VHL, SDH mutations) [^4de6d5e4].

---

## Management

Management centers on **alpha-blockade** (phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin) followed by beta-blockade once alpha-blockade is established, with surgical resection for localized disease [^4de6d5e4]. For metastatic or inoperable cases, consider radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent with early diagnosis and surgical cure**; however, delayed diagnosis increases morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular complications [^4de6d5e4].

---

The most likely cause is **pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma**, with hyperthyroidism as a key alternative. A structured workup with biochemical testing and imaging is essential for diagnosis and management [^4de6d5e4].

In addition to the classic triad, patients often experience other symptoms such as anxiety, dyspnea, chest, abdominal or flank pain, nausea and vomiting, tremor, flushing, dizziness, visual symptoms such as blurred vision, and paresthesia. On the other hand, persistent vasoconstriction in patients with pheochromocytoma declines the blood volume leading to orthostatic hypotension. The sudden out-pouring of epinephrine has been postulated as causing an elevation in body temperature by a combination of inducing hypermetabolism and impairing heat dissipation as a consequence of cutaneous vasoconstriction (the leading cause of pallor during attacks). Hypermetabolism caused by catecholamines can cause weakness, fatigue and weight loss. Paradoxically, some patients have diarrhea, whereas others may have constipation.

Although chronic hypertension can cause cardiovascular complications, catecholamines directly have toxic effect on myocardium as well. During attacks different ECG changes evolve, which are resolved after the surgery. However, chronic exposure to catecholamine can lead to irreversible myocardial fibrosis.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^2f3ecde6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our case indicates that a comprehensive preoperative history collection is extremely crucial for underdiagnosed patients, especially for elective surgery. Thyroid diseases can be discovered with a more careful preoperative assessment and TS probably prevented. In reported cases listed in Tables 3, 61% (11/18) patients experienced TS due to unrecognized underlying hyperthyroidism preoperatively. The signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be very subtle to clinically overt. Patients with hyperthyroidism commonly experience palpitations, fatigue, tremor, anxiety, disturbed sleep, weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating, tachycardia, and fever. Thyroid nodules or a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes with a bruit, may be palpable. Up to 25% of patients with Graves' disease present with signs of ophthalmopathy. Other rare extrathyroidal Graves' disease manifestations include pretibial myxedema and acropachy. When patients present with multiple symptoms and signs as mentioned above, hyperthyroidism should be considered as a potential diagnosis. Symptoms that are often overlooked include abdominal discomfort, weight changes, and fatigue. Of note, some non-thyroid diseases and drugs can influence thyroid hormone levels, including gestational trophoblastic disease, McCune-Albright syndrome, teratoma (struma ovarii), TSH-producing pituitary adenomas, and amiodarone. Patients with these diseases have an increased likelihood to develop hyperthyroidism and TS.

### Methadone hydrochloride (methadone HCl) [^30776d17]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Heroin Withdrawal

During the induction phase of methadone maintenance treatment, patients are being withdrawn from heroin and may therefore show typical withdrawal symptoms, which should be differentiated from methadone-induced side effects. They may exhibit some or all of the following signs and symptoms associated with acute withdrawal from heroin or other opiates: lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sneezing, yawning, excessive perspiration, goose-flesh, fever, chilliness alternating with flushing, restlessness, irritability, weakness, anxiety, depression, dilated pupils, tremors, tachycardia, abdominal cramps, body aches, involuntary twitching and kicking movements, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal spasms, and weight loss.

Initial Administration

The initial methadone dose should be carefully titrated to the individual. Too rapid titration for the patient's sensitivity is more likely to produce adverse effects.

The major hazards of methadone are respiratory depression and, to a lesser degree, systemic hypotension. Respiratory arrest, shock, cardiac arrest, and death have occurred.

The most frequently observed adverse reactions include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those who are not suffering severe pain. In such individuals, lower doses are advisable.

Other adverse reactions include the following: (listed alphabetically under each subsection)

Body as a Whole

asthenia (weakness), edema, headache

Cardiovascular

(also see WARNINGS: Cardiac Conduction Effects) – arrhythmias, bigeminal rhythms, bradycardia, cardiomyopathy, ECG abnormalities, extrasystoles, flushing, heart failure, hypotension, palpitations, phlebitis, QT interval prolongation, syncope, T-wave inversion, tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia

Digestive

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^ac6faf28]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Fever of unknown origin: clinical overview of classic and current concepts [^00b2f980]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^a45fe993]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Mefloquine hydrochloride [^13796560]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing

Postmarketing surveillance indicates that the same kind of adverse reactions are reported during prophylaxis, as well as acute treatment. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to mefloquine exposure.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, loose stools or diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness or vertigo, loss of balance, and neuropsychiatric events such as headache, somnolence, and sleep disorders (insomnia, abnormal dreams). These adverse reactions may occur early in the course of mefloquine use. It has been reported that dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus and hearing impairment, and loss of balance may continue for months or years after discontinuation of the drug and may be permanent in some cases.

More severe neuropsychiatric disorders have been reported such as: sensory and motor neuropathies (including paresthesia, tremor and ataxia), convulsions, agitation or restlessness, anxiety, depression, mood swings, panic attacks, memory impairment, confusion, hallucinations, aggression, psychotic or paranoid reactions and encephalopathy. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported.

Other less frequently reported adverse reactions include:

Cardiovascular Disorders: circulatory disturbances (hypotension, hypertension, flushing, syncope), chest pain, tachycardia or palpitation, bradycardia, irregular heart rate, extrasystoles, A-V block, and other transient cardiac conduction alterations.

Skin Disorders: rash, exanthema, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, edema, hair loss, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Musculoskeletal Disorders: muscle weakness, muscle cramps, myalgia, and arthralgia.

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia? [^a8a19a85]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many patients have palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia can be challenging and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with palpitations. Data Source, Study Selection, and

Data Extraction

MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) searches of English-language articles that compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations with a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality and a third author resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–3.11), having palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. A known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or having palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely. The presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck (LR, 177; 95% CI, 25–1251) or visible neck pulsations (LR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25–5.78) in association with palpitations increases the likelihood of a specific type of arrhythmia (atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia). The absence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck makes detecting the same arrhythmia less likely (LR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19). No other features significantly alter the probability of clinically significant arrhythmia. Diagnostic tests for prolonged periods of electrocardiographic monitoring vary in their yield depending on the modality used, duration of monitoring, and occurrence of typical symptoms during monitoring. Loop monitors have the highest diagnostic yield (34%-84%) for identifying an arrhythmia.

Conclusions

While the presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck or visible neck pulsations associated with palpitations makes the diagnosis of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia likely, the reviewed studies suggest that the clinical examination is not sufficiently accurate to exclude clinically significant arrhythmias in most patients. Thus, prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring with demonstration of symptom-rhythm correlation is required to make the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia for most patients with recurrent palpitations.

### Lorazepam [^5a51c7b2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms reported following discontinuation of benzodiazepines include headache, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, rebound phenomena, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise, and physical contact/perceptual changes, involuntary movements, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, hallucinations/delirium, convulsions/seizures, tremor, abdominal cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, vertigo, hyperreflexia, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. Convulsions/seizures may be more common in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or who are taking other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold such as antidepressants.

There is evidence that tolerance develops to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines.

Lorazepam may have abuse potential, especially in patients with a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.

Thyroid dysfunction

Like patients with pituitary dysfunction, patients with thyroid dysfunction are often asymptomatic and the diagnosis is usually only initially by biochemistry. The pathophysiology is reported to be dissimilar to autoimmune diseases of the thyroid, with CPI-induced cases appearing to be part of a spectrum induced by T cell cytotoxicity, starting with acute thyroiditis (with raised fT4 and low thyroid-stimulating hormone) typically after 1 month of therapy and progressing to hypothyroidism after a further month. Thyrotoxicosis, secondary to thyroiditis or Grave's disease, is a rare complication of CPI therapy. Testing for antibodies such as anti-thyroid peroxidase and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin can be useful. Rarely, patients may have symptoms of acute hyperthyroidism (tachycardia, palpitations, diarrhoea or tremor) or hypothyroidism (constipation, weight gain, lethargy).

### Levothyroxine [^376e2de7]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage (see PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE). They include the following:

General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating;

Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia;

Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness;

Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest;

Respiratory: dyspnea;

Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and elevation in liver function tests;

Dermatologic: hair loss; flushing;

Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density;

Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility.

Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised height.

Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.

Inadequate levothyroxine dosage will produce or fail to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.

Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various Gl symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.

### Investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin in adults [^f96d6e00]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Few clinical problems generate such a wide differential diagnosis as pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. The initial definition proposed by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961,¹ later revised, is "a fever of 38.3°C (101°F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits". ²⁻⁴Essentially the term refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an obvious cause despite reasonable evaluation and diagnostic testing. A fever that is not self limiting for which no cause can be found can become a source of frustration for both patient and doctor. There is little consensus on how such patients should be investigated, although recent prospective studies have evaluated diagnostic protocols to suggest approaches to investigation. ³⁵⁶ We discuss evidence from epidemiological and diagnostic studies and suggest an approach to investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunocompromised individuals, those with HIV infection, and patients admitted to hospital for other reasons with persistent or unexplained fever represent distinct subgroups in which the likely causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pyrexia usually differ from those in patients who are not immunocompromised. We do not discuss these subgroups in this review other than to provide definitions of pyrexia of unknown origin in different groups of patients (see box 1).

Symptoms include Anxiety, restlessness, mood swings, panic attacks, behavioral problems, deterioration in school performance, inability to concentrate and sleep disturbances. Palpitations, heat-intolerance, fatigue, muscle weakness, development of new onset tremors Increased appetite, diarrhea, changes in weight [usually weight loss], and menstrual irregularity in girls, and Family history: History of thyroid or other autoimmune disorder. Initial laboratory work-up can include Blood tests: TSH, Free T4 (FT4), T3, Thyroid peroxidase antibody, Thyroglobulin antibody, Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), and Thyroid receptor antibodies (TRAb); Other tests to consider after consultation with Pediatric Endocrinologist include CBC with differential, CMP, Thyroid ultrasound, and Radioactive iodine uptake. Urgent referral guidance states that All cases of hyperthyroidism should be considered a medical urgency and referred to pediatric endocrinologist as early as a possible, with The exception to the rule: thyroid storm which is a medical emergency and patients should be transferred to the emergent care center for initial stabilization; additionally, Onset of fever and altered mental status is ominous and may indicate a thyroid storm. Items useful for consultation include Previous growth data/growth charts, Pertinent medical records, and Recent laboratory and radiologic studies.

Diagnosis of GD

Awareness of common and atypical presentations of GD is necessary as failure to diagnose GD in a timely manner may lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Most patients with GD present with classic signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, but they can also present with TED in about 40%of cases and dermopathy in 5% to 15% of patients. Thymic enlargement has also been reported. Clinical presentation depends on the age of onset, severity, and duration of hyperthyroidism.

Common presentations such as heat intolerance, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, palpitation, tremors, anxiety, nervousness, as well as eye symptoms and palpable goiter are often seen in younger population. In older patients, symptoms are usually subtle with fatigue, weight loss, and new onset atrial fibrillation. Atypical presentation of hyperthyroidism in older adults is also referred as apathetic thyrotoxicosis.

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations [^0334ea1a]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpitations-sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat-are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered as potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, and noncardiac problems, such as hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations also can result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

### Dangerous mistake: an accidental caffeine overdose [^0e41b456]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year-old woman with no significant medical and family history presented to the local emergency department (ED) referring malaise, anxiety, dizziness and nausea. Symptoms like chest pain, syncope, palpitations or fever were denied.

The initial physical examination at triage revealed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths/min, 100% oxygen saturation on room air, blood pressure of 112/70 mm Hg, pulse of 80 beats/min and had a normal tympanic temperature. Also, the blood sugar was 147 mg/dL.

After observation, the patient had an episode of presyncope followed by agitation and vomiting. At this point, the patient was pale and sweaty with a GCS of 11 (eye opening: 4; verbal response: 2; motor response: 5), blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, tachycardia (160 beats/min) and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. Her pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and no muscle weakness or sensory deficits were found.

The ECG showed a polymorphic broad QRS tachycardia and the arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidaemia with severe hypokalemia. The dysrhythmia was successfully treated with 5 mg of propranolol intravenous in total. Acid–base and hydroelectrolytic disorders were also corrected.

After stabilisation, the patient informed the ED's physician that when she was preparing the preworkout supplement, used the same dosage of the proteic supplement for anhydrous caffeine, instead of 1 dose of 300 mg (6 mg/kg) of anhydrous caffeine, the patient consumed a total of 5000 mg (89 mg/kg), 30 min before going to the ED. The patient switched the dose dispensers shown in figure 1.

Figure 1
Two view angle of dose dispensers; (A) dose dispenser for the proteic supplement; (B) dose dispenser for the anhydrous caffeine.

The patient's body weight was 56 kg. The patient also indicated that she occasionally drinks one espresso (60 mg of caffeine) and has never used alcohol or any recreational drugs.

### The face of postural tachycardia syndrome-insights from a large cross-sectional online community-based survey [^5bccb2da]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Here, we highlight the results of the largest known survey of patients with a diagnosis of POTS. We believe these results provide important insights into the background, clinical features and diagnostic journey of patients suffering from this condition. We believe these data will serve as an essential step for moving forward with future studies aimed at better identifying these patients and establishing better treatments for their symptoms.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficulties. These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine, but are more likely to occur in patients with heart disease, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)].

Due to the lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, the true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine. Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below by body system:

Cardiovascular: angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, pallor, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, ventricular ectopy and stress cardiomyopathy.

Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)].

Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have occurred, particularly in patients with underlying organic heart disease or patients receiving drugs that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)].

Rapid rises in blood pressure associated with epinephrine use have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)].

### Fever of unknown origin in the returning traveler [^07f0cbed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The returning traveler with fever presents a diagnostic challenge for the health care provider. When evaluating such a patient, the highest priority should be given to diseases that are potentially fatal or may represent public health threats. A good history is paramount and needs to include destination, time and duration of travel, type of activity, onset of fever in relation to travel, associated comorbidities, and any associated symptoms. Pretravel immunizations and chemoprophylaxis may alter the natural course of disease and should be inquired about specifically. The fever pattern, presence of a rash or eschar, organomegaly, or neurologic findings are helpful physical findings. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but when corroborated with clinical and epidemiologic data may offer a clue to diagnosis.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? a systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^0b8719b6]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Pheochromocytoma is a rare disease but with high mortality if it is not being diagnosed early. Several biochemical tests with high accuracy have been obtained, but the clinical threshold for request of these tests is not determined clearly.

Objectives

To determine the Likelihood Ratios of clinical symptoms and signs in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. And also meta-analysis of their sensitivity in this disease.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1960 to February 2014. Bibliographies were searched to find additional articles.

Study Selection

We included original studies describing the sensitivity and/or likelihood ratios of signs and symptoms in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma. Their method of diagnosis should have been based on pathology. We excluded specific subtypes or syndromes related to pheochromocytoma, or specific ages or gender. Also we excluded studies before 1993 (JNC5) which no definition of hypertension was presented. 37 articles were chosen finally.

Data Extraction

Two authors reviewed data from articles independently and gave discrepancies to third author for decision. The aim was extraction of raw numbers of patients having defined signs or symptoms, and draw 2×2 tables if data available. We meta-analyzed sensitivities by Statsdirect and Likelihood Ratios by Meta-disc soft wares. Because our data was heterogeneous based on I² > 50% (except negative Likelihood ratio of hypertension), we used random effect model for doing meta-analysis. We checked publication bias by drawing Funnel plot for each sign/symptom, and also Egger test.

Data Synthesis

The most prevalent signs and symptoms reported were hypertension (pooled sensitivity of 80.7%), headache (pooled sensitivity of 60.4%), palpitation (pooled sensitivity of 59.3%) and diaphoresis (pooled sensitivity of 52.4%). The definition of orthostatic hypotension was different among studies. The sensitivity was 23–50%. Paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing, and weakness were the signs/symptoms which had publication bias based on Funnel plot and Egger test (P value < 0.05). Seven of the articles had control group, and could be used for calculating LR of signs/symptoms. Diaphoresis (LR+ 2.2, LR-0.45), Palpitation (LR+ 1.9, LR-0.52) and headache (LR+ 1.6, LR-0.24) were significant symptoms in clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Other signs and symptoms had been reported in only one study and could not have been meta-analyzed. Classic triad of headache, palpitation and diaphoresis in hypertensive patients had the LR+ 6.312 (95% CI 0.217–183.217) and LR-0.139 (95% CI 0.059–0.331). Surprisingly, hypertension was not important in clinical suspicion of pheochromocytoma, and even normotension increased the probability of the disease.

Conclusions

By available data, there is no single clinical finding that has significant value in diagnosis or excluding pheochromocytoma. Combination of certain symptoms, signs and para-clinical exams is more valuable for physicians. Further studies should be done, to specify the value of clinical findings. Until that time the process of diagnosis will be based on clinical suspicion and lab tests followed by related imaging.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Re-evaluating the prevalence and factors characteristic of catecholamine secreting head and neck paragangliomas [^a4c84482]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Operational definitions for other recorded clinical variables are as follows: hyper‐adrenergic symptoms at first presentation were defined as explicit documentation of sustained or intermittent palpitations, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and/or tremors or new‐onset hypertension in conjunction with at least one of these other symptoms. Hypertension at first presentation was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Tachycardia at first presentation was defined as resting heart rate > 100 beats per minute.

Statistical comparisons between groups were made with chi‐square test and Student's t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. All statistical tests were two‐tailed and performed with SPSS Version 27 with a p ≤ .05 as the threshold for statistical significance. This study was deemed exempt from informed consent by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB).

### Syncope and palpitations: a review [^d7daecc5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Syncope and palpitations are common complaints for patients presenting to their primary care provider. They represent symptoms that most often have a benign etiology but rarely can be the first warning sign of a serious condition, such as arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or noncardiac disease. The history, physical examination, and noninvasive testing can, in most cases, distinguish benign from pathologic causes. This article introduces syncope and palpitations, with emphasis on the differential diagnoses, initial presentation, diagnostic strategy, and various management strategies.

Clinical scenario

Case 1

A 35 year old woman was referred by her family physician because of recurrent spells of headache, dizziness, and sweating since 6 months ago. She had also experienced dyspnea and palpitation followed by chest discomfort. Each time, she was admitted to the hospital with high blood pressure and heart rate. But the physical exam between attacks was normal.

Case 2

A 50 year-old man came to his family physician with moderate bitemporal headache. On physical exam, his blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg and pulse rate was 70. He had no chest pain, dyspnea or blurred vision. He had experienced such headaches in the last 6 months about once a month.

### Fever of unknown origin caused by tuberculosis [^264fd7d6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is an important cause of fever of unknown origin. Travel, age, dialysis, diabetes, birth in a country with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, and immunoincompetence are among the most salient risks. Associated physical findings, radiologic evaluation, and hematologic and endocrinologic abnormalities may provide clues to the diagnosis. Both noninvasive and invasive diagnostic modalities are reviewed. Because diagnosis may be elusive, therapeutic and diagnostic trials of antituberculous therapy should be considered in all patients with fever of unknown origin who defy diagnosis.

A 67-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history was admitted to our hospital with complaints of generalised weakness, nausea, diarrhoea and weight loss. The patient suffered from tachycardia and hypotension. Blood tests revealed Graves' thyrotoxicosis and the patient was treated accordingly. However, patient's health continued to decline rapidly and further tests revealed a concomitant Addisonian crisis. Additional treatment with corticosteroids led to a full recovery. It is well known that autoimmune endocrine disorders tend to cluster. However, the presentation is usually sequential in time. This case reports the highly rare simultaneous presentation of Addison's disease and Graves' thyrotoxicosis. It also provides several suggestions to help establish the diagnoses.

### Personalized management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma [^155189cb]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentations

In cluster 2–related PPGLs, there is suggestive evidence that signs and symptoms are mainly of an episodic nature associated with paroxysmal excessive secretory activity. This presentation appears related to high tumoral catecholamine contents, low rates of constant catecholamine secretion (per mass of tumor tissue), and a well-developed regulatory control of secretion that nevertheless can respond to provocative stimuli; this contrasts with cluster 1 tumors, which show low catecholamine contents but higher rates of continuous secretion and less developed secretory control (sustained hypertension).

All potential PPGL-related specific and nonspecific signs and symptoms and possible stimuli of the so-called "spells" — especially in cluster 2–related PPGLs — are described in detail under "Personalized Management: Molecular Cluster 1" subsection "Clinical Presentations". Patients with cluster 2–related PCCs commonly show a more pronounced "signs and symptoms score" — described in detail under "Personalized Management: Molecular Cluster 1" subsection "Clinical Presentations" — and more likely suffer from pallor, tremor, and anxiety/panic, compared with those with cluster 1–related disease. This may be partly explained by the — although episodic — excessive catecholamine secretion during a so-called spell.

For RET -related PCCs the predominant stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors by epinephrine is presumably responsible for the presentation of episodic tachycardia/palpitations and paroxysmal hypertension rather than sustained hypertension. However, only around 50% of patients with RET -related PCCs present with signs and symptoms, which may reflect negligible or low rates of catecholamine secretion as well as discovery as part of screening programs. Similarly, patients with NF1-related PCCs can often be asymptomatic and normotensive.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^31821784]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes of interest

The primary outcomes were remission, defined as no panic attack for at least one week at the end of study, and dropout, defined as patients who discontinued treatment or withdrew before the end of the study owing to adverse events, protocol violation, or a lack of treatment efficacy. The secondary outcomes were anxiety and depression symptom scores and any adverse events (eg, sedation, fatigue or weakness, malaise, ataxia, slurred speech, cognitive impairment, sleep problems, sexual dysfunctions, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, diarrhoea, constipation, nausea or vomiting, gastrointestinal problems, chest pain, nervousness, headache, lack of coordination, blurred vision, difficulty with urination, menstrual irregularity, change in appetite, change in body weight, upper respiratory tract infection, irritability, agitation, paraesthesia, diaphoresis, tremor, anxiety, depressive symptoms, asthenia, and orthostatic hypotension). Anxiety and depression symptom scores were originally measured by the tools specified in the studies included, such as the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety, clinical anxiety scale, Hamilton rating scale for depression, and Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale. These validated tools have been accepted and commonly used for measuring anxiety and depression symptoms. Given the limited number of studies that reported health related quality of life, this was not considered as an outcome (see review protocol registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020180638).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently extracted data on study characteristics (eg, setting, design, study period), participant characteristics (eg, mean age, percentage of women, duration of panic disorder), duration of treatment, and outcome measurements. Data used for pooling were extracted as means and standard deviations or continuous outcomes, and number of participants across treatments for dichotomous outcomes. When data were insufficient, we contacted the corresponding authors of the studies.

### 15 YEARS OF PARAGANGLIOMA: clinical manifestations of paraganglioma syndromes types 1–5 [^2b5ff6c2]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Cardinal manifestations of PGL1–5

PGL1–5 are characterised by the development of PGLs and/or PCs, together with a variable risk of developing renal cancers, gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) or (rarely) pituitary tumours. The patient with a PGL syndrome will therefore present in one of four ways: i) with symptoms and/or signs of catecholamine excess; ii) with symptoms and/or signs of local tumour mass; iii) as an incidental finding on an imaging study for unrelated purpose and iv) after genetic testing in context of familial disease.

Clinical features of catecholamine excess include hypertension, headache, sweating, palpitations, and often morbid apprehension or anxiety. These symptoms often come in paroxysms that can last for minutes or hours, with variable frequency. Clinical examination may reveal hypertension (although absent in 10–20% cases, and paroxysmal in 30%), pallor, hyperhidrosis and tremor.

Rarely, patients may present with catecholaminergic 'crisis' accompanied by acute cardiomyopathy and severe hypertension (but sometimes with shock), and/or multiorgan failure, lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, fever and hyperglycaemia. In such cases, precipitating factors may be present including recent use of dopamine D2 agonists (e.g. metoclopramide), corticosteroids, β-blockers or anaesthesia.

PGL of the urinary bladder is associated with catcholaminergic symptoms that are provoked by micturition, and may also be associated with painless haematuria.

Clinical features of local tumour mass are relevant for HNPGLs and also for metastatic PPGLs. Carotid body tumours and vagal PGLs may present with neck fullness, cough, hoarse voice, or dysphagia and are clinically palpable in the lateral upper neck (Fig. 1). Glomus tympanicum tumours may present with unilateral hearing loss and/or pulsatile tinnitus. Jugular PGLs may present with palsies of lower cranial nerves VII, IX, X, XI and/or XII. Local symptoms from tumour mass also occur with renal cell cancers that can present with flank pain and/or haematuria, and GISTs that may present with abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. Pituitary tumours are rarely associated with hereditary PGLs and present with features either of local tumour mass (headache, visual field deficit) and/or hormonal excess (acromegaly, hyperprolactinaemia;).

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^d7d64cc4]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.3°C on at least two occasions and a duration of illness of ≥ 3 weeks or having multiple febrile episodes over this time period. There must be no obvious diagnosis despite complete history taking and examination, as well as appropriate investigation that should include routine blood tests, inflammatory markers, autoimmune screen, cultures, chest radiography and abdominal imaging. Investigation includes identifying any potential diagnostic clues (PDCs) that can help reveal the underlying cause of the fever; however, up to 50% of cases of FUO remain undiagnosed.

The case described here is of a rare condition presenting with FUO that proved to be a diagnostic challenge. Despite its rarity, accurate documentation of cases of Cogan's syndrome remains crucial to improving our awareness and understanding of this condition. This could in turn bring about the development of more effective treatment as well as reduce patient morbidity by leading to earlier diagnosis. Our case also stresses how laboratory and radiological investigations should not serve as an alternative to thorough clinical assessments since early recognition of PDCs and symptom complexes is more likely to help clinch a diagnosis than investigations which can at times return non-specific results.

### Hyperthyroidism as a cause of autonomic dysreflexia [^fa621f75]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

A 25-yr-old female tetraplegic patient experienced autonomic dysreflexia episodes involving hypertension, headache, facial flushing, and tachycardia. The symptoms were not related to the bladder or bowel. The episodes did not seem to be linked to any mechanical cause. The patient was incidentally diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Treatment with antithyroid medication resulted in resolution of the autonomic dysreflexia. This case suggests that hyperthyroidism may trigger autonomic dysreflexia in tetraplegic patients.

### Fever of unknown origin: is there a role for empiric therapy? [^af55761e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy has little or no role to play in cases of classic fever of unknown origin with three important exceptions: cases that meet criteria for culture-negative endocarditis; cases in which findings or the clinical setting suggests cryptic disseminated tuberculosis (or, occasionally, other granulomatous infections); and cases in which temporal arteritis with vision loss is suspected. Several studies indicate that patients with prolonged, undiagnosed fever of unknown origin generally have a favorable prognosis. A small and largely anecdotal literature suggests a small role for symptomatic use of corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in highly selected cases.

### The dermatological manifestations of postural tachycardia syndrome: a review with illustrated cases [^9a73e6d8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a syndrome of excessive tachycardia with orthostatic challenge, and relief of such symptoms with recumbence. There are several proposed subtypes of the syndrome, each with unique pathophysiology. Numerous symptoms such as excessive tachycardia, lightheadedness, blurry vision, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, and tremulousness are associated with orthostatic intolerance. Other co-morbid conditions associated with POTS are not clearly attributable to orthostatic intolerance. These include chronic headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal or bladder disorders, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Dermatological manifestations of POTS are also common and wide ranging, from livedo reticularis to Raynaud's phenomenon, from cutaneous flushing to erythromelalgia. Here, we provide three illustrative cases of POTS with dermatological manifestations. We discuss the potential pathophysiology underlying such dermatological manifestations, and how such mechanisms could in turn help guide development of management.

### A case of pheochromocytoma associated with liver abscess and intestinal pseudo-obstruction [^2fa4b7a2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The notable findings of this case were its unique clinical presentation and the co-occurrence of pheochromocytoma and liver abscess. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pheochromocytoma associated with a liver abscess.

First, the clinical presentation of this case is unique. The classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma include headache, palpitations, sweating, and hypertension. Among these, sustained or paroxysmal hypertension is the most common sign of pheochromocytoma. For instance, Philipsreported that paroxysmal hypertension and sustained hypertension occur in 45% and 50% of patients with pheochromocytoma, respectively, and only 5% of patients remain normotensive. In our case, frequent blood pressure measurements showed no evidence of paroxysmal hypertension. In addition, tachycardia associated with fever was observed during the infection; however, neither tachycardia nor sweating was observed after the fever resolved. Instead, constipation, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and weight loss were observed as clinical manifestations of the pheochromocytoma.

Constipation and intestinal pseudo-obstruction are occasionally observed complications of pheochromocytoma caused by hypersecretion of catecholamines, which act on alpha-2-adrenergic receptors of intestinal smooth muscle cells to decrease intestinal movement. Thosani et al. reported that 6% of patients with paragangliomas or pheochromocytomas experienced constipation. In addition, they reported that constipation is a complication usually observed in patients with primary tumors larger than 5 cm, as in this case, or with extensive metastatic disease. Administration of an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phentolamine, and tumor reduction is known to be effective approaches for improving bowel movement in pheochromocytoma patients. Although phentolamine was partially effective in our case, the patient's constipation and intestinal pseudo-obstruction were completely resolved only after tumor resection.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^55bc3a9d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

Background

Clinical scenario

Case 1: A 35 year old woman was referred by her family physician because of recurrent spells of headache, dizziness, and sweating since 6 months ago. She had also experienced dyspnea and palpitation followed by chest discomfort. Each time, she was admitted to the hospital with high blood pressure and heart rate. But the physical exam between attacks was normal.
Case 2: A 50 year-old man came to his family physician with moderate bitemporal headache. On physical exam, his blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg and pulse rate was 70. He had no chest pain, dyspnea or blurred vision. He had experienced such headaches in the last 6 months about once a month.

### Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis and treatment [^199baa97]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterized by overproduction of thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland and affects 1.3% of adults in the United States. Thyrotoxicosis is a state of thyroid hormone excess and may be caused by hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis, or exogenous administration. The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism are weakness, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance, and the most common signs are a palpable goiter, tachycardia, muscle weakness, and tremor. A low thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin) level has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing thyrotoxicosis. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is the autoimmune condition Graves disease, typically diagnosed by the presence of thyroid eye disease, which is pathognomonic, or thyrotropin receptor antibodies. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma, and thyroiditis, which can be differentiated by the pattern of uptake on a radioactive iodine scan. Thionamides (most commonly methimazole) typically induce remission of Graves disease and can control hyperthyroidism caused by multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma. Radioactive iodine resolves hyperthyroidism in more than 90% of patients with Graves disease and toxic multinodular goiter, with hypothyroidism developing in most patients 1 year after treatment. Thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with compressive symptoms from an obstructive goiter.

Case presentation

A 32 year old Hispanic male with no known past medical history presented to his primary care physician with 20 lbs weight loss, without other symptoms. Vital signs revealed blood pressure of 133/76 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 respirations per minute and oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical exam revealed a thin man in no distress, head and neck exam revealed no orbitopathy with a thyroid gland that was not enlarged, cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm, lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, no abdominal tenderness, neurologic exam showed no tremors or hyperreflexia.

Laboratory results revealed normal complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel and TSH of < 0.01 mcU/mL that prompted referral to Endocrinology. He denied palpitations, hyperdefecation, tremors, skin changes or anxiety. Further workup revealed a free T4 (fT4) of 3.73 ng/dL and total T3 (TT3) of 291 ng/dL. Methimazole (MMI) 20 mg BID and propranolol 20 mg BID were started. Ultrasound (US) revealed a hypervascular gland with an asymmetric ill-defined hypoechoic enlarged right to mid lower pole nodule measuring 1.2 × 1.6 × 1.5 cm indicative of subacute thyroiditis (Fig. 1 A).

Discussion

The main purpose of this article was defining sensitivity and — if possible-LR of signs and symptoms in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We used the search strategy of "Rational Clinical Examination" for collecting articles in Medline from 1960 to 2014; and used reference tracking of review articles to find more relevant original articles. In addition to electronic search, we did hand-searching using endocrinology textbooks. The result of this search strategy was 37 articles. From 6 of these articles, we could fill the 2 × 2 table of LRs.

For evaluating the possibility of doing meta-analysis for our data, first we calculated heterogeneity of different symptoms, which all were heterogeneous according to definition of heterogeneity based on I² (except negative LR of hypertension with I² of 43.2%). Because of heterogeneity of data, we used random effect model for meta-analysis. For evaluating publication bias we used Egger test, which the P -value < 0.05 was considered significant and so the data was considered to have publication bias. This was true for 4 of the symptoms: paroxysmal hypertension, chest pain, flushing and weakness.

### Does this patient have pheochromocytoma? A systematic review of clinical signs and symptoms [^450616e6]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Although about 4% of adrenal masses incidentally found are known to be pheochromocytoma, this tumor is popular for its catecholamine secretion, and symptoms the catecholamines produce. The most catecholamines secreted are epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. Figure 1 illustrates the catecholamine metabolism in normal human cells. Normal adrenal glands contain mostly epinephrine. Most pheochromocytomas secrete predominantly norepinephrine; and about 15% secrete predominantly epinephrine. Dopamine β-hydroxylase, responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine, may be missing in immature tumors; Thus, the presence of a tumor secreting predominantly dopamine indicates a higher probability of malignancy. Pheochromocytoma has been called the "Great Mimic" since its manifestations can resemble so many other conditions, which may confuse clinicians. The clinical presentation varies, ranging from an adrenal incidentaloma to hypertensive crises with associated cerebrovascular or cardiac complications. The vast majority of symptoms and signs are attributable to the excess of catecholamines released by tumors continuously or paroxysmally. The most leading catecholamine-related sign for clinicians to suspect pheochromocytoma is hypertension. Related to hypertension, four patterns of blood pressure are seen. Sustained hypertension, paroxysmal hypertension, sustained hypertension with paroxysms, and normotension. This variation is somehow related to the catecholamine predominantly secreted by the tumor. The catecholamines exhibit different effects on different catecholamine receptors; typically, norepinephrine-mediated stimulation of α-receptors leads to vasoconstriction whereas epinephrine stimulates β₂-receptors, causing vasodilatation. Subjects with predominantly norepinephrine-secreting pheochromocytoma (noradrenergic phenotype) develop sustained hypertension more frequently than subjects with predominantly epinephrine-producing pheochromocytomas (adrenergic phenotype) who present more often with paroxysmal symptoms. Dopamine-producing tumors often present with normotension. Paroxysmal release of catecholamines constitutes the characteristic classic triad of episodic headache, sweating, and palpitations which is known as "an attack". In some patients, a particular stimulus triggers an attack. Anesthesia and tumor manipulation are the most well-known triggers for catecholaminergic crisis; positional change, exercise, and various medications (e.g. TCAs, opiates, metoclopramide and radiographic contrast agents) are other possible precipitating factors. In others, no clearly defined precipitating event can be found, and the episodes occur in a random pattern.

### Palpitations: evaluation, management, and wearable smart devices [^f48036e0]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Palpitations are a common symptom described by patients as a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart, a pounding chest, irregular or skipped heartbeats, or a pounding sensation in the neck. They are associated with a low mortality rate; however, recurrent palpitations have been shown to impair quality of life and increase health care use. Common triggers are cardiac disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, medication or illicit drug use, or psychosomatic disorders. A detailed history, physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of palpitations. Additional testing may be indicated to include echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, electrocardiogram monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies to distinguish whether symptoms correlate with cardiac arrhythmia or structural or ischemic heart disease. Management of palpitations is based on the suspected etiology. In most cases of cardiac-induced palpitations, the treatment can include reassurance, education, trigger avoidance, or use of atrioventricular nodal blockers. Tachyarrhythmias may require cardiac ablation. Patients who have palpitations with no arrhythmia causality and no cardiac disease should be reassured; however, screening for psychosomatic disorders should be considered. Wearable smart devices with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring technologies are currently available to consumers; these tools have shown diagnostic accuracy for detection of arrhythmias, allowing patients to have greater participation in their health care.

Investigation of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should begin with a complete history and physical exam with orthostatic vital signs and 12-lead ECG, while complete blood count and thyroid function studies can be useful for selected patients; a 24-hour Holter monitor may be considered for selected patients although its clinical efficacy is uncertain, and detailed autonomic testing, transthoracic echocardiogram, tilt-table testing, and exercise stress testing may be considered for selected patients being assessed for POTS.
