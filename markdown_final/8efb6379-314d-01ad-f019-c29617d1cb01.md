Answer Choices:
A. 30,561
B. 35,610
C. 300,561
D. 305,610

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the total floor space in standard form given 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "standard form" means in this context. Then, I should verify the arithmetic addition. Next, I will compare the result to the provided answer choices. Finally, I will double-check for any potential misreads or traps in the options and confirm the correct selection.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the request. In basic arithmetic problems like this, "standard form" simply means writing the number in its usual decimal representation without any special notation, so I should just compute the sum and present it plainly, which aligns with how numerical results are typically reported in the documents provided, for example population counts and dosing quantities are written as plain integers or decimals rather than scientific notation or other formats [^d0e143d1] [^7d96cf20].

> Now, I will add the components step-by-step. 300,000 plus 5,000 equals 305,000. Then 305,000 plus 600 equals 305,600. Finally, 305,600 plus 10 equals 305,610 square feet. Wait, let me verify that last step: 305,600 + 10 is indeed 305,610, not 305,601, so the total is 305,610 square feet [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the answer choices and match the result. Option A is 30,561, which is far too small and off by a factor of ten. Option B is 35,610, which is also too small and misplaces the magnitude. Option C is 300,561, which forgets to add the 5,000. Option D is 305,610, which matches my calculation exactly. Hold on, I should verify that none of the options are trying to trick me with commas or spacing; they all use standard comma separators, so the comparison is straightforward and D is correct [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I didn't overlook anything in the problem statement. The expression is clearly 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10, and there are no units or formatting caveats that would change the sum. Therefore, the standard form of the total floor space is 305,610 square feet, which corresponds to choice D [^notfound].

---

The total floor space is **305,610 square feet** [^notfound], which corresponds to option D. This is calculated by adding 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 = 305,610 square feet.

---

## Calculation

| **Component** | **Square footage** |
|-|-|
| Base area | 300,000 sq ft |
| Additional area 1 | 5,000 sq ft |
| Additional area 2 | 600 sq ft |
| Additional area 3 | 10 sq ft |
| Total | 305,610 sq ft |

---

## Verification

- 300,000 + 5,000 = 305,000
- 305,000 + 600 = 305,600
- 305,600 + 10 = 305,610

---

## Conclusion

The total floor space is **305,610 square feet**, which matches option D.

Pool content turnover rate—definition, 6-hour standard, and calculation are detailed. The turnover rate is the number of times a pool’s contents can be filtered though its filtration equipment in a 24-hour period, and a 6-hour turnover rate will result in 98% clarification if the pool is properly designed. A typical-use pool should have a pump and filtration system capable of pumping the entire contents of the pool though the filters every 6 hours; to determine compliance, use Turnover rate = pool volume (gallons)/flow rate×60 (minutes in hour). A sample calculation shows Turnover rate = 90,000 (gallons in pool)/ 180 gallons per minute×60 (minutes in hour), yielding an 8.3-hour turnover rate = 90,000 (pool volume in gallons)/10,800, which would not meet the required turnover rate of 6 hours.

### A randomized controlled trial comparing standard-and low-dose strategies for transfusion of platelets (SToP) to patients with thrombocytopenia [^716c5153]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

A noninferiority study was performed comparing low-dose and standard-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions. A double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed in 6 sites in 3 countries. Thrombocytopenic adults requiring prophylactic platelet transfusion were randomly allocated to standard-dose (300-600 x 10(9) platelets/product) or low-dose (150- < 300 x 10(9) platelets/product) platelets. The primary outcome (World Health Organization [WHO] bleeding > or = grade 2) was assessed daily through clinical examination, patient interview, and chart review. A WHO grade was assigned through adjudication. The Data Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study because the difference in the grade 4 bleeding reached the prespecified threshold of 5%. At this time, 129 patients had been randomized and 119 patients were included in the analysis (58 low dose; 61 standard dose). Three patients in the low-dose arm (5.2%) had grade 4 bleeds compared with none in the standard-dose arm. WHO bleeding grade 2 or higher was 49.2% (30/61) in the standard-dose arm and 51.7% (30/58) in the low-dose group (relative risk [RR], 1.052; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.737-1.502). A higher rate of grade 4 bleeding in patients receiving low-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions resulted in this RCT being stopped. Whether this finding was due to chance or represents a real difference requires further investigation. These clinical studies are registered on (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT00420914.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^9ac3f0db]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Exploring less common approaches to reducing sample size

We now consider some less standard approaches to bringing the sample size requirements closer to the numbers it is feasible to recruit in a reasonable time frame.

Step 3: Relaxing α by a small amount, beyond traditional values

The much-criticised 5 % significance level is used widely in much applied scientific research, but is an arbitrary figure. It is extremely rare for clinical trials to use any other level. It may be argued that this convention has been adopted as a compromise between erroneously concluding a new treatment is more efficacious and undertaking a trial of an achievable size and length. Settings where traditionally sized trials are not possible may be just the area where researchers start to break this convention, for good reason.

In considering the type I error, it is critical to consider the question: ‘What are the consequences of erroneously deciding to use a new treatment routinely if it is truly not better?’

Taking the societal perspective as before, we might consider the probability of making a type I error, thus erroneously burdening patients with treatments that do not improve outcomes, or even worsen them, while potentially imposing unnecessary toxicity.

First, for conditions where there are only enough patients available to run one modestly sized randomised trial in a reasonable time frame, research progress will be relatively slow, and making a type I error may be less of a concern than a type II error. In contrast, making several type I errors in a common disease could lead in practice to patients taking several ineffective treatments; for a disease area where only one trial can run at any given time, the overall burden on patients is potentially taking one ineffective treatment that does not work.

Thus, if we take the societal perspective with the trials in Table 1 then, if each trial was analysed with α =0.05 and we see (hypothetically) 40 % positive results, then the expected number of false positive trials is given in the final column. We also assumed 10 % and 70 % positive results, with qualitatively similar conclusions.

### Global dietary database 2017: data availability and gaps on 54 major foods, beverages and nutrients among 5.6 million children and adults from 1220 surveys worldwide [^5084cd12]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Data standardisation

Standardisation included data quality assessment, standardised categorisation of foods, beverages and nutrients and their units, aggregation by subgroup strata, energy-adjustment and compilation into a relational database. Each dietary variable was characterised according to a standard definition and units (table 1). Surveys with varying definitions were classified using defined secondary definitions. When multiple days of dietary intakes were collected (eg, diet recalls or records), these were averaged for each individual. Semi-quantitative instruments (eg, FFQs based on a single specified portion size) and short standardised questionnaires (eg, DHS surveys) were converted to standard serving sizes for each frequency category. Household-level data were converted to individual-level intakes within each household using Adult Male Equivalents,which accounts for the household composition and differing energy intakes by age and sex of household members. Based on national estimated average requirementsand observed population intakes,all intakes were adjusted to 700 kcal/day for ages 0 to <1 years, 1000 kcal/day for ages 1 to <2 years, 1300 kcal/day for ages 2–5 years, 1700 kcal/day for ages 6–10 years, 2000 kcal/day for ages 11–74 years and 1700 kcal/day for ages 75+ years (online supplemental text S3). Individual-level microdata were aggregated into subgroups jointly stratified by age (0–5, 6–11 and 12–23 months; and 2–4, 5–10, 11–14, 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, 90–94 and 95+years), sex, education (≤6 years of education, 6.01–12 years or ≥12.01 years; and for children, head of household’s educational attainment), urban/rural residence, and pregnancy/lactation status, as available. Urban versus rural residence were defined according to each survey’s established definition, due to absence of any single global definition of these factors as well as logistical challenges in aiming to revise each survey’s existing definitions. Education was selected as the most widely available and standardised metric of socioeconomic status, as compared with income or wealth indices which are not always reported similarly or accurately across countries.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^8d3e0593]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen extract selection—standardized extracts and potency units: Summary Statement 76: When possible, standardized extracts should be used to prepare the allergen immunotherapy extract treatment sets. A. Potency is determined with the intradermal dilution for 50 mm sum of erythema (ID50EAL) system for determining BAU values, in which the method entails preparing a series of 3-fold dilutions and injecting 0.05 mL intradermally in 15 to 20 “highly sensitive” allergic subjects, and the end point is when the erythema sum equals 50 mm. Standardized extracts are available with biologic potencies of 10,000 and 100,000 BAU for grasses; 5,000 and 10,000 BAU for cat allergen; 5,000, 10,000, and 30,000 AU for dust mite; and 100,000 AU or 1:10 and 1:20 w/v for short ragweed. Short ragweed extract is sold with Amb a 1 reported in FDA units such that 1 FDA unit of Amb a 1 equals 1 μg of Amb a 1, and 350 units of Amb a 1/mL is approximately equivalent to 100,000 AU/mL. Cat extracts are available as 5,000 and 10,000 BAU/mL, which contain 10 to 19.9 FDA units of Fel d 1/mL; 1 FDA unit of Fel d 1 equals 2 to 4 μg of Fel d 1, and approximately 22% of subjects with cat allergy have specific IgE antibodies to cat albumin. For dust mite, subsequent ID50EAL testing indicates that the AU is bioequivalent to the BAU, and thus dust mite extracts are still labeled in AU.

### Practice parameter: diagnostic assessment of the child with status epilepticus (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^6563cb0d]. Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus epidemiology in children—The incidence of SE in children ranges from 10 to 58 per 100,000 per year for children ages 1 to 19 years (mean 38.8 and median 43.8/100,000/year; 95% CI 18.2 to 59.5/100,000/year) or would be 31,600 (range 7,300 to 41,600) children under age 18 years in the United States per year. In one study of 394 children aged 1 month to 16 years, more than 80% of children less than 2 years of age had acute symptomatic SE, febrile SE, or a progressive encephalopathy whereas cryptogenic and remote symptomatic SE was more common in children older than 4 years. SE has been reported to recur in 17% of children.

2.4 Patients on Cancer Chemotherapy

Initiate PROCRIT in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy.

Use the lowest dose of PROCRIT necessary to avoid RBC transfusions.

Recommended Starting Dose

Adults:

150 Units/kg subcutaneously 3 times per week until completion of a chemotherapy course or
40,000 Units subcutaneously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course.

Pediatric Patients (5 to 18 years):

600 Units/kg intravenously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy course.

Dose Reduction

Reduce dose by 25% if:

Hemoglobin increases greater than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period or
Hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion.

Withhold dose if hemoglobin exceeds a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion. Reinitiate at a dose 25% below the previous dose when hemoglobin approaches a level where RBC transfusions may be required.

Dose Increase

After the initial 4 weeks of PROCRIT therapy, if hemoglobin increases by less than 1 g/dL and remains below 10 g/dL, increase dose to:

300 Units/kg three times per week in adults or
60,000 Units weekly in adults
900 Units/kg (maximum 60,000 Units) weekly in pediatric patients

After 8 weeks of therapy, if there is no response as measured by hemoglobin levels or if RBC transfusions are still required, discontinue PROCRIT.

2.5 Surgery Patients

The recommended PROCRIT regimens are:

300 Units/kg per day subcutaneously for 15 days total: administered daily for 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and for 4 days after surgery.
600 Units/kg subcutaneously in 4 doses administered 21, 14, and 7 days before surgery and on the day of surgery.

Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is recommended during PROCRIT therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

### Lifestyle interventions for treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in adults: implications for clinicians [^7319ebbf]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine exercise prescription form—2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults specify “150-300 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity or 75-150 minutes/week of vigorous activity (somewhat hard to very hard) or a combination of both,” with “Muscle strength training 2 or more times a week.” The person-centered tool “can be used by clinicians and healthcare professionals” using the frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT) framework. It defines intensity as follows: “Moderate activity is at a pace where you can talk but cannot “sing.”” and “Vigorous activity is done at a pace where you can’t say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.” Time can be accumulated flexibly: “30 minutes 5 days/week or • 20 minutes daily • 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. Just work your way up to 150 total minutes/week,” with a long-term step goal to “gradually build up to 7,000-9,000 steps/day.” Strength training guidance states, “To start, try 10-15 repetitions using light effort. Build up to medium or hard effort for 8-12 repetitions. Repeat 2-4 times, 2-3 days/week,” and to “Give yourself a rest day between each strength training session.”

### SNMMI procedure standard for bone scintigraphy 4.0 [^8796f76d]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2018). Medium credibility.

SNMMI bone scintigraphy—protocol/image acquisition and processing specifies that the energy window should be centered at 140 keV with a window width between 15% and 20%. If flow images are acquired, the camera should be positioned over the region of interest before radiopharmaceutical injection, and the acquisition computer should be programmed to acquire approximately 30–60 images at 1–3 s/frame; when digital images are acquired, blood flow images may be obtained in a 64 × 64 or greater matrix. Blood pool images should be acquired for approximately 3–5 min/image immediately after the flow phase and within 10 min after injection of the tracer, and after 10 min, activity may appear in the skeleton; blood pool images are usually obtained in a 128 × 128 or greater matrix and with a count density of approximately 300,000 counts per image (150,000–200,000 counts per image may be adequate for the extremities). Routine delayed images are usually obtained from 2 to 4 h after injection of the tracer to allow it to clear from the soft tissues.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Active drug-sensitive tuberculosis (TB) treatment with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs—key dosing guidance is as follows. Isoniazid with all ARVs is dosed at 5 mg/kg (usual dose 300 mg). For rifampin, use is Not recommended with HIV PIs, DOR, ETR, RPV, BIC, or EVG/c; with TAF it states Use with caution at dose indicated below; with other ARV drugs the dose is 10 mg/kg (usual dose 600 mg), and Note: DTG, RAL, and MVC doses need to be adjusted when used with rifampin. For rifabutin, with PI with COBI, TAF, BIC, or EVG/c-containing regimens it is Not recommended; with DTG, RAL, EFV, DOR, RPV the dose is 5 mg/kg (usual dose 300 mg); with HIV PIs with RTV the dose is 150 mg; and with EFV the dose is 450–600 mg; additionally, Note: DOR and RPV doses need to be adjusted when used with rifabutin. Pyrazinamide with all ARVs uses weight-based dosing: Weighing 40–55 kg: 1,000 mg (18.2–25.0 mg/kg); Weighing 56–75 kg: 1,500 mg (20.0–26.8 mg/kg); Weighing 76–90 kg: 2,000 mg (22.2–26.3 mg/kg); Weighing >90 kg: 2,000 mg. Ethambutol with all ARVs uses weight-based dosing: Weighing 40–55 kg: 800 mg (14.5–20.0 mg/kg); Weighing 56–75 kg: 1,200 mg (16.0–21.4 mg/kg); Weighing 76–90 kg: 1,600 mg (17.8–21.1 mg/kg); Weighing >90 kg: 1,600 mg. Additional cautions include: “Acquired rifamycin resistance has been reported in patients with inadequate rifabutin levels when on 150 mg twice weekly dosing together with RTV-boosted PIs. May consider TDM when rifabutin is used with an RTV-boosted PI and adjust dose accordingly,” and “Monitor for therapeutic response and consider TDM to assure dosage adequacy in patients weighing >90 kg.”

To quantify global variation in the incidence of lower extremity amputations in light of the rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus.

Methods

An electronic search was performed using the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from 1989 until 2010 for incidence of lower extremity amputation. The literature review conformed to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards.

Results

Incidence of all forms of lower extremity amputation ranges from 46.1 to 9600 per 10(5) in the population with diabetes compared with 5.8-31 per 10(5) in the total population. Major amputation ranges from 5.6 to 600 per 10(5) in the population with diabetes and from 3.6 to 68.4 per 10(5) in the total population. Significant reductions in incidence of lower extremity amputation have been shown in specific at-risk populations after the introduction of specialist diabetic foot clinics.

Conclusion

Significant global variation exists in the incidence of lower extremity amputation. Ethnicity and social deprivation play a significant role but it is the role of diabetes and its complications that is most profound. Lower extremity amputation reporting methods demonstrate significant variation with no single standard upon which to benchmark care. Effective standardized reporting methods of major, minor and at-risk populations are needed in order to quantify and monitor the growing multidisciplinary team effect on lower extremity amputation rates globally.

### Monitoring the European standard series in 10 centres 1996-2000 [^b03c44a4]. Contact Dermatitis (2005). Low credibility.

A 5-year retrospective study of the frequency of sensitization to the 25 allergens of the European standard series (ESS) was conducted in 10 centres in 8 European countries. Included were the results of 26 210 patients. The range in sensitivities differed moderately between the centres. Combining results of different centres and drawing conclusions on incidences can be done only with great care. The information on the ranking of the allergens and their sensitization incidence in the clinics are useful for decisions on the future composition of the standard series. The ESS is still a valid screening tool, and no substances should be deleted.

### Distinct cellular immune responses in children en route to type 1 diabetes with different first-appearing autoantibodies [^b855f54e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Data acquisition

For the acquisition, cells were diluted to 0.5 × 10 6 cells/mL with Cell Acquisition Solution (Standard BioTools, USA) containing 10% EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (Standard BioTools, USA). Samples were analyzed on a Helios mass cytometer, (Standard Biotools, USA). For all samples, 300–600,000 events were collected (CyTOF Software v. 6). We aimed at collecting 600,000 events (cells) when possible, at least 300,000 events (cells) were collected from each sample as recommended by the Maxpar direct immune profiling assay manufacturer. This recommendation allows estimating low-abundance cell populations, such as pDCs, comprising 0.1–0.5% of total PBMC sample. For most of the samples 0.36, 0.37, 0.40 millions of live intact cells were analyzed for ≥2 AAb, IAA, and GADA first groups, respectively. The minimal reliable cell number per population was 100 intact live cells.

To minimize technical variations and improve data consistency, we took several measures. First, all the samples were handled, stained and acquired in a similar fashion, at the same site and Helios mass cytometer and by the same personnel and operator. Next, we prepared a master mix of additional antibodies for all the study cohort samples, aliquoted and stored them at –80 °C to ensure consistent staining pattern, as described here. Further, all samples from each case-control pair were processed at the same time (including thawing, staining, and acquisition), i.e. in the same batch, and the model accounted for the batches by having the pair as a random effect. Additionally, we used the internal control, a PBMC sample, which was obtained from a single donor. The internal control sample was processed, stained and acquired along with the study samples of each case–control pair. t-SNE plots for the batch control samples can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2.

### Intravenous zanamivir or oral oseltamivir for hospitalised patients with influenza: an international, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trial [^580740bb]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. However, there is an unmet need for intravenous treatment for patients admitted to hospital with severe influenza. We studied whether intravenous zanamivir was a suitable treatment in this setting.

Methods

In this international, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 16 years or older with severe influenza admitted to 97 hospitals from 26 countries. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1 stratified by symptom onset ≤4 days or 5-6 days) to receive 300 mg or 600 mg intravenous zanamivir, or standard-of-care (75 mg oral oseltamivir) twice a day for 5-10 days; patients were followed up for 28 days. The randomisation schedule, including stratification, was generated using GlaxoSmithKline's RandAll software. Patients, site study staff, and sponsor were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical response-a composite of vital sign stabilisation and hospital discharge-in the influenza-positive population. The trial was powered to show an improvement of 1·5 days or greater with 600 mg intravenous zanamivir. Pharmacokinetic, safety, and virology endpoints were also assessed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231620.

Findings

Between Jan 15, 2011, and Feb 12, 2015, 626 patients were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg intravenous zanamivir (n=201), 600 mg intravenous zanamivir (n=209), or 75 mg oral oseltamivir (n=205) twice a day; 11 patients discontinued the study before receiving any study treatment. 488 (78%) of 626 patients had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Compared with a median time to clinical response of 5·14 days in the 600 mg intravenous zanamivir group, the median time to clinical response was 5·87 days (difference of -0·73 days, 95% CI -1·79 to 0·75; p=0·25) in the 300 mg intravenous zanamivir group and 5·63 days (difference of -0·48 days, 95% CI -2·11 to 0·97; p=0·39) in the oseltamivir group. Four patients with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 in the oseltamivir group developed H275Y resistance mutations. Adverse events were reported in 373 (61%) of treated patients and were similar across treatment groups; the most common adverse events (300 mg intravenous zanamivir, 600 mg intravenous zanamivir, oseltamivir) were diarrhoea (10 [5%], 15 [7%], 14 [7%]), respiratory failure (11 [5%], 14 [7%], 11 [5%]), and constipation (7 [3%], 13 [6%], 10 [5%]). 41 (7%) treated patients died during the study (15 [7%], 15 [7%], 11 [5%]); the most common causes of death were respiratory failure and septic shock.

Interpretation

Time to clinical response to intravenous zanamivir dosed at 600 mg was not superior to oseltamivir or 300 mg intravenous zanamivir. All treatments had a similar safety profile in hospitalised patients with severe influenza.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^3327f722]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 5–1—estimated calorie needs per day by age, gender, and physical activity level provides Calorie Requirements (kcals) by Activity Level at three different levels of physical activity and states that the estimates are rounded to the nearest 200 calories and that an individual’s calorie needs may be higher or lower than these average estimates. At age 2–3 years, daily estimates are 1,000-1,200 (sedentary), 1,000-1,400 (moderately active), and 1,000-1,400 (active). For females 9–13 years the values are 1,400-1,600, 1,600-2,000, and 1,800-2,200; for females 14–18 years they are 1,800, 2,000, and 2,400. For males 14–18 years the values are 2,000-2,400, 2,400-2,800, and 2,800-3,200; for males 19–30 years they are 2,400-2,600, 2,600-2,800, and 3,000. Sedentary means a lifestyle that includes only the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life, moderately active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, and active means a lifestyle that includes physical activity equivalent to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, in addition to the light physical activity associated with typical day-to-day life; estimates for females do not include women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Recommendations for tumor mutational burden assay validation and reporting: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, college of American pathologists, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer [^eb954e51]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2024). High credibility.

Tumor mutational burden (TMB)—definition, clinical associations, and need for standardization—is defined as the total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase (Mb) of coding DNA sequenced and has been associated with a higher rate of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment response and longer survival in multiple cancer types. Currently, there exists variation in how TMB is calculated, reported, and interpreted, and there is no established standard for interpreting TMB values, including what values should be considered high or actionable and whether cutoffs should depend on tumor type, therapy, or assay. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with TMB ≥10 mutations/Mb in 2020, standardization of TMB is expected to benefit clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories and should facilitate its implementation into routine clinical use; to date, PD-L1 protein expression, microsatellite instability/defective mismatch repair, and TMB have been approved as predictive biomarkers for ICIs in patients with cancer.

### A workflow to process 3D + time microscopy images of developing organisms and reconstruct their cell lineage [^6cd7dfd4]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Validation protocol

Obtaining a complete ‘gold standard' annotated reference, even for small animals such as the ascidian and sea urchin embryos, was possible only with considerable human effort. The Phallusia and Paracentrotus data sets, Pm1-2 and Pl1-2, were almost completely checked and curated. Cell tracking accuracy depended on the imaging depth, along which the signal-to-noise ratio degraded. Owing to the decrease in image quality with depth, there remained a few errors for which there was no solution, even through manual expertise. We curated around 25,000 temporal links in Pl1, 22,000 in Pl2, 30,000 in Pm1 and 40,000 in Pm2. All divisions were also fully annotated. The four digital embryos produced were validated by two independent experts.

In the case of the zebrafish, however, a complete gold standard was almost impossible due to a number of cell samples of the order of several million. Our gold standard for the Danio data set Dr1 was obtained by a large-scale curation strategy: (i) all detected nuclear centres were completely annotated inside 54 spatial boxes of average size 340 × 70 × 140 μm 3 in x, y, z, over ten time steps starting at various sample times t 0 ∈{1, 20, 100, 200, 300, 350}. By this method, 25,123 links were manually checked, comprising 3,262 links for t 0 =1 (from t =1 to t =10), 2,735 for t 0 =20 (from t =20 to t =29), 3,005 for t 0 =100, 8,736 for t 0 =200, 5,474 for t 0 =300 and 1,911 for t 0 =350. This strategy insured even sampling throughout the image data both in time and space (Fig. 4). (ii) As part of the investigation of the zebrafish fate map, several cell clones were manually validated and when required corrected along with the whole data set, corresponding to 50,503 additional curated temporal links and the corresponding curated nuclei. (iii) An entire layer of epithelial cells was completely curated at one specific time, t =4. (iv) In addition, a large number of links were randomly checked, bringing the total to 80,428. (v) Finally, more than 600 mitoses were checked.

Presentation of cause-specific mortality estimates

Cause-specific mortality estimates for GBD 2023 are given in death counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 population, calculated using the GBD standard population structure.For changes over time, we present percentage changes over the period 1990–2023, and annualised rates of change as the difference in the natural log of the values at the start and end of the time interval divided by the number of years in the interval. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all metrics are computed using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric (appendix 1 section 4.1.3). To reduce computing power and time, the number of computations per process was scaled back from 500 in GBD 2021 to 250 in GBD 2023, as simulation testing revealed that final estimates and their uncertainty were not affected by this reduction. See appendix 1 (section 4.1.3) for further details on this update.

Measuring probability of premature death

In accordance with the GBD framework, a death that occurs at any age before the standard (expected) life expectancy is classified as premature. To inform discussions and debates in the literature on premature deaths before age 70 years, in alignment with studies from WHO,,the US National Institutes of Health,and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,we computed the probability of death from birth to age 70 years (70q0).

Calculation of the probability of premature death by cause

The probability-of-death metric represents the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Methods for calculating all-cause probability of premature death have been described elsewhere.For example, for males aged 0–70 years in Canada in 1990, a probability of death of 0·1 from ischaemic heart disease indicates a 10% chance of dying from this cause before age 70 years. Cause-specific probability of death can be calculated as follows:whererepresents the probability of death for ages x to x + n in cause c,represents deaths in cause fraction space for age group x to x + n in cause c ; andrepresents the all cause probability of death for ages x to x + n.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^45132483]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

How should we approach trial design when we can get some, but not all, of the way to the numbers required for a randomised phase III trial?We present an ordered framework for designing randomised trials to address the problem when the ideal sample size is considered larger than the number of participants that can be recruited in a reasonable time frame. Staying with the frequentist approach that is well accepted and understood in large trials, we propose a framework that includes small alterations to the design parameters. These aim to increase the numbers achievable and also potentially reduce the sample size target. The first step should always be to attempt to extend collaborations, consider broadening eligibility criteria and increase the accrual time or follow-up time. The second set of ordered considerations are the choice of research arm, outcome measures, power and target effect. If the revised design is still not feasible, in the third step we propose moving from two- to one-sided significance tests, changing the type I error rate, using covariate information at the design stage, re-randomising patients and borrowing external information.We discuss the benefits of some of these possible changes and warn against others. We illustrate, with a worked example based on the Euramos-1 trial, the application of this framework in designing a trial that is feasible, while still providing a good evidence base to evaluate a research treatment.This framework would allow appropriate evaluation of treatments when large-scale phase III trials are not possible, but where the need for high-quality randomised data is as pressing as it is for common diseases.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^ce73b090]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal death

A neonatal death is a death during the first 28 completed days after live birth (days 0–27).

Groupings by chronological age

An early neonatal death is a death during the first 7 completed days after live birth (days 0–6).

A late neonatal death is a death 7–27 days after live birth.

2.3 Recommendations for recording of perinatal events

Reporting requirements for mortality statistics differ from individual‐level recording requirements to guide clinical care. To facilitate accurate reporting ICD‐11 recommends a minimum perinatal dataset be recorded for all births, including stillbirths, with gestational age and birth weight recorded to the degree of accuracy to which they measured (Table S1). Gestational age should ideally be recorded in days. If recorded in weeks, separate register columns for completed weeks and number of days since last completed week are recommended. For accurate birth weight reporting, record the actual weight measured (ideally using a calibrated electronic weighing scale to the nearest 10 g) instead of using pre‐defined weight categories (e.g. 500 g groupings) employed for statistical tabulation. Record chronological age at death in completed minutes or hours for the first 24 h (day 0), then days thereafter (days 1–27).

### Performance characteristics of the COBAS amplicor hepatitis C virus (HCV) monitor, version 2.0, international unit assay and the national genetics institute HCV superquant assay [^5a0d6d00]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

The COBAS Amplicor Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Monitor assay, version 2.0, which reports in international units per milliliter, was compared to the assay reported in copies per milliliter by analyzing dilution series and clinical plasma samples by both methods. In addition, the Amplicor international unit assay was compared to the National Genetics Institute HCV Superquant assay. The dilution series ranged from <100 to 5,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml and consisted of 32 points, assayed in triplicate in each assay. Thirty clinical samples ranging from 1,000 to 1,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml were assayed in duplicate. Deming regression analysis comparing the Amplicor HCV RNA international units-per-milliliter and copies-per-milliliter assays was calculated as follows: (Amplicor international units per milliliter) = 1.030(Amplicor copies per milliliter) - 0.392; R(2) = 0.981; n = 28; S(y/x) (standard error of the estimate) = 0.129. The linearity of the Amplicor international units-per-milliliter assay was as follows: observed = 0.886(expected) + 0.437; R(2) = 0.983; n = 30. The linearity of the Superquant assay was as follows: observed= 0.918 (expected) + 0.436; R(2) = 0.986; n = 32. Deming regression analysis comparing the Amplicor and Superquant assays was calculated as follows: Superquant = 1.066(Amplicor) - 0.0197; R(2) = 0.908; S(y/x) = 0.308; n = 28. The Amplicor and Superquant assays were linear through the range of 600 to 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml and approximately 300 to 5,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml, respectively. The narrow range of the Amplicor assay means that some samples will require dilution and retesting for accurate quantification above 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml. The Amplicor and Superquant assays agreed well within the range of 600 to 600,000 IU of HCV RNA/ml (approximately 1,000 to approximately 1,000,000 HCV RNA copies/ml). Overall, the Amplicor and Superquant assays agree well, and results obtained in one assay could be expected to compare well with results from the other when reported in copies per milliliter.

### Assessment of parents' preferences for incentives to promote engagement in family-based childhood obesity treatment [^94204eba]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

With 4 attributes in each profile and each attribute containing 2 to 6 levels, it would be impractical to show parents potential incentive programs representing every permutation of attribute levels. Therefore, a fractional factorial design was used to create a balanced set of profiles that displayed each attribute level an equal number of times. We created 600 incentive program profiles, paired into 300 choice questions. These questions were divided into 30 blocks with 10 choice questions each. Participants were randomized and received 1 block of 10 choice questions, each comparing 2 possible rewards. In accordance with best practices for DCEs, we sought to administer the survey to a minimum of 300 parents.

The survey included an introduction to the discrete choice scenario (eAppendix in the Supplement). After completing a practice question intended to assess parent comprehension of the DCE task, each parent answered 10 discrete choice questions in which they were asked to choose which of 2 possible incentive program profiles would motivate them more (Figure 1).

Figure 1. 
Sample Discrete Choice Experiment Question

A separate survey question was used to assess parent preferences for a small, guaranteed reward or a lottery system for a larger reward with the same mean value. The lottery option was not included as a level in the payment structure attribute to improve the clarity of the survey and to reduce the number of prohibitions between attribute levels. Parents were randomized to see 1 of 3 chances of winning the lottery: 1:10, 1:5, or 1:3 (eAppendix in the Supplement).

### ENTERPRET: a randomized controlled trial of vedolizumab dose optimization in patients with ulcerative colitis who have early nonresponse [^3f400db6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) may experience nonresponse to biologics, possibly as a result of low drug exposure. This trial assessed the efficacy of dose optimization in patients with UC who have early nonresponse to vedolizumab and high drug clearance.

Methods

ENTERPRET was a phase 4, open-label, randomized, controlled trial that included patients with moderate to severe UC who had high drug clearance at week 5 (serum concentration, <50 μg/mL) and nonresponse to standard vedolizumab treatment at week 6. At week 6, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive standard dosing (300 mg every 8 weeks) or dose-optimized vedolizumab (600 mg at week 6, then 300 mg every 4 weeks; or 600 mg at week 6, then 600 mg every 4 weeks [based on week 5 serum concentration]). The primary end point was endoscopic improvement at week 30.

Results

Of 278 enrolled patients, 132 (47.5%) had a clinical response at week 6. From week 6, 108 patients received standard (n = 53) or dose-optimized vedolizumab (n = 55); among patients with nonresponse at week 6, 86.5% had high drug clearance. At week 30, 10 patients (18.9%) who received standard vedolizumab had endoscopic improvement vs 8 patients (14.5%) who received dose-optimized vedolizumab. Five patients (9.4%) who received standard vedolizumab had clinical remission at week 30 vs 5 patients (9.1%) who received dose-optimized vedolizumab; clinical response was observed in 17 (32.1%) and 17 patients (30.9%), respectively. Safety event rates were similar among treatment groups.

Conclusions

In patients with early nonresponse and high drug clearance, vedolizumab dose optimization is probably not required. A proportion of patients benefited from continued treatment irrespective of the dose received.

### Children and adolescents and digital media [^da8145e5]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

School-age TV viewing and obesity risk—In a 1996 study of 5- to 10-year-olds, the odds of being overweight were 4.6 times greater for youth watching more than 5 hours of TV per day compared with those watching 0 to 2 hours, and this study greatly influenced the AAP recommendations for 2 hours or less of sedentary screen time daily for children 2 through 18 years of age. In the Netherlands, children 4 through 13 years of age had a significant risk factor for obesity when watching TV over 1.5 hours per day, with the association only found for children 4 through 9 years of age. A large international study with almost 300 000 children and adolescents found that watching between 1 and 3 hours of TV a day led to a 10% to 27% increase in risk of obesity, and these studies suggest that setting limits of TV viewing to between 1 and 1.5 hours a day may be more effective to prevent obesity than the 2 hours per day standard presented in earlier AAP recommendations.

Phase 1: Defining the outcome

This phase involved measuring actual levels of in-hospital mobility and articulating recommendations for desired mobility levels by linking daily step counts to functional outcomes. Despite the large variation in steps/d (from 0 to 8111), 900 steps and above was identified as a mobility level which prevented a clinically meaningful functional decline (5 points on the Modified Barthel ADL Index) in the vast majority of the study participants.

### A conformation-selective monoclonal antibody against a small molecule-stabilised signalling-deficient form of TNF [^887b3c1f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To form the complex, 333 µl of purified human TNF at 300 mM was mixed with 4567 µl of SEC buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and 100 µL of UCB-8733 (10 mM in DMSO, approximately 10 molar excess) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following day, the complex was formed by adding 4080 µl of SEC buffer to 700 µl TNFR1, 5,000 µl of TNF/ UCB-8733 mix, and 220 µl CA1974 Fab fragment at 500 mM. Total volume of the reaction was 10 ml with a final molar ratio of 3 TNF monomers (equivalent to 1 trimer): 2.5 TNFR1 receptors: 1.2 Fab. The ternary complex (cytokine, small molecule inhibitor, receptor, and Fab) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Analytical SEC was used to assess complex formation (Supplementary Fig. 2). The sample was then concentrated to 1.5 ml and was loaded in a single injection on Superdex 200 16/600 size exclusion column (120 ml) pre-equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions of the ternary complex were selected and concentrated to 13.7 mg/ml and immediately used in crystallization trials. The ternary complex was crystallized by sitting drop vapour diffusion by mixing 0.5 μl of complex with 0.5 μl of Wizard III/IV: 0.1 M HEPES, pH7.0, 10% PEG6,000 (condition B8) over 80 μl of the same crystallization solution.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^4a09bffc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2.7 Reporting criteria for international comparisons

Inclusion of fetal deaths and live births born at extremely low gestational ages disrupts the validity of international comparisons and is therefore not recommended.

For international comparisons countries should report all late gestation stillbirths (≥196 days [≥28 +0 weeks] or birth weight ≥1000 g, if gestational age unknown). Where possible, additionally report early gestation stillbirths (154–195 days [22 +0 –27 +6 weeks] or birth weight 500–999 g, if gestational age unknown) as a separate category (Table 2).

TABLE 2 
Recommendations for internationally comparable reporting of perinatal death statistics.

Whilst all neonatal deaths should be reported in the national data system, for international comparisons only those born ≥196 days (≥28 +0 weeks or birth weight ≥1000 g, if gestational age unknown) should be included. This recommendation represents a shift from previous recommendations and current practice in many countries. However, gestational age and birth weight should now be recorded for every birth and death, and national reporting systems should be adapted to facilitate reporting using these thresholds.

Where deaths before 154 days (<22 +0 weeks or <500 g, if gestational age unknown) are included in perinatal statistics they should be presented separately from deaths at 154 days or more (≥22 +0 weeks or <500 g, if gestational age unknown) and the lower limit for inclusion in perinatal statistics in the setting should be stated, for example, “20 +0 weeks of gestation” or “no lower gestational age limit.”

Indicators for international comparisons of perinatal mortality

To facilitate international comparisons, ICD‐11 recommends reporting the following rates:
Late gestation stillbirth rate = ([stillbirths ≥28 +0 weeks]/[total births ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Early neonatal mortality rate = ([day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥28 +0 weeks]/[live births born at ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.
Perinatal mortality rate = ([stillbirths ≥28 +0 weeks + day 0–6 neonatal deaths born at ≥28 +0 weeks] /[total births ≥28 +0 weeks]) × 1000.

Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)

Purified IN proteins were diluted to 1.5 mg/ml with running buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 750 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM CHAPS and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Multimeric state of supernatant WT and mutant INs were analyzed on Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with running buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.

For analytical SEC, WT and mutant IN proteins were analyzed using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with running buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The protein stocks were diluted to 20 µM with the running buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. To estimate multimeric state of IN proteins, we used the protein standard including bovine thyroglobulin (670,000 Da), bovine gamma-globulin (158,000 Da), chicken ovalbumin (44,000 Da), horse myoglobin (17,000 Da) and vitamin B12 (1,350 Da). Retention volumes for different oligomeric forms of IN were as follows: tetramer ~12.5 mL, dimer ~14 mL, monomer ~15-16 mL.

IN-RNA interactions

To monitor IN-RNA interactions, we utilized AlphaScreen-based assay, which monitors the ability for IN to bind and bridge between two trans-activation response element (TAR) RNAs. Briefly, equal concentrations (1 nM) of two synthetic TAR RNA oligonucleotides labeled either with biotin or digoxin (DIG) were mixed and then streptavidin donor and anti-DIG acceptor beads at 0.02 mg/mL concentration were supplied in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/mL BSA, and 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4). After 2 h incubation at 4 °C, 320 nM IN was added to the reaction mixture and incubated further for 1.5 h at 4 °C. AlphaScreen signals were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Enspire multimode plate reader.

### A theory of cortical map formation in the visual brain [^5967eaa6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Model stage 2. Development of cortical subplate (thalamic afferent sorting by retinotopy)

The model divides the cortical subplate into equally spaced square locations and accommodates one thalamic afferent in each location. The number of locations within the cortical subplate equals the number of thalamic afferents. In turn, the number of thalamic afferents equals the number of ganglion cells from the two eyes projecting to one LGN times the neuronal divergence, which is one if each retinal ganglion cell connects only to one thalamic afferent. The separation between two square locations within the cortical subplate is constant and equal to 50 microns. This constant separation makes the size of the cortical subplate directly related to the number of thalamic afferents. For example, a patch of the cortical subplate that receives 180,000 ON and 180,000 OFF thalamic afferents has 600 × 600 = 360,000 square locations and measures 30,000 × 30,000 square microns. In contrast, a patch of the cortical subplate that receives 100 times less afferents (1800 ON and 1800 OFF) is 10 times smaller (60 × 60 = 3600 cortical locations) and measures only 3000 × 3000 square microns. The model assumes that the most important factor in generating cortical orientation maps is the number of thalamic afferents sampling the same point of visual space. If this number is small, the cortex can only devote a small region to represent each visual point. However, if the cortical area per visual point is large, the number of afferents with overlapping receptive fields is also large and the cortex can sort afferents by eye input and ON-OFF polarity in addition to retinotopy.

### CT patterns of fungal pulmonary infections of the lung: comparison of standard-dose and simulated low-dose CT [^099ef787]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effect of radiation dose reduction on the appearance and visual quantification of specific CT patterns of fungal infection in immuno-compromised patients.

Materials and Methods

Raw data of thoracic CT scans (64 × 0.75 mm, 120 kVp, 300 reference mAs) from 41 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary fungal infection were collected. In 32 patients fungal infection could be proven (median age of 55.5 years, range 35-83). A total of 267 cuboids showing CT patterns of fungal infection and 27 cubes having no disease were reconstructed at the original and 6 simulated tube currents of 100, 40, 30, 20, 10, and 5 reference mAs. Eight specific fungal CT patterns were analyzed by three radiologists: 76 ground glass opacities, 42 ground glass nodules, 51 mixed, part solid, part ground glass nodules, 36 solid nodules, 5 lobulated nodules, 6 spiculated nodules, 14 cavitary nodules, and 37 foci of air-space disease. The standard of reference was a consensus subjective interpretation by experts whom were not readers in the study.

Results

The mean sensitivity and standard deviation for detecting pathological cuboids/disease using standard dose CT was 0.91 ± 0.07. Decreasing dose did not affect sensitivity significantly until the lowest dose level of 5 mAs (0.87 ± 0.10, p=0.012). Nodular pattern discrimination was impaired below the dose level of 30 reference mAs: specificity for fungal 'mixed nodules' decreased significantly at 20, 10 and 5 reference mAs (p<0.05). At lower dose levels, classification drifted from 'solid' to 'mixed nodule', although no lesion was missed.

Conclusion

Our simulation data suggest that tube current levels can be reduced from 300 to 30 reference mAs without impairing the diagnostic information of specific CT patterns of pulmonary fungal infections.

### Surge capacity principles: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^ae9e7061]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Critical care surge capacity planning—conventional, contingency, and crisis levels are outlined with intensive care unit (ICU) expansion goals and operational expectations. Conventional care targets at least 20% beyond usual capacity and should be achieved within a 2-h period, with an ICU expansion goal of x 1.2 usual capacity (20%). Contingency care corresponds to x 2 usual capacity (100%) and 100% beyond usual capacity or two times the usual ICU beds, typically provided in nontraditional areas (postanesthesia care unit, operating rooms) using community or regional resources. Crisis capacity corresponds to x 3 usual capacity (200%) and is not consistent with usual standards of care (Mass Critical Care). Depending on the role of the hospital in community response and hazards identified, it may be prudent to plan for additional conventional capacity.

### Evaluating and implementing block jackknife resampling mendelian randomization to mitigate bias induced by overlapping samples [^45771abe]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

To further evaluate the optimal situation for applying the block jackknife resampling MR, we performed another simulation analysis to compare it with classic one-sample MR using PRS constructed with SNPs identified through external GWAS with a small sample size (compared with the applied dataset) as the genetic instruments for the exposure.

Using the same approach used in the first simulated analysis, we generated phenotype and genotype data for 1000 pairs of applied datasets (n = 50 000) and external datasets with each of the different sample sizes (n = 10 000, 15 000, 20 000, 25 000, 30 000, 35 000, 40 000, 45 000 and 50 000). GWAS and PRS construction were undertaken using the three frameworks performed in the first analysis, except all PRS were calculated using a stringent P -value threshold for MR (P < 5 × 10 −8). Linear regression and 2SLS were performed to generate the correlation coefficients and estimate of the effects from the exposure to the outcome. The R package ‘rsimsum’ was used to compute simulation metrics mentioned in the first analysis.

To evaluate whether the number of SNPs simulated affect the results, we generated another set of phenotype and genotype data for 300 pairs of applied datasets (n = 50 000) and external datasets (n = 50 000) with varying numbers of SNPs (N snp = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500 and 2000) together explaining 10% of the variances in the exposure (i.e. true). GWAS, PRS construction and association analysis were performed using the same methods mentioned before. The resulting correlation coefficients and effect estimates were examined using simulation metrics as described previously.

In addition, we applied the number of 10 blocks across all analyses in this study. To investigate whether the choice of block number would lead to differences in estimates, we performed additional simulation using the same parameters as the primary analysis and calculated the block jackknife resampled PRS using seven different number of blocks (N block = 3, 6, 10, 20, 50, 100) and three different P -value threshold (5 × 10 −8, 0.05 and 1). The resulting correlation coefficients and effect estimates were compared with those generated for the sample overlapping PRS and externally weighted PRS, and they were evaluated using the simulation metrics as described previously.

### High-load preconditioning of soft tissue grafts: an in vitro biomechanical bovine tendon model [^c2ae1557]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

No consensus exists regarding the optimal preconditioning protocol that will minimize postoperative elongation while creating a graft that is biomechanically equivalent to the native anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It was hypothesized that a preconditioning protocol of specific mode and magnitude would create a graft with equivalent stiffness to the native ACL.

Methods

Thirty-six bovine extensor tendon grafts were randomly allocated among six preconditioning groups (n = 6 per group) including three cyclic (10 cycles at 0.5 Hz between 10-80, 100-300, and 300-600 N) and three static loading protocols (20 s at 80, 300, and 600 N). Grafts were then cyclically loaded between 50 and 250 N at 0.5 Hz for 500 cycles to simulate an early rehabilitation protocol.

Results

Cyclic 300-600 N and static 600 N loading protocols both demonstrated significantly less elongation during simulated rehabilitation when compared to lower, current clinical standard preconditioning levels of 10-80 N (-62% Δ) and 80 N (-69% Δ). The same high-load preconditioning protocols demonstrated statistical equivalence in stiffness when compared to the previously reported stiffness of the native ACL.

Conclusions

In this experimental model, increased force applied to soft tissue grafts during preconditioning significantly decreased the subsequent elongation experienced during simulated early rehabilitation. A static load of 600 N removed the most graft elongation during preconditioning, had the least amount of cyclic displacement during simulated early rehabilitation, and was statistically equivalent to the native ACL stiffness. Implementation of high-load preconditioning of soft tissue grafts may help improve outcomes following ACL reconstruction by reducing residual knee laxity resulting from postoperative graft elongation and the intrinsic viscoelastic properties of the graft tissue while imparting biomechanical characteristics (e.g. stiffness) equivalent to the native ACL.

### Lecanemab-associated amyloid-β protofibril in cerebrospinal fluid correlates with biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease [^1d1ec98b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Preparation of Aβ Protofibril Standard

Aβ protofibril used to calibrate CSF Aβ protofibril concentration was prepared according to the previously reported method with a slight modification.In brief, Aβ protofibril standard was made from Aβ 1‐42 soluble aggregates by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) purification. Synthetic peptide, β‐Amyloid (1–42) • HFIP (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA) was dissolved in 10 mM NaOH to form 100 μM and then diluted to 50 μM with 2 × PBS (100 mM phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl). The diluted (50 μM) solution was incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes to form Aβ 1‐42 aggregates. After the incubation, 10% Tween20 solution (BioRad, Irvine, CA) was added to the final concentration of 0.6% and then the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was collected for further purification by SEC to separate Aβ protofibril from small oligomers and monomers. Superdex 75 10/600 GL (GE HealthCare, Hanover Township, PA) was used for the purification. Monitoring 214 nm, the first peak which was eluted in void volume was collected as Aβ protofibril solution. The purified Aβ protofibril solution was aliquoted in Protein LoBind tube 1.5 mL (Eppendorf, Germany) and stored at −80°C before use. Concentration of Aβ protofibril standard was determined using V‐PLEX Aβ42 Peptide (4G8) Kit (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) by the measurement of the protofibril solution treated with 50% formic acid followed by neutralization of pH.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^991ebf84]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are tools used to guide evidence-based healthcare that have been implemented internationally since the 1980s. However, there is widespread lack of agreement on the impact of clinical pathways on hospital resources and patient outcomes. This can be partially attributed to the confusion for both researchers and healthcare workers regarding what constitutes a clinical pathway. This paper describes efforts made by a team of Cochrane Review authors to develop criteria to assist in the objective identification of clinical pathway studies from the literature.

Methods

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop criteria to define a clinical pathway: (1) identify publications exploring the definition of a clinical pathway; (2) derive draft criteria; (3) pilot test the criteria; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Results

Previous literature and liaison with the European Pathways Association resulted in five criteria being used to define a clinical pathway: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression; and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population. After pilot testing it was decided that if an intervention met the first criteria (a structured multidisciplinary plan of care) plus three out of the other four criteria then it was included as a clinical pathway for the purposes of this review. In all, 27 studies were included in the final review. The authors of the included studies referred to these interventions as 'clinical pathways', 'protocols', 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

Conclusions

The criteria used for the identification of relevant studies for this Cochrane Review can be used as a foundation for the development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^b27e0cb1]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric and congenital cardiac catheterization laboratory (PCCL) equipment and supplies—A hybrid cardiac catheterization suite should have an additional 300 square feet (19 square meters) of procedure room footprint with a dedicated, lockable table allowing left/right tilt of ideally 30°, as well as head up/down to approximately 30°. For PCCL procedures, biplane imaging is extremely valuable and is the ideal standard for most laboratories, with maintenance and servicing necessary to avoid outages. Laboratories should maintain stocks with minimum numbers for each consumable and maintain periodic automatic replenishment (PAR) levels; it is never acceptable that a specific intervention cannot be performed because supplies were not available during a case. Storage spaces should be temperature and humidity-controlled, with rapid access to the full range of supplies. For adult congenital patients, larger detector sizes are preferable and procedure tables must accommodate a higher weight limit. In resource-limited environments, operators may have to utilize single-plane laboratories due to lack of biplane availability, alternative strategies may be necessary to meet supply demands, and resterilization may be required.

Results

Literature

A search of electronic databases and communication with the European Pathways Association revealed three 'sentinel' articles that described the characteristics of a clinical pathway: Campbell et al. De Bleser et al. and Vanhaecht et al. De Bleser et al. surveyed the multiple terms used to describe a clinical pathway via a comprehensive review of the literature and derived key characteristics in attempting to address international confusion regarding the definition of a clinical pathway. Campbell et al. described clinical pathways in the context of their relationship to clinical guidelines, whilst Vanhaecht et al. summarised previous studies to determine whether their review of audit tools elicited common characteristics of clinical pathways. A summary of the characteristics identified by these studies is provided in Table 1.

Table 1 
Characteristics of clinical pathways derived from sentinel articles

Criteria

The following five criteria were derived from the three sentinel articles mentioned above: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression (that is, steps were taken if designated criteria were met); and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population.

Level of agreement and final criteria

These criteria were tested by three of the team on five papers. If the intervention described in the paper met all five criteria then it was considered a clinical pathway. This resulted in agreement between reviewers on only two out of the five papers. It was apparent that the main obstacle to agreement on all five criteria was the poor reporting of the intervention. To address this issue the criteria were unchanged but their relative importance was adjusted. An intervention was defined as a clinical pathway if it was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care and at least three of the remaining four criteria were met (that is, it met the first criteria and any three of the remaining four). This amended schedule of essential criteria was then tested by applying them to a further five papers. Following the application of the amended schedule of criteria, there was 100% agreement between the three review authors regarding whether an intervention was a clinical pathway. This schedule was then adopted by the review group and applied to studies identified by the search strategy for the systematic review.

### Comparison of percent of United States adults weighing > or = 300 pounds (136 kilograms) in three time periods and comparison of five atherosclerotic risk factors for those weighing > or = 300 pounds to those [^244cc379]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The radiologic tables used for many imaging procedures have maximum weight limits. Many United States (US) adults may have a body weight that exceeds these limits and may be ineligible for diagnostic imaging procedures. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys in 1976 to 1980, 1988 to 1994, and 1999 to 2004, we determined the increase in the percentage and number of US adults weighing>or=300 pounds (i.e., the weight limit for an electron beam computed tomography table). In addition, the prevalence and clustering of 5 cardiovascular disease risk factors (current smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated C-reactive protein) was determined for US adults weighing>or=300 pounds, and compared with their counterparts weighing<300 pounds. The percentage of US adults, >or=20 years, weighing>or=300 pounds was 0.10%, 0.79%, and 1.50% in 1976 to 1980, 1988 to 1994, and 1999 to 2004, respectively (p trend<0.001). This corresponds to an increase from 130,000 US adults weighing>or=300 pounds in 1976 to 1980, to 1,390,000 in 1988 to 1994 and 3,020,000 in 1999 to 2004 (p trend<0.001). After age standardization, in 1999 to 2004, 34.1% and 24.0% of adults weighing>or=300 pounds had 2 and >or=3, respectively, of the 5 cardiovascular disease risk factors, compared with 17.7% and 5.3%, respectively, of adults weighing<300 pounds (each p<0.001). In conclusion, morbid obesity has increased dramatically among US adults. The clustering of cardiovascular disease risk factors associated with morbid obesity and the exclusion from diagnostic imaging may affect those most in need of such procedures.

Analytical size-exclusion chromatography

Heimdallarchaeota Vps22 (27.9 kDa) was subjected to analytical SEC using a Superdex 200 16/600 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). The sample was loaded onto the column in a buffer comprised of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The calibration curve was established under the same conditions using the following standard proteins (Sigma MWGF1000): carbonic anhydrase (CAN; 29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (BSA; 66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; 150 kDa), beta-amylase (BAM; 200 kDa), apoferritin (AFE; 443 kDa) and thyroglobulin (TGL; 669 kDa). Physical interactions between the Odinarchaeota ESCRT-I complex proteins (Vps23, Vps28 and ubiquitin) were examined by size-exclusion chromatography using an analytical Superdex S200 HR 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). Prior to the gel filtration analyses, ESCRT-I complexes were formed at 60 °C by mixing 250 μg of each protein in a final volume of 500 μl gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) for 10 min. The complexes were subsequently spun at 16,000 g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min to remove any precipitated material, before loading onto the size-exclusion chromatography column. 0.5 ml fractions were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE, on 15% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were then visualized with Coomassie stain.

### Cynodon dactylon pollen (STANDARDIZED Bermuda GRASS POLLEN) [^4ef7f4ec]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNING

This product is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of allergenic extracts and the emergency care of anaphylaxis or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist.

STANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN BAU/ml ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH G RASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN AU/ml OR WITH NON-STANDARDIZED (WEIGHT/VOLUME) GRASS POLLEN EXTR A CT S. For guidance in selecting dose, refer to Table A in the Clinical Pharmacology section that describes the potency of non-standardized grass pollen extracts. Comparative skin tests can be performed to determine the relative potency before initial use of new extracts. For previously untreated patents, initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the Dosage and Administration section of this insert. Patients being switched from other types of extracts to Allergy Laboratories should have their dose adjusted. Extracts standardized in BAU (Bioequivalent Allergy Unit) may differ in potency from non-standardized extracts. Comparative skin tests can be performed to determine relative potency of standardized versus non-standardized extracts. The dosage should be reduced 75% when switching from one lot of standardized grass pollen extract to another Iot. Patients with unstable or severe asthma, including steroid-dependent asthma, are at increased risk for more frequent and more severe reactions from allergy extract injections. Greater caution must be exerted with such patients at all phases of extract administration, but particularly during build up. For example, extract therapy might be initiated at weaker concentrations and built by smaller dosage increments than in comparably allergic rhinitis patients without asthma. Also when asthma is poorly controlled, the injection regimen might be temporarily interrupted (at the discretion of the physician) until control of asthma is re-established. Whenever a reaction occurs in such patients their asthma should be medically stabilized before injections are resumed with an appropriate dosage reduction. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact physician's office if reaction symptoms occur. As with all allergenic extracts, severe systemic reactions may occur. In certain individuals these life threatening reactions may be fatal. Patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes following treatment and emergency measures as well as personnel trained in their use should be immediately available in the event of a life threatening reaction. Serious adverse reactions can be reported to the U S Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Program. The MedWatch forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-FDA-1088. The address is MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787.

### Combined chemical genetics and data-driven bioinformatics approach identifies receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors as host-directed antimicrobials [^b7a56bdb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Bacterial culture

Bacterial strains used are displayed in Supplementary Table 1. Mycobacteria were cultured in Difco Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Becton Dickinson, Breda, the Netherlands) supplemented with 10% ADC (Becton Dickinson), 0.5% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich), and appropriate antibiotics. Stm was cultured on Difco Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (Becton Dickinson) or in Difco LB broth (Becton Dickinson) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.

Stm and Mtb infections

One day before infection, mycobacterial cultures were diluted to a density corresponding with early log-phase growth (optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) of 0.4). Stm was grown either in LB broth or on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics. After overnight incubation, Stm liquid cultures were diluted 1:33 and cultured for an additional 3–4 h, while plate-grown Stm was suspended in PBS by rinsing the agar plates. Bacterial density was determined by measuring the OD 600 and the bacterial suspension was diluted in cell culture medium without antibiotics to reach a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 (unless indicated otherwise). Accuracy of bacterial density measurements was verified by a standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Cell cultures (HeLa for Stm infections and MelJuSo for Mtb infections), seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates as described below, were inoculated with 100 μl of the bacterial suspension, centrifuged for 3 min at 800 rpm, and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO 2 for 20 min if infected with Stm or 60 min if infected with Mtb. The plates were then washed with culture medium containing 30 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Lonza BioWhittaker, Basel, Switzerland) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in a medium containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin and the indicated chemical compounds until readout by flow cytometry or CFU, as indicated.

Chemical compound treatment

A total of 10,000 HeLa or MelJuSo cells were seeded per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates or 300,000 primary macrophages were seeded per well in 24-well plates in appropriate culture medium without antibiotics 1 day prior to infection with Mtb or broth-grown Stm. Infected cells were treated overnight with chemical compounds at 10 μM (unless indicated otherwise) or DMSO at equal v/v in a medium containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^e58932b0]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Substantive provisions of a housing code—egress, lighting/ventilation, thermal standards, and occupancy/structural conditions include that within each dwelling unit two or more means of egress should be provided to safe and open space at ground level. The housing code should spell out minimum standards for lighting and ventilation within each room in the structure, and in addition, minimum thermal standards should be provided; although most codes merely provide the requirement of a given temperature at a given height above floor level, the community should give consideration to the use of effective temperatures. The effective temperature is a means of incorporating not only absolute temperature in degrees, but also humidity and air movement, giving a better indication of the comfort index of a room. The code should provide that no person shall occupy or let for occupancy any dwelling or dwelling units that do not comply with stated requirements, which generally specify that the foundations, floors, exterior walls, doors, window space and windows be sound and in good repair; that it be moisture-free, watertight and reasonably weather tight and that all structural surfaces be sound and in good repair.

### Cynodon dactylon pollen (STANDARDIZED Bermuda GRASS POLLEN) [^79079b16]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

The pediatric dosage for 1:1000 Epinephrine-Hydrochloride is 0.05 to 0.1 ml for infants to 2 years of age; 0.15ml, for children 2 to 6 years; and 0.2ml, for children 6 to 12 years.

Patients should always be observed for at least 30 minutes after any injection. Hypotension can be reversed by using vasopressor agents and volume expanders. Parenteral aminophylline and inhalation bronchodilators may be required for bronchospasm. Oxygen may also be needed. Maintenance of an open airwayis critical if upper airway obstruction is present. Adrenal corticosteroids and intravenous antihistamine can be given after adequate epinephrine and circulatory support has been administered. Physicians must be familiar with these systemic reactions and have all the equipment and drugs necessary for proper treatment. (8)

Serious adverse reactions can be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Program. The MedWatch forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-FDA-1088. The address is: MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20852-9787.

### Incidence and risk factors for intussusception among children in Northern Israel from 1992 to 2009: a retrospective study [^fa8c6165]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Using a standardized form, demographic and clinical information was collected including age, sex, hospitalization date (month and year), maternal and paternal age, birth weight, birth week, history of gastroenteritis prior to hospitalization, breastfeeding, and significant medical problems. For cases, data were also obtained on clinical symptoms and treatment modality (e.g. air enema, barium enema or surgery). Socioeconomic rank of place of residence according to the Israel Bureau of Statistics was used as a proxy measure of socioeconomic status; ranks 1–4, 5–6 and 7–10 were grouped as low, intermediate and high socioeconomic status, respectively.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Carmel medical center (Protocol number 0099-09-CMC) and Hillel Yaffe medical center (Protocol number HYMC-0051-09), which allowed access to medical records. Data abstraction was done by one person (S.E.), and the identity of the patients was kept confidential and was retained in the study hospitals.

Sample size and power calculation

Assuming that the yearly incidence of intussusception in children less than five years of age is 35 per 100,000 children, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and maximum acceptable difference of 20 per 100,000 between the assumed and true incidence, then the required sample size was estimated at 33,602. The catchment area of the study hospitals had on average 35,600 children less than five years of age. Assuming a 30% prevalence of breastfeeding (i.e. 70% not breastfed), and an odds ratio (OR) for intussusception of 0.5 for children who are not breastfed, with the available 190 cases and 295 controls, we had 87% statistical power to detect a significant difference with two sided test.

### Radiation dose reduction at MDCT with iterative reconstruction for prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia: preliminary study using normal fetal specimens [^1bd7578e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate to what degree the radiation dose can be reduced without affecting the ability to evaluate normal fetal bones at MDCT with iterative reconstruction.

Materials and Methods

Fifteen normal fetal specimens immersed in containers (30- and 35-cm diameter) were scanned with a 64-MDCT scanner, with tube voltage of 100 kVp and tube current of 600, 300, 150, 100, and 50 mA. Images were subjected to adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR). The fetal dose was measured using glass dosimeters. We calculated the relative ratio of the dose at 600 mA. Image quality was evaluated on maximum-intensity-projection and volume-rendering images. Two radiologists recorded the visualization scores of five regions. Images at 600 mA were considered to be standard.

Results

With the 30-cm-diameter container, the fetal dose was 10.15 mGy (relative ratio, 100%) at a tube current of 600, 51% at 300, 25% at 150, 17% at 100, and 9% at 50 mA. With the 35-cm-diameter container the fetal dose was 10.01 mGy (relative ratio, 100%) at 600, 47% at 300, 24% at 150, 17% at 100, and 8% at 50 mA. Visual evaluation showed that in both containers, with ASIR 90%, there was a statistically significant difference between 50-and 600-mA images (p<0.01) but not between 600-mA images and those acquired at 100, 150, and 300 mA (p=0.08-1.00).

Conclusion

The fetal radiation dose for the evaluation of normal fetal bones can be reduced by 83% with ASIR 90%.

### Capacity of anesthesiology residency programs in four east African countries: can supply meet the demand? [^b157dcac]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

By 2015, 4 East African countries (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi) had identified a deficit in the number of anesthesiologists, with a mean density of 0.30 physician anesthesia providers (PAP) per 100,000 population, which was significantly lower than the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) recommended minimum of 5.0/100,000 population. This workforce shortfall has been recognized as 1 factor that may negatively affect surgical outcomes. This survey sought to assess the capacity of anesthesia residency programs to meet recommended human resource standards in these countries.

Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study surveyed heads of anesthesia departments, principals of medical colleges that host residency programs and registrars of national medical councils in 4 East African countries. A descriptive analysis of the infrastructural characteristics, human resources, cost of training, enrollment, and output from the programs over 5 years (2015-2020) was conducted. The growth in the number of registered PAP and trends in workforce density were determined. The 2020 needs deficit was calculated based on the WFSA benchmark, and the projected workforce needs in 2030 were estimated based on the population growth trajectory.

Results

There were 7 accredited university-based anesthesia residency programs in 2020, with median (range) enrollment and graduation rates of 10.5 (2-18) and 5.5 (0-13) residents/country/year, respectively. Enrollment was unstable with some countries having years with no enrollment at all. Only 1 country had new programs planned. There was a median resident to supervisor ratio of 1.44 (0.89-7):1 and 50.3 (21.4-100)% of residency training supervisors had no academic faculty appointment. The median university tuition was $1677 (600-6165)/year. The number of PAP increased in all 4 countries median 5-year growth of 79.3 (22.7-150)%, with minimal impact on the low workforce density, median of 0.23 (0.04-0.35)/100,000 in 2020. The median deficit in PAP in 2020 was an estimated 1410 (589-2499) PAP, with a median need for 1763 (763-2911) new specialists per country by 2030.

Conclusions

The PAP workforce deficits significantly outstripped the annual output of all residency programs. Anesthesia societies need to raise awareness about this deficit and engage policymakers to increase investment in anesthesia training, including providing scholarships and employment of PAP in training institutions. Integrating nonuniversity-based residency programs may support an increased output. The attainability of the 2030 workforce goals will need review. National strategies are needed to increase the total anesthesia workforce, which includes nonphysician anesthesia providers (NPAPs) as part of the task-sharing framework.
