## Question

What does left anterior fascicular block mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB) means: what it is anatomically and pathophysiologically, how to diagnose it on ECG, how common it is and in whom, what causes it, what it means prognostically, how to avoid diagnostic pitfalls, when to investigate further, how to manage it, and special-population considerations, culminating in key takeaways. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic substrate and pathophysiology to ground the ECG findings. Then, I should verify the ECG diagnostic criteria and carefully separate LAFB from mimics such as LBBB or LVH plus LAFB. Next, I will review prevalence, etiologies, and prognostic implications. After that, I should examine pitfalls that can simulate or conceal infarction or hypertrophy. Then, I will determine thresholds for additional testing and outline management strategies, including in athletes and aircrew, and finally synthesize the main points with pragmatic clinical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic and physiologic basis. LAFB reflects impaired conduction in the anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, shifting ventricular activation so that depolarization of the anterosuperior left ventricle proceeds via slower myocyte-to-myocyte spread from the intact posterior fascicle, producing a characteristic leftward and superior axis without marked QRS widening; hold on, I need to ensure I'm not overstating QRS prolongation here because QRS is typically normal or only mildly increased in isolated LAFB, unlike LBBB which is substantially prolonged [^114X1HN7].

> I will now examine the ECG criteria. The classic fingerprint is frontal plane left axis deviation typically between about −45° and −90°, a qR in aVL, rS in II/III/aVF, and normal or only slightly prolonged QRS duration, with exclusion of other causes of left axis deviation such as inferior MI or emphysema; wait, let me verify the intrinsicoid deflection detail — I initially wrote " > 0.045 ms", but that unit is incorrect, I should correct it to an intrinsicoid deflection in aVL delayed beyond roughly 45 ms (0.045 s), which aligns with slowed early activation of the anterolateral LV wall [^114X1HN7] [^111mSCsT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bundle-branch block morphology: true LBBB mandates broader QRS with specific notching/slurring morphology and sex-specific thresholds (≥ 130 ms women, ≥ 140 ms men), and many ECGs labeled "LBBB" may actually be LVH plus LAFB, so I should double-check for strict LBBB criteria before concluding that LAFB is part of LBBB rather than isolated [^112c8WXR] [^112yh1of].

> Next, I should review prevalence and demographics. LAFB is encountered in approximately 1–2% of individuals without structural heart disease and becomes more frequent with age, with a male predominance; but wait, I should verify that this population estimate reflects screening cohorts such as aircrew as opposed to hospitalized populations, and indeed the aircrew guidance supports incidental LAFB in healthy adults while emphasizing evaluation if new after midlife [^113RL6Z9]. Let me also consider genetic susceptibility; common variants affecting depolarization are associated with fascicular blocks, including LAFB, which reinforces that conduction traits have heritable components beyond acquired disease [^116yRTZT].

> I need to determine etiologies and associations. Coronary artery disease, particularly anteroseptal infarction, hypertension-related conduction system degeneration, cardiomyopathies, and age-related fibrosis such as Lev/Lenègre disease are repeatedly implicated; I should confirm I am not missing infiltrative or genetic myopathies — LMNA cardiomyopathy is a classic example where conduction disease can precede ventricular dysfunction by years, reminding me to keep cardiomyopathy etiologies in mind when LAFB appears alongside other conduction abnormalities [^114X1HN7] [^117Khu3X]. Critically, if LAFB is newly acquired after about age 40, I need to ensure coronary disease is reasonably excluded, with CT coronary angiography suggested in aircrew guidance, whereas in younger, asymptomatic individuals an echocardiogram may suffice for structural screening [^113RL6Z9].

> Now, I should appraise clinical significance and prognosis. Hold on, let me verify the absolute risk figures: in a large primary care cohort, isolated LAFB carried an absolute 10-year risk of third-degree AV block of about 0–2% with a modest hazard ratio, whereas combined conduction disease such as RBBB plus LAFB, particularly with PR prolongation, markedly raised the risk of complete AV block, syncope, and pacemaker implantation; importantly, mortality was not clearly increased with isolated LAFB, which tempers alarm when it is an incidental finding without structural disease or symptoms [^116LjvBy]. I should also recall that RBBB alone may not portend excess cardiovascular mortality, but when RBBB is combined with a fascicular block, the risk context changes, so I need to check for bifascicular or trifascicular patterns on serial ECGs and correlate clinically [^111J33LH].

> I will now examine diagnostic pitfalls. LAFB can both mimic and mask infarction or hypertrophy; for example, anterior Q waves in V2–V3 can appear due to altered septal activation and be benign when very short and confined to few leads, whereas true infarct Q waves are wider and more extensive; wait, I should double-check that benign Qs are around 0.02–0.03 seconds, not 0.02 ms, and yes, they are indeed on the order of 20–30 ms, which supports cautious interpretation rather than overcalling MI on the basis of small, limited anterior Q waves in LAFB [^1124XhM1]. Conversely, development of LAFB can lead to disappearance of inferior Q waves from prior MI, potentially concealing infarct patterns; I need to keep that in mind when comparing tracings longitudinally [^116yXNwj]. Let me also reconsider the LBBB discussion: some ECGs with long QRS durations reflect LVH plus LAFB rather than true LBBB, an important distinction for CRT candidacy and MI rule-in algorithms, reinforcing the need to apply strict LBBB criteria and to recognize that LAFB can slightly widen QRS but typically not into the LBBB range [^112yh1of] [^112c8WXR] [^114X1HN7].

> Next, I should review when to investigate further. Mandatory additional evaluation is warranted if LAFB is new after about age 40, if there are ischemic symptoms, syncope, dyspnea, or evidence of structural heart disease, or if LAFB is part of bifascicular or trifascicular block; wait, I should confirm guideline-driven triggers, and the aircrew guidance supports CT coronary angiography for late-onset LAFB, while ESC syncope guidance and EPS data support deeper evaluation in syncope with BBB, particularly when PR is prolonged or block pattern is complex, given higher likelihood of infra-His disease [^113RL6Z9] [^116AWdNG] [^1145Bfe2]. But wait, what if exercise unmasks higher-grade block in trifascicular disease with normal coronary arteries? There are instructive cases where treadmill testing reproduced symptomatic complete AV block, prompting pacemaker implantation despite structurally normal hearts, so I should consider provocative testing when symptoms are exertional and resting ECG is not definitive [^115N8aVL].

> Let me outline management pragmatically. For isolated, asymptomatic LAFB without structural disease, no specific therapy is required beyond risk factor modification and periodic clinical or ECG follow-up; hold on, I should ensure I am not overtesting such patients, since aircrew guidance even allows unrestricted flying when no underlying disease is present, underscoring the benign nature of isolated LAFB in many cases [^113RL6Z9]. When LAFB coexists with other conduction disease or symptoms suggest intermittent high-grade AV block, I should pursue ambulatory monitoring, exercise testing when appropriate, and consider EPS in line with syncope guidelines, with pacemaker implantation reserved for documented high-grade AV block or significant inducible conduction delay, acknowledging the higher event risk in combined blocks from population data [^116AWdNG] [^1145Bfe2] [^116LjvBy].

> I need to ensure I contextualize special populations. In athletes, I should differentiate training-related adaptations, which generally do not produce marked left axis deviation, from pathologic LAFB and screen for cardiomyopathy when ECG changes extend beyond expected athletic patterns; careful application of athlete-specific ECG interpretation criteria helps reduce false positives while maintaining sensitivity for cardiomyopathy and channelopathies [^11325qnJ]. In aircrew, isolated LAFB without evidence of underlying disease generally permits unrestricted flying, but documentation excluding CAD is expected if onset is after about age 40, a standard that reflects the occupational safety threshold rather than intrinsic danger of isolated LAFB per se [^113RL6Z9].

> Finally, let me synthesize the key takeaways and double-check for internal consistency. LAFB represents delayed activation of the anterosuperior LV due to anterior fascicular impairment, yielding left axis deviation and characteristic limb-lead patterns with usually normal QRS duration; it is often incidental and benign when isolated but can be a surrogate marker of CAD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or degenerative conduction disease, especially when new in older adults; pitfalls include pseudoinfarct anterior Q waves and masking of prior inferior MI; evaluation escalates when LAFB is new after age 40, symptomatic, structurally accompanied, or combined with other conduction blocks; management targets underlying disease and surveillance, reserving pacing for documented or inducible high-grade AV block in line with syncope guidance; overall long-term risk of complete AV block is very low for isolated LAFB but rises substantially with bifascicular or trifascicular patterns, which should prompt more vigilant assessment [^114X1HN7] [^113RL6Z9] [^1124XhM1] [^116yXNwj] [^116AWdNG] [^116LjvBy].

Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) is a conduction delay in the left anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, producing a characteristic ECG pattern: **left axis deviation** (−45° to −90°) [^114X1HN7], **small q in I/aVL** with **small r in II/III/aVF**, and a normal or slightly prolonged QRS (≤ 120 ms) [^111mSCsT]. It is **often incidental and benign**, but in older adults or with structural heart disease, it may signal underlying pathology or progression to higher-grade block [^116LjvBy] [^113RL6Z9]. Management focuses on identifying and treating underlying causes; isolated LAFB rarely requires intervention, but new LAFB in patients over 40 warrants evaluation for coronary artery disease [^113RL6Z9] [^notfound].

---

## Anatomical and physiological basis

The left bundle branch typically divides into two fascicles: anterior and posterior. The anterior fascicle conducts impulses to the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle. In LAFB, conduction through the anterior fascicle is **delayed or blocked**, so the impulse travels down the posterior fascicle first, then upward and leftward through the myocardium. This altered sequence produces the characteristic ECG findings [^114X1HN7].

---

## Electrocardiographic criteria

Diagnosis is based on **specific ECG criteria**:

- **Left axis deviation**: Frontal plane axis between −45° and −90° [^114X1HN7].

- **QRS duration**: Normal or slightly prolonged (≤ 120 ms) [^111mSCsT].

- **QRS morphology**: Small q waves in leads I and aVL; small r waves in leads II, III, and aVF [^113E7QHT].

- **Delayed R-wave peak**: In leads I and aVL [^111mSCsT].

- **Normal PR interval**: No significant prolongation [^113E7QHT].

These criteria are **summarized below** [^114X1HN7]:

| **ECG parameter** | **Characteristic finding** |
|-|-|
| Frontal plane axis | −45° to −90° |
| QRS duration | ≤ 120 ms |
| QRS morphology | Small q in I, aVL; small r in II, III, aVF |
| R-wave peak | Delayed in I, aVL |
| PR interval | Normal |

---

## Clinical significance and underlying conditions

LAFB is **often an incidental finding** in asymptomatic individuals, particularly younger patients without structural heart disease [^116LjvBy]. However, it may indicate **underlying cardiac disease**, especially in older adults or those with known cardiovascular disease [^114X1HN7]. Common associated conditions include:

- **Coronary artery disease**: Particularly anterior myocardial infarction [^114X1HN7].

- **Hypertension**: Chronic pressure overload [^114X1HN7].

- **Cardiomyopathies**: Dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111tSWkz].

- **Degenerative conduction system disease**: Lev or Lenègre disease [^114X1HN7].

- **Aortic valve disease**: Aortic stenosis or regurgitation.

- **Infiltrative diseases**: Sarcoidosis, amyloidosis [^113E7QHT].

- **Congenital heart disease**: Ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect [^114X1HN7].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

LAFB itself is **typically asymptomatic** and does not cause specific symptoms [^113E7QHT]. When symptoms occur, they reflect underlying cardiac disease and can include chest pain consistent with angina or myocardial infarction; dyspnea from heart failure or valvular disease; palpitations due to arrhythmias; and syncope or presyncope — rare and usually due to progression to higher-grade block [^116LjvBy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The primary diagnostic tool for LAFB is the **12-lead ECG** [^113E7QHT]. Additional evaluation may include echocardiography to assess structural heart disease, valvular abnormalities, or cardiomyopathy; stress testing to evaluate ischemic heart disease; cardiac MRI to assess infiltrative or inflammatory cardiac disease; and, rarely, an electrophysiological study in symptomatic patients or when progression to higher-grade block is suspected [^113RL6Z9] [^1145Bfe2] [^116AWdNG].

---

## Management and treatment

LAFB itself **does not require specific treatment**. Management focuses on identifying and treating **underlying cardiac conditions** [^113RL6Z9]:

- **Coronary artery disease**: Medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass grafting [^113RL6Z9].

- **Hypertension**: Antihypertensive therapy.

- **Valvular disease**: Surgical or transcatheter valve replacement.

- **Cardiomyopathy**: Medical management, device therapy (ICD, CRT) if indicated.

- **Progression to higher-grade block**: Pacemaker implantation if symptomatic or high-grade AV block develops [^116LjvBy].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of isolated LAFB is **generally favorable**, with minimal risk of progression to higher-grade block or significant arrhythmias [^116LjvBy]. Nonetheless, LAFB may indicate underlying cardiac disease that can affect prognosis. Potential complications include rare progression to higher-grade block (particularly when underlying disease is present); arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias, usually related to the underlying pathology; and heart failure arising from structural heart disease [^113RL6Z9].

---

## Differentiation from other conduction abnormalities

LAFB must be **distinguished from other conduction abnormalities**, such as left posterior fascicular block (LPFB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Key distinguishing features include [^113E7QHT]:

| **Parameter** | **LAFB** | **LPFB** | **LBBB** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Axis deviation | Left (−45° to −90°) | Right (+90° to +120°) | Normal or left |
| QRS duration | ≤ 120 ms | ≤ 120 ms | ≥ 120 ms |
| QRS morphology | Small q in I, aVL; small r in II, III, aVF | Small r in I, aVL; small q in II, III, aVF | Broad, notched R waves in I, aVL, V5, V6; absent Q waves in I, V5, V6 [^112c8WXR] |

Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) is a conduction delay in the left anterior fascicle, causing characteristic ECG changes. It is **usually benign** but may indicate underlying cardiac disease, so management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause [^116LjvBy] [^113RL6Z9].

- **Left anterior and left posterior fascicular block**: Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) is seen in 1–2% of individuals without structural heart disease, while left posterior fascicular block (LPFB) is far less common. Both carry no appreciable risk of progression to higher degrees of block. However, LAFB may be associated with myocardial ischaemia, and if newly acquired over age 40, underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) should be excluded with CT coronary angiography. Under 40 years, if investigated, an echocardiogram is usually sufficient. LPFB is often associated with RBBB and may be associated with CAD or cardiomyopathy. Investigation with echocardiography, Holter, and exercise ECG is recommended, and if over age 40 at presentation, CT coronary angiography should be considered. If there are no underlying cardiac abnormalities, unrestricted flying is possible without follow-up investigation in both types of hemiblock.

- **Ectopy, tachyarrhythmias, ventricular pre-excitation, and channelopathies**:

	- **Ectopy**: Atrial and ventricular ectopy is frequently discovered on routine aircrew ECGs. For aeromedical purposes, two or more atrial or ventricular ectopic beats on a standard ECG should lead to further assessment with a Holter monitor. On Holter monitoring in aircrew, atrial and ventricular ectopy is quantified as the percentage of total beats and is often graded as rare (≤ 0.1%), occasional (> 0.1% to 1.0%), frequent (> 1.0% to 10%), and very frequent (> 10%).

### Hemiblocks revisited [^114X1HN7]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

The trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system and the concept of trifascicular block and hemiblock were described by Rosenbaum and his coworkers in 1968. Since then, anatomical, pathological, electrophysiological, and clinical studies have confirmed the original description, with scarce advances in the subject. In the present study, we attempt to review and redefine reliable criteria for the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic diagnosis of left anterior and posterior hemiblock.

One of the most important issues related to hemiblocks is that they may simulate or conceal the electrocardiographic signs of myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia and may mask or simulate ventricular hypertrophy. Illustrative examples of these associations are shown to help with the interpretation of electrocardiograms. The incidence and prevalence of hemiblocks are presented based on studies conducted in hospital patients and general populations.

- **Common causes of hemiblocks**: One of the most prevalent causes is coronary artery disease, with a particularly frequent association between anteroseptal myocardial infarction and left anterior hemiblock. The second most important cause is arterial hypertension, followed by cardiomyopathies and Lev and Lenègre diseases. Hemiblocks may also occur in aortic heart disease and congenital cardiopathies.

Left anterior hemiblock is more common in men and increases in frequency with advancing age. Evidence is presented regarding the relationship of spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defects, which may explain the…

### Intraventricular conduction abnormality — an electrocardiographic algorithm for rapid detection and diagnosis [^111mSCsT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intraventricular conduction abnormalities are commonly seen on the electrocardiograms of patients in the emergency department population. The significance of such a finding can vary widely. When placed into clinical context, determination and description of an intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) can assist in the management of a number of pathologies, both directly cardiac and otherwise. The IVCDs discussed in this review include unifascicular blocks, such as right bundle branch block (RBBB), left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), as well as bifascicular blocks, including left bundle branch block, RBBB plus LAFB, and RBBB plus LPFB. After reviewing these IVCDs, the text presents a simplified algorithm that aids in the electrocardiographic diagnosis of these conduction abnormalities.

### New ECG criteria for acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block [^112c8WXR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Definition of LBBB**: The authors chose a relatively conventional definition of LBBB with the QRS duration > 0.12 seconds, QS or rS complex in V1, and an R wave peak time > 60 ms in lead I, V5, or V6, along with the absence of a Q wave in these leads. There was no requirement for notching or slurring of the R wave in I, V5, and V6 as in the long-standing World Health Organization definition of LBBB. In 2009, an American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation/Heart Rhythm Society recommendations article produced a broader definition of LBBB. This definition stated that ST-T waves are usually oppositely directed to the QRS complex, and positive T waves in the presence of an upright QRS complex may be normal. Subsequently, Strauss et al. introduced a definition of strict LBBB with a QRS duration ≥ 130 ms in women and ≥ 140 ms in men. A QS or rS complex in V1 and V2, as well as notching or QRS slurring in mid-QRS in ≥ 2 contiguous leads, completed their definition. They argued that many ECGs reported as showing LBBB had a wide QRS because of a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy and left anterior fascicular block and not LBBB. Their research aimed at assessing the likelihood of success of cardiac resynchronization therapy, and hence they were using a strict definition of LBBB. Whether the definition of LBBB by Strauss et al. would have altered results in Study 1 is a question that cannot be answered here.

### Intraprocedural high-degree atrioventricular block or complete heart block in transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients with no prior intraventricular conduction disturbances [^113TMnUX]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Low credibility.

Conduction disturbances are the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, no data exists regarding the outcomes of intraprocedural high-degree atrioventricular block (HAVB) or complete heart block (CHB) in patients without previous conduction disturbances.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of intraprocedural HAVB/CHB in patients without previous intraventricular conduction disturbances.

- **Methods**: The occurrence of intraprocedural HAVB/CHB was assessed in 676 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR. Two groups were established according to its duration: persistent HAVB/CHB (PHAVB/CHB) and transient HAVB/CHB (THAVB/CHB), which was not present at the end of the procedure.

- **Results**: Intraprocedural HAVB/CHB occurred in 50 patients (7.4%), being persistent in 32 (64.0%) and transient in 18 (36.0%). The use of the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System (MCRS) and a greater oversizing of the valve increased the risk of intraprocedural HAVB/CHB (p < 0.001). Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) was more frequent in the PHAVB/CHB group than in the THAVB/CHB group (96.9% vs. 33.3%; p < 0.001). At 1-month follow-up, the PHAVB/CHB group showed a 98% ventricular pacing rate (VPR) compared to 16% in the THAVB/CHB group (p < 0.001), and similar VPR were observed at 1-year follow-up (98% vs. 37%, p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased at 1-year follow-up in patients with PHAVB/CHB (-3.9 ± 1.8%, p = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: In TAVR recipients with no prior intraventricular conduction disturbances, intraprocedural HAVB/CHB is associated with notable clinical outcomes.

### Fascicular heart blocks and risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes: Results from a large primary care population [^116LjvBy]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Low credibility.

Fascicular heart blocks can progress to complete heart blocks, but this risk has not been evaluated in a large general population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between various types of fascicular blocks diagnosed by electrocardiographic (ECG) readings and the risk of incident higher degree atrioventricular block (AVB), syncope, pacemaker implantation, and death.

- **Methods**: We studied primary care patients referred for ECG recording between 2001 and 2015. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) as well as absolute risks of cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Results**: Of 358,958 primary care patients (median age 54 years; 55% women), 13,636 (3.8%) had any type of fascicular block. Patients were followed for up to 15.9 years. We found increasing HRs of incident syncope, pacemaker implantation, and third-degree AVB with increasing complexity of fascicular block. Compared with no block, isolated left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) was associated with a 0%-2% increased 10-year risk of developing third-degree AVB (HR 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–2.05), whereas right bundle branch block combined with LAFB and first-degree AVB was associated with up to a 23% increased 10-year risk (HR 11.0; 95% CI 7.7–15.7), depending on age and sex group. Except for left posterior fascicular block (HR 2.09; 95% CI 1.87–2.32), we did not find any relevant associations between fascicular block and death.

- **Conclusion**: We found that higher degrees of fascicular blocks were associated with an increasing risk of syncope and pacemaker implantation.

### A randomized comparison of retrograde left-sided versus anterograde right-sided ablation of the atrioventricular junction [^115TpDQe]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

The main finding from this study is that there was no significant difference in the RF ablation time required to induce an atrioventricular block between retrograde left- and anterograde right-sided approaches. Ablation of the atrioventricular node is an effective treatment for symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) and aims to achieve maximal cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients. Traditionally, this has been performed with a right-sided approach, yielding success rates of more than 95%. However, in some cases, right-sided ablation is challenging and can lead to procedural failure, necessitating a cross-over to the left-sided retrograde technique or a repeat procedure.

- **Benefits of left-sided ablation**: Studies show that atrioventricular conduction block can be induced with fewer RF applications, resulting in decreased procedure and fluoroscopy times. Although left-sided ablation often occurs after unsuccessful right-sided attempts, there may already have been a modification of the atrioventricular node before left-sided ablation was attempted.

- **Proximity to left-sided endocardium**: Previous studies suggest that the atrioventricular node's proximity to the left-sided endocardium is significant in patients failing right-sided ablation. This proximity is evidenced in cases where inadvertent atrioventricular block was induced during other left-sided arrhythmia ablations. Thus, proposing an initial left-sided atrioventricular ablation as an alternative to reduce procedure times and fluoroscopy exposure could be beneficial.

### P-wave oversensing by the implantable cardiac monitor during paroxysmal atrioventricular block: What is the mechanism [^115gTTJm]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of P-wave oversensing (PWOS) by an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM), resulting in a false-negative diagnosis of atrioventricular block (AVB). Measuring the P- and R-wave amplitudes on subcutaneous electrocardiogram and adjusting the R-wave minimum sensitivity on a case-by-case basis is crucial. Additionally, the diagnosis of AVB in the present case was possible due to the patient's timely activation of the patient assist device during symptom onset, underscoring the importance of educating patients and their family members on the appropriate use of this function during symptom manifestation.

### Left bundle-branch block: Pathophysiology, prognosis, and clinical management [^114iPUXw]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Given its broad use as a screening tool, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has largely become one of the most common diagnostic tests performed in routine clinical practice. As a result, the finding of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) in the absence of a well-defined clinical setting has become relatively frequent and raises questions and concerns. While LBBB does not necessarily imply poor outcomes in the absence of clinically detectable heart disease, physicians should be aware of its role in stratifying the risk of cardiovascular events and death in subjects with both ischemic and nonischemic heart disease. This paper reviews historical landmarks, pathophysiologic features, prognostic implications, and clinical management of LBBB in apparently healthy subjects as well as those with heart disease.

### Lithobid [^116xdyFm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients should be informed that a condition known as Brugada syndrome may pre-exist and can be unmasked by lithium therapy. Brugada syndrome is a heart disorder characterized by abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden death. Patients should be advised to seek immediate emergency assistance if they experience fainting, light-headedness, abnormal heartbeats, or shortness of breath, as these symptoms may indicate a potentially life-threatening heart disorder known as Brugada syndrome.

### Significance of anterior Q waves in left anterior fascicular block — a clinical and noninvasive assessment [^1124XhM1]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) Q waves in V leads (V2 or V3) pose a diagnostic challenge in the presence of left anterior fascicular block (LAFB). Benign Q waves, in the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), primarily due to LAFB have been described. This study evaluates Q waves in the presence of LAFB.

- **Hypothesis**: Anterior Q waves in the presence of LAFB may not be indicative of myocardial infarction (MI).

- **Methods**: From 1990 to 1997, ECGs of 236 male patients with LAFB were analyzed for the presence of Q waves in the V leads. Records were reviewed for evidence of CAD. Of these 236 patients, 61 (26%) had Q waves in the V leads. In this group, 31 patients were available for further analysis.

- **Results**: Of the 31 patients with Q waves in the V leads who were available for further study, LAFB was present in 22 patients (71%), and LAFB plus right bundle-branch block (RBBB) was present in 9 (29%). Of the 20 patients with Q waves due to MI, 13 (65%) had LAFB, and 7 (35%) had LAFB plus RBBB. Of 11 patients with benign Q waves, 9 (82%) had LAFB, and 2 (18%) had LAFB plus RBBB. Benign Q waves were noted in 5.3% (11/206) of patients with LAFB. The mean duration of Q waves and Q-wave location limited to V2 and/or V3 are 0.029 s and 64% versus 0.053 s and 15% in benign versus pathologic Q waves, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with LAFB, in the absence of MI, may have Q waves in the V leads that are approximately 0.02 s in duration and restricted to one or two leads. This anomaly may represent a variation of conduction in the initial 0.02 s QRS vector due to LAFB.

### Usefulness and limitations of dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block. A multicentre study [^113X3jvh]. European Heart Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Patients with left bundle branch block exhibit abnormal septal motion, which may limit the interpretation of stress echocardiograms. This study sought to assess the diagnostic value of dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography in left bundle branch block patients.

- **Methods and Results**: Sixty-four left bundle branch block patients (mean age 59 years, 24 men) with suspected coronary artery disease underwent dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography and coronary arteriography. Myocardial ischaemia was defined as new or worsening wall thickening abnormalities. Coronary artery disease was quantitatively defined as a diameter stenosis ≥ 50% in a major epicardial artery. Rest septal motion was normal (apart from the early systolic septal notch) in 34 patients (53%) and abnormal in 30 patients (47%). Rest septal thickening was normal in 32 patients (50%) and abnormal in 32 patients (50%). All seven patients with a QRS duration ≥ 160 ms and an abnormal QRS axis had abnormal rest septal motion and thickening. Inter-observer agreement for ischaemia was 88%. In all but one patient, disagreement was in the septum. For the anterior and posterior circulation, respectively, sensitivity was 60% (9/15) and 67% (8/12), specificity was 94% (46/49) and 98% (51/52), and accuracy was 86% (55/64) and 92% (59/64). Sensitivity for the anterior circulation tended to be better in patients with normal rest septal thickening (83% vs 44%).

- **Conclusions**: Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography has excellent diagnostic specificity in left bundle branch block patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

### Abnormal conduction-induced cardiomyopathy: JACC review topic of the week [^112yu5Sy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Nonischemic cardiomyopathies are a frequent occurrence. The understanding of the mechanisms and triggers of these cardiomyopathies has led to improvement and even recovery of left ventricular function. Although chronic right ventricular pacing-induced cardiomyopathy has been recognized for many years, left bundle branch block and pre-excitation have been recently identified as potential reversible causes of cardiomyopathy. These cardiomyopathies share a similar abnormal ventricular propagation that can be recognized by a wide QRS duration with left bundle branch block pattern; thus, we coined the term abnormal conduction-induced cardiomyopathies. Such abnormal propagation results in abnormal contractility that can only be recognized by cardiac imaging as ventricular dyssynchrony. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment will not only lead to improved left ventricular ejection fraction and functional class but may also reduce morbidity and mortality. This review presents an update of the mechanisms, prevalence, incidence, and risk factors, as well as their diagnosis and management, while highlighting gaps in knowledge.

### Electrocardiographic predictors of successful resynchronization of left bundle branch block by HIS bundle pacing [^115nGiUK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

In the remainder of patients with a 12‐lead appearance of LBBB (4/24, 16.7%), lines of block were not observed. Instead, a second pattern was observed: slow propagation across the LV epicardium without any appearance of discontinuity. This was termed diffusely slowed propagation (DSP). Examples of both patterns are shown in accompanying videos, and illustrative single‐frames of EPM cines are shown in Figure 2.

- **Figure 2**: Example of propagation discontinuity and successful correction by HBP. The epicardial surface of the LV is shown for intrinsic LBBB (left) and HBP with shortening of LVAT (right) in the same patient. Blue circles are ECGI-derived activations. Darker blue represents later activation. In LBBB, the activation wavefront appears to initially travel from the anterior LV toward the lateral LV (arrow 1, red) but then appears to halt at a line of propagation discontinuity (yellow). The remainder of the LV appears to be activated later from the posterior LV (arrow 2, blue). During HBP, the wavefront moves smoothly and rapidly across the line of propagation discontinuity.

During HBP, in 15 (75%) of the 20 patients where propagation discontinuity was observed, the appearance of discontinuity resolved with rapid, unidirectional activation proceeding through the regions where propagation discontinuity was observed in intrinsic activation. In the remaining five patients, the appearance of discontinuity was preserved.

### Atrial cardiomyopathy: A useful notion in cardiac disease management or a passing fad [^111nbMo2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The term atrial cardiomyopathy, which has been used sporadically in the medical literature, was recently the subject of a detailed consensus document prepared by representatives of the European Heart Rhythm Association, Heart Rhythm Society, Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, and Sociedad Latinoamericana de Estimulación Cardiaca y Electrofisiología. They discussed aspects of the definition, histopathology, atrial-specific physiology, atrial pathology, impact on arrhythmia occurrence, imaging, mapping, and ablation. Here, the authors consider critically the added clinical value of this concept and its meaningfulness. They review evidence implicating atrial cardiomyopathy as an independent contributor to the risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation and as a determinant of arrhythmia progression. The issue of classification is considered, and the authors discuss how atrial cardiomyopathic properties might guide stroke prevention, rhythm maintenance, and rate control in atrial fibrillation. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate these potential applications and will ultimately define the value of this terminology.

### Temporal relationship of conduction system disease and ventricular dysfunction in LMNA cardiomyopathy [^117Khu3X]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

LMNA cardiomyopathy presents with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, conduction system disease (CSD), and/or arrhythmias before the onset of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Knowing the time interval between the onset of CSD and its progression to DCM would help guide clinical care.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated family members from 16 pedigrees previously identified to carry LMNA mutations for the ages of onset of ECG abnormalities, CSD, or arrhythmia and of left ventricular enlargement (LVE) and/or systolic dysfunction. Of 103 subjects, 64 carried their family LMNA mutation, and 51 (79%) had ECG abnormalities with a mean age of onset of 41.2 years (range 18–76). Ventricular dysfunction was observed in 26 with a mean age of onset of 47.6 years (range 28–82); at diagnosis, 9 had systolic dysfunction but no LVE, 5 had LVE but no systolic dysfunction, and 11 had DCM. Of 16 subjects identified with ECG abnormalities who later developed ventricular dysfunction, the median ages of onset by log-rank analyses were 41 and 48 years, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: ECG abnormalities preceded DCM with a median difference of 7 years. Clinical surveillance should occur at least annually in those at risk for LMNA cardiomyopathy with any ECG findings.

### Electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic findings of patients undergoing reductive ventriculectomy (Batista operation) [^116xXUuW]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The Batista operation, or partial ventriculectomy, was designed by the Brazilian surgeon Dr. Randas Batista as an alternative method for treating patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

- **Hypothesis**: This study aimed to analyze electrocardiographic (ECG) and vectorcardiographic (VCG) data obtained from patients who underwent such surgery and to evaluate its electrical repercussions on the heart.

- **Methods**: Pre- and postoperative ECG and VCG were performed 45 days apart in 15 patients undergoing reductive ventriculectomy.

- **Results**: All ECGs showed sinus rhythm with unchanged QRS duration. Left atrial enlargement (86.6%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (100%) were the most common findings. Bundle-branch blocks (BBBs) were often demonstrated on preoperative studies, predominantly (46.7%) left BBBs. Left anterior fascicular blocks were observed in four patients (26.6%), with one associated with right BBB. Electrocardiographic changes suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI) were seen in four patients preoperatively; postoperatively, all had extended to or within the lateral wall. Five additional patients developed lateral MIs postoperatively, totaling 9 patients (60%) with postoperative signs of infarction (p < 0.05). ECG and VCG also showed significant postoperative lowering of QRS voltages (mean 40.74%) in all patients, leading to difficulty in diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy, although the morphologic features did not change.

- **Conclusions**: These important ECG and VCG alterations reflect both postoperative changes and challenges in the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Non-reentrant fascicular tachycardia: Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of a distinct type of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia [^1124sKes]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

The most common form of idiopathic Purkinje-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the reentrant type. We describe the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of focal non-reentrant fascicular tachycardia.

- **Methods and results**: Among 530 idiopathic VT patients who were referred for ablation, we identified 15 (2.8%) with non-reentrant fascicular tachycardia (11 men, 45 ± 21 years). Sinus rhythm ECG showed normal conduction intervals with a His-ventricular interval of 41 ± 4 ms. All patients had monomorphic VT (cycle length: 337 ± 88 ms) with a relatively narrow QRS (123 ± 12 ms) and did not respond to verapamil during the initial presentation. VT exhibited right bundle-branch block/superior axis configuration in 11 patients (73%) and inferior axis in 3 (20%). In 1 patient (7%), VT exhibited left bundle-branch block/superior axis configuration. During ablation, spontaneous VT occurred in 3 patients (20%), and nonentraintable VT or identical premature ventricular complex was induced in 9 (60%). A high-frequency presystolic Purkinje potential was recorded during VT/premature ventricular complex, preceding the QRS by 25 ± 16 ms. VT recurrence was observed in 4 patients (27%); among them, 3 underwent pacemap-guided ablation during the first session. A second ablation with activation mapping guidance eliminated the VT during the 88 ± 8-month follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Among idiopathic VT cases referred for ablation, 2.8% were focal non-reentrant fascicular tachycardia, which had distinct clinical characteristics and usually originated from the left posterior fasc.

### Resuscitation great. Karel Wenckebach: the story behind the block [^115J2Ea4]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

The first documentation of a human atrioventricular (AV) block dates back to 1873, when A.L. Galabin reported a 34-year-old patient using an apexcardiogram. This was followed the same year by Luciani, who recorded 2nd degree AV blocks while studying frogs. In 1899, Karel F. Wenckebach provided the cardiology field with the criteria of what he called "Luciani periods", now known as Wenckebach periodicity or Mobitz I AV block. The classic electrocardiographic presentation of Mobitz I/Wenckebach periodicity is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval on the electrocardiogram (EKG) on consecutive beats, followed by a blocked P wave. This clinical entity is the first and most common of two types of 2nd degree AV block. This manuscript reviews the life of Karel F. Wenckebach and the events that led this great Dutch physician to make one of the most important contributions to the field of cardiology.

### The tetrafascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system [^116qBJXi]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The existence of a tetrafascicular intraventricular conduction system remains debatable. A consensus statement ended with some discrepancies, and despite agreeing on the possible existence of an anatomical left septal fascicle, the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic characteristics of left septal fascicular block (LSFB) were not universally accepted. The most important criterion to confirm the existence of LSFB is its intermittent nature. So far, our group has published cases of transient ischemia-induced LSFB and phase 4 or bradycardia-dependent LSFB. Finally, anatomical, anatomopathological, histological, histopathological, electrocardiographic, vectorcardiographic, body surface potential mapping, and electrophysiology studies support the fact that the left bundle branch divides into three fascicles or a "fan-like interconnected network".

### Electrocardiographic criteria for detecting acute myocardial infarction in patients with left bundle branch block: a meta-analysis [^111mtigj]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Numerous investigators have evaluated the ECG algorithm described by Sgarbossa et al. to predict acute myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block and have arrived at divergent conclusions. To clarify the utility of the Sgarbossa ECG algorithm, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of these trials.

- **Methods**: A structured search was applied to MEDLINE and Scopus databases, beginning with the year that the algorithm was derived (1996). Two reviewers independently screened citations, assessed for method quality, and extracted data (individual study characteristics, screening performance, and interobserver agreement) with a standardized extraction tool. We assessed qualifying studies for heterogeneity and generated summary estimates for the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios with fixed-effect models.

- **Results**: We identified 11 studies with 2,100 patients that met the criteria for at least one component of the analysis. Ten studies with 1,614 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 3. These yielded a summary sensitivity of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 23%), specificity of 98% (95% CI 97% to 99%), a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9 (95% CI 4.5 to 13.8), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.8 (95% CI 0.8 to 0.9). The summary diagnostic odds ratio revealed homogeneity. Seven studies with 1,213 patients reported a Sgarbossa ECG algorithm score of greater than or equal to 2. These yielded sensitivities ranging from 20% to 79% and specificities ranging from 6%.

### Diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block with the ST-elevation to S-wave ratio in a modified Sgarbossa rule [^111RxXRt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Sgarbossa's criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) in left bundle branch block is a diagnostic tool designed to identify patients with acute MI in the presence of a left bundle branch block, a condition that often obscures the electrocardiographic diagnosis of MI. The criteria incorporate three primary components: ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more that is concordant with the QRS complex, ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in lead V1, V2, or V3, and excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead. These components are used to evaluate the likelihood of an acute MI, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making in patients with left bundle branch block.

The clinical calculator "Sgarbossa's criteria for MI in left bundle branch block" evaluates the likelihood of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with a left bundle branch block by analyzing three specific ECG criteria. Here's how the scoring system works:

- **If there is ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm**: This occurs in the same direction as the QRS complex and contributes 5 points to the total score.

- **An ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in ECG leads V1, V2, or V3**: Adds 3 points.

- **If there is any excessively discordant ST elevation or depression in any one lead**: 2 points are added.

For each criterion that is true, the corresponding points are summed to obtain an overall score. For example, if a patient exhibits both an ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex and an ST-segment depression in one of the specified leads, the points for both criteria are combined to determine the likelihood of a myocardial infarction.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: Bundle branch blocks and fascicular blocks [^113E7QHT]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Intraventricular conduction block is the general name given to a varied group of electrocardiographic entities. All share a common finding of some degree of delay in ventricular activation; recognition of these blocks hinges upon analysis of the QRS complex, as well as the ST-T changes associated with them. Bundle branch block (right or left), and fascicular block (left anterior or left posterior) are all examples of intraventricular conduction block. Causation of intraventricular conduction block may be cardiac or noncardiac; early recognition of the etiology may be of clinical importance. This article reviews the basic anatomy and physiology related to intraventricular conduction blocks and then examines each in terms of electrocardiographic definition and clinical correlation.

### Qtc interval evaluation in patients with right bundle branch block or bifascicular blocks [^115cSdyN]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Bifascicular blocks can be induced by left ventricular pacing. Twelve-lead ECG examples with a paper speed of 50 mm/second illustrate this:

- **RBBB + LAFB pattern**: This pattern is shown on the left side during pacing and narrow QRS complexes are visible during intrinsic rhythm on the right side.
- **RBBB + LPFB pattern**: Similarly, this pattern is displayed on the left side during pacing with narrow QRS complexes visible during intrinsic rhythm on the right side.

Abbreviations are as follows: ECG - electrocardiogram; LAFB - left anterior fascicular block; LPFB - left posterior fascicular block; RBBB - right bundle branch block.

Statistical analysis was performed on continuous data, displayed as mean ± SD. Data analysis involved a computerized database (Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) and statistical evaluation using SPSS Software Release 23.0.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test assessed normal distribution. Differences between groups were determined by Student's unpaired t-test, and significance was attributed to P-values < .05 (two-sided).

### Cardioneuroablation for treatment of atrioventricular block [^117Q6rCM]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

Cardioneuroablation is an emerging treatment for atrioventricular block, involving the modification of autonomic input to the heart. This technique may offer an alternative to the traditional approach of pacemaker implantation, particularly for younger patients or those with vasovagal syncope.

- **Study overview**: In a recent study, researchers evaluated the efficacy of cardioneuroablation in patients with atrioventricular block. Patients who underwent the procedure showed significant improvements in heart rate variability and reductions in syncope episodes compared to those who did not.

- **Technique specifics**: The procedure involves radiofrequency ablation of specific autonomic ganglia connected to the heart. This study used advanced imaging techniques to guide precise ablation.

- **Outcomes**: The majority of patients experienced restoration of normal sinus rhythm post-procedure.

The findings suggest cardioneuroablation could be a promising option for atrioventricular block treatment, though further research is needed to establish its long-term benefits and safety profile.

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^113gua6H]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

- **Outcomes and risks**: In the largest series of reentrant fascicular VTs, which included 160 patients with left posterior septal fascicular VT, 30 patients with left anterior septal fascicular VT, and 8 patients with left upper septal fascicular VT, the success and recurrence rates were 97% and 4%, respectively, for left posterior septal fascicular VT; 90% and 11%, respectively, for left anterior septal fascicular VT; and 100% and 2.5%, respectively, for left upper septal fascicular VT. Recurrence of papillary muscle fascicular VT after ablation was high, with 3 of 8 patients (38%) with posterior papillary muscle fascicular VT and 1 of 5 patients (20%) with anterior papillary muscle fascicular VT requiring a second ablation session for VT recurrences.

Aside from the complications that can result from any LV electrophysiological procedure, the only complications specifically associated with catheter ablation of idiopathic left fascicular VT have been LBBB and AV block. Tsuchiya et al. have reported that 2 patients in their series of 16 patients (12.5%) had transient LBBB after ablation. The authors targeted the left basal septum, and the LBBB disappeared within 10 minutes without VT recurrence. In a larger series, 1 (0.5%) of 198 patients had a transient AV block. This patient presented with left posterior fascicular VT, and the diastolic potential (P1) at the midseptum was targeted for ablation. Before the ablation, the patient had catheter-induced RBBB. The AV block disappeared immediately after discontinuing the RF energy delivery.

### Electrocardiographic features and prevalence of bilateral bundle-branch delay [^112Do6G4]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Definitive diagnosis of bilateral bundle-branch delay/block may be made when catheter-induced right bundle-branch block (RBBB) develops in patients with baseline left bundle-branch (LBB) block. We hypothesized that an RBBB pattern with absent S waves in leads I and aVL will identify bilateral bundle-branch delay/block.

- **Methods and results**: Fifty patients developing transient RBBB pattern in lead V1 during right heart catheterization were studied. Patients were grouped according to whether the baseline ECG demonstrated a normal QRS, left fascicular blocks, or LBB block pattern. The RBBB morphologies in each group were compared. The prevalence of bilateral bundle-branch delay/block pattern was examined in our hospital ECG database. All patients with baseline normal QRS complexes (n = 30) or left fascicular blocks (4 anterior, 5 posterior) developed a typical RBBB pattern. Among the 11 patients with a baseline LBB block pattern, 7 developed an atypical RBBB pattern with absent S waves in leads I and aVL, and the remaining 4 demonstrated a typical RBBB. The absence of S waves in leads I and aVL during RBBB was 100% specific and 64% sensitive for the presence of pre-existing LBB block. Among the consecutive 2253 hospitalized patients with RBBB, 34 (1.5%) had the bilateral bundle-branch delay/block pattern.

- **Conclusions**: An ECG pattern of RBBB in lead V1 with absent S wave in leads I and aVL indicates concomitant LBB delay. Pure RBBB and bifascicular blocks are associated with S waves in leads I and aVL.

### Preoperative electrocardiogram in prediction of 90-day postoperative mortality: Retrospective cohort study [^116EbKB4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

For the following statistical analysis, we excluded patients who were not operated on and those without preoperative ECG testing. The total number of patients excluded for these reasons was 143.

The characteristics of physiological ECG, as defined in this study, are described in Table 2. All other ECG findings were considered abnormal.

The mortality analysis included 2,219 patients who had ECG tests prior to the surgery. Of these, 639 (28.8%) had a normal ECG, 131 (5.9%) had non-sinus rhythm, 105 (4.7%) had an abnormal PQ interval, 258 (11.6%) had left anterior hemiblock (LAH), 38 (1.7%) had left bundle branch block (LBBB), 77 (3.5%) had right bundle branch block (RBBB), 219 (9.9%) had incomplete right bundle branch block (iRBBB), 25 (1.1%) had an abnormal QT interval, 434 (19.6%) had ST segment changes (of whom 216 [9.7% of all included patients] had early repolarization ST elevation), 613 (27.6%) had T wave changes, and 527 (23.7%) had other abnormalities. These included, but were not limited to, hypertrophy signs, supraventricular extrasystoles (SVES) and ventricular extrasystoles (VES), Q wave pathologies, R wave changes, P pulmonale, P mitrale, and pre-excitation. Some patients had multiple abnormalities. A detailed distribution of ECG abnormalities is provided in Table 3.

### Blocking nerves and saving lives: Left stellate ganglion block for electrical storms [^113dxzPw]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Patients who present with electrical storms (ES) due to the rapid recurrence of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation represent major medical emergencies without easy solutions. Antiarrhythmic drugs have limited value, and ES needs to be stopped quickly to prevent irreversible patient deterioration and death. Since the mid-1970s, we have provided the rationale for interrupting cardiac sympathetic nerves and evidence of its antifibrillatory action in different clinical settings.

Slowly but progressively, from isolated clinical reports to small case series, increasing evidence has indicated that pharmacologic stellate ganglion block (SGB) is highly effective in interrupting ES. However, medical guidelines have largely ignored SGB, and few centers are prepared to perform SGB in actual emergencies. Our own experience shows that a direct anatomic approach that does not require echocardiographic assistance can be performed rapidly, thus saving time in highly critical patients.

In this review, we retrace the evolution in our understanding of the mechanism of action of SGB, discuss the approaches and their limitations, and review the correct indications that overcome still existing biases. Furthermore, we propose a practical solution to increase the availability of SGB to more patients by extending the number of centers where this approach can be rapidly implemented.

### Painful left bundle branch block syndrome: Clinical and electrocardiographic features and further directions for evaluation and treatment [^111UFfKG]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Painful left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a rarely diagnosed chest pain syndrome caused by intermittent LBBB in the absence of myocardial ischemia. Its prevalence, mechanism, detailed electrocardiographic (ECG) features, and effective treatments are not well described.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to characterize clinical and ECG features of patients with painful LBBB syndrome with respect to the LBBB ECG morphology (in particular QRS axis and the precordial S/T wave ratio), clarify diagnostic criteria and possible mechanisms, and provide directions for further evaluation and treatment.

- **Methods**: We analyzed clinical (n = 50) and ECG (n = 15) features of patients with painful LBBB syndrome (4 patients in our practice and 46 cases identified in the literature).

- **Results**: All 15 ECGs of patients with painful LBBB syndrome had an inferior QRS axis and a very low (< 1.8) precordial S/T wave ratio, which was consistent with the "new LBBB" pattern. We report a case of painful LBBB syndrome coexisting with coronary artery disease. Right ventricular apical pacing resolved intractable chest pain in 1 case of painful LBBB.

- **Conclusion**: Painful LBBB ECG morphology within seconds/minutes of its onset is consistent with the new LBBB pattern with a very low (< 1.8) precordial S/T wave ratio and inferior QRS axis. Painful LBBB syndrome can coexist with coronary artery disease, complicating the assessment of chest pain in the setting of LBBB. An electrophysiology study might be considered to investigate whether changing ventricular activation pattern by pacing prov.

### Echocardiographic evidence of hemodynamic and clinical improvement in patients paced for heart failure [^115eMELk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is frequently associated with electrical conduction disturbances. The development of left bundle-branch block with a discoordinated ventricular contraction pattern further contributes to impaired hemodynamic performance. Biventricular pacing has evolved as a new treatment option for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances. The "electrical" approach aims to normalize the disturbed contraction pattern, thereby improving hemodynamic function by simultaneous stimulation at different ventricular sites.

Acute hemodynamic improvement with biventricular pacing has been demonstrated in patients with depressed left ventricular function and delayed intraventricular conduction. Due to the variations in optimal pacing site and atrioventricular delay, individual optimization to achieve optimal hemodynamic benefit is necessary. Echocardiography has the potential to provide hemodynamic data by Doppler techniques and combine these with geometric information about ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and contraction patterns.

This article focuses on the use of echocardiographic techniques for noninvasive optimization in cardiac pacing and presents preliminary experience from the initial trials on multisite pacing in heart failure.

### Sequence variants with large effects on cardiac electrophysiology and disease [^116yRTZT]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We tested the 190 QRS variants for association with ventricular conduction disorders, including left anterior/posterior fascicular block (LAFB/LPFB) and left/right bundle branch block (LBBB/RBBB). Using a 5% false discovery rate (FDR, P ≤ 0.003), we observed 46 associations with 37 variants (Supplementary Data 4). Three variants associate genome-wide significantly with LAFB, including the missense variant p. Leu294Arg (MAF = 4.4%) in ADPRHL1 (OR = 1.37, P = 4.8 × 10⁻⁸), which codes for a cardiac-restricted protein essential for heart chamber outgrowth. The stop-gain variant p. Ser699Ter in HMCN2 (MAF = 2.0%) is associated with a high risk of LPFB (OR = 2.31, P = 5.2 × 10⁻⁴).

To assess the genetic relationship between ventricular depolarization and other electrical functions of the cardiac conduction system, we tested the genetic correlation between different ECG measures. The genetic correlation between mean QRS duration and mean PR interval duration is 0.14 (95% CI: 0.06–0.21), and between mean QRS duration and mean QT interval duration is 0.31 (95% CI: 0.23–0.40). We also tested the 190 QRS variants for association with ECG measures reflecting atrial and atrioventricular conduction (P–Q component of the ECG) and ventricular repolarization (ST–T component) (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 5). Using a 5% FDR (P ≤ 0.016), 177 of the variants associate with a non-QRS measure of the ECG. Of those, 16 have more significant effects on non-QRS components: the PR interval (at CAV1, OBFC1, SCN5A, SCN10A, and TBX3) and T amplitude (at KLF12, LMF1, MYBPC3, and RNF207).

### In search of left septal fascicular block [^115UD8Jy]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

In most humans, the left bundle branch divides into three fascicles. Electrocardiographic changes resulting from conduction abnormalities of the left anterior and left posterior fascicles are well described and commonly diagnosed. The existence of conduction defects of the left septal fascicle is controversial, with no generally accepted criteria for diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Approximately 26,000 electrocardiograms were reviewed to find examples consistent with left septal fascicle block according to criteria derived from a review of the literature.

- **Results**: Electrocardiograms meeting the proposed criteria were found in about 0.5% of tracings. Illustrative examples are shown with a discussion of the reasons for their selection.

- **Conclusions**: Left septal fascicle block seems to exist, is polymorphic, and may explain some previously inadequately understood electrocardiographic abnormalities.

### What should be done with the asymptomatic patient with right bundle branch block [^111J33LH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In a recently published study of 6,299 subjects (mean age, 52.8 years), 75 (1.2%) had complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and 61 (1%) had incomplete RBBB at baseline. During a median follow-up of 15.9 years, 1,309 of the subjects (20.8%) died, and of these, 655 (10.4%) were cardiovascular deaths. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay and left bundle branch block (BBB) according to the Minnesota definition, but not complete or incomplete RBBB, were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age and sex. The authors did not study the prognostic impact of combined intraventricular conduction disorders.

There have been conflicting data on the prognostic significance of isolated RBBB in patients without established heart disease. Yet, it seems that when combined with left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) or left posterior fascicular block, RBBB is associated with increased risk. The other studies did not separate between isolated RBBB and RBBB as part of a bifascicular block; therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the different results are related to different prevalence of concomitant fascicular blocks among the studies.

### QTc interval evaluation in patients with right bundle branch block or bifascicular blocks [^116z9jEc]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 71 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study. The majority of patients (89%) were in sinus rhythm during the electrophysiological examination. The pacing rates were 36 ± 18 bpm above the intrinsic rhythm to achieve stable left ventricular capture. In intrinsic rhythm, the mean heart rate was 69 ± 13 bpm with a QRS duration of 97 ± 7 ms, JT interval of 328 ± 38 ms, and QTc interval of 452 ± 28 ms using Bazett's formula, 442 ± 25 ms with Fridericia's formula, and 441 ± 24 ms with Hodge's formula, measured in leads V1 or V2, respectively.

- **Bifascicular blocks**: In both bifascicular blocks, the longest QT interval was measured in lead V1 or V2.
- **RBBB with LAFB**: QRS duration increased to 175 ± 21 ms, with a QTmc interval of 466 ± 37 ms after QRS interval correction with the Bogossian formula and heart rate correction with the Bazett formula. Using Fridericia's formula, the QTmc interval was 425 ± 33 ms, and with the Hodge formula, it was 435 ± 26 ms.
- **RBBB with LPFB**: QRS duration increased to 179 ± 20 ms, with a QTmc interval of 471 ± 31 ms, 431 ± 27 ms, and 438 ± 23 ms after application of the Bazett, Fridericia, and Hodge formulas, respectively.

Compared to intrinsic rhythm, the mean ΔQTmc using the combination of the Bogossian and Bazett formulas was 15 ± 33 ms in RBBB with LAFB (P = 0.01) and 20 ± 30 ms in RBBB with LPFB (P = 0.0002). When using the Bogossian and Fridericia formulas, the mean ΔQTmc was −17 ± 27 ms in RBBB with LAFB (P = 0.0006) and −11 ± 23 ms in RBBB with LPFB (P = 0.012).

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^115t4MxX]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Reported cases of left posterior papillary muscle fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) presented an RBBB configuration and right-axis deviation QRS configuration. A diastolic Purkinje potential (P1) is recorded at the papillary muscle, with the location confirmed by ICE imaging. Ablation at this site is highly effective for suppressing this VT.

Left anterior septal fascicular VT exhibits an RBBB QRS morphology with an Rs pattern in V5–V6. A Purkinje potential is recorded in the diastolic phase during the VT at the midanterior left ventricular (LV) septum. In this circuit, P1 potentials represent activation in the proximal portion of the specialized Purkinje tissue, which has decremental conduction properties. During VT, the anterograde limb is the Purkinje tissue exhibiting P1, and the retrograde limb is the LV muscle. The circuits of the left anterior and posterior fascicular reentrant VTs are mirror images.

Left anterior papillary muscle fascicular VTs have RBBB with deep S waves in V5–V6. LV endocardial mapping during left anterior fascicular reentrant VT identifies the earliest ventricular activation in the anterolateral wall of the LV, where ablation suppresses VT.

Upper septal fascicular VT has a narrow QRS and inferiorly directed frontal plane axis. P1 represents the activation potential of the specialized Purkinje tissue at the LV septum. P2 represents the activation of the left anterior and posterior fascicles. Both the left anterior and posterior fascicles are the anterograde limbs of the reentrant circuit in VT, producing the narrow QRS configuration and inferior axis. This VT is successfully ablated at the site of the earliest activation.

### Catheter ablation of fascicular ventricular tachycardia: Long-term clinical outcomes and mechanisms of recurrence [^116FMPhm]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in the remaining six patients, recurrent ventricular tachycardia (reVT) exhibited a different ECG morphology, with narrower QRS and variable inferior axis (Figure 5; Figure II in the Data Supplement; Table 2). Five of these six patients developed a new-onset LPF block after the first ablation. Only three patients agreed to undergo a repeat electrophysiology study (EPS). During the second ablation procedure, the left posterior fascicle (LPF) was activated in an anterograde direction with a resultant positive HV interval that was shorter during ventricular tachycardia (VT) compared with sinus rhythm. EPS and activation mapping confirmed the diagnosis of upper septal VT. Concealed entrainment was successful in only one patient, with a post-pace interval (320 ms) minus tachycardia cycle length (315 ms) of 5 ms (Figure III in the Data Supplement).

The lower turnaround of the upper septal VT circuit, marked by the site with the most premature diastolic potential, was targeted. The ablation site was significantly more basal compared with the index ablation (Table 2; Figures 4C, 4D, and 6). Radiofrequency ablation was initiated cautiously at 10 W, gradually increased to a maximum of 20 W, and was acutely successful in all three patients without any atrioventricular nodal injury or ECG changes. All three patients remain free from recurrent arrhythmias following a median follow-up of 46.1 months.

Figure 5 shows the twelve-lead ECG of index and recurrent fascicular ventricular tachycardia (FVT). Both patients labeled A and B presented with left posterior fascicular VT (LPFVT; left) that was successfully ablated during their index ablation. ECG axis was unchanged after the index ablation in patients.

### Left septal fascicular block: Evidence, causes, and diagnostic criteria [^113CYqPb]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Low credibility.

The existence of a tetrafascicular intraventricular conduction system is widely accepted by researchers. In this review, we have updated the criteria for left septal fascicular block (LSFB) and the differential diagnosis of prominent anterior QRS forces. More and more evidence points to the fact that the main cause of LSFB is critical proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery before its first septal perforator branch.

The most important characteristic of LSFB that has been incorporated in the corresponding diagnostic electrocardiographic criteria is its transient/intermittent nature, mostly observed in clinical scenarios of acute (i.e. acute coronary syndrome including vasospastic angina) or chronic (i.e. exercise-induced ischemia) ischemic coronary artery disease. In addition, the phenomenon proved to be phase 4 bradycardia rate dependent and induced by early atrial extrastimulus. Finally, we believe that intermittent LSFB has the same clinical significance as "Wellens syndrome" and the "de Winter pattern" in the acute coronary syndrome scenario.

### Characterization of left ventricular activation in patients with heart failure and left bundle-branch block [^112L2vq4]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Conventional activation mapping in the dilated human left ventricle (LV) with left bundle-branch block (LBBB) morphology is incomplete given the limited number of recording sites that may be collected in a reasonable time and the lack of precision in marking specific anatomic locations.

- **Methods and results**: We studied LV activation sequences in 24 patients with heart failure and LBBB QRS morphology with the simultaneous application of 3D contact and noncontact mapping during intrinsic rhythm and asynchronous pacing. Approximately one-third of the patients with typical LBBB QRS morphology had normal transseptal activation time and slightly prolonged or near-normal LV endocardial activation time. A "U-shaped" activation wavefront was present in 23 patients due to a line of block located anteriorly (n = 12), laterally (n = 8), and inferiorly (n = 3). Patients with a lateral line of block had significantly shorter QRS (P < 0.003) and transseptal durations (P < 0.001), and a longer distance from the LV breakthrough site to the line of block (P < 0.03). Functional behavior of the line of block was demonstrated by a change in its location during asynchronous ventricular pacing at different sites and cycle lengths.

- **Conclusions**: A U-shaped conduction pattern is imposed on the LV activation sequence by a transmural functional line of block located between the LV septum and the lateral wall, with a prolonged activation time. Assessment of functional block is facilitated by noncontact mapping, which may be useful for identifying and targeting specific locations that are optimal for the intervention.

### Risk and predictors of dyssynchrony cardiomyopathy in left bundle branch block with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [^112gJyRs]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

This study was approved by the institutional investigational review board. We obtained subjects by screening our ECG database from September 2011 to September 2012 for all studies in which left bundle branch block (LBBB) was included in the official interpretation. This time period represents the earliest computerized tracings for review in our database to ensure a long follow-up period. The ECG was analyzed for evidence of an LBBB using conventional criteria that included native QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, broad R waves in leads I, aVL, V5, or V6, and absent q waves in leads I, V5, and V6. Among those with a confirmed LBBB, we reviewed all prior available ECGs to establish the earliest date in which the LBBB was identified for a given subject. This served as time point zero or the start of the follow-up period.

### Predictors of positive electrophysiological study in patients with syncope and bundle branch block: PR interval and type of conduction disturbance [^1145Bfe2]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) is indicated in patients with syncope and bundle branch block (BBB). Data about predictors of positive EPS in these patients is scarce.

- **Objective**: To assess clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) predictors of positive EPS in patients with syncope and BBB.

- **Methods**: This was an observational single-center study that included all consecutive patients with syncope and BBB who underwent EPS from January 2011 to June 2017. Results of EPS were considered positive according to the ESC syncope guidelines.

- **Results**: During the study period, 271 patients were included (64.9% male, age: 73.9 ± 12.2 years, number of syncopal episodes: 2.4 ± 2.5, LVEF: 56.1 ± 9.9%). Type of BBB: RBBB+LAFB/LPFB in 39.8%, isolated LBBB in 38.7%, and isolated RBBB in 18.5% of the patients. Duration of QRS and PR interval were 141.9 ± 16.7 and 182.8 ± 52.2 milliseconds. EPS was positive in 41.7% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, conduction disturbance pattern and long PR interval (OR 8.6; 2.9–25; P < 0.0001) were predictors of positive EPS. Conduction disturbance patterns related with positive EPS were: BBB different than isolated RBBB (OR 15.2; 2.2–23.4; P = 0.005), LBBB or RBBB+long PR+left fascicular block (OR 4.5; 1.06–20.01; P < 0.042), and RBBB+left fascicular block compared with LBBB (OR 4.8; 1.2–16.7; P = 0.025). Clinical factors and syncope characteristics were not related to EPS result.

- **Conclusions**: Diagnostic yield of EPS in patients with syncope and BBB is moderate (41%). Type of conduction disturbance pattern and PR interval are associated with the electrophysiological study results.

### Electrocardiography in athletes: Normal and abnormal findings [^11325qnJ]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Many sporting organisations recommend a pre-participation ECG to screen for disorders which predispose individuals to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The ability of the ECG to perform accurately is dependent on both the ECG criteria used and the experience of the operator. Over the last decade, there have been several ECG criteria, though these were recently superseded by the publication of the "International Consensus Criteria for ECG Interpretation in Athletes". These criteria employ the latest evidence to improve specificity while maintaining sensitivity for ECG-detectable pathologies associated with SCA. Accordingly, this review describes the normal, borderline, and abnormal ECG findings in an asymptomatic athlete aged 12–35 years.

### Cardiac conduction disorders due to acquired or genetic causes in young adults: A review of the current literature [^115mtXYV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Young patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of CCDs may have concealed heart or undiagnosed extracardiac diseases. A comprehensive diagnostic workup for those requiring a pacemaker at an early age could help identify these underlying conditions, stratifying risk for adverse outcomes and guiding therapeutic strategies. Figure 2 summarizes the diagnostic workup in young patients with CCD.

- **Figure 2**: Flow chart for management of young patients with CCD.

CCD indicates cardiac conduction disorders. In young adults, CCDs can present asymptomatically or with a range of symptoms, including syncope, dizziness, fatigue, heart failure, and, in rare cases, sudden cardiac death (SCD). Accurate diagnosis involves correlating symptoms with rhythm disturbances through detailed history-taking, physical exams, and noninvasive tests like 12-lead ECGs, 24-hour Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and implantable loop recorders. A holistic assessment is essential to identify extracardiac conditions that may contribute to CCDs, such as myotonic dystrophies and Kearns–Sayre syndrome.

Electrophysiological studies are not frequently used in these cases. Indeed, the interpretation of a 12-lead ECG and a 24-hour Holter monitor is often sufficient to identify and classify conduction disturbances. However, in certain scenarios, electrophysiological studies may be essential. One such case may be borderline atrioventricular conduction disturbances in patients with ambiguous or unclear symptoms where intracardiac recordings can further differentiate between supra-Hisian, intra-Hisian, and infra-Hisian blocks.

### Low lead one ratio predicts clinical outcomes in left bundle branch block [^1164xGBH]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

We evaluated the association between a novel electrocardiographic (ECG) marker of late, rightward electrocardiographic forces, termed the lead one ratio (LOR), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial scar, and clinical outcomes in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB).

- **Methods and results**: LOR was calculated in patients with LBBB from a derivation cohort (n = 240), and receiver operator characteristic curves identified optimal threshold values for predicting myocardial scar and LVEF less than 35%. An independent validation cohort of patients with LBBB (n = 196) was used to test the association of LOR with the myocardial scar, LVEF, and the likelihood of death, heart transplant, or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. The optimal thresholds in the derivation cohort were LOR less than 13.7 for identification of scar (sensitivity 55%, specificity 80%) and LOR less than 12.1 for LVEF less than 35% (sensitivity 49%, specificity 80%). In the validation cohort, LOR less than 13.7 was not associated with scar size or presence (P > 0.05 for both). LOR less than 12.1 was associated with lower LVEF (30 [20–40] versus 40 [25–55]%; P = 0.002) and predicted LVEF less than 35% in univariable (odds ratio [OR], 2.2 [1.2–4.1]; P = 0.01) and multivariable analysis (OR, 2.2 [1.2–4.3]; P = 0.02). LOR less than 12.1 was associated with scar presence when patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy were excluded (OR = 7.2 [1.5–33.2]; P = 0.002). LOR less than 12.1 had an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.53 ([1.05–2.21]; P = 0.03) for death, transplant, or LVAD implantation.

### Beyond conduction impairment: Unveiling the profound myocardial injury in left bundle branch block [^1132iirE]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Low credibility.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) represents a frequently encountered conduction system disorder. Despite its widespread occurrence, a continual dilemma persists regarding its intricate association with underlying cardiomyopathy and its pivotal role in the initiation of dilated cardiomyopathy. The pathologic alterations linked to LBBB-induced cardiomyopathy (LBBB-CM) have remained elusive.

- **Objective**: This study sought to investigate the chronologic dynamics of LBBB to left ventricular dysfunction and the pathologic mechanism of LBBB-CM.

- **Methods**: An LBBB model was established through main left bundle branch trunk ablation in 14 canines. All LBBB dogs underwent transesophageal echocardiography and electrocardiography before ablation, and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after LBBB induction. Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging was performed at 12 months. Hearts were then harvested from all LBBB dogs and 14 healthy adult dogs as normal controls for anatomic observation, Purkinje fiber staining, histologic staining, and connexin43 protein expression quantitation.

- **Results**: LBBB induction caused significant fibrotic changes in the endocardium and mid-myocardium. Purkinje fibers exhibited fatty degeneration, vacuolization, and fibrosis, along with downregulated connexin43 protein expression. During a 12-month follow-up, left ventricular dysfunction progressively worsened, peaking at the end of the observation period. The association between myocardial dysfunction, hypoperfusion, and fibrosis was observed in the LBBB-afflicted canines.

### Painful left bundle branch block syndrome successfully treated by HIS-bundle pacing [^113GFHAp]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Painful left bundle branch block (LBBB) syndrome is frequently under-recognized by healthcare providers as it is a rare condition. Chest pain from this condition can be quite debilitating. Different modalities of treatment have been tried, with variable responses. These include pharmacological suppression of sinus node activity with beta-blockers to prevent higher rate-related LBBB, or a permanent pacemaker to pace the ventricles from a different site from the left bundle. However, there are no agreed guidelines yet. We noticed a consistent response, with complete resolution of chest pain in cases treated by His-bundle pacing, as reported in five cases in the literature. Reporting this case will increase our awareness of this clinical entity and enhance our evidence about His-bundle pacing as an effective treatment modality for this condition.

### Defining left bundle branch block in the era of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112yh1of]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has emerged as an attractive intervention to improve left ventricular mechanical function by changing the sequence of electrical activation. Unfortunately, many patients receiving CRT do not benefit but are subjected to device complications and costs. Thus, there is a need for better selection criteria. Criteria for CRT eligibility include a QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. However, QRS morphology is not considered, although it can indicate the cause of delayed conduction. Recent studies have suggested that only patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) benefit from CRT, and not patients with right bundle branch block or nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. The authors review the pathophysiologic and clinical evidence supporting why only patients with complete LBBB benefit from CRT. Furthermore, they review how the threshold of 120 ms to define LBBB was derived subjectively at a time when criteria for LBBB and right bundle branch block were mistakenly reversed. Three key studies over the past 65 years have suggested that one-third of patients diagnosed with LBBB by conventional electrocardiographic criteria may not have true complete LBBB, but likely have a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy and left anterior fascicular block. On the basis of additional insights from computer simulations, the investigators propose stricter criteria for complete LBBB that include a QRS duration ≥ 140 ms for men and ≥ 130 ms for women, along with mid-QRS notching or slurring in ≥ 2 contiguous leads. Further studies are needed to reinvestigate.

### Differential clinical characteristics and prognosis of intraventricular conduction defects in patients with chronic heart failure [^111tSWkz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

A clinical phenotype characterized by left ventricular (LV) dilation with markedly depressed systolic function, advanced mitral valve regurgitation, and a history of dilated cardiomyopathy was more often observed in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). In contrast, patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) presented with overt signs of right and left heart failure (HF), more depressed right ventricular (RV) motion at echocardiography, and more frequently reported a history of coronary heart disease. Patients with left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) showed intermediate degrees of structural LV derangements with respect to LBBB and RBBB, although they still presented marked signs of left and right HF and advanced New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Patients free of intraventricular conduction defects (IVCDs) were more often women with less enlarged left ventricles and less depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), suggesting a predominance of a diastolic rather than a systolic dysfunctional substrate.

The clinical-ECG associations described in this study have not been previously recognized due to the lack of studies analyzing more than two IVCDs in the same cohort. Not all studies assessing the prognosis of both LBBB and RBBB in the same series of patients have provided echocardiographic information. Moreover, specific data on relevant structural cardiac features such as LV mass, LV diameter, or left atrial (LA) size, or resynchronization therapies were not reported in these studies. However, specific findings such as the observation of more advanced mitral valve regurgitation in patients with LBBB in one study, or the higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction in HF patients with RBBB reported in three studies, add valuable insights.

### Trifascicular block progressing to complete AV block on exercise: A rare presentation demonstrating the usefulness of exercise testing [^115N8aVL]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man presented with dyspnoea and giddiness on exertion for the last month. A resting ECG showed trifascicular block with complete right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and a prolonged PR interval of greater than 0.24 seconds. His echocardiography showed no evidence of wall motion abnormality. He underwent a treadmill test for exercise-induced ischaemia, which revealed complete atrioventricular (AV) block during the first stage of the Bruce protocol, reproducing his symptoms of dyspnoea and giddiness. The test was terminated, and the ECG returned to trifascicular block, similar to his baseline ECG during recovery. A coronary angiogram (CAG) was performed to rule out any ischaemic cause for the exercise-induced AV block, which was normal. Given his reproducible symptoms and the demonstration of complete AV block during exercise, a dual-chamber pacemaker (DDD) was implanted. His symptoms disappeared, and he remained asymptomatic on follow-up.

### Endocardial or epicardial ventricular tachycardia in nonischemic cardiomyopathy? The role of 12-lead ECG criteria in clinical practice [^115QNWC7]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Specific 12-lead ECG criteria have been reported to predict an epicardial site of origin (SoO) of induced ventricular tachycardias (VTs) in left ventricular nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to (1) determine the value of ECG criteria to predict an epicardial SoO of clinically documented VTs, (2) analyze the effect of VT cycle length (CL) and antiarrhythmic drugs on the accuracy of ECG criteria, and (3) assess interobserver variability.

- **Methods**: In 36 consecutive patients with nonischemic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (age 58 ± 16 years, 75% male) who underwent combined endocardial/epicardial VT ablation, all clinically documented and induced right bundle branch block VTs were analyzed for previously reported ECG criteria to determine the SoO, as defined by ≥ 11/12 pace-map, concealed entrainment, and/or VT termination during ablation.

- **Results**: In 21 patients with clinically documented (25 mm/s) right bundle branch block VT, none of the ECG criteria differentiated between patients with and those without an epicardial SoO. In induced VTs (100 mm/s), 2 of 4 interval criteria differentiated between an endocardial and epicardial SoO for slow VTs (CL > 350 ms) and 2 of 4 criteria in patients on amiodarone, but none for fast VTs (CL ≤ 350 ms) or patients off amiodarone. The Q wave in lead I was the most accurate criterion for an epicardial SoO (sensitivity 88%, specificity 80%). In both clinically documented and induced VTs, interobserver agreement was poor for pseudodelta wave and moderate for other criteria.

### Cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease [^116WTqmz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Lyme carditis is an uncommon manifestation of Lyme disease. Most cases present with heart block of varying degrees, but the spectrum of disease includes other transient arrhythmias and structural manifestations, such as myopericarditis or cardiomyopathy. Antibiotics hasten the resolution of Lyme carditis, and cardiac pacing can be an adjunctive therapy. Outcomes are generally good, but there are rare fatalities associated with Lyme carditis, underscoring the continued need for improved modes of prevention of Lyme disease and the importance of its early recognition and treatment.
