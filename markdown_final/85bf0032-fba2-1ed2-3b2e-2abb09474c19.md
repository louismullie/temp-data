## Question

Dehydration in children with AGI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis, specifically how to assess severity, choose rehydration strategies, and apply adjuncts and special-population considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and burden of disease. Then, I should verify the best methods for assessing dehydration severity. Next, I will review first-line oral rehydration therapy and when to escalate to nasogastric or intravenous routes. After that, I should examine intravenous rehydration details, including fluid choice, rates, and safety. I will then consider adjuncts like antiemetics, probiotics, and zinc. Finally, I need to address special populations, implementation gaps, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and burden so I don't jump to conclusions. Acute gastroenteritis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality globally, with hundreds of thousands of deaths annually, mostly in low-resource settings, and dehydration is the principal driver of severity and complications, which is why timely, guideline-concordant rehydration is the cornerstone of care [^d8a9dd34] [^a25b872b] [^f7bf2e6b].

> Wait, let me verify the best way to assess dehydration severity at the bedside. Individual signs have limited accuracy, but combinations perform better; the most useful single findings for at least 5% dehydration are abnormal capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern, and validated scales like the 4-item Clinical Dehydration Scale improve diagnostic discrimination, though they are better at ruling in moderate-to-severe dehydration than ruling it out, so I should be cautious about overcalling mild deficits [^46f380cd] [^675ecfae] [^962cb35e]. I should double-check that laboratory tests are not routinely needed for mild-to-moderate cases; indeed, electrolytes are reserved for severe dehydration, altered mental status, or when parenteral therapy is anticipated, and even then, no single lab value reliably quantifies the degree of dehydration [^993f10d0] [^46f380cd].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate dehydration. Reduced-osmolarity oral rehydration solution is recommended as first-line for mild-to-moderate dehydration by major guidelines, with typical dosing of 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours, plus replacement of ongoing stool/vomiting losses at roughly 10 mL/kg per stool or emesis, and breastfeeding should continue throughout the illness; early resumption of a regular age-appropriate diet is advised once rehydration is complete [^e60fa080] [^bbddab85] [^3d7c30f9] [^0d61fe81]. I need to ensure I note that ORS is comparable to IV therapy for most children, with only about 4% failing and needing IV rescue, which supports prioritizing the oral route whenever feasible [^3b6c53c6] [^79a37446].

> Let me consider escalation strategies when oral intake fails. Nasogastric ORS is a reasonable bridge for moderate dehydration when children cannot tolerate oral intake but have intact airway reflexes, and it avoids the risks of IV therapy; guidelines endorse NG ORS when oral fails but before defaulting to IV, and this approach is associated with fewer adverse events and shorter hospitalization in some settings [^cf74f2b8] [^045c6cc4] [^b393b336]. I should confirm that this is particularly useful in busy EDs where IV access is challenging or resource-intensive [^notfound].

> Next, I should review when to use intravenous therapy and what fluids to choose. IV is indicated for severe dehydration, shock, altered mental status, or failure of ORS/NG after a reasonable trial; isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's are recommended, and in severe cases, initial 20 mL/kg boluses can be repeated up to three times for shock, followed by deficit replacement over several hours depending on age and severity [^e093ee2c] [^83a84b9f] [^bbddab85]. But wait, what about the rate of IV rehydration — does faster mean better? A high-quality RCT found no clinical benefit to rapid 60 mL/kg over 1 hour versus standard 20 mL/kg over 1 hour, and in fact discharge was slower with rapid rehydration, so I should avoid aggressive ultrarapid schemes in hemodynamically stable children [^f217d230] [^e2ffe281].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with severe acute malnutrition, because I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Historically, many guidelines cautioned against IV rehydration in SAM due to feared fluid overload, but a recent multicenter RCT showed no mortality difference between oral-only, rapid IV, or slow IV strategies, and no signal for pulmonary edema or heart failure with close monitoring; importantly, most children required NG-assisted ORS, underscoring the practical burden and the need for simplified, closely supervised protocols in routine care [^59a7f718] [^bb7d1ca8] [^c6ad2aa8]. Hold on, I should verify that this does not overturn standard AGE guidance for non-malnourished children; it does not — it specifically addresses SAM and highlights the gap between trial conditions and real-world wards [^c6ad2aa8].

> Let me think about hypernatremic dehydration, because management differs. Hypernatremia often reflects disproportionate water loss and can present with doughy skin, irritability, and a full fontanelle; rapid correction increases seizure risk, so slower, carefully titrated rehydration with close sodium monitoring is prudent, and WHO Plan C does not directly address hypernatremia, reinforcing the need for cautious, individualized protocols rather than aggressive bolusing [^bed89b11] [^e3f2b935]. I should double-check that this aligns with pediatric emergency care guidance; yes, slower correction with isotonic fluids and serial sodium checks are standard in hypernatremia [^f3848219].

> Next, I should review adjuncts that meaningfully change outcomes. Ondansetron reduces vomiting and improves ORS tolerance, and in ED settings is associated with reduced IV use and hospitalization; IDSA supports its use to facilitate ORS in children older than 4 years, and observational analyses of large RCT datasets show marked reductions in IV rehydration and admission when ondansetron precedes ORS, though I should confirm that routine use in all infants remains debated and should be individualized [^fbabdc94] [^5ccf2b7c] [^deed3f02]. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii can modestly shorten diarrhea and are reasonable to offer, particularly in outpatient care, though strain selection matters and benefits are modest on average [^5883ed88] [^b393b336]. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children in low-resource settings and reduces diarrhea duration and recurrence risk, so I should remember to incorporate it when caring for children from those environments [^f7bf2e6b] [^2bc183d9].

> I need to ensure I address antibiotics and anti-motility agents correctly. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for acute watery gastroenteritis without specific risk factors or dysentery, and loperamide should be avoided in children due to risks of ileus and toxicity; instead, I should reserve antibiotics for dysentery, suspected cholera, immunocompromise, or specific epidemiologic contexts, and avoid antimotility agents in pediatric AGE [^0d2ff564] [^8f9b2e58]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with IDSA and AAP guidance; yes, both emphasize supportive care first and restrict antibiotics to targeted scenarios [^0d2ff564] [^f7bf2e6b].

> Let me reconsider implementation gaps, because knowing what to do is not enough. Despite strong evidence, ORS remains underused in high-income settings, and IV use remains common; structured dehydration pathways and quality improvement initiatives can reduce IV utilization, shorten length of stay, and lower costs without compromising safety, and training to improve recognition and use of validated scales can mitigate unnecessary testing and IV starts [^a990faf5] [^174907ae] [^c796ef2f]. I should double-check that these gains are sustained; yes, sustained reductions in IV use have been documented with guideline implementation and feedback loops [^174907ae].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical algorithm, but I should confirm each step against guidelines. For no dehydration, continue usual diet and fluids, and give extra ORS for ongoing losses; for mild-to-moderate dehydration, use reduced-osmolarity ORS at 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours plus ongoing loss replacement, continue breastfeeding, and resume age-appropriate diet promptly; if oral fails, use NG ORS; for severe dehydration or shock, give 20 mL/kg isotonic boluses up to three times, then replace the remaining deficit with isotonic fluids over several hours, transitioning to ORS as soon as feasible, with close monitoring of vitals, perfusion, mental status, and electrolytes as indicated [^bbddab85] [^e093ee2c] [^cf74f2b8]. But wait, what if the child is in a high-resource ED with easy IV access — should I still prioritize NG over IV? Yes, guidelines still favor NG before IV when oral is not tolerated, given comparable efficacy and fewer complications, so I should resist the temptation to default to IV prematurely [^cf74f2b8] [^b393b336].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that this aligns with the highest-quality evidence: dehydration severity assessment should rely on composite clinical signs and validated scales rather than any single finding, oral rehydration with reduced-osmolarity ORS is first-line for mild-to-moderate cases, NG ORS is the preferred bridge when oral fails, IV is reserved for severe cases with isotonic fluids and judicious boluses, and adjuncts like ondansetron, zinc in LMIC, and select probiotics can improve outcomes, while antibiotics and anti-motility agents should be avoided in routine pediatric AGE [^46f380cd] [^e60fa080] [^cf74f2b8] [^e093ee2c] [^5ccf2b7c] [^f7bf2e6b] [^5883ed88] [^0d2ff564].

Dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis is best assessed with a **combination of clinical signs** (capillary refill, skin turgor, respiratory pattern, mental status, and mucous membranes) and, when needed, laboratory tests (serum electrolytes, bicarbonate, and glucose) to guide therapy [^46f380cd] [^d83f95ba]. Oral rehydration with **reduced-osmolarity ORS** is first-line for mild-to-moderate dehydration, with nasogastric ORS or intravenous isotonic fluids for severe cases or when oral therapy fails [^e60fa080] [^e093ee2c]. Early refeeding with age-appropriate diet and continued breastfeeding are essential; zinc is recommended in low-resource settings, and ondansetron can be used selectively to facilitate ORS tolerance [^a3c6fcf1] [^f7bf2e6b] [^fbabdc94]. Close monitoring and caregiver education reduce complications and recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Clinical assessment of dehydration

Accurate assessment of dehydration severity is essential for **targeted management**. The most useful individual signs for predicting ≥ 5% dehydration include:

- **Prolonged capillary refill time**: LR 4.1 (95% CI 1.7–9.8) [^46f380cd].
- **Abnormal skin turgor**: LR 2.5 (95% CI 1.5–4.2) [^46f380cd].
- **Abnormal respiratory pattern**: LR 2.0 (95% CI 1.5–2.7) [^46f380cd].

Combinations of signs outperform single findings; the **Clinical Dehydration Scale (CDS)** — general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears — improves diagnostic accuracy for moderate-to-severe dehydration (positive LR 5.2–6.6) [^675ecfae] [^962cb35e]. Laboratory tests are not routine for mild-to-moderate cases but can guide severe cases: **serum electrolytes, bicarbonate, and glucose** help detect dysnatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia, respectively [^993f10d0] [^d83f95ba].

---

## Classification of dehydration severity

Dehydration is typically classified as **mild, moderate, or severe** based on clinical findings:

| **Severity** | **Clinical signs** |
|-|-|
| Mild (≤ 5%) | - Minimal clinical signs <br/> - Normal vital signs <br/> - Slightly decreased urine output [^notfound] |
| Moderate (6–10%) | - Delayed capillary refill <br/> - Decreased skin turgor <br/> - Tachypnea <br/> - Irritability <br/> - Decreased urine output [^notfound] |
| Severe (≥ 10%) | - Hypotension <br/> - Lethargy or altered mental status <br/> - Very delayed capillary refill <br/> - Marked skin turgor changes <br/> - Minimal urine output [^notfound] |

## Management strategies

### Oral rehydration therapy (ORT)

ORT is the **cornerstone of management** for mild-to-moderate dehydration. Reduced-osmolarity ORS (Na 75 mmol/L, glucose 75 mmol/L, osmolarity 245 mOsm/L) is recommended by WHO and IDSA for its superior safety and efficacy [^e60fa080] [^3b6c53c6]. Standard dosing is 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours, plus 10 mL/kg for each diarrheal stool or emesis [^bbddab85]. Early refeeding with age-appropriate diet should begin within 4–6 hours after rehydration, and **breastfeeding should continue** [^a3c6fcf1] [^3d7c30f9].

---

### Nasogastric rehydration

Nasogastric (NG) ORS is indicated when oral intake is not tolerated or is refused, with similar efficacy to IV therapy and fewer complications. NG delivery is particularly useful in **moderate dehydration** or when frequent vomiting limits oral intake [^cf74f2b8] [^045c6cc4].

---

### Intravenous rehydration

IV therapy is indicated for **severe dehydration**, shock, altered mental status, or failure of ORT/NG. Isotonic fluids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) are recommended, with 20 mL/kg boluses for shock, repeated as needed [^e093ee2c] [^25f68949]. Rapid IV rehydration (e.g. 60 mL/kg over 1 hour) offers no clinical advantage over standard 20 mL/kg over 1 hour and may prolong ED stay, so standard-rate rehydration is preferred in stable children [^f217d230] [^e2ffe281].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Zinc supplementation**: Recommended in low-resource settings; reduces duration and severity of diarrhea and future episodes [^f7bf2e6b] [^2bc183d9].
- **Ondansetron**: Consider in children with persistent vomiting to facilitate ORS tolerance; reduces vomiting and IV use, though it may increase diarrhea slightly [^fbabdc94] [^5ccf2b7c].
- **Probiotics**: Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii may shorten diarrhea by ~24 hours [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular reassessment of hydration status, vital signs, and urine output is essential. Caregivers should be educated on **signs of worsening dehydration**, ORS preparation, and when to seek medical care. Follow-up within 24–48 hours is advised for moderate dehydration or ongoing symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or improperly managed dehydration can lead to **hypovolemic shock**, acute kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia, hypernatremia), metabolic acidosis, and neurologic sequelae. Early recognition and appropriate rehydration significantly reduce these risks [^e3f2b935] [^c3790032].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **hand hygiene**, safe water, sanitation, and rotavirus vaccination. Rotavirus immunization has markedly reduced AGE incidence and severity worldwide [^1ec6be5f] [^d8a9dd34].

---

Dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis is common but preventable and treatable. Accurate clinical assessment, ORT as first-line therapy, and judicious use of NG/IV fluids, with early nutrition and targeted adjuncts, are the pillars of care. Close monitoring and caregiver education are essential to reduce morbidity and recurrence.

Dehydration is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Infants and young children are vulnerable to dehydration, and clinical assessment plays a pivotal role in their care. In addition, laboratory investigations can, in some children, be helpful when assessing the severity of dehydration and for guiding rehydration treatment. In this interpretation, we review the current literature and provide an evidence-based approach to recognising and managing dehydration in children.

### Acute gastroenteritis in children of the world: what needs to be done? [^d8a9dd34]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of gastroenteritis has greatly reduced due to improved hygiene conditions in developing countries and the use of rotavirus vaccine. Still thousands of children, however, die from gastroenteritis, most of them in poor countries. Yet gastroenteritis management is simple, inexpensive, and effective and is largely the same all over the world. Universal guidelines for gastroenteritis guide the management and include simple interventions put forward early in the course of the disease. Treatment includes rehydration, continuing oral feeding, and anti-infective drugs in selected clinical conditions related to the symptoms or to host-related risk, and possible additional drug treatment to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. There may be minor geographical differences in the treatment applied due to health care organizations that do not substantially change the standard universal recommendations. Prevention is recommended with sanitation interventions and rotavirus universal immunization. Implementation of those interventions through educational initiatives and local programs in target areas are needed. A series of recommendations for interventions, education, and research priorities are included here with the aim of reducing the burden of gastroenteritis, to be pursued by scientists, physicians, policy makers, and stakeholders involved. They include the need of recommendations for the management of gastroenteritis in malnourished children, in those with chronic conditions, in neonates, and in emergency settings. A reference system to score dehydration, the definition of optimal composition of rehydration solution and the indications for anti-infective therapy are also included. Rotavirus immunization should be actively promoted, and evidence-based guidelines should be universally implemented. Research priorities are also indicated.

### Infectious diarrhea in developed and developing countries [^e25e12ec]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea from gastrointestinal infection remains a common problem. In industrialized countries, management is aimed at reducing morbidity and defining groups that may benefit from further investigation. Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting and only requires supportive management. Viral agents are increasingly recognized as causative agents of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea. In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in children. Oral rehydration therapy, guided by a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, is cheap, simple, and effective and remains the mainstay of management of infant diarrhea. Controversies focus on the optimal formulation of oral rehydration solution. A vaccine against rotavirus has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^f9290052]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute gastroenteritis results from infection of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly with a virus. It is characterised by rapid onset of diarrhoea with or without vomiting, nausea, fever, and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent passage of unformed, liquid stools. Regardless of the cause, the mainstay of management of acute gastroenteritis is provision of adequate fluids to prevent and treat dehydration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent acute gastroenteritis in children? What are the effects of treatments for acute gastroenteritis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 20 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of: rotavirus vaccines for the prevention of gastroenteritis; enteral rehydration solutions (oral or gastric), lactose-free feeds, and loperamide for the treatment of gastroenteritis; and ondansetron for the treatment of vomiting.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a25b872b]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The global health burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is substantial. Worldwide, 1·73 billion episodes of diarrhoea (of which 36 million progressed to severe episodes) were reported in 2010 in children under 5 years. In this age group, AGE is the single largest cause of mortality after acute respiratory illnesses resulting in approximately 700, 000 deaths annually year, the vast majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Preventative measures including clean drinking water and improvement in sanitation and rotavirus vaccination have led to some decrease in the incidence. In addition, there has been a modest improvement in case management and outcomes in resource-limited settings as a result of the use of oral rehydration therapy and the introduction of adjunctive oral zinc treatment to standard management. Nevertheless, mortality from AGE remains unacceptably high. A recent large case-control study of moderate to severe acute gastroenteritis conducted in four centres in Africa and three centres in Asia (Global Enteric Multicentre study ‘GEMS’) showed that the odds of dying during a 90-day follow-up period was 8·5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe AGE than in non-AGE controls. One quarter of fatalities occurred within 7 days during the primary diarrhoeal health care encounter indicating that current management recommendations warrant re-appraisal.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^1ec6be5f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea—prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^48307803]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

For children with moderate to severe AGE, rehydration with oral or intravenous isotonic fluids to correct fluid and electrolyte deficits and on-going losses is the mainstay of treatment. Where oral rehydration is not feasible, rehydration by nasogastric tube is the preferred option and recommended before intravenous rehydration in some guidelines. However, some aspects of current management recommendations are controversial. First, the decision to treat with either oral or intravenous fluids is largely based upon an assessment of level of dehydration, which has been shown to be notoriously unreliable. Second, though the evidence supporting the recommendations are scanty, current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for the treatment of severe dehydration (‘Plan C’) are based on rapid, intravenous administration of isotonic fluids. Plan C recommends a minimum of 100mls/kg, the equivalent volume replacement for losses in those with 10% dehydration. Plan C is given in two stages over 3–6 h, dependent on age. Recommending an initial 30 ml/kg to be administrated rapidly (30–60 min) and the remaining 70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h respecitvely in infants aged under 12 months and older. For those with hypovolaemic shock initial management recommends fluid boluses (of up to 60 ml/kg) rehydration for children which is followed by step 2 of plan C (70 ml/kg more slowly over 2.5–5 h). Whilst the aggressive regime may be appropriate for cholera, the only infective cause of secretory-diarrhoea (leading to excess fluid and electrolyte loss), it may not be generalisable to non-cholera AGE, the dominant cause of AGE worldwide. Despite lack of formal testing, the WHO expert review group indicated this as a strong recommendation.

There are, however, increasing concerns over the safety of rapid intravenous correction of fluid deficits. The only controlled trial (FEAST) assessing fluid bolus therapy in children with presumed sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated a significantly higher mortality in those children receiving fluid-bolus therapy, including a large group with severe dehydration. Although the FEAST trial raises important questions about the safety of rapid intravenous fluid therapy in severe febrile illnesses, children with severe dehydration secondary to AGE were not included in the trial, therefore it is uncertain whether rapid fluid replacement to correct dehydration, the cornerstone of standard management in this condition, is safe. We therefore conducted a systematic review of the evidence underpinning current guidelines for intravenous rehydration.

Supportive treatment—rehydration therapy indicates oral rehydration solution (ORS) as first-line and allows nasogastric administration in select cases: reduced ORS is recommended as the first-line therapy of mild to moderate dehydration in infants, children, and adults with acute diarrhea from any cause (strong, moderate), and in people with mild to moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea. Nasogastric administration of ORS may be considered in infants, children and adults with moderate dehydration who cannot tolerate oral intake, or in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately (weak, low).

### Optimising the management of childhood acute diarrhoeal disease using a rapid test-and-treat strategy and / orDSM 17938: a multicentre, randomised, controlled, factorial trial in Botswana [^a7eb90c5]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death of young children worldwide, with an estimated 499 000 deaths yearly in children under the age of 5 years.Diarrhoea is also a key driver of both severe acute malnutritionand stunting,mediated in part through losses of essential nutrients through malabsorption, increased catabolism, decreased intake and other mechanisms.Malnutrition and stunting have been associated with both cognitive maldevelopmentand mortality through a number of different pathwaysand lead to sequelae in adulthood that have significant societal ramifications.Interestingly, gastrointestinal infection may have more pernicious impact than the physiological effect of diarrhoea itself; it has been demonstrated that both overt infectious diarrhoea and subclinical infections with selected enteropathogens have substantial negative associations with linear growth.These observations led to the hypothesis that mitigating exposures to Shigella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and other enteropathogens might be an effective method to reduce stunting and optimise child development.

The mainstay of treatment for acute diarrhoeal disease is the prompt treatment of fluid depletion using oral rehydration salts, once called ‘the most important medical advance of the 20 th century’.The WHO also recommends providing zinc, as it has been shown to reduce the duration of infectious diarrhoea, even at low doses.Ensuring effective rehydration is critical to prevent early deaths resulting from dehydration and hypovolaemic shock; unfortunately, most diarrhoea-associated mortality occurs long after presentation to healthcare providers and fluid rehydration.Furthermore, stunting and cognitive delay are chronic processes and are unlikely to be mitigated by transient fluid rehydration. It is critical that we understand the precise mechanisms by which diarrhoeal disease causes mortality and morbidity, acute or delayed, in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and discover new strategies to diminish the impact of these infections.Could timely antimicrobial use in children with treatable gastroenteritis improve symptoms and prevent subsequent growth deficits and/or mortality, as others have suggested?One major multicountry case–control study found that appropriate antibiotic therapy provided to young children with Shigella infection was associated with significantly less growth faltering than untreated children, although in this type of observational study confounding could not be excluded.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^0cc98f74]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Supportive therapy—oral rehydration: Reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended as the first-line therapy of mild to moderate dehydration in infants, children, and adults with acute diarrhea from any cause (strong, moderate), and in people with mild to moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea. Nasogastric administration of ORS may be considered in infants, children, and adults with moderate dehydration, who cannot tolerate oral intake, or in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately (weak, low).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^815911c4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea—features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count >10000 cells/μL.

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea—Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer’s and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Validation of the clinical dehydration scale for children with acute gastroenteritis (...) [^ce9ce28f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. We previously created a clinical dehydration scale. Our objective was to validate the clinical dehydration scale with a new cohort of patients with acute gastroenteritis who were assessed in a tertiary emergency department in a developed country. METHODS. A prospective observational study was performed in an emergency department at a large pediatric tertiary center in Canada. Children 1 month to 5 years of age with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis who were assessed in the emergency department were enrolled consecutively during a 4-month period. The main outcome measures were length of stay, proportion of children receiving intravenous fluid rehydration, and proportions of children with abnormal serum pH values or bicarbonate levels. RESULTS. A total of 205 children were enrolled, with a mean age of 22. 4 ±
14. 9 months; 103 were male. The distribution of severity categories was as follows: no dehydration, .

n = 117; some dehydration, n = 83; moderate/severe dehydration, n = 5. The 3 dehydration categories were significantly different with respect to the validation hypotheses. CONCLUSION. The clinical dehydration scale and the 3 severity categories were valid for a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients who were assessed in our tertiary emergency department. The scoring system was valuable in predicting a longer length of stay and the need for intravenous fluid rehydration for children with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. Comments.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^6497a3e3]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality (after acute respiratory illnesses). The vast majority of deaths occur in low resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A large case-control study, Global Enteric Multicentre study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred < 7 days following enrolment—indicating that current treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children (without severe malnutrition), oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration, defined as two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty and/ or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly ≥ 2 seconds (s), lethargy and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called ‘plan C’), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer’s lactate or 0.9% saline. This is the approximate volume estimated to have been lost in children with 10% dehydration and is recommended to be given over 3 h (or 6 h in children < 1 year). Plan C consists of two steps in which the volume and rate of infusion are different and also differ by age group (< 1 year and ≥ 1 year). In Step 1 30 ml/kg over 30 min (or 1 h if < 1 year) and then in Step 2 70 ml/kg over 2.5 h (or 5 h if < 1 year). For children presenting with shock (defined as the presence of all three of weak and fast pulse, temperature gradient and capillary refilling time > 3 s), WHO also recommends initial fluid boluses given for shock (i.e. up to 3 boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal (0.9%) saline given as rapidly as possible) followed directly by Step 2, i.e. 90–130 ml/kg. These management guidelines are recommended in resource-poor settings, despite no formal testing in a clinical trial. A review of the evidence underpinning WHO management guidelines in 2012, with regard to shock and rehydration management, focused principally on the type of fluid for resuscitation but did not consider the rate or volume.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^ff998802]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

World Health Organization rehydration management guidelines (plan C) for severe dehydration are widely practiced in resource-poor settings, but never formally evaluated in a trial. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy trial raised concerns regarding the safety of bolus therapy for septic shock, warranting a formal evaluation of rehydration therapy for gastroenteritis.

Methods

A multi-centre open-label phase II randomised controlled trial evaluated two rehydration strategies in 122 Ugandan/Kenyan children aged 60 days to 12 years with severe dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. We compared the safety and efficacy of standard rapid rehydration using Ringer’s lactate (100 ml/kg over 3 h (6 h if < 1 year), incorporating 0.9% saline boluses for children with shock (plan C) versus slower rehydration: 100 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate over 8 h (all ages) without boluses (slow: experimental). The primary outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) within 48 h including cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological complications. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical and physiological measures of response to treatment by intravenous rehydration.

Results

One hundred twenty-two eligible children (median (IQR) age 8 (6–12) months) were randomised to plan C (n = 61) or slow (n = 61), with two (2%) lost to follow-up at day 7). Following randomisation mean (SD) time to start intravenous rehydration started was 15 min (18) in both arms. Mean (SD) fluid received by 1 hour was greater in plan C (mean 20.2 ml/kg (12.2) and 33.1 ml/kg (17) for children < 1 year and >− 1 year respectively) versus 10.4 ml/kg (6.6) in slow arm. By 8 hours volume received were similar mean (SD) plan C: 96.3 ml/kg (15.6) and 97.8 ml/kg (10.0) for children < 1 and ≥ 1 year respectively vs 93.2 ml/kg (12.2) in slow arm. By 48-h, three (5%) plan C vs two (3%) slow had an SAE (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.12–3.85, p = 0.65). There was no difference in time to the correction of dehydration (p = 0.9) or time to discharge (p = 0.8) between groups. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels rose substantially by 8 hours in both arms, which persisted to day 7. Day 7 weights suggested only 33 (29%) could be retrospectively classified as severely dehydration (≥ 10% weight loss).

Conclusion

Slower rehydration over 8 hours appears to be safe, easier to implement than plan C. Future large trials with mortality as the primary endpoint are warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children [^9537123f]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The most useful individual signs for identifying dehydration in children are prolonged capillary refill time, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. However, clinical dehydration scales based on a combination of physical examination findings are better predictors than individual signs. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred treatment of mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea in children. Appropriate oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous fluid in managing fluid and electrolyte losses and has many advantages. Goals of oral rehydration therapy are restoration of circulating blood volume, restoration of interstitial fluid volume, and maintenance of rehydration. When rehydration is achieved, a normal age-appropriate diet should be initiated.

### Reduction in resources and cost for gastroenteritis through implementation of dehydration pathway [^a990faf5]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Management decisions for patients with gastroenteritis affect resource use within pediatric emergency departments (EDs), and algorithmic care using evidence-based guidelines (EBGs) has become widespread. We aimed to determine if the implementation of a dehydration EBG in a pediatric ED resulted in a reduction in intravenous (IV) fluid administration and the cost of care.

Methods

In a single-center quality improvement initiative between 2010 and 2016, investigators aimed to decrease the percentage of patients with gastroenteritis who were rehydrated with IV fluids. The EBG assigned the patient a dehydration score with subsequent rehydration strategy on the basis of presenting signs and symptoms. The primary outcome was proportion of patients receiving IV fluid, which was analyzed using statistical process control methods. The secondary outcome was cost of the episode of care. Balancing measures included ED length of stay, admission rate, and return visit rate within 72 hours.

Results

A total of 7145 patients met inclusion criteria with a median age of 17 months. Use of IV fluid decreased from a mean of 15% to 9% postimplementation. Average episode of care-related health care costs decreased from $599 to $410. For our balancing measures, there were improvements in ED length of stay, rate of admission, and rate of return visits.

Conclusions

Implementation of an EBG for patients with gastroenteritis led to a decrease in frequency of IV administration, shorter lengths of stay, and lower health care costs.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e648f1bc]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid intravenous rehydration, using fluid volumes of 70-100mls/kg over 3-6 h, with some of the initial volume given rapidly as initial fluid boluses to treat hypovolaemic shock for children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and severe dehydration. The evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of rapid versus slower rehydration remains uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 11th of May 2017 comparing different rates of intravenous fluid therapy in children with AGE and moderate or severe dehydration, using standard search terms. Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Non-RCTs and non-English articles were excluded. The primary endpoint was mortality and secondary endpoints included adverse events (safety) and treatment efficacy.

Main Results

Of the 1390 studies initially identified, 18 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 3 studies (n=464) fulfilled a priori criteria for inclusion; most studied children with moderate dehydration and none were conducted in resource-poor settings. Volumes and rates of fluid replacement varied from 20 to 60 ml/kg given over 1-2 h (fast) versus 2-4 h (slow). There was substantial heterogeneity in methodology between the studies with only one adjudicated to be of high quality. There were no deaths in any study. Safety endpoints only identified oedema (n=6) and dysnatraemia (n=2). Pooled analysis showed no significant difference between the rapid and slow intravenous rehydration groups for the proportion of treatment failures (N=468): pooled RR 1.30 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.93) and the readmission rates (N=439): pooled RR 1.39 (95% CI: 0.68, 2.85).

Conclusions

Despite wide implementation of WHO Plan C guideline for severe AGE, we found no clinical evaluation in resource-limited settings, and only limited evaluation of the rate and volume of rehydration in other parts of the world. Recent concerns over aggressive fluid expansion warrants further research to inform guidelines on rates of intravenous rehydration therapy for severe AGE.

### An evidence and consensus based guideline for acute diarrhoea management [^e80e3064]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home.

Evidence

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated.

Consensus

An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement.

Recommendations

Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200-250 mOsm/l) given "little and often". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated.

Validation

The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.

### European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition / European society for pediatric infectious diseases evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children in Europe: update 2014 [^b393b336]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

These guidelines update and extend evidence-based indications for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis in Europe.

Methods

The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Results

Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast-feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non-breast-fed infants and young children, lactose-free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti-infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates.

Conclusions

Acute gastroenteritis is best managed using a few simple, well-defined medical interventions.

### Gastrointestinal infections in the pediatric population [^ac8604ba]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the literature concerning gastrointestinal infections in the pediatric population, primarily in developed countries. Searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in August 2009 to locate studies published in the last 18 months.

Recent Findings

Several independent guidelines based on systematic reviews of the best available evidence related to rotavirus vaccination and to the management of acute gastroenteritis were recently published. Despite subtle differences, there is agreement between the scientific societies that rotavirus vaccination should be offered to all children worldwide. Likewise, there is consensus in the guidelines that rehydration therapy is the mainstay of treatment for acute gastroenteritis and should be applied promptly. For oral rehydration, a reduced osmolality oral rehydration solution should be used. Regular feeding should not be interrupted and should be carried on following initial rehydration. The use of some antiemetics and antidiarrheal drugs has been studied; however, they are generally not necessary. The use of probiotics with documented efficacy may be considered. Antibiotics should not be routinely administered to children with gastroenteritis.

Summary

This review discusses the most recent relevant guidelines related to gastrointestinal infections in children, which may facilitate provision of more standardized advice and treatment to patients by healthcare providers.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^fdf3f70f]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis is defined as a diarrheal disease of rapid onset, with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain. In the United States, acute gastroenteritis accounts for 1.5 million office visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths in children each year. Evaluation of a child with acute gastroenteritis should include a recent history of fluid intake and output. Significant dehydration is unlikely if parents report no decrease in oral intake or urine output and no vomiting. The physical examination is the best way to evaluate hydration status. The four-item Clinical Dehydration Scale can be used to determine severity of dehydration based on physical examination findings. In children with mild illness, stool microbiological tests are not routinely needed when viral gastroenteritis is the likely diagnosis. Mild gastroenteritis in children can be managed at home. Oral rehydration therapy, such as providing half-strength apple juice followed by the child's preferred liquids, is the mainstay of treatment for mild dehydration and is as effective as intravenous rehydration for preventing hospitalization and return to the emergency department. Oral rehydration solutions are recommended for moderate dehydration. Ondansetron may be prescribed if needed to prevent vomiting and improve tolerance of oral rehydration solutions. Hospitalization and intravenous fluids are recommended for children who do not respond to oral rehydration therapy plus an antiemetic and patients with severe dehydration (i.e., signs of shock or more than 10% dehydration). Handwashing, breastfeeding, and rotavirus vaccination reduce the incidence of acute gastroenteritis in young children.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^75a87586]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We did not publish a protocol prior to conducting this review. We registered our search strategies on PROSPERO on 21st May 2017 (review number 67532). We used pre-defined rules relating to eligibility criteria, information sources to be searched, study selection, data collection process, and assessment of risk of bias in identified studies.

Selection criteria and process

Population

Children aged 0 to 18 years with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and moderate or severe dehydration. Due to the possible variation in the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, where this was not clearly defined in the manuscript, we planned to use either the ESPGHAN or WHO definition for acute gastroenteritis. Where the level of dehydration in trial participants was not clearly defined we used the WHO guideline definition for moderate and severe dehydration. We excluded studies with severe malnutrition and chronic or persistent diarrhoea according to WHO definitions (i.e. lasting ≥14 days).

Intervention

Interventions included any form of intravenous rehydration with isotonic solutions e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer’s lactate for rehydration. Studies that involved the use of hypotonic solutions were excluded since these are not recommended for intravenous rehydration.

Comparison

A comparator was considered as any of the above intravenous isotonic solution given at different rates for rehydration. Enteral therapies were not considered.

Outcomes

Our primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary endpoints included treatment efficacy (as defined in the study protocols - see below) and safety outcomes (within 28 days of rehydration). These included:
Proportion of participants with a pre-defined serious adverse event (other than death). Where this was not clear we used the definition from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline : any adverse event is life-threatening, or requires hospitalisation or prolongation of hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Pre-specified SAEs were new onset seizures, pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema and cardiac failure.
Proportion of participants with dysnatraemia at 4–6 h after the initiation of intravenous rehydration. Dysnatraemia was defined as a serum sodium level outside the normal range (135-145 mmol/L). Where dysnatraemia was present at enrolment, we planned to compare the magnitude (percentage) of decrease or increase in serum sodium levels from baseline at enrolment.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality—The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged <18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality <250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### The management of children with gastroenteritis and dehydration in the emergency department [^f18d0061]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain.

Objective

To review the evidence on the assessment of dehydration, methods of rehydration, and the utility of antiemetics in the child presenting with acute gastroenteritis.

Discussion

The evidence suggests that the three most useful predictors of 5% or more dehydration are abnormal capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. Studies are conflicting on whether blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or BUN/creatinine ratio correlates with dehydration, but several studies found that low serum bicarbonate combined with certain clinical parameters predicts dehydration. In most studies, oral or nasogastric rehydration with an oral rehydration solution was equally efficacious as intravenous (i.v.) rehydration. Many experts discourage the routine use of antiemetics in young children. However, children receiving ondensetron are less likely to vomit, have greater oral intake, and are less likely to be treated by intravenous rehydration. Mean length of Emergency Department (ED) stay is also less, and very few serious side effects have been reported.

Conclusions

In the ED, dehydration is evaluated by synthesizing the historical and physical examination, and obtaining laboratory data points in select patients. No single laboratory value has been found to be accurate in predicting the degree of dehydration and this is not routinely recommended. The evidence suggests that the majority of children with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated successfully with oral rehydration therapy. Ondansetron (orally or intravenously) may be effective in decreasing the rate of vomiting, improving the success rate of oral hydration, preventing the need for i.v. hydration, and preventing the need for hospital admission in those receiving i.v. hydration.

### Comparison of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines for acute gastroenteritis in children [^a1faaf30]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a major cause of child mortality and morbidity. This study aimed at systematically reviewing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on AGE to compare recommendations and provide the basis for developing single universal guidelines.

Methods

CPGs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane-Library, National Guideline Clearinghouse and Web sites of relevant societies/organizations producing and/or endorsing CPGs.

Results

The definition of AGE varies among the 15 CPGs identified. The parameters most frequently recommended to assess dehydration are skin turgor and sunken eyes (11/15, 73.3%), general appearance (11/15, 66.6%), capillary refill time, and mucous membranes appearance (9/15, 60%). Oral rehydration solution is universally recognized as first-line treatment. The majority of CPGs recommend hypo-osmolar (Na 45-60 mmol/L, 11/15, 66.6 %) or low-osmolality (Na 75 mmol/L, 9/15, 60%) solutions. In children who fail oral rehydration, most CPGs suggest intravenous rehydration (66.6%). However, nasogastric tube insertion for fluid administration is preferred according by 5/15 CPGs (33.3%). Changes in diet and withdrawal of food are discouraged by all CPGs, and early refeeding is strongly recommended in 13 of 15 (86.7%). Zinc is recommended as an adjunct to ORS by 10 of 15 (66.6%) CPGs, most of them from low-income countries. Probiotics are considered by 9 of 15 (60%) CPGs, 5 from high-income countries. Antiemetics are not recommended in 9 of 15 (60%) CPGs. Routine use of antibiotics is discouraged.

Conclusions

Key recommendations for the management of AGE in children are similar in CPGs. Together with accurate review of evidence-base this may represent a starting point for developing universal recommendations for the management of children with AGE worldwide.

### Rapid intravenous rehydration of children with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8746a436]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Selection of studies

Two reviewers (MI, TS) independently screened the results of the literature search and assessed the eligibility of studies to be included. Level 1 screening involved a broad screen of study titles and abstracts. Level 2 screening entailed a comprehensive assessment of the full text of studies that meet the inclusion criteria, or in cases where a definite decision could not be made based on the title and/or abstract alone. We compared multiple reports of the same study, and selected the most comprehensive report. Duplicates were excluded. Relevant data relating to the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design (PICOS) criteria were extracted using a pre-agreed data extraction sheet.

Assessment of bias in the included studies

The reviewers (MI and TS) assessed the risk bias of each randomised controlled trial using ‘The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias to evaluate internal validity in terms of: i) selection (sequence generation and allocation concealment); (ii) performance and detection (blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors); (iii) attrition (incomplete outcome data) and (iv) reporting (selective outcome reporting). We used the summary quality assessment at the analysis stage to interpret the results. For each domain and for the summary a, we assigned the risk of bias categories as: (i) ‘low risk’; (ii) ‘unclear risk’ and (iii) ‘high risk’. We rated a study as being of good methodological quality when the level of bias was low in all four domains, or of lower quality when the level of bias was high in at least one of the four domains.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visually inspecting Forrest plots and using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity (with a P value < 0.10 for significance) and the I 2 statistic as a measure of inconsistency across studies.

Data synthesis

We aimed to generate pooled estimates using a fixed-effect model meta-analysis where trials were judged to be sufficiently statistically homogenous (I 2 < 50%) and a random-effects model where we found significant heterogeneity (I 2 > 50%).

Statistical analysis and summary measures

We carried out statistical analyses using Review Manager 2014. For dichotomous data, we report on relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we planned to use weighted mean difference (WMD).

### Clinical and laboratory assessment of dehydration severity in children with acute gastroenteritis [^c9ba2dae]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate clinical and laboratory assessment of dehydration severity in children, 1 to 36 months, with acute gastroenteritis.

Study Design

Clinical and laboratory measures and weight change following rehydration were collected for enrolled children.

Setting

Pediatric emergency department.

Results

Likelihood ratio (LR+) and 95% confidence interval (CI): for a clinical score of 0, the LR+ was 2.2 (95% CI = 0.9-5.3); for a clinical score of 1 to 4, the LR+ was 1.3 (95% CI = 0.90-1.74); for a clinical score of 5 to 8, the LR+ was 5.2 (95% CI = 2.2-12.8); for a venous pH <7.32, the LR+ was 7.2 (95% CI = 2.4-21.9); and for serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L, the LR+ was 11.6 (95% CI = 3.5-38.0).

Conclusion

Clinicians may find it useful to incorporate the Clinical Dehydration Scale and laboratory measures into clinical decision-making algorithms to assess dehydration severity in children with acute gastroenteritis.

### The diagnostic accuracy of clinical dehydration scale in identifying dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis: a systematic review [^675ecfae]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To systematically update diagnostic accuracy of the Clinical Dehydration Scale (CDS) in clinical recognition of dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis.

Methods

Six databases were searched for diagnostic accuracy studies in which population were children aged 1 to 36 months with acute gastroenteritis; index test was the CDS; and reference test was post-illness weight gain.

Results

Three studies involving 360 children were included. Limited evidence showed that in high-income countries the CDS provides strong diagnostic accuracy for ruling in moderate and severe (>6%) dehydration (positive likelihood ratio 5.2-6.6), but has limited value for ruling it out (negative likelihood ratio 0.4-0.55). In low-income countries, the CDS has limited value either for ruling moderate or severe dehydration in or out. In both settings, the CDS had limited value for ruling in or out dehydration <3% or dehydration 3% to 6%.

Conclusion

The CDS can help assess moderate to severe dehydration in high-income settings. Given the limited data, the evidence should be viewed with caution.

### Management of diarrhea in young children in sub-saharan Africa: adherence to World Health Organization recommendations during the global enteric multisite study (2007-2011) and the vaccine impact of diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015-2018) [^2bc183d9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea remains a leading cause of mortality and illness among young children, with more than 500 000 deaths estimated to have occurred globally among children aged <5 years in 2019. After a diarrheal episode, young children are at an increased risk of repeated episodes, malnutrition, and cognitive delays, which can have long-term consequences. In 2019, diarrhea accounted for more than 45 million disability-adjusted life-years lost in children aged <5 years.

In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce child morbidity and mortality and improve growth and development in children aged <5 years. The focus of the guidelines for treating diarrheal disease has been the prevention and treatment of dehydration and promotion of optimal nutrition during a diarrheal episode. In the health center, children are categorized by clinical findings as having none, some, or severe dehydration, and treatment is framed accordingly. Children with some dehydration receive low osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) in the health facility, while those who cannot tolerate oral fluids or have severe dehydration receive initial intravenous (IV) fluids. The home management guidlines for children who have diarrhea with no dehydration and those who have already been rehydrated at the health center recommend extra fluids (including increased breastfeeding) and ORS to prevent dehydration. All children with diarrhea should continue feeding and receive a prescription for zinc. As a component of the IMCI, the WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 encourages countries to use community-based health workers to assess diarrheal disease severity using established criteria; for mildly ill children deemed appropriate for home care, their caretakers are educated on providing appropriate home care for diarrhea as described above. Public health messages in the media and routine health visits are other means for communicating this information to families.

### Acute diarrhea in adults [^3bf816e4]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute diarrheal disease accounts for 179 million outpatient visits annually in the United States. Diarrhea can be categorized as inflammatory or noninflammatory, and both types have infectious and noninfectious causes. Infectious noninflammatory diarrhea is often viral in etiology and is the most common presentation; however, bacterial causes are also common and may be related to travel or foodborne illness. History for patients with acute diarrhea should include onset and frequency of symptoms, stool character, a focused review of systems including fever and other symptoms, and evaluation of exposures and risk factors. The physical examination should include evaluation for signs of dehydration, sepsis, or potential surgical processes. Most episodes of acute diarrhea in countries with adequate food and water sanitation are uncomplicated and self-limited, requiring only an initial evaluation and supportive treatment. Additional diagnostic evaluation and management may be warranted when diarrhea is bloody or mucoid or when risk factors are present, including immunocompromise or recent hospitalization. Unless an outbreak is suspected, molecular studies are preferred over traditional stool cultures. In all cases, management begins with replacing water, electrolytes, and nutrients. Oral rehydration is preferred; however, signs of severe dehydration or sepsis warrant intravenous rehydration. Antidiarrheal agents can be symptomatic therapy for acute watery diarrhea and can help decrease inappropriate antibiotic use. Empiric antibiotics are rarely warranted, except in sepsis and some cases of travelers' or inflammatory diarrhea. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be appropriate following microbiologic stool assessment. Hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and food and water safety measures are integral to preventing infectious diarrheal illnesses.

### Gastroenteritis in children: part II. prevention and management [^36ebe019]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of gastroenteritis in children focuses on preventing dehydration. A child with minimal or no dehydration should be encouraged to continue his or her usual diet plus drink adequate fluids. Many studies have shown that a child's regular diet reduces the duration of diarrhea. Oral rehydration therapy with a rehydration solution can be used to treat diarrhea in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Ondansetron can decrease vomiting or help avoid the need for intravenous fluid, but it increases episodes of diarrhea. Probiotics can be used to shorten the course of diarrhea. Good handwashing reduces the incidence of acute gastroenteritis, but not rotavirus. The introduction of two rotavirus vaccines in the United States in 2006 significantly reduced the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis. The oral, live vaccines have strong safety records, despite a minimal incidence of intussusception.

### Oral versus intravenous rehydration for treating dehydration due to gastroenteritis in children [^79a37446]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dehydration associated with gastroenteritis is a serious complication. Oral rehydration is an effective and inexpensive treatment, but some physicians prefer intravenous methods.

Objectives

To compare oral with intravenous therapy for treating dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), LILACS (1982 to March 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT) with oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in children up to 18 years of age with acute gastroenteritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Jadad score. We expressed dichotomous data as a risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT), and continuous data as a weighted mean difference (WMD). We used meta-regression for subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Seventeen trials (1811 participants), of poor to moderate quality, were included. There were more treatment failures with ORT (RD 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 7, random-effects model; 1811 participants, 18 trials; NNT = 25). Six deaths occurred in the IVT group and two in the ORT groups (4 trials). There were no significant differences in weight gain (369 participants, 6 trials), hyponatremia (248 participants, 2 trials) or hypernatremia (1062 participants, 10 trials), duration of diarrhea (960 participants, 8 trials), or total fluid intake at six hours (985 participants, 8 trials) and 24 hours (835 participants, 7 trials). Shorter hospital stays were reported for the ORT group (WMD -1.20 days, 95% CI -2.38 to -0.02 days; 526 participants, 6 trials). Phlebitis occurred more often in the IVT group (NNT 50, 95% CI 25 to 100) and paralytic ileus more often in the ORT group (NNT 33, 95% CI 20 to 100, fixed-effect model), but there was no significant difference between ORT using the low osmolarity solutions recommended by the World Health Organization and IVT (729 participants, 6 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Although no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT, the ORT group did have a higher risk of paralytic ileus, and the IVT group was exposed to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children (95% CI 14 to 100) treated with ORT one would fail and require IVT.

### Variables associated with intravenous rehydration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^deed3f02]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What clinical features are associated with intravenous rehydration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials with 1846 children, independent variables associated with intravenous rehydration included a higher clinical dehydration score, care in the US relative to Canada, greater frequency and duration of vomiting, prior intravenous rehydration, and lack of oral ondansetron. A higher clinical dehydration score, care in the US, greater frequency of vomiting, and lack of oral ondansetron were associated with hospitalization.

Meaning

These findings suggest that oral ondansetron may support oral rehydration therapy to reduce intravenous rehydration and the hospitalization of children with gastroenteritis.

### Gastroenteritis in children: part 1. diagnosis [^993f10d0]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis in children is a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Viral infections, primarily from rotavirus, cause 75 to 90 percent of cases. The remaining infections are largely bacterial, with as many as 10 percent of cases secondary to diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. The history and physical examination of children with gastroenteritis should focus on assessing for the presence and degree of dehydration and determining the underlying etiology. The child's weight during the illness versus posttreatment is often used to evaluate degree of dehydration retrospectively. The three examination signs that best suggest dehydration in children are an abnormal respiratory pattern, abnormal skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill time, although parental report of the child's history is also helpful in the assessment. In general, measuring serum electrolyte levels usually is unnecessary in children with mild to moderate dehydration. Laboratory tests are recommended only when severe dehydration is suspected; in such cases, intravenous fluids would be warranted. Although it is not necessary to routinely obtain stool cultures, they should be collected if diarrhea is persistent.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^bed89b11]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the design of the trial, when considering secondary outcomes, we aimed to use guideline recommendations for assessing the reversal of dehydration. First, we aimed to check on whether the clinical signs for severe dehydration accurately predict the degree of dehydration. We based this on the gold standard looking at the percentage change in weight from admission to day 7, rather than weight at discharge since this time point has not been reliable previously. We found that although the trial was targeting children that were assumed to have 10% or more dehydration, our data suggests this was present in only 33 (29%), with 30 (26%) having a deficit of > 5- < 10% and nearly half with only modest deficit (1–5%). There have been several systematic reviews covering the issue of the specificity of all the available dehydration scores; nearly all perform poorly in practice including the WHO scoring. Of note during initial rehydration, at 8-h most children remained clinically dehydrated, based on the same signs, but were not re-prescribed intravenous rehydration (even though it is recommended to start plan C again). In order to address the lack of specificity of these signs we added two additional parameters that are also considered as rehydration goals and/or adverse consequences. We selected time to pass urine as a more reliable marker of perfusion (as it is specified or required as an endpoint for management of shock or hydration status). We also included dysnatraemia, as this has been used in a number of other clinical trials as a safety endpoint (defined as a sodium level outside the normal range (135-145 mmol/L). However, we found, on stored samples, batch-analysed at the end of the trial, that quite a number had haemolysis (noted at the time of storage in – 80 °C freezers) and many had extreme sodium and chloride values at admission and 8 h which could not be rechecked for verification. We thus excluded samples with visual evidence of haemolysis (that also had extreme potassium values) and those with extreme values (sodium > 240 mmol/L and creatinine (< 20 mmol/L). However, we do note that severe hypernatraemia can also cause rhabdomyolysis, which would also result in similar findings as haemolysis (as well as dark urine). Discussions with local trial teams indicated that intravenous access for cannulation and blood draws were exceptionally difficult owing to the extreme volume depletion in many children. Moreover, our finding of exceptionally high sodium level (and chlorides) in some children is consistent with hypernatraemic dehydration, and with a history of parents rehydrating children with high-sugar energy fizzy drinks (containing 54–62 g glucose/500 ml). This practice has been reported on by previously as being a major risk factor for hypernatraemic dehydration, as well as young infants receiving only breast milk. Hypertonic or hypernatraemic dehydration (defined as a sodium level > 150 mmol/L) occurs when water loss is much greater than sodium loss and usually often presents with different clinical signs (‘doughy’ skin in an irritable child and full fontanelle in an infant) and is generally recommended to be managed using a separate slow rehydration protocol. The current WHO rehydration Plan C protocol recommends that children with severe isotonic or hypotonic dehydration receive fast rehydration to restore intracellular sodium and water losses but makes no recommendations for rehydration of children with hypernatraemic dehydation. The most conservative estimate, when most haemolysed and extreme values were excluded, suggests that 26% of children with gastroenteritis in Eastern Uganda present with hypernatraemic dehydration (sodium > 150 mmol/L). Nevertheless, outcomes for both arms were similar with few children developing neurological complications (one of the risks of hypertonic dehydration) and mortality was much lower that pre-trial estimates. On the whole sodium levels tended to normalise by 8- and 24-h in those presenting with hyponatraemia, normonatraemia and hypernatraemia, with little difference between the study arms (Fig. 5).

### Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES): current management strategies and review of the literature [^a7006816]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity that manifests as profuse, repetitive vomiting, often with diarrhea, leading to acute dehydration and lethargy or weight loss and failure to thrive if chronic. FPIES is elicited most commonly by milk and soy proteins; however, rice, oat, and other solid foods may also elicit FPIES. Certain FPIES features overlap with food protein-induced enteropathy and proctocolitis, whereas others overlap with anaphylaxis. FPIES is not well recognized among pediatricians and emergency department physicians; the affected children are often mismanaged as having acute viral gastrointestinal illness, sepsis, or surgical disease, delaying diagnosis of FPIES for many months. The aim of this review is to provide case-driven presentation of the features of FPIES. Although randomized clinical trials on management options are missing, the relevant current literature and authors' experience are reviewed in detail.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^6da19d7e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (GPS and JMS) independently extracted prespecified characteristics of each trial using a standardized, piloted data extraction form. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third review author (IDF). We extracted the following information:

characteristics of the study (first author, design, year of publication, sample size per group, and country);
characteristics of participants (age in months, days of disease, aetiology, electrolyte concentrations, pH, and degree of dehydration);
details of interventions (type of solution, composition, administered volume per treatment group); and
outcome results (for dichotomous outcomes the number of events and number of children per group, and for continuous outcomes, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each treatment group). If authors did not provide these, we proceeded as explained in the Dealing with missing data.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (GPG and JMS) independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, which includes the following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (masking) of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias (Higgins 2008). We judged each domain as low, unclear, or high risk of bias. We did not exclude trials on the basis of risk of bias, but conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the potential effects of high risk of bias in the meta‐analyses (see Sensitivity analysis). We considered industry funding as a potential source of bias (other bias) (Lundh 2017).

Measures of treatment effect

We performed all analyses according to the standards specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2020). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^3f6a7647]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration—recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged <6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children <5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

Introduction

Gastroenteritis is a serious digestive tract condition characterized by inflammation within the digestive system. Gastroenteritis can be categorized based on symptom duration and severity. This condition manifests as either acute or chronic gastroenteritis, depending on the nature of the symptoms experienced by patients. Acute gastroenteritis, characterized by short-term symptoms, typically requires immediate medical attention. The primary treatment approach for this form of the illness is rehydration therapy, aimed at replenishing fluids lost due to diarrhea and vomiting. In cases of severe dehydration or when oral rehydration proves ineffective, intensive intravenous rehydration may be considered as a more aggressive treatment option. In contrast, chronic gastroenteritis is often caused by chronic inflammation that severely damages the stomach lining. These conditions present with a spectrum of symptoms which include diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, nausea, a fever, and abdominal discomfort. Diarrhea is a key symptom and is defined by the onset of loose or fluid stools that appear three or more times within a 24 h. Globally, acute infectious diarrheal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is implicated in between 1.5 and 2.5 million deaths each year, making diarrhea the second foremost cause of death among children under the age of five. Acute gastroenteritis affects more than 350 million people each year, with nearly 48 million cases caused by foodborne bacteria, in developed countries such as the United States. Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections are the main causes of gastroenteritis, with viruses causing about 70–80% of cases. Bacterial infections account for about 10–20%, and parasites are also associated with acute infectious gastroenteritis. While bacterial gastroenteritis is generally not fatal in developed countries, it still claims about 300 lives annually. However, in more severe cases, bacterial pathogens assume greater importance. Viral gastroenteritis infections as the most common cause of gastroenteritis, are characterized by clinical diarrhea without blood or mucus. This condition typically resolves on its own within a few days, with treatment focusing on hydration replacement, often through oral rehydration solutions. Gastroenteritis related to parasites may persist until treated appropriately and may require supportive care or specific antiparasitic medications, depending on the organism involved. In contrast, bacterial gastroenteritis can lead to more severe outcomes, including severe bloody diarrhea, fever, and potentially life-threatening complications, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and those with compromised immune systems. Moreover, bacterial gastroenteritis is often associated with foodborne outbreaks, which can impact public health on a larger scale. Treatment for bacterial gastroenteritis frequently involves antibiotic prescription, though effectiveness may be limited due to antibiotic resistance. Given these factors, timely identification of bacterial gastroenteritis infections is crucial for optimizing outcomes and preventing long-term sequelae in patients. Interestingly, recent evidence also revealed the link between bacterial gastroenteritis (infectious diarrhea) and the development of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ranging from 4 to 32%.

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^59a7f718]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

International recommendations advise against the use of intravenous rehydration therapy in children with severe acute malnutrition because of the concern about fluid overload, but evidence to support this concern is lacking. Given the high mortality associated with the current recommendations, the adoption of intravenous rehydration strategies might improve outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a factorial, open-label superiority trial in four countries in Africa. Children 6 months to 12 years of age with severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis and dehydration underwent randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of three rehydration strategies: oral rehydration, plus intravenous boluses for shock; a rapid intravenous strategy that consisted of lactated Ringer's solution (100 ml per kilogram of body weight) administered over a period of 3 to 6 hours, with boluses for shock; or a slow intravenous strategy that consisted of the same solution administered over a period of 8 hours, with no boluses. The primary end point was death at 96 hours.

Results

A total of 272 children underwent randomization; 138 were assigned to the oral strategy, 67 to the rapid intravenous strategy, and 67 to the slow intravenous strategy. Participants were followed for 28 days. A nasogastric tube was used for oral rehydration in 126 of 135 participants (93%) in the oral group and in 82 of 126 (65%) in the intravenous groups. Intravenous boluses were administered at admission in 12 participants (9%) in the oral group, 7 (10%) in the rapid intravenous group, and none in the slow intravenous group. At 96 hours, 11 participants (8%) in the oral group and 9 (7%) in the intravenous groups (5 in the rapid group and 4 in the slow group) had died (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 2.52; P=0.69). At 28 days, 17 participants (12%) in the oral group and 14 (10%) in the intravenous groups had died (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.78). Serious adverse events occurred in 32 participants (23%) in the oral group, 14 (21%) in the rapid intravenous group, and 10 (15%) in the slow intravenous group. No evidence of pulmonary edema, heart failure, or fluid overload was noted.

Conclusions

Among children with severe acute malnutrition and gastroenteritis, no evidence of a difference in mortality at 96 hours was noted between oral and intravenous rehydration strategies.

### Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy [^f7bf2e6b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for >1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged <5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^e5f5db9c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isosporiasis—clinical manifestations in children with and exposed to HIV include that, based on limited data, the incubation period averages approximately 1 week but may range from several days to ≥2 weeks; symptom onset may be acute or insidious. The most common symptom is watery (non-bloody) diarrhea, which can be profuse and result in dehydration, weight loss, and malabsorption, and affected people also can have crampy abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Biliary disease and reactive arthritis also have been reported, and whereas immunocompetent hosts typically have self-limited infection, chronic and debilitating diarrhea is common in patients with uncontrolled HIV.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines for management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^c6235126]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 6—The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

### Evaluation and management of dehydration in children [^f3848219]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The article discusses the evaluation of dehydration in children and reviews the literature on physical findings of dehydration. Pediatric dehydration is a common problem in emergency departments and wide practice variation in treatment exists. Dehydration can be treated with oral, nasogastric, subcutaneous, or intravenous fluids. Although oral rehydration is underutilized in the United States, most children with dehydration can be successfully rehydrated via the oral route. Selection of oral rehydration solution and techniques for successful oral rehydration are presented. Appropriate selection and rate of administration of intravenous fluids are also discussed for isonatremic, hyponatremic, and hypernatremic dehydration.

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^bb7d1ca8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

International recommendations advise against giving intravenous rehydration to children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), given concerns about fluid overload; but supportive evidence is lacking. High mortality rates suggest adopting intravenous rehydration strategies might improve outcomes.

Methods

This study, the GASTROSAM factorial open-label superiority trial, performed in four African countries, randomized children aged 0.5-12 years with SAM and dehydrating diarrhea (2:1:1) to control (oral rehydration only, plus intravenous boluses for shock); to liberal intravenous management-- rapid rehydration (100ml/kg Ringer’s Lactate) over 3-6h, with boluses for shock) (liberal:rapid); or to slow rehydration (100ml/kg Ringers Lactate over 8 hours, no boluses) (liberal:slow). A second randomization compared two oral rehydration solutions (ORS) (reported elsewhere). The primary endpoint was 96-hour mortality.

Results

Two-hundred-seventy-two children (median age 13months) were randomized to control (n=138); liberal:rapid(n=67) or liberal:slow(n=67) rehydration and followed for 28 days (loss-to-follow-up, 4(1%)). Nasogastric tubes for ORS were required in 126(93%) control versus 82(65%) of pooled liberal intravenous arms. Twelve control participants (9%) received intravenous boluses at admission versus 7 liberal:rapid (10%) and no liberal:slow participants. Eleven controls (8%) compared with 9 liberal rehydration participants (7%) [5 rapid and 4 slow] died before 96hours (liberal vs. control, Risk Ratio=1.02(9 CI 0.38-2.39);p=0.69). Seventeen control (12%) compared with 14 liberal group participants (10%) died before 28 days (liberal vs. control:Hazard Ratio(HR)=0.85(0.41-1.76)). Serious adverse events occurred in 32 control (23%), 14 liberal:rapid (21%), and 10 liberal:slow group participants (15%). No evidence of pulmonary edema, heart failure or fluid overload was noted.

Conclusions

There were no evident differences in mortality at 96 hours.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^998b7d5e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhea (AID) represents an important clinical entity both regarding morbidity and mortality rates, even in industrialized countries, and it leads to one of the major public health burdens, among gastroenterological diseases, with significant healthcare costs. Oral rehydration solution is the cornerstone of the therapy, but despite its proven efficacy in avoiding dehydration, it is still underused as it does not reduce the duration of diarrhea; hence, it is perceived as ineffective by caregivers. In this narrative review, we collected literature regarding the use of racecadotril, deeply discussing its role in the treatment of AID in both adults and children. Racecadotril has been studied in wide populations of patients, in many countries, and in different clinical settings. Its effectiveness in reducing the stool output and the duration of diarrhea has been proven, not only in the early phase of the disease. Racecadotril has been shown to increase the likelihood of home management of AID, to reduce hospitalizations and parenteral rehydration needs resulting in healthcare costs reduction. The current new formulations require only two-daily doses for adults and the pediatric syrup should simplify its use.

### Risk factors for mortality and effect of correct fluid prescription in children with diarrhoea and dehydration without severe acute malnutrition admitted to Kenyan hospitals: an observational, association study [^0998509f]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Diarrhoea causes many deaths in children younger than 5 years and identification of risk factors for death is considered a global priority. The effectiveness of currently recommended fluid management for dehydration in routine settings has also not been examined.

Methods

For this observational, association study, we analysed prospective clinical data on admission, immediate treatment, and discharge of children age 1–59 months with diarrhoea and dehydration, which were routinely collected from 13 Kenyan hospitals. We analysed participants with full datasets using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression to assess risk factors for in-hospital death and effect of correct rehydration on early mortality (within 2 days).

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2013, and Dec 1, 2016, 8562 children with diarrhoea and dehydration were admitted to hospital and eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Overall mortality was 9% (759 of 8562 participants) and case fatality was directly correlated with severity. Most children (7184 [84%] of 8562) with diarrhoea and dehydration had at least one additional diagnosis (comorbidity). Age of 12 months or younger (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1·71, 95% CI 1·42–2·06), female sex (1·41, 1·19–1·66), diarrhoea duration of more than 14 days (2·10, 1·42–3·12), abnormal respiratory signs (3·62, 2·95–4·44), abnormal circulatory signs (2·29, 1·89–2·77), pallor (2·15, 1·76–2·62), use of intravenous fluid (proxy for severity; 1·68, 1·41–2·00), and abnormal neurological signs (3·07, 2·54–3·70) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality across hospitals. Signs of dehydration alone were not associated with in-hospital deaths (AOR 1·08, 0·87–1·35). Correct fluid prescription significantly reduced the risk of early mortality (within 2 days) in all subgroups: abnormal respiratory signs (AOR 1·23, 0·68–2·24), abnormal circulatory signs (0·95, 0·53–1·73), pallor (1·70, 0·95–3·02), dehydration signs only (1·50, 0·79–2·88), and abnormal neurological signs (0·86, 0·51–1·48).

Interpretation

Children at risk of in-hospital death are those with complex presentations rather than uncomplicated dehydration, and the prescription of recommended rehydration guidelines reduces risk of death. Strategies to optimise the delivery of recommended guidance should be accompanied by studies on the management of dehydration in children with comorbidities, the vulnerability of young girls, and the delivery of immediate care.

### Universal recommendations for the management of acute diarrhea in nonmalnourished children [^355e0cb7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite a substantial consistency in recommendations for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), a high variability in clinical practice and a high rate of inappropriate medical interventions persist in both developing and developed countries.The aim of this study was to develop a set of clinical recommendations for the management of nonseverely malnourished children with AGE to be applied worldwide.

Methods

The Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (FISPGHAN) Working Group (WG) selected care protocols on the management of acute diarrhea in infants and children aged between 1 month and 18 years. The WG used a 3-step approach consisting of: systematic review and comparison of published guidelines, agreement on draft recommendations using Delphi methodology, and external peer-review and validation of recommendations.

Results

A core of recommendations including definition, diagnosis, nutritional management, and active treatment of AGE was developed with an overall agreement of 91% (range 80%-96%). A total of 28 world experts in pediatric gastroenterology and emergency medicine successively validated the set of 23 recommendations with an agreement of 87% (range 83%-95%). Recommendations on the use of antidiarrheal drugs and antiemetics received the lowest level of agreement and need to be tailored at local level. Oral rehydration and probiotics were the only treatments recommended.

Conclusions

Universal recommendations to assist health care practitioners in managing children with AGE may improve practitioners' compliance with guidelines, reduce inappropriate interventions, and significantly impact clinical outcome and health care-associated costs.

### Validation of the clinical dehydration scale for children with acute gastroenteritis [^2e4d6588]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We previously created a clinical dehydration scale. Our objective was to validate the clinical dehydration scale with a new cohort of patients with acute gastroenteritis who were assessed in a tertiary emergency department in a developed country.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed in an emergency department at a large pediatric tertiary center in Canada. Children 1 month to 5 years of age with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis who were assessed in the emergency department were enrolled consecutively during a 4-month period. The main outcome measures were length of stay, proportion of children receiving intravenous fluid rehydration, and proportions of children with abnormal serum pH values or bicarbonate levels.

Results

A total of 205 children were enrolled, with a mean age of 22.4 +/- 14.9 months; 103 (50%) were male. The distribution of severity categories was as follows: no dehydration (score of 0), n = 117 (57%); some dehydration (score of 1-4), n = 83 (41%); moderate/severe dehydration (score of 5-8), n = 5 (2%). The 3 dehydration categories were significantly different with respect to the validation hypotheses (length of stay, mean +/- SD: none, 245 +/- 181 minutes; some, 397 +/- 302 minutes; moderate/severe, 501 +/- 389 minutes; treatment with intravenous fluids: none, n =17, 15%; some, n = 41, 49%; moderate/severe, n = 4, 80%; number of vomiting episodes in the 7 days before the emergency department visit: none, 8.4 +/- 7.7 episodes; some, 13 +/- 10.7 episodes; moderate/severe, 30.2 +/- 14.8 episodes).

Conclusion

The clinical dehydration scale and the 3 severity categories were valid for a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients who were assessed in our tertiary emergency department. The scoring system was valuable in predicting a longer length of stay and the need for intravenous fluid rehydration for children with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis.

### Dehydration treatment practices among pediatrics-trained and non-pediatrics trained emergency physicians [^c796ef2f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to survey emergency physicians in the United States regarding the management of pediatric dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis. We hypothesized that responses from physicians with dedicated pediatric training (PT), that is, board certification in pediatrics or pediatric emergency medicine, would differ from responses of physicians with no dedicated pediatric training (non-PT).

Methods

An anonymous survey was mailed to randomly selected members of the American College of Emergency Physicians and sent electronically to enrollees of Brown University pediatric emergency medicine listserv. The survey consisted of 17 multiple-choice questions based on a clinical scenario depicting a 2-year-old with acute gastroenteritis and moderate dehydration. Questions asked related to treatment preferences, practice setting, and training information.

Results

One thousand sixty-nine surveys were received: 997 surveys were used for data analysis, including 269 PT physicians and 721 non-PT physicians. Seventy-nine percent of PT physicians correctly classified the scenario patient as moderately dehydrated versus 71% of non-PT physicians (P = 0.063). Among those who correctly classified the patient, 121 PT physicians (58%) and 350 non-PT physicians (68%) would initially hydrate the patient with intravenous fluids. Pediatrics-trained physicians were more likely to initially choose oral or nasogastric hydration compared with non-PT physicians (P = 0.0127). Pediatrics-trained physicians were less likely to perform laboratory testing compared with the non-PT group (n = 92, 45%, vs n = 337, 66%; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Contrary to established recommendations for the management of moderately dehydrated children, significantly more PT physicians, compared with non-PT physicians, follow established guidelines.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^e3f2b935]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Appropriate classification of dehydration is crucial as it determines appropriate management. Children with 'no dehydration' may be managed at home, with increased fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Those with 'some dehydration' are managed by healthcare services and receive oral rehydration therapy, and children with severe dehydration require intravenous rehydration (WHO 2005). Rehydration of severely dehydrated children is achieved with rapid or slow rehydration therapy. Most of the management guidelines recommend a rapid rehydration therapy to treat children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea (WHO 2005). In rapid therapy the fluid deficit is replaced over three to six hours, while in slow therapy, replacement occurs over more than six to eight hours (typically using one or two 10 mL/kg to 20 mL/kg boluses of 0.9% saline before the full replacement).

Although some micro‐organisms, such as rotavirus, have been associated with an increased risk of severe dehydration in high‐income countries (HIC) (Albano 2007), reports from low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC) have shown that micro‐organism identification does not predict the occurrence of severe dehydration (Andrews 2017). Severe dehydration may cause a significant loss of intravascular volume (hypovolaemia). When this loss is substantial, hypovolaemic shock, characterized by tachycardia and either prolonged capillary refill time or hypotension, may occur. Severe dehydration can also cause electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis. Electrolyte disturbances may appear due to significant water, sodium, bicarbonate, and potassium losses. Large losses of bicarbonate in stools, hyperlactatemia caused by hypovolaemia, and long fasting periods causing hyperketonaemia explain metabolic acidosis in these children (Hirschhorn 1980 ; Levy 2013).

Last, deaths associated with severe dehydration may occur when a hypovolaemic shock is not appropriately managed and when it is associated with severe malnutrition and the coexistence of sepsis (Singh 2019). The mortality rate of children with severe dehydration may be as high as 13% (Akech 2018). Children with severe dehydration should receive intravenous rehydration therapy to restore volume and perfusion to vital organs, resolve metabolic acidosis, and replace the fluid deficit.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^8f9b2e58]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic relief—Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children <18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children >4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^c6ad2aa8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This multicenter trial conducted in resource-poor conditions did not observe a reduction in mortality between standard and liberal rehydration strategies in patients with SAM. The use of liberal rehydration strategies, both intravenous and oral were not associated with cardiac or pulmonary complications and resulted in fewer patients requiring fluid boluses for shock and placement of nasogastric tubes.

The key limitation of our trial was the much lower overall mortality (9%) than we predicted from two small studies, which reported mortality at hospital discharge or 28 days as 68-82%,, at the high end compared with other observational data. A key reason for low mortality in our trial may be that most children were managed on high dependency wards (or step-down, intermediate care units) by dedicated clinical trial teams with very close and frequent monitoring to identify and treat complications (specifically fluid overload, shock or hypoglycemia) and to ensure protocol adherence. These measures were put in place to address concerns by ethics committees over the balance of risk to benefit for children participating in the trial, but may reduce the generalisability of the findings. The concerns resulted from longstanding national and international guidance recommending against IV rehydration in children with SAM arising from the perceived risk of incipient heart failure. In routine practice in low-resourced, overcrowded pediatric wards in Africa, the close clinical monitoring afforded by our trial is not possible, as evidenced by the poor outcomes reported in SAM with severe dehydration under routine surveillance –. This underscores the need for simplified protocols for the management of dehydration. For example, at admission 79% of children were unable to take oral rehydration, resulting in 93% of the control arm requiring nasogastric tubes for oral rehydration solution administration. This is not a trivial low-risk procedure, especially in children with impaired consciousness and high purging rates. The current recommendations have resulted in additional demands on limited ward personnel, since oral rehydration solution cannot be given by the child’s caregiver (as noted in guidance documents). In contrast, slow intravenous rehydration, even compared to rapid rehydration, was simpler to implement requiring no calculation of volumes for boluses and adjustment for the rapid and slower rehydration phases depending on age.

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^f217d230]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine if rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration results in improved hydration and clinical outcomes when administered to children with gastroenteritis.

Design Single centre, two arm, parallel randomised pragmatic controlled trial. Blocked randomisation stratified by site. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, investigators, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment assignment.

Setting Paediatric emergency department in a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada.

Participants 226 children aged 3 months to 11 years; complete follow-up was obtained on 223 (99%). Eligible children were aged over 90 days, had a diagnosis of dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis, had not responded to oral rehydration, and had been prescribed intravenous rehydration. Children were excluded if they weighed less than 5 kg or more than 33 kg, required fluid restriction, had a suspected surgical condition, or had an insurmountable language barrier. Children were also excluded if they had a history of a chronic systemic disease, abdominal surgery, bilious or bloody vomit, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.

Interventions Rapid (60 mL/kg) or standard (20 mL/kg) rehydration with 0.9% saline over an hour; subsequent fluids administered according to protocol.

Main outcome measures Primary outcome: clinical rehydration, assessed with a validated scale, two hours after the start of treatment. Secondary outcomes: prolonged treatment, mean clinical dehydration scores over the four hour study period, time to discharge, repeat visits to emergency department, adequate oral intake, and physician’s comfort with discharge. Data from all randomised patients were included in an intention to treat analysis.

Results 114 patients were randomised to rapid rehydration and 112 to standard. One child was withdrawn because of severe hyponatraemia at baseline. There was no evidence of a difference between the rapid and standard rehydration groups in the proportions of participants who were rehydrated at two hours (41/114 (36%) v 33/112 (30%); difference 6.5% (95% confidence interval −5.7% to 18.7%; P=0.32). The results did not change after adjustment for weight, baseline dehydration score, and baseline pH (odds ratio 1.8, 0.90 to 3.5; P=0.10). The rates of prolonged treatment were similar (52% rapid v 43% standard; difference 8.9%, 21% to −5%; P=0.19). Although dehydration scores were similar throughout the study period (P=0.96), the median time to discharge was longer in the rapid group (6.3 v 5.0 hours; P=0.03).

Conclusions There are no relevant clinical benefits from the administration of rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration to haemodynamically stable children deemed to require intravenous rehydration.

Trail registration Clinical Trials NCT00392145.

There was no evidence of a difference between the rapid and standard rehydration groups in the proportions of participants who were rehydrated at two hours (41/114 (36%) v 33/112 (30%); difference 6.5% (95% confidence interval -5.7% to 18.7%; P=0.32). The results did not change after adjustment for weight, baseline dehydration score, and baseline pH (odds ratio 1.8, 0.90 to 3.5; P=0.10). The rates of prolonged treatment were similar (52% rapid v 43% standard; difference 8.9%, 21% to -5%; P=0.19). Although dehydration scores were similar throughout the study period (P=0.96), the median time to discharge was longer in the rapid group (6.3 v 5.0 hours; P=0.03).

Conclusions

There are no relevant clinical benefits from the administration of rapid rather than standard intravenous rehydration to haemodynamically stable children deemed to require intravenous rehydration. Trail registration Clinical Trials NCT00392145.

### Probiotics for treating acute infectious diarrhoea [^5883ed88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 20 viruses, bacteria, and parasites are associated with acute diarrhoea (Gadewar 2005). The 2013 Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) and its subsequent reanalysis in 2016 identified six pathogen groups responsible for 77.8% of moderate to severe diarrhoeal episodes in children under five in countries in Africa and Asia: the bacteria Shigella spp, Campylobacter spp, and heat‐stable enterotoxin‐producing Escherichia coli (ST‐ETEC); the viruses rotavirus and adenovirus 40/41; and the parasite Cryptosporidium spp (Kotloff 2013 ; Liu 2016b). Although Shigella spp was the dominant pathogen associated with dysentery, it also accounted for a large burden of watery diarrhoea (Liu 2016b). In an extension of the GEMS study, the spectrum of pathogens causing less severe diarrhoea in under five children was similar to that causing more severe episodes, with norovirus GII also identified as an important pathogen in children under one year (Kotloff 2019). Acute diarrhoea is frequent among travellers, in whom enterotoxigenic E coli is particularly common (Black 1986).

In practice, most episodes of acute diarrhoea that are assumed to be caused by an infectious agent are treated without identification of the causative agent. WHO guidelines base treatment on clinical presentation (level of dehydration, malnutrition) and recommend additional management only for dysentery or suspected cholera (WHO 2005). Similarly, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommends that, although some clinical features vary with different infectious diarrhoeal aetiologies, children with acute gastroenteritis do not routinely need to undergo investigation for the causative pathogen (Guarino 2014). Current WHO guidelines for children in low‐ and middle‐income countries recommend that in addition to fluid therapy for children with acute non‐bloody diarrhoea without severe dehydration, zinc supplementation should be given (WHO 2005).

### Rapid versus standard intravenous rehydration in paediatric gastroenteritis: pragmatic blinded randomised clinical trial [^446a0b3b]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measurements

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was rehydration, defined as a score on the clinical dehydration scale of ≤1two hours after the start of treatment. This scale, which consists of four clinical variables, was used to improve diagnostic characteristicsas individual measures, such as prolonged capillary refill, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern, have sensitivities of only 43-60% to detect 5% dehydration.In validation studies, the scale selected has been shown to correlate with length of stay and the use of intravenous rehydration and therefore seems to correlate with clinical decision making.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included prolonged treatment—a composite measure defined as admission to an inpatient unit at the index visit or admission within 72 hours of randomisation or a stay in the emergency department longer than six hours after the start of treatment; score on the clinical dehydration scale; adequate oral intake, a common prerequisite for discharge,defined as consuming at least 5 mL/kg of liquid per two hour time period (only a small volume was prespecified as all children additionally received intravenous rehydration); time to discharge, determined by chart review—defined as the time between the start of treatment and discharge from the emergency department or inpatient unit; repeat emergency department visit within 72 hours; and attending physician’s comfort with discharge at two and four hours as reported on a 5 point Likert scale. We found the latter correlated strongly with the outcome of hospital admission.

Sample size

We estimated that enrolling 226 children would provide 80% power to detect a 20 percentage point difference in the proportion of children rehydrated two hours after the start of treatment, given a two sided type I error probability of 0.05 and a 40% success rate in the standard group. This calculation included a 5% adjustment for losses to follow-up, withdrawals, and missing data.

### Pediatric gastroenteritis in the emergency department: practice evaluation in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland [^3b76edce]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in children is very common and accounts for a large number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The most dangerous complication is dehydration, and every year, there are at least 230 deaths and over 87,000 hospitalizations of children under 5 years of age in the European Union. In Europe, incidence of AGE range from 0.5 to 1.9 episodes per year per person, with a higher risk for children under 3 years. The management of children diagnosed with AGE is based largely upon international recommendations. The latest European recommendations from European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition/European Society for Paediatric Infectious Disease (ESPGHAN/ESPID) published in 2008, specify preferred methods of rehydration, possible medications, potentially useful laboratory tests, and suggested nutrition in cases of AGE. These recommendations clearly state that the first line of treatment should include oral rehydration with standard Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), the composition of which is specified within the same recommendations. In contrast, treatment recommendations are less strict regarding second line treatments. Indeed, recommendations indicate that the nasogastric (NG) and intravenous (IV) routes can both be used to rehydrate individuals with AGE even though the recommendations additionally state that the NG route is associated with less adverse events and shorter hospitalizations. They also clearly state that there is no need for microbiological investigation since the epidemiology of AGE is well known in Europe. These recommendations, however, do not take into account the most recent studies on AGE treatments, such as the study of ondansetron by Carter et al. Where guidelines are vague or evidence is limited, wide variations in the management of AGE have been observed among institutions and countries. Because an accurate understanding of current treatment regimens is a necessary prerequisite to developing improvements, we sought to assess variations in the management of pediatric AGE across Europe.

Our primary objective was to determine the extent to which significant variations in rehydration therapies for individuals with pediatric gastroenteritis exist among pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in Europe. Secondary objectives included the assessment of variations in the use of additional therapeutic and diagnostic modalities.

### The global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries: epidemiologic and clinical methods of the case / control study [^1e666889]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Case Definition of MSD and Other Study Outcomes

The initial step in eligibility screening was the selection of children who fulfilled the WHO definition of diarrhea (≥3 abnormally loose stools in 24 hours). In subsequent steps we identified cases of MSD, the primary outcome of interest, intending to capture diarrheal illnesses that would not be expected to resolve spontaneously without medical intervention or without sequelae, because these illnesses constitute priorities for development of vaccines and other new or improved preventive and therapeutic strategies. We reasoned that episodes that would qualify as MSD fell into 2 general categories: (1) those accompanied by dehydration to a degree that the child's survival would likely depend on access to life-saving rehydration fluids, and (2) those with evidence of inflammatory destruction of the intestinal mucosa, thereby at increased risk for disabling sequelae (such as persistent diarrhea and stunting) or death.

To capture children who had potentially life-threatening diarrheal dehydration, we adapted the WHO definition of dehydration to our case definition of MSD, choosing the most objective signs (sunken eyes more than usual and slow or very slow recoil after an abdominal wall “skin pinch”). In addition, we included the determination by a healthcare provider that the severity of dehydration warranted administration of intravenous fluids. Although not part of our case definition, other signs of dehydration proposed by WHO were documented, including restlessness or irritability and drinking eagerly or appearing thirsty (considered to be signs of “some” dehydration), and lethargy, loss of consciousness, inability to drink, or drinking poorly (as signs of “severe” dehydration). During analysis we will explore the impact on the study findings of including these other signs of dehydration in the definition of MSD. We considered adopting as inclusion criteria elements of systems used widely to define severe illness in rotavirus vaccine trials. However, many of the components, such as total duration and maximum severity of diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, can only be determined in retrospect when the episode is resolving or resolved, at which point the decision to include a child in GEMS would already have been made. Instead, our approach has been to collect this information for exploration during analysis.

### Variables associated with intravenous rehydration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^5ccf2b7c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Despite guidelines endorsing oral rehydration therapy, intravenous fluids are commonly administered to children with acute gastroenteritis in high-income countries.

Objective

To identify factors associated with intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization in children with acute gastroenteritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study is a planned secondary analysis of the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) probiotic trials. Participants include children aged 3 to 48 months with 3 or more watery stools in 24 hours between November 5, 2013, and April 7, 2017, for the PERC study and July 8, 2014, and June 23, 2017, for the PECARN Study. Children were from 16 pediatric emergency departments throughout Canada (6) and the US (10). Data were analyzed from November 2, 2018, to March 16, 2021.

Exposures

Sex, age, preceding health care visit, distance between home and hospital, country (US vs Canada), frequency and duration of vomiting and diarrhea, presence of fever, Clinical Dehydration Scale score, oral ondansetron followed by oral rehydration therapy, and infectious agent.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Intravenous fluid administration and hospitalization.

Results

This secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials included 1846 children (mean [SD] age, 19.1 [11.4] months; 1007 boys [54.6%]), of whom 534 of 1846 (28.9%) received oral ondansetron, 240 of 1846 (13.0%) received intravenous rehydration, and 67 of 1846 (3.6%) were hospitalized. The following were independently associated with intravenous rehydration: higher Clinical Dehydration Scale score (mild to moderate vs none, odds ratio [OR], 8.73; 95% CI, 5.81-13.13; and severe vs none, OR, 34.15; 95% CI, 13.45-86.73); country (US vs Canada, OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 3.15-14.49); prior health care visit with intravenous fluids (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.32-15.72); and frequency of vomiting (per 5 episodes, OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.39-1.99). The following were independently associated with hospitalization: higher Clinical Dehydration Scale score (mild to moderate vs none, OR, 11.10; 95% CI, 5.05-24.38; and severe vs none, OR, 23.55; 95% CI, 7.09-78.25) and country (US vs Canada, OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.36-8.40). Oral ondansetron was associated with reduced odds of intravenous rehydration (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13-0.32) and hospitalization (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89).

Conclusions and Relevance

Intravenous rehydration and hospitalization were associated with clinical evidence of dehydration and lack of an oral ondansetron-supported oral rehydration period. Strategies focusing on oral ondansetron administration followed by oral rehydration therapy in children with dehydration may reduce the reliance on intravenous rehydration and hospitalization.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^74a9e883]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in children—clinical presentation and risk factors: Case and hospitalization rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are lower than in adults, and asymptomatic infection is more common; however, infection can lead to significant illness and even death in children. Clinical presentations can be non-specific and may more frequently include fever alone and/or gastrointestinal symptoms than in adults, and children are also capable of transmitting disease to others. Comorbidities including medically complex conditions (including certain genetic disorders, neurologic diseases, and cancer), type 1 diabetes, complex congenital heart disease, and obesity have all been associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and ICU admission in children.

### Comparison of clinical and biochemical markers of dehydration with the clinical dehydration scale in children: a case comparison trial [^c3790032]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dehydration associated with gastroenteritis represents one of the leading causes of admission and morbidity in the pediatric emergency department (ED). It is also the most common cause of electrolyte abnormalities in children presenting at the ED. In Canada, acute gastroenteritis accounts for 240,000 annual pediatric visits to the ED, while globally, diarrheal disease is responsible for approximately 10% of deaths in children under 5 years of age. Considering its extensive global impact, it is not surprising that there are several serious complications associated with severe dehydration including hypo-volemic shock, pre-renal acute kidney injury, and acute tubular necrosis. Clinicians must determine whether patients only need to be rehydrated or whether they face more substantial morbidity, which can be challenging. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing a simple, non-invasive tool for measuring the severity of dehydration in children. Although previous studies have attempted to validate markers of dehydration by assessing the severity of dehydration using serial measurements of patient body weight, serial weights in sick and dehydrated children may be unreliable due to a number of factors that are not related to the severity of their illness. The clinical dehydration scale (CDS, Table 1) has been developed to meet this important objective. The CDS combines scores of general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears. Use of the CDS has increased and it has been validated in 3 prospective studies, including one in the original ED, in a different Canadian pediatric ED, and in a multicenter trial at 3 Canadian EDs.

### Risk factors for mortality and effect of correct fluid prescription in children with diarrhoea and dehydration without severe acute malnutrition admitted to Kenyan hospitals: an observational, association study [^8746e5b1]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A studyusing the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's methodology recently identified risk factors for diarrhoeal deaths as a research priority. This study investigated clinical features associated with mortality and whether, for early deaths, associations are modified by prescribed fluid therapy in accordance with WHO and Kenyan guidance in children with both diarrhoea and dehydration. We used routinely collected data from 13 first-level referral hospitals in Kenya involved in a collaborative effort to improve availability of routine data on admitted children and the management of common conditions.We excluded children who had severe acute malnutrition, a known major risk factor for mortality with specific fluid management guidance,,and children younger than 30 days or older than 5 years because no standard rehydration guidelines exist for those ages. We did not have microbial cultures of stool or blood but malaria testing is done consistently by these hospitals in their own laboratories.

In our study of 8562 children admitted with both diarrhoea and dehydration, we found that most (>80%) had at least one additional diagnosis (comorbidity). We also note that diarrhoea not accompanied by clinically diagnosed dehydration is a common symptom in a range of diseases. Among participants with diarrhoea and dehydration (representing 16% of all admissions and associated with 28% of all death), respiratory signs, circulatory impairment, pallor, neurological signs and symptoms, prolonged diarrhoea, age younger than 1 year, and female sex were associated with increased risk of in-hospital death. Our findings are consistent with studies that have shown impaired consciousness, convulsions,signs of pneumonia,,anaemia, weak pulse volume,longer duration of preadmission illness,and persistent diarrhoea,,,as risk factors for mortality in children with diarrhoea. Respiratory signs might in fact be indicative of pneumonia comorbidity. Female sex and younger age (<1 year), which were significantly associated with mortality in this study, have also been found to be risk factors in other studies. Our study did not investigate reasons for higher mortality in female participants than in male participants; some of the reasons suggested include social inequality and gender bias, but whether these factors are also important in Kenya is unclear.

### Diagnosing clinically significant dehydration in children with acute gastroenteritis using noninvasive methods: a meta-analysis [^962cb35e]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the most accurate, noninvasive method of assessing dehydration.

Study Design

The following data sources were searched: electronic databases, gray literature, scientific meetings, reference lists, and authors of unpublished studies. Eligible studies were comparative outpatient evaluations that used an accepted reference standard and were conducted in developed countries in children aged <18 years with gastroenteritis. Data extraction was completed independently by multiple reviewers before a consensus was made.

Results

Nine studies that included 1039 participants were identified. The 4-item Clinical Dehydration Scale (CDS), the "Gorelick" score, and unstructured physician assessment were evaluated in 3, 2, and 5 studies, respectively. Bedside ultrasound, capillary digital videography, and urinary measurements were each evaluated in one study. The CDS had a positive likelihood ratio (LR) range of 1.87-11.79 and a negative LR range of 0.30-0.71 to predict 6% dehydration. When combined with the 4-item Gorelick Score, the positive LR was 1.93 (95% CI 1.07-3.49) and negative LR was of 0.40 (95% CI 0.24-0.68). Unstructured dehydration assessment had a pooled positive LR of 2.13 (95% CI 1.33-3.44) and negative LR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.28-0.82) to detect ≥ 5% dehydration.

Conclusions

Overall, the clinical scales evaluated provide some improved diagnostic accuracy. However, test characteristics indicate that their ability to identify children both with and without dehydration is suboptimal. Current evidence does not support the routine use of ultrasound or urinalysis to determine dehydration severity.

### Management of gastroenteritis over 10 years: changing culture and maintaining the change [^174907ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the impact of an implementation program on adherence to a guideline for the management of acute gastroenteritis.

Design

Using four retrospective audits over a 10-year period, the authors examined the change in practice and maintenance of that change following a targeted implementation program for the clinical guideline.

Setting

Tertiary children's hospital in South Wales.

Participants

447 children aged less than 5 years, admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis, comprising four cross-sectional samples (106 in 1999, 153 in 2002, 99 in 2004, 89 in 2009).

Main Outcome Measures

Age of child, hydration status, method of rehydration and duration of admission, for each audit, with an implementation strategy delivered after the second audit.

Results

In 1999 and 2002, intravenous rehydration was used in 20% and 15% of cases, respectively. After the implementation program in 2004, compared to 1999, there was a significant decrease in the intravenous rehydration rate to 4% in 2004 (p<0.001); in 2009 the intravenous rehydration rate was maintained at a low level of 6% (p<0.001).

Conclusion

It was only after the implementation program that a change in practice was achieved. Once change had been accepted, it was maintained even in the absence of targeted training. Audit does not improve clinical practice unless, in addition, there is a clear, succinct guideline with an implementation programme in place.

### External validation of the clinical dehydration scale for children with acute gastroenteritis [^c1bf474e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to validate the clinical dehydration scale (CDS) for children with gastroenteritis in a different pediatric emergency department (ED) from where it was initially derived and validated.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary care pediatric ED over a 1-year period. A sample of triage nurses were trained in applying the CDS. The CDS consists of four clinical characteristics (general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears), each of which are scored 0, 1, or 2 for a total score of 0 to 8, with 0 representing no dehydration; 1 to 4, some dehydration; and 5 to 8, moderate/severe dehydration. Children 1 month to 5 years of age with vomiting and/or diarrhea who had the CDS documented at triage and a final diagnosis of gastroenteritis, gastritis, or enteritis were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included a chronic disease, treatment with intravenous (IV) rehydration within the previous 24 hours, visit to the ED for the same illness in the 7 days prior to arrival, and diarrhea of more than 10 days' duration. The primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS) in the ED from the time of seeing a physician to discharge, analyzed with a Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

From April 2008 to March 2009, 150 patients with a mean (+/-SD) age of 22 (+/-14) months (range = 4 months to 4 years) were enrolled. Fifty-six patients had no dehydration, 74 had some dehydration, and 20 had moderate/severe dehydration. The median LOS in the ED after being seen by a physician was significantly longer as children appeared more dehydrated according to the CDS: 54 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 26-175 minutes), 128 minutes (IQR = 25-334 minutes), and 425 minutes (IQR = 218-673 minutes) for the no, some, and moderate/severe dehydration groups, respectively (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The CDS has been further validated in children with gastroenteritis in a different pediatric center than the original one where it was developed. It is a good predictor of LOS in the ED after being seen by a physician.

### Is this child dehydrated? [^46f380cd]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The ability to assess the degree of dehydration quickly and accurately in infants and young children often determines patient treatment and disposition.

Objective

To systematically review the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory tests for evaluating dehydration in infants and children.

Data Sources

We identified 1561 potential articles by multiple search strategies of the MEDLINE database through PubMed. Searches of bibliographies of retrieved articles, the Cochrane Library, textbooks, and private collections of experts in the field yielded an additional 42 articles.

Study Selection

Twenty-six of 1603 reviewed studies contained original data on the precision or accuracy of findings for the diagnosis of dehydration in young children (1 month to 5 years).

Data Extraction

Two of the 3 authors independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of diagnostic tests. We eliminated 13 of the 26 studies because of the lack of an accepted diagnostic standard or other limitation in study design. The other 13 studies were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

The most useful individual signs for predicting 5% dehydration in children are an abnormal capillary refill time (LR, 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-9.8), abnormal skin turgor (LR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2), and abnormal respiratory pattern (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7). Combinations of examination signs perform markedly better than any individual sign in predicting dehydration. Historical points and laboratory tests have only modest utility for assessing dehydration.

Conclusions

The initial assessment of dehydration in young children should focus on estimating capillary refill time, skin turgor, and respiratory pattern and using combinations of other signs. The relative imprecision and inaccuracy of available tests limit the ability of clinicians to estimate the exact degree of dehydration.
