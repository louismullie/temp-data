## Question

calcium chloride dose for digoxin toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of calcium chloride for digoxin toxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical teaching that calcium is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity. Then, I should verify what contemporary evidence and guidelines say about giving calcium in this setting. Next, I will examine mechanistic rationale and any human data that inform risk. After that, I need to check regulatory labeling for calcium chloride and digoxin. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and clarify what to do instead of giving calcium if hyperkalemia is present.

> Let me first confirm the traditional teaching. Historically, many clinicians were taught that intravenous calcium is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity because it could precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias, a belief rooted in mechanistic concerns about calcium overload and delayed afterdepolarizations in digitalis toxicity [^868abef3].

> Wait, let me verify whether that dogma still holds. Contemporary human data suggest that intravenous calcium in digoxin-toxic patients has not been associated with an increased risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias or mortality in observational cohorts, challenging the older prohibition, although the evidence quality is limited and not randomized [^e2060196].

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale carefully. Digoxin toxicity increases intracellular calcium and promotes delayed afterdepolarizations, which can trigger ventricular arrhythmias; adding exogenous calcium could theoretically worsen this, especially with rapid administration or in the setting of hyperkalemia, so the concern is biologically plausible even if human data are sparse [^56abe3b7] [^3846452d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm what regulators say. FDA labeling for calcium chloride warns that arrhythmias may occur if calcium and digoxin are administered together and advises avoiding concomitant use; if unavoidable, it recommends close ECG monitoring during administration, which underscores a risk signal even if it does not define a "safe dose" in toxicity [^868abef3] [^d459fd52].

> Let me consider the clinical context. In digoxin toxicity, hyperkalemia is common and life-threatening; the traditional reflex to give calcium for cardioprotection in hyperkalemia conflicts with the historical digoxin teaching, and although a human study did not show increased malignant arrhythmias with calcium, it did not establish safety or efficacy in this specific drug–drug context, so the balance still favors avoidance when alternatives exist [^e2060196] [^1763744b].

> I should double-check what to do instead. The cornerstone of digoxin toxicity management is digoxin-specific antibody fragments, with dosing based on ingested amount or serum digoxin concentration; for hyperkalemia, insulin with dextrose is preferred, and for bradyarrhythmias, atropine, isoproterenol, or temporary pacing can be considered while arranging Fab, which aligns with guideline-based care [^1b0243ea] [^1763744b] [^2edcb5c0].

> But wait, what if the patient is in extremis with refractory shock and the team is considering calcium as a last-ditch inotrope? Even then, I need to ensure we acknowledge that there is no established safe dose of calcium chloride for digoxin toxicity, and any use would be off-label, experimental, and require continuous ECG monitoring with full awareness of the potential to precipitate arrhythmias, so this should be reserved for exceptional scenarios after Fab and standard supportive measures have been initiated or are unavailable [^45ab9fb0] [^d459fd52].

> I will now examine whether any guideline provides a dose. I should confirm that major guidelines do not recommend calcium for digoxin toxicity; indeed, ACC/AHA/HRS guidance focuses on Fab, supportive care, and rhythm-specific measures, and does not endorse calcium administration for digoxin poisoning, reinforcing that there is no validated dosing regimen for calcium chloride in this setting [^2edcb5c0].

> Let me reconsider the original question about dose. Given the absence of supportive dosing data, the FDA warnings, and the availability of safer, effective therapies, there is no recommended dose of calcium chloride for digoxin toxicity, and calcium should generally be avoided; if, despite this, calcium is administered in a desperate scenario, it should be given slowly in small aliquots with continuous ECG and hemodynamic monitoring, recognizing that even this approach is unsupported by evidence and carries risk [^45ab9fb0] [^d459fd52].

> Final synthesis: There is no established or recommended dose of calcium chloride for digoxin toxicity. Avoid calcium in this setting, prioritize digoxin immune Fab, correct hyperkalemia with insulin and dextrose, and manage bradyarrhythmias with atropine, isoproterenol, or pacing as indicated, reserving any experimental calcium use for exceptional circumstances with full disclosure of risk and continuous monitoring [^1b0243ea] [^1763744b] [^2edcb5c0].

---

Calcium chloride is **contraindicated in digoxin toxicity** because it can precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias by increasing intracellular calcium and promoting delayed afterdepolarizations [^45ab9fb0] [^56abe3b7]. There is **no safe dose** of calcium chloride for digoxin toxicity; if hyperkalemia is present, treat with insulin, glucose, and digoxin immune Fab, not calcium [^1763744b] [^1b0243ea]. If calcium is mistakenly given, monitor closely for malignant arrhythmias and be prepared to treat immediately with digoxin immune Fab and antiarrhythmics [^2edcb5c0].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for avoiding calcium chloride

Digoxin toxicity increases intracellular calcium via Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition, causing delayed afterdepolarizations and arrhythmias [^56abe3b7]. Exogenous calcium further elevates intracellular calcium, **increasing arrhythmia risk** [^45ab9fb0].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA warnings**: Calcium chloride is contraindicated in digitalis toxicity due to arrhythmia risk; avoid concomitant use with digoxin [^868abef3] [^45ab9fb0].
- **ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines**: For digoxin toxicity with bradycardia or hemodynamic compromise, use digoxin immune Fab; calcium is not recommended [^7068c3fa] [^7b4e955b].
- **Human data**: In digoxin-toxic patients, IV calcium did not cause malignant dysrhythmias in a small series, but this does not establish safety and is not practice-changing [^e2060196].

---

## Risks associated with calcium chloride administration

Calcium chloride in digoxin toxicity can cause:

- **Malignant arrhythmias**: Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole [^notfound].
- **Hypercalcemia**: Worsens digoxin toxicity and arrhythmias [^45ab9fb0].
- **Tissue necrosis**: Extravasation can cause severe local injury [^6188253c].

---

## Alternative management strategies

- **Digoxin immune Fab**: First-line for life-threatening toxicity; dosing based on ingested amount or serum level [^1b0243ea] [^a4bcd377].
- **Hyperkalemia management**: Use insulin, glucose, and digoxin immune Fab; avoid calcium [^1763744b] [^d8e1514c].
- **Supportive care**: Atropine, pacing, and antiarrhythmics (e.g. lidocaine, phenytoin) as indicated [^1763744b] [^c0ee6704].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Hyperkalemia with digoxin toxicity | - Insulin <br/> - Glucose <br/> - Digoxin immune Fab <br/> - Avoid calcium [^1763744b] [^d8e1514c] |
| Life-threatening arrhythmias | Digoxin immune Fab immediately [^1b0243ea] [^2edcb5c0] |
| Accidental calcium administration | - Monitor for arrhythmias <br/> - Prepare digoxin immune Fab and antiarrhythmics [^2edcb5c0] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Calcium chloride is **contraindicated in digoxin toxicity**; there is no safe dose. Use digoxin immune Fab and supportive care; avoid calcium to prevent fatal arrhythmias [^45ab9fb0] [^1b0243ea].

### Dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin therapy in severe verapamil toxicity [^9269acaf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) alone is an ineffective antidote in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Digoxin has been evaluated as a therapy to increase the effectiveness of calcium in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses.

Objective

To determine if there is a dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Methods

Eight dogs were instrumented to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, and left ventricular pressures. Verapamil toxicity (50% decrease in mean arterial pressure) was induced with verapamil 6 mg/kg/hr and maintained for 30 minutes by titrating the verapamil rate. Following verapamil toxicity, each dog received one dose of digoxin equivalent to 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 times the loading dose of digoxin (0.009 mg/kg). The verapamil rate was changed to 4 mg/kg/hr and continued for the next five hours. CaCl(2) boluses were given (0.5 g immediately following verapamil toxicity and 1 g at one, two, and three hours). Measurements were compared with the loading dose of digoxin using linear regression analysis.

Results

Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure at 4 hours (10.23 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 2.74 to 17.73), 4 hours, 15 minutes (13.9 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 8.75 to 19.01), and 5 hours (17.04 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.76 to 32.32). Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal ventricular pressure at the end of hour 3 (8.55 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 3.41 to 13.69), 3 hours, 15 minutes (11.81 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.89 to 18.73), hour 4 (8.26 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.03 to 15.48), and 4 hours, 15 minutes (9.74 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.47 to 15.00). The authors were unable to detect a dose-dependent increase in other parameters, including diastolic relaxation (diastolic change in pressure over time) and time to onset of death. No ventricular arrhythmias developed in any dogs.

Conclusions

There is a dose-dependent effect of digoxin on systolic blood pressure and maximal ventricular pressure in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — acute medical management dosing for bradycardia attributable to SND or atrioventricular block includes the following regimens: For symptomatic sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block, atropine 0.5–1 mg IV (may be repeated every 3–5 min to a maximum dose of 3 mg). Dopamine 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min IV, starting at 5 mcg/kg/min and increasing by 5 mcg/kg/min every 2 min, and dosages of > 20 mcg/kg/min may result in vasoconstriction or arrhythmias. Isoproterenol 20–60 mcg IV bolus followed doses of 10–20 mcg, or infusion of 1–20 mcg/min based on heart rate response. Epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min IV or 0.01–0.5 mcg/kg/min IV titrated to desired effect; dosage for advanced cardiac life support is 2 to 10 mcg/min with titration to hemodynamic response. For calcium channel blocker overdose, 10% calcium chloride 1–2 g IV every 10–20 min or an infusion of 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/h is listed. High dose insulin therapy consists of an IV bolus of 1 unit/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/kg/h with instruction to follow glucose and potassium levels. For digoxin overdose, digoxin antibody fragment dosage is dependent on amount ingested or known digoxin concentration, and one vial binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^884b5c26]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — prehospital clinical considerations include that "The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported". "Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered". "A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED". "Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block". "Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L-type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta-blockers. There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia". "Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses)", and "Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia".

### Treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning: a systematic review [^5ee4fdd4]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers blinded to authors and journal names selected the studies based on eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or, when required, by a third reviewer. The kappa statistic was used to quantify agreement on the articles included. A data abstraction form to standardize the data collection process was used after a pilot version was tested among data abstractors with five articles related to digoxin poisoning. No significant abstraction difference was noted between abstractors. For each included study, two reviewers independently abstracted study characteristics (year of publication, authors, and study design), subjects (number, inclusion/exclusion criteria, age, gender, co-morbidities, co-ingestions, type of animal studied where applicable, sample size calculation, and weight for animal studies), treatment and control group characteristics, CCB involved (type, dose, route, and form), treatment(s) provided, outcomes, and results. To ensure uniformity, an independent individual merged the data collection into a single flow sheet.

Two independent reviewers carried out quality analysis for all of the studies except case reports. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third party if required. The Cochrane risk of bias toolwas not required because no controlled trials were found. The STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) checklistand the Thomas toolwere used for observational studies, the Institute of Health Economics toolfor case series, and the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelinesand the modified NRCNA (National Research Council for the National Academies) checklistfor animal studies. The percent agreement was documented for each item, and the kappa statistic was calculated for each type of quality analysis tool. Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence for each outcome. A planned meta- analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of studies, interventions, and outcomes. The search strategy identified 15,577 citations. Two reviewers selected 216 articles (Kappa on articles inclusion = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73–0.89) (Supplementary Appendix 1, to be found at online). Six full-text articles were not found because the foreign language journals were inaccessible. Professional translation was performed on 23 manuscripts. A list of the articles translated and excluded after full-text review is available upon request.

### Calcium chloride dihydrate [^45ab9fb0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Avoid concomitant use with calcium chloride injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. (5.3, 7.1)
Calcium Channel Blockers: Avoid concomitant use with calcium chloride injection. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of calcium chloride injection. (7.2)
Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia: Increase the frequency of calcium concentration monitoring in patients taking calcium chloride injection concomitantly with other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia. (7.3)

7.1 Digoxin

Avoid the concomitant use of calcium chloride injection with digoxin. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor ECG closely during administration of calcium chloride injection.

Synergistic arrhythmias may occur with concomitant use. The use of calcium chloride injection may result in hypercalcemia which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers

Concomitant use of calcium chloride injection and calcium channel blockers may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers. Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of calcium chloride injection.

7.3 Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia

Increase frequency of monitoring of calcium concentrations in patients taking concomitant calcium chloride injection and other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g., calcipotriene, estrogen, lithium, parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, thiazide diuretics, Vitamin A, and Vitamin D).

### Calcium chloride dihydrate [^d459fd52]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

The use of calcium chloride injection is contraindicated in newborns (up to 28 days of age) if they require (or are expected to require) ceftriaxone intravenous treatment because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium, regardless of whether these products would be received at different times or through separate intravenous lines [see Contraindications (4)]. Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in lungs and kidneys in premature and full-term newborns aged less than 1 month have occurred when ceftriaxone and calcium were administered either simultaneously or non-simultaneously and through different intravenous lines. In-vitro studies demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium compared to other age groups.

In patients older than 28 days of age, calcium chloride injection and ceftriaxone intravenous solutions may be administered sequentially one after another if infusion lines at different sites are used, infusion lines are replaced, or infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with physiological salt solution to avoid precipitation. Do not mix or administer calcium chloride injection simultaneously with ceftriaxone, even if using different infusion lines or different infusion sites as it can lead to precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, Arrhythmias, and Syncope with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of calcium chloride injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest. It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the risk of syncope. Too rapid an injection exceeding 1 mL/minute may lead to hypotension and cardiac syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3 Arrhythmias with Concomitant Digoxin Use

Arrhythmias may occur if calcium chloride injection and digoxin are administered together. Hypercalcemia resulting from an overdose of calcium chloride injection increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Avoid the use of calcium chloride injection in patients receiving digoxin. If concomitant therapy is necessary, closely monitor ECG and calcium levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^7562443c]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^6d78a352]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3	Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

7	DRUG INTERACTIONS

- **Cardiac Glycoside**: Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. (7.1)

- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Administration of calcium may reduce the response. (7.2)

- **Drugs that may cause hypercalcemia**: Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently. (7.3)

7.1	Cardiac Glycosides

Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration.

7.2	Calcium Channel Blockers

Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers.

7.3	Drugs that may cause Hypercalcemia

Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently.

A 68 year old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department after experiencing several days of nausea and vomiting. Recorded vital signs included: blood pressure 98/32 mm Hg, heart rate 69 bpm, "normal" respirations, and no fever. Her initial ECG revealed peaked T waves and regular rhythm with no visible P waves. Initial serum electrolytes were notable for a potassium level of 7.7 mmol/L, and a creatinine level of 9.6 mg/dL (849 micromol/L). She was unable to provide a list of her current medications or other medical history. There was no old chart immediately available for comparison.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^dc124b24]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Toxicity from cardiac drugs is associated with a large number of fatalities and significant morbidity. Furthermore, the advice given by poison control centers are often not followed. Consensus recommendations were published for out-of-hospital management of calcium channel blocker (CCB) ingestion, but recommendations for in-hospital care have not been systematically developed.

In the absence of formally recognized guidelines, we convened a workgroup of experts involved in the care of poisoned patients to develop evidence-based recommendations to guide the in-hospital management of CCB poisoning. Considering the very low level of evidence found in the literature, the workgroup agreed on developing expert consensus recommendations to propose a management approach and facilitate knowledge translation. In light of the variable pharmacokinetics among the available CCBs, the altered pharmacokinetics following overdose and the loss of selectivity at very high CCB doses, the workgroup adopted a pragmatic clinical approach and did not focus on individual agents (for complementary information concerning CCB poisoning, see Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

### The effects of intravenous calcium in patients with digoxin toxicity [^e2060196]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Digoxin is an inhibitor of the sodium-potassium ATPase. In overdose, hyperkalemia is common. Although hyperkalemia is often treated with intravenous calcium, it is traditionally contraindicated in digoxin toxicity.

Objectives

To analyze records from patients treated with intravenous calcium while digoxin-toxic.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all adult patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity in a large teaching hospital over 17.5 years. The main outcome measures were frequency of life-threatening dysrhythmia within 1 h of calcium administration, and mortality rate in patients who did vs. patients who did not receive intravenous calcium. We use multivariate logistic regression to ensure that no relationship was overlooked due to negative confounders (controlling for age, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, peak serum potassium, time of development of digoxin toxicity, and digoxin concentration).

Results

We identified 161 patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity, and were able to retrieve 159 records. Of these, 23 patients received calcium. No life-threatening dysrhythmias occurred within 1 h of calcium administration. Mortality was similar among those who did not receive calcium (27/136, 20%) compared to those who did (5/23, 22%). In the multivariate analysis, calcium was non-significantly associated with decreased odds of death (odds ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–2.5). Each 1 mEq/L rise in serum potassium concentration was associated with an increased mortality odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.3).

Conclusion

Among digoxin-intoxicated humans, intravenous calcium does not seem to cause malignant dysrhythmias or increase mortality. We found no support for the historical belief that calcium administration is contraindicated in digoxin-toxic patients.

### Cardiotoxic medication poisoning [^b0e20701]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers result in a disproportionate number of fatalities from cardiac medication overdoses, and share similar characteristics. High-dose insulin is a superior therapy for both overdoses, but is likely synergistic with vasopressors; therefore we recommend starting vasopressors and high-dose insulin simultaneously. Digoxin remains an important cardiac poison and can likely be safely treated with smaller doses of fab fragments than in the past, except for patients in extremis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive but promising nonspecific therapy for refractory shock from cardiotoxic overdose and should be considered primarily in cases of refractory cardiogenic shock.

### Digoxin (digox) [^a481efeb]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders: In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur despite serum digoxin concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL, because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Deficiencies of these electrolytes may result from malnutrition, diarrhea, or prolonged vomiting, as well as the use of the following drugs or procedures: diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, antacids, dialysis, and mechanical suction of gastrointestinal secretions.

Hypercalcemia from any cause predisposes the patient to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly when administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. On the other hand, hypocalcemia can nullify the effects of digoxin in humans; thus, digoxin may be ineffective until serum calcium is restored to normal. These interactions are related to the fact that digoxin affects contractility and excitability of the heart in a manner similar to that of calcium.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity — supportive therapy and dosing: Because of improvements in heart rate and blood pressure, coupled with low risk of adverse effects, intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, and a systematic review of treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning not specific to SND found 7 animal studies demonstrating reduced mortality and hemodynamic improvement with intravenous calcium, while hemodynamic benefits in humans were less consistent in 11 case series and 21 case reports; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate (to minimize peripheral vein irritation) are commonly used. Glucagon dosing in this setting is described as the standard therapy in cardiac arrest being a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, and because effects are transient, an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated; although scores of case reports and case series (the largest comprised of 9 patients) have been published showing increased heart rate in the settings of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, no clinical trials have been performed. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/ kg/ h in patients with severe beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning.

### Should digoxin immune fAb be administered based solely on reported ingested amount in acute digoxin poisoning? [^e2aed83e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute digoxin poisoning is increasingly uncommon in emergency medicine. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding indications for antidotal digoxin immune fab in acute poisoning. In healthy adults, the fab prescribing information recommends administration based on "known consumption of fatal doses of digoxin: ≥ 10mg", while many emergency medicine textbooks suggest fab administration be driven by clinical features or potassium concentration. A 54 kg adult, not on digoxin, presented one hour after ingesting 12.5 mg. Electrocardiogram revealed only ST depression and first degree heart block. Initial pulse was 102 beats/min, systolic blood pressure was 170 mmHg. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic. Poison center recommended immediately obtaining serum potassium and digoxin concentrations; call-back was planned for two hours. The emergency physician was instructed to have ≥ 10 fab vials bedside and to administer if instability ensued. Thirty-five minutes later (≈90 min post-ingestion) ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest occurred; initial serum potassium resulted at this time at 3.3 mEq/L. Bicarbonate, insulin and glucose, amiodarone, magnesium, calcium, and 10 fab vials were administered. Cardioversion resulted in wide-complex tachycardia which became ventricular fibrillation then asystole and the patient died. Serum digoxin concentration drawn on hospital arrival resulted after death at 44 ng/mL. In this fatal case of acute digoxin poisoning, fab was not empirically recommended because the patient initially did not have significant signs or symptoms that accompanied the history of ingesting ≥ 10 mg digoxin. While the bedside team was given clear anticipatory guidance by the regional poison center, the patient died despite fab administration once instability occurred.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^59333319]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Hypercalcemia

Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. In the pivotal trial, 3 patients randomized to NATPARA required administration of IV fluids to correct hypercalcemia during treatment with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4	Hypocalcemia

Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases of hypocalcemia that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest when NATPARA is withheld, missed or abruptly discontinued, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D or calcium supplements or both if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5	Risk of Digoxin Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Digitalis Compounds

The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia of any cause may predispose to digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA [see Drug Interactions (7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.6	Hypersensitivity

There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking NATPARA. Reactions included anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash. If signs or symptoms of a serious hypersensitivity reaction occur, discontinue treatment with NATPARA, treat hypersensitivity reaction according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Monitor for hypocalcemia if NATPARA is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of digoxin toxicity [^9dbed8b0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of palopegteriparatide SC (also known as Yorvipath):
- **Digoxin toxicity**: use caution in patients taking digoxin, as palopegteriparatide transiently increases serum calcium predisposing patients to digoxin toxicity. Measure serum calcium and digoxin levels routinely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.
- **Hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization, particularly during initiation and up-titration. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypercalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Interrupt palopegteriparatide for at least 2–3 days when albumin-corrected serum calcium is > 12 mg/dL. Adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements in cases of less serious hypercalcemia.
- **Hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as unintended changes in serum calcium levels may occur with two injections per day. Use only one injection to achieve the recommended once daily dosage.
- **Hypocalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypocalcemia, especially following abrupt discontinuation. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Treat hypocalcemia and adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements as needed if hypocalcemia occurs.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

### Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath) [^f6885382]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Potential Risk of Osteosarcoma

YORVIPATH is a PTH analog. An increased incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) has been reported in male and female rats treated with PTH analogs, including teriparatide. Osteosarcoma occurrence in rats is dependent on teriparatide or PTH dose and treatment duration. Osteosarcoma has been reported in patients treated with teriparatide in the postmarketing setting; however, an increased risk of osteosarcoma has not been observed in observational studies in humans. There are limited data assessing the risk of osteosarcoma beyond 2 years of teriparatide use.

YORVIPATH is not recommended in patients who are at increased risk of osteosarcoma, such as patients with:

Open epiphyses. YORVIPATH is not approved in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
Metabolic bone diseases other than hypoparathyroidism, including Paget's disease of bone.
Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase.
Bone metastases or a history of skeletal malignancies.
History of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.
Hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma.

Instruct patients to promptly report clinical symptoms (e.g., persistent localized pain) and signs (e.g., soft tissue mass tender to palpation) that could be consistent with osteosarcoma.

5.5	Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic hypotension has been reported with YORVIPATH. Associated signs and symptoms may include decreased blood pressure, dizziness (including postural dizziness), palpitations, tachycardia, presyncope, or syncope. Such symptoms can be managed by dosing at bedtime, while reclining. YORVIPATH should be administered initially when the patient can sit or lie down due to the potential of orthostatic hypotension.

5.6	Risk of Digoxin Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Digitalis Compounds

YORVIPATH increases serum calcium, and therefore, concomitant use with digoxin (which has a narrow therapeutic index) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy may be reduced if hypocalcemia is present. When YORVIPATH is used concomitantly with digoxin, measure serum calcium and digoxin levels routinely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Refer to the digoxin prescribing information for dose adjustments, if needed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Cardiovascular toxicity related to cancer treatment: a pragmatic approach to the American and European cardio-oncology guidelines [^ec6f61fc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial Fibrillation

What do the Guidelines Say?

Only the ESC‐2016 guidelines provide recommendations regarding the management of AF associated with cancer treatments (Table S9). 9

Which Pragmatic Approach May be Suggested?

The pragmatic harmonized approach proposed by the working group is depicted in Figure 5C.

In summary, the initial approach to manage AF associated with cancer treatment has been chosen according to the 2 usual considerations, namely, the rhythm versus the rate‐control strategy and thromboembolic prophylaxis. 59, 60, 61 Although no score has been validated to predict the thromboembolic and bleeding risk in the context of active cancer, the working group suggests to indicate anticoagulation according to a multiparametric evaluation including the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score; thromboembolic and bleeding risk of the cancer; hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly (> 65 years), drugs/alcohol (HAS‐BLED) score; platelet count; and life expectancy. It seems that lung, gastric, and pancreatic cancer are associated with a high risk of thromboembolic events. 62 Low‐molecular‐weight heparin may be considered as a short‐term measure, while warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants may be considered as long‐term anticoagulation options. The choice should be based on the risk assessment of drug‐drug interactions of each anticoagulant with cancer treatments and the specific bleeding risk of each cancer. Regarding direct oral anticoagulants, Xa inhibitors may be preferred to IIa inhibitors. The uptake of all direct oral anticoagulants is influenced by the P‐glycoprotein system, 60 but dabigatran appears to be the most at‐risk direct oral anticoagulants because of its low bioavailability and important renal elimination, which exposes it to a theoretical increased risk for drug levels outside of the therapeutic range. Regarding the decision on rate versus rhythm control, rate control rather than rhythm control strategy should be preferred, especially if the suspected cancer treatment causing AF is continued. 9, 59, 63 BBs represent the first‐line pharmacological class because of no/few drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments. Digoxin and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) must be avoided because of the high risk of drug‐drug interactions with cancer treatments (P‐glycoprotein system, cytochrome P450 system). 64, 65 A rhythm control strategy can be discussed in patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control or in cases of hemodynamic instability. 9, 59 However, the potential for drug‐drug and QTc interval prolongation must be considered when associating antiarrhythmic with anticancer drugs.

### Management of yellow oleander poisoning [^af9fa34e]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Poisoning due to deliberate self-harm with the seeds of yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) results in significant morbidity and mortality each year in South Asia. Yellow oleander seeds contain highly toxic cardiac glycosides including thevetins A and B and neriifolin. A wide variety of bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias occur following ingestion. Important epidemiological and clinical differences exist between poisoning due to yellow oleander and digoxin; yellow oleander poisoning is commonly seen in younger patients without preexisting illness or comorbidity. Assessment and initial management. Initial assessment and management is similar to other poisonings. No definite criteria are available for risk stratification. Continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 h is necessary to detect arrhythmias; longer monitoring is appropriate in patients with severe poisoning. Supportive care. Correction of dehydration with normal saline is necessary, and antiemetics are used to control severe vomiting. Electrolytes. Hypokalemia worsens toxicity due to digitalis glycosides, and hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Both must be corrected. Hyperkalemia is due to extracellular shift of potassium rather than an increase in total body potassium and is best treated with insulin-dextrose infusion. Intravenous calcium increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and is not recommended in treating hyperkalemia. Oral or rectal administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin may result in hypokalemia when used together with digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Unlike digoxin toxicity, serum magnesium concentrations are less likely to be affected in yellow oleander poisoning. The effect of magnesium concentrations on toxicity and outcome is not known. Hypomagnesaemia should be corrected as it can worsen cardiac glycoside toxicity. Gastric decontamination. The place of emesis induction and gastric lavage has not been investigated, although they are used in practice. Gastric decontamination by the use of single dose and multiple doses of activated charcoal has been evaluated in two randomized controlled trials, with contradictory results. Methodological differences (severity of poisoning in recruited patients, duration of treatment, compliance) between the two trials, together with differences in mortality rates in control groups, have led to much controversy. No firm recommendation for or against the use of multiple doses of activated charcoal can be made at present, and further studies are needed. Single-dose activated charcoal is probably beneficial. Activated charcoal is clearly safe. Arrhythmia management. Bradyarrhythmias are commonly managed with atropine, isoprenaline, and temporary cardiac pacing in severe cases, although without trial evidence of survival benefit, or adequate evaluation of possible risks. Accelerating the heart rate with atropine or beta-adrenergic agents theoretically increases the risk of tachyarrhythmias, and it has been claimed that atropine increases tachyarrhythmic deaths. Further studies are required. Tachyarrhythmias have a poor prognosis and are more difficult to treat. Lidocaine is the preferred antiarrhythmic; the role of intravenous magnesium is uncertain. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments are effective in reverting life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias; prospective observational studies show a beneficial effect on mortality. High cost and lack of availability limit the widespread use of digoxin-specific antibody fragments in developing countries.

Conclusions

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments remain the only proven therapy for yellow oleander poisoning. Further studies are needed to determine the place of activated charcoal, the benefits or risks of atropine and isoprenaline, the place and choice of antiarrhythmics, and the effect of intravenous magnesium in yellow oleander poisoning.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity management (COR I, LOE B-NR) states that administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients who present with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity; typical toxicity produces enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, fascicular or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) suggests digoxin toxicity, and severe overdose causes hyperkalemia and cardiac standstill; mild cases may be managed by discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often used if VAs are present and temporary pacing sometimes needed for atrioventricular block or asystole; for more severe intoxication with serious arrhythmias such as VT and serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL, the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, with one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients showing rapid response (30 minutes to 4 hour) and 54% survival to hospital discharge among those presenting with cardiac arrest, while adverse effects can include worsening of underlying disease and hypokalemia and doses lower than the full neutralizing dose may be effective if cardiac arrest is not imminent.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Monitor serum calcium more frequently when using NATPARA in patients receiving digoxin. (5.5, 7.2)

7.1	Alendronate

Co-administration of alendronate and NATPARA leads to reduction in the calcium-sparing effect, which can interfere with the normalization of serum calcium. Concomitant use of NATPARA with alendronate is not recommended.

7.2	Digoxin

NATPARA causes transient increase in calcium and therefore, concomitant use of NATPARA and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy is reduced if hypocalcemia is present. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digoxin, carefully monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels, and patients for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^6d3a760e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanism and dosage of inotropic agents can cause adverse effects

There is a possibility that the adverse effects of inotropic agents on myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium could explain the results of prior trials: by increasing energy consumption and leading to exhaustion of the energy stores, these agents could promote pump failure as well as ventricular arrhythmias via dysfunctional calcium cycling. In fact, the negative long‐term impact of catecholamines on the heart, and the beneficial impact of β‐blockade, has been demonstrated in several landmark studies. 90 Additionally, data suggest that drugs acting via cAMP modulation lead to adverse effects in the long term by causing desensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium, disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis, causing ventricular arrhythmias, and disrupting lusitropy. Studies have shown that left ventricular function deteriorates to below pre‐treatment levels after withdrawal of inotropes, demonstrating that the therapy accelerates ventricular dysfunction. 91 It is conceivable that β‐adrenergic blocking agents might have prevented this deterioration of ventricular function, but their usage was infrequent during most clinical trials.

An intriguing corollary to the notion that the inotropic effects of drugs might explain their negative impact on clinical outcomes is that many clinical trials studying these agents aimed to maximize their positive haemodynamic effects and used very high doses for this purpose. Similar to the deleterious effects of very high doses of digoxin, it is quite possible that by chasing the wrong intermediate measures of heart failure, prior studies drove up the risk of myocardial toxicity and shifted the risk–benefit equation in the wrong direction. 80 This was articulated by Dr. Milton Packer in a perspective article published in a 1993 issue of JACC — in the aftermath of a large number of negative inotrope trials — where he concluded: 'The belief that positive inotropic agents for heart failure should be developed at inotropic doses may have been the primary factor for the controversy that has surrounded these drugs for the last 200 years'. 80

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity: Administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity. Typical digoxin toxicity arrhythmias include enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, and management in mild cases can include discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often administered if VAs are present; temporary pacing may be needed for atrioventricular block or asystole. For more severe intoxication defined by serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, and in one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, 54% of those presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization.

### DIGOXIN solution… [^7e782a3c]. FDA (DailyMed) (2011). Low credibility.

Studies have shown diminished efficacy at serum levels < 0. 5 ng/mL, while levels above 2 ng/mL are associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit. The inotropic effects of digoxin tend to appear at lower concentrations than the electrophysiological effects. Based on retrospective analysis, adverse events may be higher in the upper therapeutic range.

5. 6 Use During Electrical Cardioversion In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur at concentrations within therapeutic range because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin.

Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Serum potassium levels should be carefully monitored when digoxin is given to patients at high risk of hypokalemia. Digoxin toxicity is also more likely in the presence of hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia is common in most of the same conditions in which hypokalemia appears. Most notably, it is commonly seen in alcoholics and in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypercalcemia. e.g. Because digoxin's therapeutic and toxic effects are all largely mediated by intracellular calcium distribution, they are affected by abnormalities in serum calcium levels.

Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Evidence suggests that the incidence of toxicity has decreased since the introduction of the serum digoxin assay and improved standardization of digoxin tablets. Cardiac toxicity accounts for about one-half, gastrointestinal disturbances for about one-fourth, and CNS and other toxicity for about one-fourth of these adverse reactions. Adverse reactions are less common when digoxin is used within the recommended dose range or therapeutic serum concentration range and when there is careful attention to concurrent medications and conditions.

YORVIPATH increases serum calcium, therefore, concomitant use with digoxin (which has a narrow therapeutic index) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy may be reduced if hypocalcemia is present. When YORVIPATH is used concomitantly with digoxin, measure serum calcium and digoxin levels, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Adjustment of the digoxin and/or YORVIPATH dose may be needed.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Triggered activity in ventricular arrhythmia (VA) describes early and delayed afterdepolarization mechanisms and their clinical associations. Early afterdepolarizations occur during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential and are the trigger for torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with QT prolongation due to medications, other acquired factors, or long QT syndrome. Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization under intracellular calcium overload; contributing factors include tachycardia, catecholamines, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). Delayed afterdepolarizations are the underlying mechanism for VT in digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA, are considered an important trigger of VA in HF, and Purkinje cell susceptibility to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release suggests early and/or delayed afterdepolarizations as a mechanism for some Purkinje fiber–related VA.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^ebdf88ad]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### Digitalis toxicity: a fading but crucial complication to recognize [^f1fd6774]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Digoxin usage has decreased in the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation as a result of its inferiority to beta-adrenergic inhibitors and agents that interfere with the deleterious effects of the activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. As a result of reduction of usage and dosage, glycoside toxicity has become an uncommon occurrence but may be overlooked when it does occur. Older age, female sex, low lean body mass, and renal insufficiency contribute to higher serum levels and enhanced risk for toxicity. Arrhythmias suggesting digoxin toxicity led to its recognition in the case presented here.

Toxicology: digoxin and related cardiac glycosides — clinical synopsis notes that cardiac glycoside poisoning can be caused by medications such as digoxin and digitoxin, plants such as foxglove and oleander, and certain toad venoms ingested as ethnopharmaceuticals or hallucinogens. Patients with cardiac glycoside poisoning may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, confusion, hyperkalemia, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, including atrioventricular nodal block, VT, VF, or asystole. Digoxin-specific immune antibody fragments (eg, digoxin-Fab) bind to and inactivate digoxin and structurally similar cardiac glycosides; different dosing regimens are advocated worldwide and the ideal empirical dose for cardiac arrest is unknown and likely differs for digoxin poisoning compared with other cardiac glycosides. Standard ALS measures for bradycardia, such as atropine and electrical pacing, have variable effectiveness in cardiac glycoside poisoning, and prior recommendations addressing these interventions were removed since they are included as part of standard ALS measures.

The BNF categorises drug-drug interactions by severity and defines potentially serious interactions as ones when "concomitant administration of the drugs involved should be avoided (or only undertaken with caution and appropriate monitoring)". Of note is that the "potentially serious" designation is not an indication of the likelihood of an interaction but of the seriousness of the potential harm if it occurs. The expert panel used the BNF to identify potentially serious interactions between drugs recommended by each of the three index guidelines and drugs recommended by any of the 12 guidelines (as two drugs recommended in the same guideline can interact). The expert panel then classified each identified drug-drug interaction in terms of the type of potential adverse effect caused. Disagreement between panel members was resolved by discussion to reach a consensus view. The potential harms of included interventions were then classified into risk of bleeding; central nervous system toxicity; cardiovascular adverse effect (including change in blood pressure or effect on heart rate or rhythm); and effect on renal function or serum potassium, or other. The "other" classification included risk associated with changes in concentration of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as lithium carbonate, digoxin, and theophylline. We chose these classification categories to reflect the types of adverse drug events associated with emergency admission to hospital.

10.2 Treatment

Chronic Overdose

If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue digoxin and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab.

Acute Overdose

Patients who have intentionally or accidently ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue digoxin until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythma, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80 to 90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.

### Digoxin (digox) [^214c0321]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Treatment of Adverse Reactions Produced by Overdosage: Digoxin should be temporarily discontinued until the adverse reaction resolves. Every effort should also be made to correct factors that may contribute to the adverse reaction (such as electrolyte disturbances or concurrent medications). Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted, following a careful reassessment of dose.

Withdrawal of digoxin may be all that is required to treat the adverse reaction. However, when the primary manifestation of digoxin overdosage is a cardiac arrhythmia, additional therapy may be needed.

If the rhythm disturbance is a symptomatic bradyarrhythmia or heart block, consideration should be given to the reversal of toxicity with DIGIBIND® [Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine)] (see Massive Digitalis Overdosage subsection), the use of atropine, or the insertion of a temporary cardiac pacemaker. However, asymptomatic bradycardia or heart block related to digoxin may require only temporary withdrawal of the drug and cardiac monitoring of the patient.

If the rhythm disturbance is a ventricular arrhythmia, consideration should be given to the correction of electrolyte disorders, particularly if hypokalemia (see Administration of Potassium subsection) or hypomagnesemia is present. DIGIBIND is a specific antidote for digoxin and may be used to reverse potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias due to digoxin overdosage.

### Clinical experience with titrating doses of digoxin antibodies in acute digoxin poisoning. (ATOM-6) [^9ee44800]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For acute digoxin poisoning, it has been recommended to give bolus doses of 10–20 vials or potentially larger than needed doses calculated from dose ingested or the measured concentration. However, a recent revision of internal Poisons Information Centre guidelines prompted a change of our recommendations, specifically instead of large boluses, to use titrating repeated low doses of digoxin antibodies(Digoxin-Fab) based on bedside assessment of cardiac toxicity.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study of patients with acute digoxin poisoning identified through two Poisons Information Centres and three toxicology units. Patient demographics, signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity, doses and response to Digoxin-Fab, free and bound serum digoxin concentrations. Outcomes were recorded and analysed.

Results

From September 2013 to September 2020, 23 patients with 25 presentations (median age 56years, females 56%) were recruited. Median dose ingested was 13mg(IQR: 9.5–25). Median heart rate (HR) was 41 beats/min before treatment. Initial median digoxin and potassium concentrations were 14.5nmol/L (IQR: 10.9–20) [11.2µg/L(IQR: 8.4–15.4)] and 5mmol/L (IQR: 4.5–5.4mmol/L), respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury were present in 22 patients (88%) and 5 patients (20%), respectively. Four patients received an initial bolus dose of Digoxin-Fab of 5–20 vials. Twenty-one patients received repeated titrated doses (1–2 vials) of Digoxin-Fab and the median total dose was 4 vials (IQR: 2–7.5). Median maximal change in HR post-Digoxin-Fab was 19 beats/min. The median potassium concentration decrease post-Digoxin-Fab was 0.3mmol/L. Total dose used in the titration group was 25% and 35% of the predicted doses based on the amount of digoxin ingested or measured serum concentration, respectively. Twelve had free digoxin concentrations measured. Free digoxin concentrations dropped to almost zero after any dose of Digoxin-Fab. Ten patients had a rebound of digoxin > 2.6nmol/L (2µg/L). There were no deaths from acute digoxin toxicity.

Conclusions

The new practice of using small, titrated doses of Digoxin-Fab led to a considerable reduction in total usage and major savings. The clinical response to titrated doses was safe and acceptable in acute digoxin poisoning.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias — triggered activity mechanisms are described, noting that early afterdepolarizations occur during late repolarization and can precipitate torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT), whereas delayed afterdepolarizations arise after repolarization with intracellular calcium overload and underlie VT in specific contexts. Early afterdepolarizations occur "during late phase 2 or early phase 3 of the action potential" and "are the trigger for torsades de pointes VT associated with QT prolongation either induced by medications or other acquired factors or due to mutations of ion channels causing the long QT syndrome". In contrast, "Delayed afterdepolarizations occur after complete membrane repolarization and develop under conditions of intracellular calcium overload", and they are "the underlying mechanism for VT in the setting of digoxin toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and idiopathic outflow tract VA", and are "also considered to be an important trigger of VA in the setting of HF". The substrate may be Purkinje-related, as "Purkinje cells are more susceptible to spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release than ventricular myocytes suggesting that delayed afterdepolarizations may be an important mechanism for some Purkinje fiber-related VA".

The variability in hemodynamic response to calcium observed in human case series, was also seen with atropine, glucagon, and pacemakers. Hemodynamic improvement was reported with levosimendan in two patientsand animals. Digoxin was associated with hemodynamic improvement in dogs, but an inconsistent effect on mortality. Animal studies showed an improvement in blood pressure with the use of liposomes, but this treatment was not tested in humans. The effect of decontamination, on the prevention of toxicity in humans poisoned with CCB was limited to small biaised case series.

Impact on functional outcomes

Functional outcomes were only reported in two case series involving extracorporeal life support in humans. Daubin et al.observed that all survivors in their sample (n = 3) were discharged without cardiovascular or neurological sequelae. Mégarbane et al.reported that three patients treated with extracorporeal life support were symptom-free after one year. However, in isolated case reports, one patient was discharged to a long-term care facilityand another underwent leg amputation.

Impact on other outcomes

Only one observational study concerning high-dose insulin studied the impact on LOS in ICU or hospital, but did not find significant differences in patients who received the therapy. However, no power calculation was done.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^50eac19e]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 chronic heart failure guideline — digoxin adverse effects, toxicity thresholds, and drug interactions: When administered with attention to dose and to factors that alter its disposition, digoxin is well tolerated by most patients with HF, but principal adverse reactions occur primarily with large doses, and the major side effects include cardiac arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurological complaints. Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated with serum digoxin levels greater than 2 ng per mL, though toxicity may occur with lower levels, especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexists. The concomitant use of clarithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone, itraconazole, cyclosporine, verapamil, or quinidine can increase serum digoxin concentrations and may increase the likelihood of digitalis toxicity, and the dose of digoxin should be reduced if treatment with these drugs is initiated. Spironolactone does not inhibit the disposition of digoxin; cross‑reactivity of some digoxin antibody assays with spironolactone confounded earlier attempts to assess the effect of spironolactone on digoxin clearance. In addition, a low lean body mass and impaired renal function can elevate serum digoxin levels, and one analysis suggested that women may not benefit from digoxin therapy and may be at increased risk for death with such therapy.

### Declining public health burden of digoxin toxicity from 1991 to 2004 [^55f1c5db]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that digoxin toxicity has declined in recent years, and that the decline is accompanied by reductions in overall utilization and dose. To analyze trends in digoxin toxicity and utilization from 1991 to 2004, we used surveys from the National Center for Health Statistics and Medicaid data in the United States and The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database in the United Kingdom. There was a significant decline in digoxin toxicity hospitalizations in the United States and a decline in ambulatory digoxin toxicity in the United Kingdom. The study demonstrated a reduction in the use of digoxin in the United States, but found no change in digoxin use in the United Kingdom. Finally, the number of prescriptions written for at least 250 microg decreased in the United States and the United Kingdom. The public health burden of digoxin toxicity declined dramatically from 1991 to 2004 in the United Kingdom and the United States.

### Digoxin-specific antibody fragments in the treatment of digoxin toxicity [^b5dc3705]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab) are widely regarded as a safe and effective treatment for the management of acute and chronic digoxin poisoning. Calculated equimolar doses of digoxin-Fab are high, very expensive, and infrequently used.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, effectiveness, indications, safety and the dosage of digoxin-specific antibody fragments.

Methods

Pubmed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane were searched from 1946 to May 2013 using the terms digoxin, digoxin-specific Fab, and digoxin antibody. Pharmacology and kinetics of digoxin and digoxin-Fab. Digoxin acts via inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. It has a narrow therapeutic index. Digoxin has 60–80% bioavailability, a mean plasma half-life of 40 h and a volume of distribution (Vd) of 5–10 L/kg and low protein binding (20%). A 40-mg vial of digoxin-Fab (DigiFab) binds 0.5 mg digoxin. Digoxin-Fab has a mean plasma half-life of 19–30 h and a Vd of 0.4 L/kg. The half-lives of both digoxin and digoxin-Fab are prolonged in renal failure to over 100 h. Efficacy and effectiveness of digoxin-Fab. There were no randomised clinical trials examining the use of digoxin-Fab for acute or chronic digoxin poisonings. Ten case series with a total of 2,080 patients have reported on the use of digoxin-Fab in digoxin poisoning. In three large case series of 430 acute and 1308 chronic poisonings, response rates to digoxin-Fab vary from 80–90% to 50%. The time for reversal of digoxin toxicity is reported to be 30–45 min. Studies with pharmacokinetic data showed that free digoxin concentration fell to almost zero within a few minutes following the administration of digoxin-Fab. Digoxin-Fab was used more frequently in acute than chronic digoxin poisoning with a higher reported success rate when used in acute overdose. It is sometimes recommended to use full neutralisation doses (based on serum concentration × Vd or ingested dose). It has also been proposed to use half this dose. Indications for digoxin-Fab. Patients who have life-threatening tachy-bradyarrhythmias, hyperkalaemia (> 6 mmol/L) or haemodynamic instability with an elevated digoxin concentration (> 2 μg/L or 2.6 nmol/L). The lowest effective digoxin-Fab dosing regimen has not been established. Safety of digoxin-Fab. Adverse events such as exacerbation of heart failure, increased ventricular rate and hypokalaemia are uncommon (< 10%). Recrudescence of digoxin toxicity and allergic reactions are infrequent. Digoxin-Fab dosing in acute poisoning. Digoxin load based on ingested dose will generally overestimate digoxin-Fab doses as bioavailability is 60–80%, and further reduced by vomiting and activated charcoal. Digoxin load based on concentration also will be overestimated when the concentration is taken before distribution is complete (around 6 h). Much smaller doses of digoxin-Fab can eliminate the digoxin in the central compartment (Vd ≈ 55 L). In imminent cardiac arrest, it may be justified to give a full neutralising dose. Otherwise, based on pharmacokinetic modelling, it is recommended to give 80 mg bolus digoxin-Fab, repeated as required according to clinical parameters because the onset of clinical response is usually rapid. Most patients would be expected to require a total of less than half of the calculated neutralising dose using this strategy. Digoxin-Fab dosing in chronic poisoning. Even if digoxin load is estimated following distribution (> 6 h), excessive neutralisation doses may still be calculated because of variation in Vd due to equations failing to account for lean body weight, age and renal failure. In practice, it is suggested to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if patient is still symptomatic, sooner if patient is clinically unstable. In general, 40–120 mg (1–3 vials) should be sufficient.

Conclusions

Digoxin-Fab is safe and indicated in all patients with life-threatening arrhythmias and an elevated digoxin concentration. However, calculated full neutralising doses of digoxin-Fab are expensive and may not be required. In acute poisoning, a small bolus of 80 mg, repeat if necessary, titrated against clinical effect, is likely to achieve equivalent benefits with much lower total doses. With chronic poisoning, it may be simplest to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if there is no response.

Digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) dosing and response in digoxin toxicity — Each vial of 40 mg of digoxin Fab binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin, and clinical response rates are as high as 80% to 90%, particularly in the acute setting. Patients with hyperkalemia or arrhythmias in the setting of digoxin serum levels of > 2 ng/mL are at increased risk of death, and potassium levels should be monitored; adverse events attributable to digoxin Fab therapy are described as rare and usually clinically insignificant.

### The effect of digoxin on renal function in patients with heart failure [^51475d8d]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The effect of worsening renal function on digoxin toxicity is well known. In end-stage renal disease, the fluctuating concentration of potassium during dialysis may increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. In patients with end stage renal failure, mortality increases with increasing serum digoxin levels. The sodium/potassium ATPase pump normally causes sodium to leave cells and potassium to enter cells, blocking this mechanism using digoxin results in higher serum potassium levels. In a study by Edner and colleagues of 10 healthy subjects, compared to no digitaliation, patients given 0.37–0.50 mg of digoxin daily for 10 days had an increase in serum potassium by 0.19 ± 0.23 mmol/l (p < 0.05) When renal potassium excretion is reduced due to reduction in kidney function, even slow-acting glyeosides should provoke hyperkalemia.

Whether digoxin affects renal function is not fully understood. We found that patients on digoxin had a significantly faster rate of decline in eGFR. However, in subgroup analysis of patients in the DIG trial who had their creatinine measured at 1 year, renal function improved more in patients in the digoxin group than in those taking placebo. Mortality in DIG did not vary with the use of digoxin in relation to renal function, although lower doses of digoxin were prescribed to patients with the lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), presumably as a result of dose adjustment for renal function.

Digoxin is a negatively chronotropic and positively inotropic agent. It inhibits the Na + /K + -ATPase resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium ions leading to its positive inotropic effect. The negatively chronotropic effect is via an incompletely understood vagotonic effect. Apart from its cardiac uses, cardiac glycosides have been implicated in the regulation of many other physiological and pathophysiological processes. The cardiac glycoside, neriifolin, reduces cerebral infarct size in rodent cerebral hypoxia–ischemia models. Digitalis blocks cell proliferation and non-toxic doses of digitalis can induce apoptosis in different malignant cell lines. Digoxin might thus be useful in diseases associated with autotic cell death or autophagy in the kidneys.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — anti-digoxin Fab evidence and dialysis: There are no RCTs of anti-digoxin Fab for treatment of digitalis overdose, and a systematic review of observational series including a total 2080 patients reported a clinical response of improvement to reversal of symptoms in 50% to 90% of patients within 30 to 45 minutes, with adverse effects occurring in < 10% of patients. A systematic review comprising 84 patients found that digoxin is only slightly dialyzable and that dialysis is unlikely to improve the outcome of patients with digoxin toxicity, although hemodialysis may be considered for treatment of associated life-threatening hyperkalemia.

### Calcium currents and arrhythmias: insights from molecular biology [^3846452d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium channels are critical to normal cardiac function. They are involved in the generation and conduction of the action potential and in contraction. Three surface membrane channels have been identified. The L-type Ca channel is most abundant and is responsible for Ca entry into the cell that triggers contraction. T-type Ca channels are most prevalent in the conduction system and are probably involved in automaticity. A newly described TTX-sensitive calcium current may be important in "boosting" or enhancing conduction and contraction. The main intracellular Ca channel resides in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for the release of the Ca that activates contraction. Oscillatory behavior of this channel influences the sarcolemmal membrane, causing delayed aftercontractions and arrhythmias such as those seen in digoxin toxicity. The on-going molecular characterization of these channels will enhance our knowledge of their normal function and dysfunction in disease states, leading to the development of new therapeutic agents to treat arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction.

Reversible causes — evaluation, Lyme carditis, and drug toxicity: In patients presenting with new atrioventricular (AV) block, medical evaluation may disclose treatable or reversible causes, the treatment or resolution of which may make permanent pacing unnecessary. Lyme carditis is one of the more common reversible causes and should be sought in appropriate patients, as AV block in such cases is almost always reversible; the most common manifestation is AV block, usually at the atrioventricular nodal level. Approximately 40% of clinically identified patients require temporary pacing, and in 1 review the median time to resolution of AV block was 6 days with a range out to 42 days; permanent AV block after antibiotic therapy is rare. Digoxin toxicity may be reversed with drug washout or neutralizing antibody fragment therapy, yet it still occurs despite lower chronic doses and serum level testing; therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic drugs, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are not commonly responsible for new AV block and most patients in that scenario ultimately require permanent pacing. Treatment of hypothyroidism suggested by laboratory testing and cardiac sarcoidosis associated with new AV block usually does not make permanent pacing unnecessary when otherwise indicated.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^86647213]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers: Metoprolol Extended Release, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown benefits in HFrEF. Similar to above, their role in HFpEF is limited to treating underlying conditions (eg, atrial arrhythmias). 30

Digoxin: The use of digoxin for chronic heart failure has declined as benefits appear to be limited to symptomatic relief without mortality benefit. Furthermore, appropriate management is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL) and older adults in particular are at risk for digoxin toxicity secondary to declining renal drug clearance. In this case it is imperative that renal function be monitored frequently to minimize drug accumulation. Prior to initiating digoxin in older adults, optimization of first‐line guideline‐directed medical therapy should be performed. Discontinuation of digoxin should be considered but requires monitoring for signs of worsening symptoms as stopping therapy may be associated with poorer outcomes among patients with heart failure. 41

On‐going goals of care discussions are paramount as patients' heart failure progresses towards advanced stages. Quality of life can be greatly improved by simplification of the medical regimen. Review and assess the tolerability of recommended therapies and eliminate adjuvant agents that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms (sotalol, dronedarone, propafenone, verapamil, diltiazem, cilostazol, metformin, thiazolidinediones, NSAIDs, etc). 42

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^f527aaa7]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients refractory to the first-line treatments, the workgroup considered therapies supported by a limited number of case series and associated with a moderate risk. The workgroup kept therapies associated with higher risks for rescue treatments. Therefore, in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, the workgroup suggested to titrate high-dose insulin infusion rates up to 10 U/kg/hr to improve inotropy and facilitates the use of carbohydrates by the myocardium with a dextrose infusion to maintain euglycemia if needed. Pacing has been associated with frequent capture and pacing problems. However, there may be hemodynamic improvement in patients presenting with unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block. To avoid spending time on a therapy that involves risk and may not be effective, the workgroup suggested to attempt transcutaneous pacing first. If transcutaneous pacing is effective, IV pacing can be instituted when clinically appropriate.

Based on possible hemodynamic improvement documented in animal studies, case series and case reports, the workgroup also suggested the use of lipid-emulsion therapy. However, this is not recommended earlier in therapy in the absence of cardiac arrest, given the inconsistent response and the concern of potentially increasing the absorption of medications still present in the gastrointestinal tract by changing the distribution of the CCB. This concern was reported in an animal study only published as an abstract at the time of analysis showing worse outcomes with an oral model of CCB poisoning. The workgroup felt that there were insufficient data to recommend a specific dose regimen of lipid-emulsion therapy. The dose most commonly used is 1.5 mL/kg of 20% lipid emulsion administered as a bolus, repeated up to twice as needed until clinical stability is achieved, and followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for 30–60 minutes. The Food and Drug Administration fixed a maximum total dose administered per 24 hour of 12.5 mL/kg.

### Digoxin (digox) [^d8e1514c]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of Potassium: Every effort should be made to maintain the serum potassium concentration between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and the serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered cautiously by the intravenous route. The electrocardiogram should be monitored for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Potassium salts may be dangerous in patients who manifest bradycardia or heart block due to digoxin (unless primarily related to supraventricular tachycardia) and in the setting of massive digitalis overdosage (see Massive Digitalis Overdosage subsection).

Massive Digitalis Overdosage: Manifestations of life-threatening toxicity include ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or progressive bradyarrhythmias, or heart block. The administration of more than 10 mg of digoxin in a previously healthy adult, or more than 4 mg in a previously healthy child, or a steady-state serum concentration greater than 10 ng/mL often results in cardiac arrest.

DIGIBIND should be used to reverse the toxic effects of ingestion of a massive overdose. The decision to administer DIGIBIND to a patient who has ingested a massive dose of digoxin but who has not yet manifested life-threatening toxicity should depend on the likelihood that life-threatening toxicity will occur (see above).

Patients with massive digitalis ingestion should receive large doses of activated charcoal to prevent absorption and bind digoxin in the gut during enteroenteric recirculation. Emesis or gastric lavage may be indicated especially if ingestion has occurred withing 30 minutes of the patient's presentation at the hospital. Emesis should not be induced in patients who are obtunded. If a patient presents more than 2 hours after ingestion or already has toxic manifestations, it may be unsafe to induce vomiting or attempt passage of a gastric tube, because such maneuvers may induce an acute vagal episode that can worsen digitalis-related arrhythmias.

Severe digitalis intoxication can cause a massive shift of potassium from inside to outside the cell, leading to life-threatening hyperkalemia. The administration of potassium supplements in the setting of massive intoxication may be hazardous and should be avoided. Hyperkalemia caused be massive digitalis toxicity is best treated with DIGIBIND; initial treatment with glucose and insulin may also be required if hyperkalemia itself is acutely life-threatening.

Methods

Eligibility criteria and search strategy

We evaluated all studies that examined comparative outcomes with digoxin and control (placebo or no treatment), regardless of study design. All cardiovascular outcomes and all populations were included. We excluded studies that did not provide comparative outcomes or were not published as full text articles in English. The definitions of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction used by each individual study were accepted. We systematically reviewed Medline (1960 to July 2014), Embase (1980 to July 2014), and the Cochrane Library (until July 2014 Issue). The search strategy included keywords and MeSH terms relating to cardiac glycosides and death, admission to hospital, or other cardiovascular outcomes. We also manually searched reference lists of relevant studies, investigated registers of ongoing trials, and included studies after discussion with content experts.

The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The project was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010783).
