## Question

A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with vague abdominal discomfort and mild jaundice. He has a history of hypertension and smokes one pack of cigarettes daily. On examination, he appears anxious but is oriented. His wife mentions he has been missing work and seems withdrawn lately. Laboratory results show mildly elevated liver enzymes. The emergency physician suspects possible alcohol-related liver disease.

According to current EASL guidelines, what specific steps should the emergency physician take to screen this patient for alcohol abuse and related disorders?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what specific steps the emergency physician should take to screen a 45-year-old man with vague abdominal discomfort, mild jaundice, and mildly elevated liver enzymes for alcohol use disorder and related conditions, according to current EASL guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this presentation raises suspicion for alcohol-related liver disease. Then, I should verify the EASL-recommended screening tools and how to apply them. Next, I will consider adjunctive alcohol biomarkers and their limitations. After that, I need to check for concurrent psychiatric and substance use comorbidities. Then, I should confirm the initial liver disease workup and noninvasive fibrosis assessment. Finally, I will outline immediate management steps, including brief intervention, referral pathways, and documentation, and I will reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why alcohol-related liver disease is on the table. The combination of jaundice, even if mild, with abnormal liver enzymes in a middle-aged man with heavy smoking and functional decline (missing work, withdrawal) is a red flag for harmful alcohol use and possible ALD, and EASL explicitly recommends screening for harmful alcohol consumption in emergency departments, which fits this scenario [^bc9b39d3] [^b3123f76].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology before proceeding. EASL advises using "alcohol use disorder" per DSM-5 rather than outdated terms like "alcohol abuse" or "alcohol dependence", so I should frame the assessment and documentation around AUD severity and DSM-5 criteria rather than legacy labels [^fbf7366b].

> Next, I should review the primary screening tool. EASL recommends the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or its concise version (AUDIT-C) to screen for AUD and dependence; given the ED setting, AUDIT-C is efficient and validated for initial screening, with thresholds of ≥ 4 in men suggesting hazardous use and prompting full AUDIT or further assessment, so I will start with AUDIT-C and escalate to the full AUDIT if positive or if clinical suspicion remains high [^0dd8927b] [^b2f374b8] [^c9e2696b].

> Hold on, I should verify adjunctive tools and not jump to conclusions. While CAGE is commonly used, EASL specifically endorses AUDIT/AUDIT-C for screening in this context; CAGE can miss harmful use that is not yet dependent, so I will prioritize AUDIT-based tools and reserve CAGE for rapid triage only if needed, keeping in mind that a single-question screen for binge drinking can be a quick trigger for fuller assessment but does not replace validated tools [^0dd8927b] [^c9e2696b].

> I need to check the role of alcohol biomarkers because underreporting is common. EASL supports using biomarkers as adjuncts; phosphatidylethanol (PEth) detects use over roughly 1–2 weeks, urine ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) over 3–7 days, and hair EtG over 3–6 months, and importantly, EtG/EtS and PEth are not confounded by liver disease, unlike GGT or CDT, which can be misleading in advanced liver injury; I should tailor the biomarker to the suspected window and interpret results alongside clinical context to avoid false positives or negatives [^41a9942b] [^27c84411] [^61f11d8e].

> Let me consider psychiatric and substance use comorbidities next. EASL recommends screening all patients with AUD for concurrent psychiatric disorders and other addictions; given the patient's withdrawal and functional decline, I should screen for depression and anxiety using brief tools like PHQ-2 and GAD-2, and ask about other substances, because these comorbidities increase relapse risk and shape treatment planning and referral urgency [^b3510d66] [^9989e7c3] [^ca09b55f].

> I will now examine the initial liver disease workup and fibrosis assessment. EASL advises determining liver function tests and measuring liver fibrosis in patients with AUD; noninvasive fibrosis assessment with transient elastography (FibroScan) or serum scores (e.g. FIB-4) helps stage disease and guide referral, and I should also obtain CBC, INR, and albumin to assess synthetic function and screen for complications of advanced disease, while remembering that an AST:ALT ratio > 1.5 supports alcoholic injury but is not diagnostic by itself [^e2bc50b1] [^e85ce5bb] [^7badfafa].

> But wait, what if this is alcoholic hepatitis rather than stable chronic disease. I should double-check for features of acute alcoholic hepatitis: rapid onset or worsening jaundice, bilirubin > 3 mg/dL, AST/ALT > 1.5× ULN but < 400 U/L with AST:ALT ratio > 1.5, and heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks prior; if suspected, I should hospitalize, assess severity (Maddrey's discriminant function or MELD), and consider corticosteroids in severe cases, ideally with early hepatology input and close monitoring for infection and renal failure [^7bb0a1ab] [^243d4f36] [^5697434d].

> Next, I should review immediate management steps. EASL recommends offering a brief intervention to all patients identified with harmful use or AUD, and referring to a multidisciplinary team; in the ED, that means providing brief motivational counseling, initiating withdrawal risk assessment (CIWA-Ar), and arranging linkage to addiction services and hepatology, with a low threshold for inpatient detoxification if high risk or decompensated disease is present [^53165458] [^418a8ac3] [^ed59dbc0].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacotherapy considerations. EASL notes that pharmacotherapy for AUD can be considered in patients with ALD, with baclofen favored in cirrhosis and acamprosate or naltrexone considered based on liver function and comorbidities; I should coordinate this with addiction specialists and ensure safety in the context of liver disease before prescribing [^e317a4cd] [^d61ae8e7].

> I need to ensure documentation is complete and nonjudgmental. I should record the AUDIT-C score, any full AUDIT results, biomarker choices and rationale, psychiatric screening results, liver test abnormalities, fibrosis assessment plan, and the agreed-upon goals, including abstinence counseling and referral appointments, using person-first, nonstigmatizing language consistent with EASL's terminology shift toward AUD rather than "alcoholic" [^fbf7366b] [^a493091e].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting guidance. Initially, I thought CAGE might suffice for a rapid ED screen, but EASL specifically recommends AUDIT/AUDIT-C for this setting, so I should adhere to EASL's preferred tools and reserve CAGE only if AUDIT cannot be completed and follow-up is assured; likewise, while some pathways mention ultrasound early, EASL emphasizes noninvasive fibrosis assessment and general cirrhosis screening principles rather than mandating immediate ultrasound, so I should individualize imaging based on clinical judgment and local pathways while ensuring fibrosis staging is addressed [^0dd8927b] [^e2bc50b1] [^f2b4e3b0].

> In summary, I should confirm suspicion with AUDIT-C, escalate to full AUDIT if positive, add targeted biomarkers to corroborate use, screen for psychiatric and other substance use comorbidities, assess liver disease severity and fibrosis noninvasively, evaluate for alcoholic hepatitis if features are present, deliver a brief intervention, and arrange expedited referral to addiction services and hepatology, documenting everything using DSM-5-aligned AUD terminology and ensuring safety for withdrawal and comorbidities [^0dd8927b] [^b2f374b8] [^b3510d66] [^e2bc50b1] [^53165458] [^418a8ac3] [^fbf7366b].

---

Per EASL guidance, the emergency physician should **screen for alcohol use disorder with AUDIT or AUDIT-C** [^0dd8927b] [^b2f374b8] and **assess for harmful alcohol use** [^bc9b39d3] in all patients with suspected alcohol-related liver disease. Concurrently, **evaluate for psychiatric comorbidities and other addictions** [^b3510d66] [^9989e7c3], and **order liver tests and noninvasive fibrosis assessment** (e.g. transient elastography) to stage liver disease [^e2bc50b1] [^e85ce7bb]. If alcohol use disorder is identified, **refer to a multidisciplinary team** [^418a8ac3] for integrated care and consider pharmacotherapy [^e317a4cd] [^d61ae8e7].

---

## Recommended screening tools for alcohol use disorder

EASL recommends the following **validated screening tools** for alcohol use disorder (AUD):

- **Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)**: A 10-item questionnaire that assesses alcohol consumption, dependence symptoms, and alcohol-related problems [^0dd8927b] [^b2f374b8].

- **Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (AUDIT-C)**: A 3-item version of AUDIT that focuses on consumption and is suitable for rapid screening in clinical settings [^0dd8927b] [^b2f374b8].

These tools help identify patients with harmful alcohol use or dependence and guide further evaluation and management [^c9e2696b].

---

## Clinical assessment of alcohol consumption

In addition to standardized screening tools, the emergency physician should conduct a **comprehensive clinical assessment** of alcohol consumption, including:

- **Quantity and frequency**: Document the average number of drinks per day, number of drinking days per week, and any binge drinking episodes [^bb2df61c].

- **Pattern of use**: Assess for daily use, binge drinking, or intermittent heavy use [^c9e2696b].

- **Duration**: Determine the length of time the patient has been consuming alcohol at harmful levels [^notfound].

- **Recent changes**: Identify any recent increases or decreases in alcohol consumption [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation for psychiatric comorbidities and other addictions

Patients with alcohol use disorder frequently have **coexisting psychiatric conditions** (e.g. depression, anxiety) and other substance use disorders. EASL recommends screening for these comorbidities using validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) for anxiety [^ca09b55f]. Identifying and addressing these comorbidities is essential for effective management and relapse prevention [^ca09b55f].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are essential to assess the extent of **alcohol-related liver injury** and to exclude other causes of liver disease. EASL recommends the following tests:

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) [^e2bc50b1] [^e85ce7bb].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytopenia [^3aca242b].

- **Noninvasive fibrosis assessment**: Transient elastography (FibroScan) or shear wave elastography to assess the degree of liver fibrosis [^notfound].

---

## Indications for further diagnostic evaluation

Further diagnostic evaluation is indicated if:

- **Severe liver injury**: Significant elevation of liver enzymes, jaundice, or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation (e.g. encephalopathy, ascites) [^7bb0a1ab].

- **Uncertain diagnosis**: Suspicion of alternative or additional liver diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) [^6b947ede].

- **Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis**: Noninvasive tests suggest advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, warranting further evaluation and management [^e2bc50b1].

---

## Management and referral

If alcohol use disorder is identified, EASL recommends the following **management steps**:

- **Brief intervention**: Provide brief motivational counseling to encourage abstinence or significant reduction in alcohol consumption [^53165458] [^5cf23477].

- **Multidisciplinary referral**: Refer the patient to a multidisciplinary team specializing in alcohol-related liver disease and alcohol use disorder management [^418a8ac3] [^70bfadec].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider medications such as baclofen, acamprosate, or naltrexone, tailored to the patient's liver function and comorbidities [^e317a4cd] [^d61ae8e7].

- **Follow-up care**: Arrange regular follow-up to monitor liver function, adherence to treatment, and relapse prevention [^e2bc50b1].

### Alcohol-associated liver disease: integrated management with alcohol use disorder [^1a50fdce]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in many regions worldwide. Around 75% of patients with cirrhosis are unaware of their disease until they are referred to the emergency department. An innovative, noninvasive screening approach is required for an earlier diagnosis of liver fibrosis. In patients with ALD the physician is inevitably dealing with 2 major disorders: the liver disease itself and the alcohol use disorder (AUD). Focus only on the liver disease will inevitably lead to failure because transient improvements in liver function are rapidly overturned if the patient returns to alcohol consumption. For this reason, integrated models of care provided by hepatologists and addiction specialists are an effective approach, which are, however, not widely available. There are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies for AUD. Progress has recently been made in the management of patients with severe AH who have improved survival through better understanding of the concept of response to medical treatment, improved survival prediction, and the advent of early liver transplantation. The emerging concept is that listing for transplantation a patient with severe ALD could lead to adjusting the duration of abstinence according to the severity and evolution of liver dysfunction and the patient's addictive profile.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on acute-on-chronic liver failure [^0774bea2]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which was described relatively recently (2013), is a severe form of acutely decompensated cirrhosis characterised by the existence of organ system failure(s) and a high risk of short-term mortality. ACLF is caused by an excessive systemic inflammatory response triggered by precipitants that are clinically apparent (e.g., proven microbial infection with sepsis, severe alcohol-related hepatitis) or not. Since the description of ACLF, some important studies have suggested that patients with ACLF may benefit from liver transplantation and because of this, should be urgently stabilised for transplantation by receiving appropriate treatment of identified precipitants, and full general management, including support of organ systems in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of the present Clinical Practice Guidelines is to provide recommendations to help clinicians recognise ACLF, make triage decisions (ICU vs. no ICU), identify and manage acute precipitants, identify organ systems that require support or replacement, define potential criteria for futility of intensive care, and identify potential indications for liver transplantation. Based on an in-depth review of the relevant literature, we provide recommendations to navigate clinical dilemmas followed by supporting text. The recommendations are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system and categorised as 'weak' or 'strong'. We aim to provide the best available evidence to aid the clinical decision-making process in the management of patients with ACLF.

Quality standards

Prehospital assessment and management of ALD

People who are being asked about their alcohol use should have a validated alcohol questionnaire completed to identify any need for intervention

All patients in primary care should have an accurate recording of alcohol intake, which includes both quantity and frequency, updated at registration and opportunistically with a special focus on people who have an alcohol-related condition or who are at increased risk of harm from alcohol. This is in line with the Public Health England initiative 'Making every contact count'. Patients who drink above the recommended limits should be screened for alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a validated formal tool, for example alcohol use disorders identification test- C (AUDIT-C) or fast alcohol screening test (FAST). Those identified as drinking at higher risk or hazardous levels (35 units/week in women, 50 units/week in men) should receive feedback; a brief intervention and written information on their alcohol intake and how to address it. Screening should occur at least annually for those deemed by clinical judgement to be at high risk of alcohol-related morbidity including (but not limited to) significant mental health problems and metabolic risk factors.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (AASLD practice guidance) — screening and preferred biomarkers: All patients receiving care in primary care and gastroenterology/hepatology outpatient clinics, emergency departments, and inpatient admissions should be screened routinely for alcohol use using validated questionnaires, and brief intervention, pharmacotherapy, and referral to treatment should be offered to patients engaged in hazardous drinking (AUDIT-C ≥ 4, AUDIT > 8, binge drinkers). Alcohol biomarkers can be used to aid in diagnosis and support recovery, and urine and hair ethyl glucuronide (EtG), urine ethyl sulfate (EtS), and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) are not affected by liver disease, and therefore are preferable.

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) burden, risk thresholds, and diagnostic principles are outlined as follows: ALD is "a leading cause of preventable liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, including the United States". Harmful drinking "(≥ 3 drinks/d or ≥ 21/wk in men and ≥ 2 drinks/d or ≥ 14/wk in women) is a risk factor for liver damage and ALD". "The diagnosis of ALD requires identification of chronic, harmful alcohol use, by patient report or detection of alcohol biomarkers, and exclusion of other diseases affecting the liver". Management emphasizes that "Treatment of AUD with achievement of sustained abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression and improve long-term outcomes at any stage of ALD", and "Liver transplantation (LT) remains a definitive treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease due to alcohol-associated cirrhosis and/or HCC".

Patients presenting to hospital with liver disease should be screened for AUD and an estimation of typical number of units of alcohol per week recorded

Evaluation of alcohol intake is important for accurate diagnosis of liver disease and assessing the need for management of alcohol withdrawal. Screening for AUD should be done with validated tools such as AUDIT or its abbreviated forms such as AUDIT-C or FAST. Integrated care of liver disease and AUD requires the engagement of multiple practitioners to be effective and relies on prompt identification of patients who need care. All those experiencing alcohol dependence should be monitored for the early signs of alcohol withdrawal (for example sweats, tremor, craving or agitation). Those typically drinking daily > 15 units of alcohol are likely to experience moderate dependence. Those typically drinking daily > 30 units of alcohol are likely to experience severe alcohol dependence and at greater risk of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In addition to the direct management of ALD, there is value in systematic screening for alcohol misuse in all patients admitted to hospital to better manage alcohol withdrawal and to identify those at risk of liver disease.

Patients admitted to hospital with ALD should be reviewed by a clinician trained in hepatology and the management of alcohol withdrawal within 24 hours of admission

Early consultant review improves outcomes in hospital admissions. In patients with acutely decompensated ALD who may also require management of alcohol withdrawal, this complexity requires early specialist review. Timely review by senior specialist clinicians has been shown to reduce early mortality in patients admitted with decompensated liver disease. All patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis should have their initial management guided by the BSG/BASL Decompensated Cirrhosis Care Bundle.

Alcohol use screening — NIAAA one-question screen and AUDIT/AUDIT-C thresholds are delineated as follows: The NIAAA recommends a one-question initial screen asking "How many times in the past year have you had 5 or more drinks in a day (for men) or 4 or more drinks in a day (for women)?", noting this is the NIAAA definition of binge drinking "(five drinks in men; four in women over 2 hours)". If the patient reports even a single episode, performing the Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Test (AUDIT) is recommended. The original AUDIT includes 10 questions covering consumption (Q1-Q3), dependence symptoms (Q4-Q6), and alcohol-associated problems (Q7-Q10); questions 1–3 are often used alone as the "AUDIT-C", but this shorter form does not provide information on more severe alcohol use problems. AUDIT-C scores of at least 4–5 may indicate harmful alcohol use, and these screening tests do not provide a diagnosis of AUD but rather point to the need for a formal assessment.

The term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction. In the context of hepatological practice, however, ALF refers to a highly specific and rare syndrome, characterised by an acute abnormality of liver blood tests in an individual without underlying chronic liver disease. The disease process is associated with development of a coagulopathy of liver aetiology, and clinically apparent altered level of consciousness due to hepatic encephalopathy. Several important measures are immediately necessary when the patient presents for medical attention. These, as well as additional clinical procedures will be the subject of these clinical practice guidelines.

Conclusion

ALD continues to be a major cause of ill health and premature mortality. These quality standards should be used alongside clinical guidelines from other organisations and local protocols to direct the treatment of patients with ALD. Despite the prevalence of ALD, research has historically lagged behind other less common causes of liver disease. As such there remains some uncertainty about the best management of ALD. We have highlighted particular aspects of the care of patients with ALD that we feel are most in need of examination (online supplemental file 1). As information from clinical audit and research emerges, it is likely that these standards will need to be updated so that they remain relevant. It is hoped that these evidence-based quality standards will improve the care of ALD and reduce variation between units.

### Key takeaways from the updated multidisciplinary European MASLD guidelines [^4f169a0b]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, there is a grey area in the diagnosis of MASLD, MetALD and ALD, which can largely be attributed to the difficulties in reliably assessing alcohol use. Alcohol use is generally under-reported in clinical practice and clinical trial settings. Consequently, there is a great risk of misclassifying SLD. A recent registry-based cohort study found that up to 17% of individuals diagnosed with MASLD (ie, without significant alcohol use) were diagnosed with ALD or alcohol use disorder before or after their MASLD diagnosis. Therefore, the EASL–EASD–EASO MASLD guidelines recommend documenting past and present alcohol intake in all individuals with SLD, using validated instruments of specific biomarkers when available, and discouraging alcohol use in individuals with SLD.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can present with any recognised pattern of liver enzyme derangement.
Diagnosis is complex, with no unifying criteria and a relatively high index of suspicion is necessary.
Coexistent liver disease is an apparent risk factor for DILI.
Standard assessment includes liver ultrasonography and screening for viral and autoimmune hepatitides.
Histology may be useful in prognostication, particularly for those with slow to resolve disease or where there is diagnostic ambiguity.
The mainstay of treatment is withdrawal of the offending agent.
Clinicians may refer to LiverTox as a guide to recorded hepatotoxicity of specific agents.

Introduction

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is the major driver of liver-related morbidity and mortality in the UK. In 2019–2020, there were 74 220 admissions to hospital in England due to ALDand 13 269 premature deaths (before the age of 75) between 2017 and 2019. National Health Service (NHS) care for people with significant ALD is a major cost to the NHS — £1.8 billion for inpatient care related to alcohol. ALD is intrinsically linked to alcohol misuse as the primary cause of liver disease, and in addition to the health costs of ALD, alcohol misuse is also causally associated to over 200 medical conditions and societal harms such as accidents, absenteeism and crime. ALD is part of a wider spectrum of alcohol-related disease, which is linked to important comorbidities particularly mental health issues, cardiovascular disease and cancer, and to other determinants of well-being particularly deprivation. Recent data from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities have highlighted the worsening situation: in 2020, 5608 alcoholic liver deaths were recorded in England, a rise of almost 21% compared with 2019. The spike in alcoholic liver deaths in 2020 occurred after a 43% increase in alcoholic liver deaths between 2001 and 2019. The same publication highlighted that alcohol specific deaths have risen significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The treatment of ALD, therefore, requires the input of multiple practitioners and multiple different agencies.

ALD remains difficult to treat: a survey of outcomes from hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the national confidential enquiry into patient outcomes and death found that death rates for patients remained high between two iterations of the survey in 2011 and 2019, and evidence of significant variations in care between centres. This is consistent with NHS England data showing marked differences in the rates of death from liver disease across the countryand the observation that people with advanced liver disease admitted to hospital in emergency are 7–8 times more likely to die than those admitted for stroke or heart attack.

Treatment guidelines for ALD have been produced by specialist hepatology societies to support the medical treatment of ALD, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has also produced guidance in the UKalthough this document has not been updated since 2017. The purpose of this initiative is to develop standards that would support the delivery of high-quality care for patients with ALD and reduce variation between areas.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults… [^3aca242b]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg per dL. It can be difficult to detect by physical examination alone. 1 Acute jaundice is often an indicator of significant underlying disease and occurs secondary to intra- and extrahepatic etiologies. A retrospective study of more than 700 individuals found that most cases of acute jaundice in adults are caused by intrahepatic disorders, including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury. The remaining 45% of acute jaundice cases are extrahepatic and include gallstone disease, hemolysis, and malignancy. 2 This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of jaundice in adults and reviews common etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia. An algorithm for the evaluation of jaundice in adults is provided in Figure 1.
3. 4, 6 Jaundice occurs when there are disruptions along this metabolic pathway, causing an increase in unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin. History and Physical Examination The initial workup of jaundice should focus on the history and physical examination to help clarify the diagnosis. A detailed alcohol and drug use history can help identify intrahepatic disorders such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, chronic liver disease, or drug-induced liver injury. A focused review of systems is important. For example, fever and prodromal viral symptoms can precede acute viral hepatitis, fever can be associated with underlying sepsis, and weight loss can be associated with underlying malignancy.

The physical examination should include evaluation for underlying encephalopathy by testing for asterixis and mental status changes; evaluation of signs of chronic liver disease to include bruising, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and gynecomastia; and a complete abdominal examination to evaluate for hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, right upper quadrant tenderness, and ascites. 3, 7. Laboratory Evaluation The laboratory evaluation to determine the etiology of jaundice should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, γ-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. 7 Fractionated bilirubinemia is required to differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

A complete blood count with a peripheral blood smear can help identify hemolysis and evaluate for anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytopenia, which is common in decompensated cirrhosis. Elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels can indicate hepatocellular damage. However, levels may be normal in chronic liver disease. In such cases, there may not be enough normal liver parenchymal tissue to release elevated levels of these enzymes. 7 Protein, albumin, and prothrombin time or international normalized ratio are associated with liver synthetic function. Low levels of protein and albumin, or elevated prothrombin time or international normalized ratio, indicate decreased synthetic function and hepatic decompensation.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis" for alcohol-related liver disease.

The diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with this specific form of liver disease. The target patient population includes individuals with a history of heavy alcohol use and presenting symptoms consistent with liver disease.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include five key elements. The first is the rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications. The second component is a serum total bilirubin level greater than 51 mcmol/L or 3 mg/dL. The third element involves elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), specifically, these should be more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but less than 400 U/L, with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.5. The fourth component requires documentation of heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks before the onset of symptoms. The final element is the exclusion of other liver diseases.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all five components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are not met. This tool aids clinicians in accurately diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis, thereby facilitating appropriate treatment and management of the condition.

The purpose of this tool is to determine whether the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are met, based on specific clinical indicators and patient history. It involves selecting relevant criteria from a list that focuses on liver function and alcohol consumption history. Here are the criteria used for the assessment:

- Rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications.
- Serum total bilirubin greater than 51 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) or 3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).
- Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but less than 400 units per liter (U/L), with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.5.
- Documentation of heavy alcohol use up to 8 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
- Exclusion of other liver diseases.

The tool checks each selected option against these criteria. If all five conditions are met, the result is that the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are confirmed. If any one or more of these criteria are not satisfied, the tool concludes that the criteria are not fully met. This method allows for a systematic and comprehensive assessment based on user inputs regarding each specified criterion.

Moderate alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is described and management priorities are outlined. Such patients might be classified as having moderate AH (which would be defined as having a MELD ≤ 20 or MDF < 32). Although there is no well-established therapy for these patients, medical attention should focus on the diagnosis of disease, patient education, referral, and interdisciplinary management of these patients with AUD treatment specialists to achieve alcohol cessation. Early detection of "subclinical" ALD and prevention of progression to AC should be a management goal in both the primary care setting as well as in hepatology referrals.

Identification and diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal — A. Identification: Recommendation I.1 states to "Incorporate universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use into medical settings using a validated scale to help identify patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal". Recommendation I.2 instructs that for patients known to be using alcohol regularly, "assess their risk of developing alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of signs and symptoms". For patients with suggestive signs or symptoms, Recommendation I.3 directs to "assess the quantity, frequency, and time of day when alcohol was last consumed" and notes that "For this assessment, it may be helpful to" use "a scale that screens for unhealthy alcohol use", use "information from collateral sources (i.e., family and friends)", and "conduct a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function". Recommendation I.4 adds that "A biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use may be helpful for identifying recent alcohol use, particularly in patients unable to communicate or otherwise give an alcohol use history", to "consider the range of time (window of detection)", and "Do not rule out the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the result of a test is negative". Standard assessments cited "to identify patients at risk of alcohol withdrawal include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), CAGE, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Piccinelli Consumption (AUDIT-PC)", and in a retrospective case-control study "an initial AUDIT-PC score ≥ 4" identified patients who developed alcohol withdrawal "with 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity".

A pregnancy test should be obtained for women of childbearing potential. In settings with access to laboratory testing, clinicians should conduct and/or arrange for a comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP) or basic metabolic profile (BMP), a hepatic panel, and a complete blood count with differential to assess a patient's electrolytes, liver functioning, renal functioning, and immune functioning; initial screening may also include laboratory tests for hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (with consent), and tuberculosis. Do not delay the initiation of treatment if alcohol withdrawal is suspected but laboratory test results are not available at the treatment setting or results are pending.

### Outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease [^26942f0c]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-related liver disease has become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the USA, partly due to an increase in the prevalence of high-risk drinking behaviour and alcohol use disorder, particularly among young women. Achieving sustained alcohol abstinence might not only prevent the development and progression of alcohol-related liver disease, but could also lead to clinically significant improvements, even in the advanced stages of disease. In this Series paper, we discuss the diagnosis and outpatient management of alcohol-related liver disease, with an emphasis on treatment options for alcohol use disorder and the assessment of nutritional status.

Abstract

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is the most common cause of advanced hepatic disease and frequent indication for liver transplantation worldwide. With harmful alcohol use as the primary risk factor, increasing alcohol use over the past decade has resulted in rapid growth of the ALD-related healthcare burden. The spectrum of ALD ranges from early asymptomatic liver injury to advanced disease with decompensation and portal hypertension. Compared with those with other etiologies of liver disease, patients with ALD progress faster and more often present at an advanced stage. A unique phenotype of advanced disease is alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) presenting with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and acute on chronic liver failure in severe forms conveying a 1-month mortality risk of 20%-50%. The model for end stage disease score is the most accurate score to stratify AH severity (> 20 defined as severe disease). Corticosteroids are currently the only available therapeutic with proven efficacy for patients with severe AH, providing survival benefit at 1 month in 50%-60% of patients. Abstinence of alcohol use, a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes, is challenging to achieve in ALD patients with concurrent alcohol use disorder (AUD). As patients with ALD are rarely treated for AUD, strategies are needed to overcome barriers to AUD treatment in patients with ALD and to promote a multidisciplinary integrated care model with hepatology, addiction medicine providers, and social workers to comprehensively manage the dual pathologies of liver disease and of AUD. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced cirrhosis, should be considered in selected patients with AH, who are unresponsive to medical therapy and have a low risk of relapse to posttransplant alcohol use. Level of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. This guideline was developed under the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee.

It should be documented that patients have been advised that complete abstinence from alcohol is associated with better prognosis in ALD and that stopping alcohol entirely should be their goal

It is clear that abstinence from alcohol is associated with better outcomes compared with people who continue to drink. Alcohol abstinence is also a prerequisite for consideration of liver transplantation should this become necessary. All patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis including AH should therefore be advised that complete abstinence from alcohol should be the target of treatment. This may be an overwhelming goal and patients should be supported to work towards this target to avoid alienating them from treatment. This should be documented in patient notes, records and on electronic portals where possible with access for all clinicians involved in going care. A record of this advice should also be given to patients and general practitioners (usually via a discharge letter).

Patients presenting with decompensated ALD or AH should be screened for infection

Alcohol consumption increases the risk of infection, and infection is a common cause of decompensated liver disease. Infection may be present at presentation or occur during admission particularly in AH, and is associated with poorer outcomes. This advice regarding screening for infection is consistent with the BSG/BASL decompensated cirrhosis bundle. Monitoring for signs of infection should continue throughout an admission with particular vigilance in patients with AH who are treated with corticosteroids where incident infection is associated with poor outcomes. It is important to note that standard laboratory markers of infection for example, leukocytosis or elevated C reactive protein may be part of the syndrome of AH and not necessarily reflect active infection; these should be interpreted with caution and additional evidence for active infection should be sought. This said, given the adverse outcome with infection a low threshold for prescribing antibiotics is appropriate. The possibility of fungal infection should be considered: this may be more frequent in AH and associated with poor outcomes. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment in AH has been shown not to improve mortality or morbidity in AH and should not replace careful monitoring for signs of infection.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Step 2 — conduct standard history and blood tests to obtain key measures states, "We recommend that all at-risk patients identified in Step 1 be screened for alcohol use and have liver tests (or comprehensive metabolic panel, if done as part of routine care) and a complete blood count as part of the initial screening process". It further notes, "The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults 18 years and older be screened for alcohol use disorders, using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise, or single-question screening tool". Results from standard laboratory tests "can allow clinicians to calculate simple fibrosis scores such as Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] or NAFLD Fibrosis Score" and can "identify patients with elevated aminotransferases", who "should be evaluated for presence of other chronic liver and biliary diseases, including chronic hepatitis C virus infection, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol-related liver disease, and mass lesions (via liver imaging)".

Alcohol use disorder — screening of psychosocial conditions in ALD highlights depression and anxiety as relapse risks and provides brief screeners. The text states that depression and anxiety disorder "increase the risk for relapse to alcohol use and failure of counseling or detoxification therapy sessions". For depression, "A simple screening tool for underlying depression is a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 questionnaire, which includes two questions", and for anxiety, the GAD tool "includes two questions (each scored from 0 to 3) for symptoms over the last 2 weeks". Across both instruments, "On each of these tools, a score of 3 or more constitutes a positive response and need for further intervention".

The quality standards group included a representative from the British Liver Trust (VH) and a patient representative (VL).

Terminology used in the document for ALD, and cirrhosis due to (ALD cirrhosis) is based on the most recent guideline document from the European society for the study of the liver, which recognised that use of the word 'alcoholic' is stigmatising and sought to move away from its use. We have also used the term alcohol-related hepatitis (AH) to replace the previous term alcoholic hepatitis.

Patients admitted to hospital with ALD and AUD should be assessed by a specialist addiction practitioner during their admission and offered appropriate intervention and referral

Alcohol treatment improves outcomes in patients with ALD and should be considered an integral part of holistic treatment. Harmful alcohol use in the context of liver disease needs to be clearly addressed by practitioners with appropriate experience and training. Specialist addiction practitioners may come from a variety of backgrounds including but not limited to nursing or medical training; their expertise in managing initial withdrawal and subsequent alcohol treatment is key. The international classification of alcohol use disorders (international classification of diseases (ICD) -10 or ICD-11) identify harmful drinking and alcohol dependence as conditions requiring access to specialist treatment interventions, which have shown to be effective in helping individuals to reduce or stop their alcohol use. In centres with an alcohol care team (ACT), assessment and management of alcohol use is best done as part of the comprehensive care that ACTs provide. Treatment and onward referral after an initial alcohol detoxification are supported by other guidelines.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients with ALD with advanced liver disease, especially jaundice and/or encephalopathy, should be treated in a symptom-triggered fashion using a recognised symptom scoring system to avoid overuse of benzodiazepines

Symptom triggered management should be the gold standard for management of withdrawal in patients with liver disease to avoid the risk of oversedation with benzodiazepines. However, it is recognised that this requires a highly vigilant, trained workforce who are able to maintain the schedule of review and react accordingly. Where this gold standard cannot be delivered, a modification to the benzodiazepine type/dose may be required for high risk patients using fixed dose regimens.

Management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in those with advanced liver disease should be undertaken in a symptom triggered fashion using recognised symptom scoring systems. These include the CIWA-Ar scaleand the Glasgow Modified Alcohol Withdrawal Score (GMAWS). Metabolism of benzodiazepines is reduced in advanced liver disease with the risk of accumulation and subsequent oversedation and precipitation of hepatic encephalopathy if fixed dose regimens are used. However, staff should be competent in monitoring symptoms effectively and should have sufficient resources to allow them to do so frequently and safely. In those with decompensated liver disease, especially severe jaundice and/or encephalopathy, modification to the benzodiazepine regimen may be required. This might include a reduction in the dose of benzodiazepine triggered by symptoms or perhaps the use of shorter acting benzodiazepines such as oxazepam or lorazepam.

### Diary from a week in practice… [^a3bf91b5]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Monday How do medical errors happen. In a crowded emergency department, I quickly tell an intern about a patient: "Miguel is a 45-year-old man with debilitating coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. I sent him here this morning because his wife is leaving him and now he says he wants to die. " At the moment, my patient is sleeping off a dose of lorazepam in a tiny, unlit cubicle he's wedged into with another depressed patient who has been awaiting a bed for days. Our psychiatric unit is full. In fact, there isn't an available bed in the entire county, and we decide that admitting Miguel to a medical floor is the only humane option. Hours later, the intern reports that Miguel is settled into his room upstairs, but mentions some odd inconsistencies: "He told me he doesn't have a wife or children, " she says, "and that he's been here since Saturday". A light begins to flicker. "Are you sure you admitted the right patient. " I ask.

Seems that in the chaos of a busy emergency department, the intern was directed to the wrong man. With my patient fast asleep, she asked his neighbor if he was Miguel. "I'm Michael, " the man answered. "Are you 45. " she'd persisted. "Forty-six. " he replied. Close enough, she thought, and voilà, assigned him a new identity. The intern is horrified. "I've learned my lesson, " she says, and I believe her. But boy, this really frightens me. Tuesday When the medical examiner pages me at 10: 30 p. m. I click worriedly through the names of my sickest patients while dialing her number. But my guesses are off, and it's Bart who has died in his sleep. Bart was a convivial bachelor who served in the merchant marines during World War II. A 290-lb 75 year old with hypertension when I first met him in 1994, he developed diabetes a few years later, then shed 50 lbs in fits and starts.

He was a model patient — compliant with medications, enthusiastic about his on-again, off-again diet, and unfailingly cheerful despite arthritis that hobbled his golf game. Bart shrugged. "I didn't know what she was talking about. I showed her my grocery bag and said, 'I'm buying. ' Do you believe that. " He took off the hat and peered at it. "Now I get it, " he said, "but I'm too old for smoking that stuff, don't you think. " Yes, I did think — and we both laughed. Despite his age, I didn't think Bart was ready for the final tee off. Wednesday As a family physician who believes that there's more to life than can be measured, I'm delighted by patients who resist high-tech attempts to pinpoint their ailments. Olivia, 27, was admitted to our inpatient service with 10 days of right upper quadrant pain worsened by fatty foods. Gallstones, most likely.

Her tenderness included the right upper and lower quadrants and the right flank; her blood work was normal except for a minimally elevated alanine transaminase; and her abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones. Might this be renal calculi. Appendicitis. An abdominal computerized tomographic scan was clean as a whistle except for a fatty liver, and a gallbladder hepatobiliary scan also was negative. Throughout the next day, Olivia was still nauseated and hurting, and she received another shot of meperidine. Today, our radiologist called to say that a reexamination of the gallbladder scan showed a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction, suggesting dysmotility. Might that be the problem. Our gastroenterologist's reaction is ho hum. "That low ejection fraction could be caused by starvation or by the meperidine, " he says firmly. "She doesn't have gallbladder disease. " And the patient.

These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (i) a formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic (Medline search); (ii) American College of Physicians Manual for Assessing Health Practices and Designing Practice Guidelines (1); (iii) guideline policies, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Policy on the development and use of practice guidelines and the AGA Policy Statement on Guidelines (2); and (iv) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to the standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^f530027a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency departments — alcohol withdrawal management recommendations: If patients are experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar ≥ 19) or are at risk of complicated withdrawal, administer medication immediately to treat withdrawal and reduce the risk of seizures and delirium. Patients presenting with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the Emergency Department should be evaluated for delirium as well as other conditions that mimic and/or accompany withdrawal, and patients presenting with delirium should be assessed for all potential etiologies including alcohol withdrawal. Patients in the Emergency Department should receive a complete blood count and complete metabolic panel including liver enzyme and magnesium tests; alcohol withdrawal treatment should not be delayed while waiting for results. For discharge to an ambulatory alcohol withdrawal management setting from the Emergency Department, indicators that should be present include mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar score < 10) or moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g. CIWA–Ar score 10–18) with no other complicating factors, not currently intoxicated (includes alcohol or other drugs), no history of complicated alcohol withdrawal (seizures, delirium), no significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would complicate withdrawal management, and ability to comply with ambulatory visits and therapy. Patients with controlled withdrawal syndrome being discharged from the Emergency Department may be offered a short-term (e.g., 1–2 day) prescription for appropriate alcohol withdrawal medication to last until follow-up with their healthcare provider.

### Treating alcohol-related liver disease from a public health perspective [^1037f7ed]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Herein, we describe the evolving landscape of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) including the current global burden of disease and cost to working-aged people in terms of death and disability, in addition to the larger spectrum of alcohol-related heath complications and its wider impact on society. We further review the most effective and cost-effective public health policies at both a population and individual level. Currently, abstinence is the only effective treatment for ALD, and yet because the majority of ALD remains undetected in the community abstinence is initiated too late to prevent premature death in the majority of cases. We therefore hope that this review will help inform clinicians of the "public health treatment options" for ALD to encourage engagement with policy makers and promote community-based hepatology as a speciality, expanding our patient cohort to allow early detection, and thereby a reduction in the enormous morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.

### Management of alcohol use disorder: a gastroenterology and hepatology-focused perspective [^0bc95aa0]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder is a prevalent and major but preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing several important health consequences, including chronic liver disease. Despite its substantial effects, most clinicians do not adequately assess alcohol intake in clinical practice, and there are several barriers to providing integrated management to patients with alcohol use disorder. Standardised questionnaires, such as the Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT), can facilitate the identification of individuals at risk of alcohol use disorder, and alcohol biomarkers such as phosphatidylethanol aid in quantifying levels of alcohol consumption. Non-pharmacological interventions-including brief interventions, twelve-step facilitation, motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management, and cognitive behavioural therapy-are effective for patients with alcohol use disorder, regardless of the presence of advanced liver disease. Pharmacological treatments should be considered according to the severity of liver disease and other comorbidities, safety profile, and local availability. The management of patients with alcohol use disorder and associated liver disease should ideally be performed in the setting of integrated multidisciplinary teams.
