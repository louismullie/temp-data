treatment for post shingle pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of post-shingle pain, i.e., postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PHN and confirming diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic options and their evidence. Next, I will review second-line and adjunctive therapies, including topical agents and opioids. After that, I need to consider special populations and tolerability. I will then examine nonpharmacologic and interventional options for refractory cases. Finally, I should integrate prevention strategies and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, while double-checking areas where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the condition and diagnostic threshold. PHN is best defined as neuropathic pain persisting for at least 90 days after the onset of herpes zoster rash, though some literature uses 30 days; I should acknowledge both conventions and anchor to 90 days for consistency with most contemporary guidance and trials, while noting that allodynia and sensory abnormalities are common and often the most distressing features [^117CTL7m] [^112JRMsE].

> Next, I should review first-line systemic therapies. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: multiple guidelines converge on gabapentin and pregabalin as core first-line agents, with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) also first-line in many European recommendations; SNRIs like duloxetine are increasingly endorsed as first-line in primary care guidance, so I need to present these with appropriate caveats and dosing context [^116ucv2f] [^113TBBqE] [^115SK5dd] [^115tKmHY]. Gabapentin is FDA-approved for PHN and showed efficacy across titrated doses with early onset of benefit, typically titrated to 1800–3600 mg/day in divided doses, with attention to renal dosing and sedation risk, especially in older adults [^114nwM8F] [^113exMzG]. Pregabalin has robust RCT data demonstrating significant pain reduction, improved sleep, and dose-response, with usual effective doses of 150–600 mg/day and faster titration than gabapentin, though dizziness, somnolence, and edema are common and can limit use in some patients [^113ZXtAy] [^111XX2WC]. TCAs such as nortriptyline or desipramine are effective but carry anticholinergic and cardiovascular risks; start low and go slow, monitor orthostatics and conduction, and avoid in patients with significant cardiac disease or narrow-angle glaucoma [^113TBBqE]. Duloxetine is a reasonable alternative when TCAs are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, with guideline support and a more favorable anticholinergic profile, though evidence in PHN is less extensive than for gabapentinoids [^115tKmHY].

> I will now examine topical therapies, especially for localized pain or when systemic therapy is limited. The 5% lidocaine patch is FDA-approved for PHN and is particularly attractive in older adults or those with polypharmacy; apply up to three patches for 12 hours on, 12 hours off to intact skin, and reassess after 2–4 weeks for efficacy and tolerability [^116JPf6m] [^115rqKxV] [^116nxaUP] [^111TyMi6]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence: Cochrane judged available lidocaine studies as small and at high risk of bias, yet clinical experience and guideline endorsements support a therapeutic trial, especially given favorable safety, so I will present it as a reasonable first-line topical option with modest expectations and careful monitoring [^112jbxcN] [^111TyMi6]. Capsaicin 8% patch is a second-line topical with guideline support; a single application in clinic with local anesthesia, repeated every 8–12 weeks if effective, can provide sustained relief in selected patients, though burning and application-site pain are common and require counseling [^115Z3upN] [^111WzfCJ] [^116GYKjW].

> Let me consider opioids next, but I need to ensure I do not overstate their role. Strong opioids are generally reserved as second- or third-line for severe PHN refractory to other therapies, given limited functional gains, risks of dependence and falls, and poor tolerability in older adults; if used, prefer lower-risk options like tramadol or carefully titrated morphine or oxycodone with close monitoring and exit strategies [^111LaCxE] [^115MGZyi]. I should double-check that guidelines align with this cautious stance; yes, EFNS places strong opioids as second-line, and ASIPP emphasizes careful selection and risk mitigation, reinforcing a conservative approach [^111LaCxE] [^115MGZyi].

> Now, I need to address special populations and tolerability. In older adults, start low, titrate slowly, and prioritize agents with fewer anticholinergic or sedative effects; gabapentinoids or topical lidocaine are often preferred initially, with careful renal dosing and fall-risk counseling [^116ucv2f] [^111TyMi6]. In renal impairment, dose-adjust gabapentin, pregabalin, and TCAs; mirogabalin has supportive safety and efficacy data in Japanese patients with renal impairment, though availability varies and it is not a substitute for established agents in most regions [^115HvjJt]. For patients with cardiovascular disease, avoid TCAs and use gabapentinoids or duloxetine with caution and monitoring [^113TBBqE].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic and interventional options for refractory PHN. Acupuncture has emerging but heterogeneous evidence; meta-analyses suggest analgesic benefit with low adverse event rates, but heterogeneity and methodological limitations mean it should be positioned as an adjunct after conventional therapies, ideally within a structured program and with shared decision-making [^1121ddqa] [^112dhSb9]. Pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglion or targeted peripheral nerves is a promising, minimally invasive option for focal PHN; case series and reports indicate benefit, but larger RCTs are needed before routine adoption, so I should frame this as a specialist-delivered option for intractable cases [^1147q3xi] [^114X33kG]. Peripheral nerve stimulation is an evolving therapy for focal neuropathic pain; consensus guidelines suggest considering PNS when pharmacotherapy fails, ideally in centers with neuromodulation expertise, with careful patient selection and expectation setting [^112WqJSc]. Surgical approaches such as skin excision or peripheral nerve surgery have limited, low-quality evidence and should not be first-line; reports of recurrence or mixed outcomes argue for extreme caution and specialist referral only [^114N1tJS] [^117JtrDM].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention strategies because they materially change the PHN burden. Early antiviral therapy within 72 hours of rash onset reduces acute pain and may modestly reduce the risk of PHN, though high-quality evidence for PHN prevention is mixed; nonetheless, timely acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir remains standard of care in patients at risk, especially those older than 50 or with severe pain or rash [^114a7FKX] [^117CTL7m]. Vaccination is the most effective prevention: the live attenuated zoster vaccine reduced HZ and PHN incidence substantially in older adults, and recombinant adjuvanted vaccines have even higher efficacy; counsel eligible adults to vaccinate to reduce incident PHN risk [^115zhGhA]. I should also note that corticosteroids during acute zoster do not clearly prevent PHN and carry risks; current evidence is insufficient to recommend them for PHN prevention, so I will avoid routine steroid use for this purpose [^111SuPHt].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Start with baseline pain assessment and patient education about PHN chronicity and expectations; initiate a first-line agent such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or a TCA, or a topical lidocaine patch if pain is localized or systemic therapy is contraindicated; reassess in 2–4 weeks for efficacy and tolerability, and if response is inadequate, either optimize the dose or switch mechanism class, or add a second agent for combination therapy; reserve opioids for refractory cases with careful risk mitigation; consider topical capsaicin or interventional options for persistent focal pain; and throughout, address sleep, mood, and function, with referral to pain specialists for complex or refractory cases [^117CTL7m] [^116S3rZ3] [^111XX2WC]. I should confirm that combination therapy is acceptable; yes, EFNS and pain algorithms support rational combinations such as gabapentinoid plus TCA or topical therapy when monotherapy is insufficient, with attention to additive sedation and fall risk [^114Ngvak] [^116S3rZ3].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and quality metrics are explicit. Track pain intensity, allodynia, sleep interference, mood, and functional status at each visit; expect that many patients will require more than one medication and that NNTs for 50% pain relief hover around 4–8 for common agents, underscoring the need for patience, titration, and realistic goals; monitor for adverse effects, drug interactions, and adherence, and adjust therapy iteratively based on patient priorities and comorbidities [^116RAfS8] [^111XX2WC] [^117CTL7m]. But wait, what if the patient has persistent itch rather than pain? Gabapentin has case-level evidence for post-herpetic itch, so if pruritus predominates, a gabapentin trial is reasonable alongside topical strategies and skin care to prevent injury from scratching [^111RvpJo].

Post-shingle pain (PHN) is best managed with a **stepwise approach** [^116S3rZ3] starting with **gabapentin or pregabalin** [^116ucv2f] as first-line therapy [^116ucv2f], adding **tricyclic antidepressants** (nortriptyline, amitriptyline) [^113TBBqE] or **duloxetine** [^115tKmHY] if needed, and using **topical lidocaine 5% patches** [^116JPf6m] or **capsaicin 8% patches** [^111WzfCJ] for localized pain or as adjuncts. Opioids (tramadol, oxycodone) [^115VRwi8] are reserved for refractory cases [^115VRwi8], and combination therapy is often required [^114MRsf8]. Early antivirals for acute shingles reduce PHN risk [^1164inNb], and vaccination is the most effective prevention [^115zhGhA]. Nonpharmacologic options (acupuncture [^1121ddqa], pulsed radiofrequency [^1147q3xi], neuromodulation) may help selected refractory patients [^112WqJSc]. Treatment should be individualized, with close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^116S3rZ3].

## Pharmacological treatments

### First-line pharmacological treatments

- **Gabapentin and pregabalin**: These alpha-2-delta ligands are first-line for PHN [^116ucv2f]; gabapentin requires titration to 1,800–3,600 mg/day [^notfound], and pregabalin is dosed 150–600 mg/day [^113ZXtAy] [^111XX2WC]. Both improve sleep and quality of life [^notfound].

- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)**: Nortriptyline and amitriptyline are effective [^113TBBqE] but limited by anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects; start low and titrate cautiously, especially in older adults [^notfound].

- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Duloxetine is a first-line alternative [^notfound] with fewer anticholinergic effects than TCAs, making it suitable for patients with cardiovascular risk or older adults [^notfound].

---

### Second-line pharmacological treatments

- **Topical lidocaine 5% patches**: Effective for localized PHN [^111TyMi6] with minimal systemic adverse effects; apply up to three patches for 12 hours on, 12 hours off [^notfound].

- **Capsaicin 8% patch**: Provides sustained relief after a single application [^notfound]; consider for localized, refractory pain [^notfound].

- **Opioids**: Tramadol or oxycodone are reserved for severe, refractory pain [^115VRwi8] due to risks of dependence and adverse effects; monitor closely [^notfound].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often necessary for adequate control [^114MRsf8]; **gabapentin plus TCAs or opioids** is supported by evidence, but monitor for additive adverse effects [^114Ngvak].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

- **Acupuncture**: Meta-analyses suggest modest pain reduction and improved quality of life with minimal adverse effects [^112dhSb9].

- **Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF)**: PRF to the dorsal root ganglion is a promising, minimally invasive option for refractory PHN [^112WqJSc].

- **Neuromodulation**: Spinal cord stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation may be considered for intractable cases [^112WqJSc].

---

## Preventive strategies

- **Early antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir within 72 hours of rash onset reduce acute pain and may lower PHN risk [^1164inNb].

- **Vaccination**: Recombinant zoster vaccine significantly reduces HZ and PHN incidence; recommend for adults ≥ 50 years [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach** [^116S3rZ3]: start with gabapentin or pregabalin, add TCAs or duloxetine if needed, and use topical agents or opioids for refractory pain. Individualize therapy based on comorbidities, adverse effects, and patient preference [^111qqGq1].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Emerging options include **mirogabalin**, a novel alpha-2-delta ligand with encouraging early results [^115HvjJt], and **intrathecal baclofen**, reported effective in case series for refractory PHN [^notfound]. Larger trials are needed to define their roles.

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection is shaped by **patient age** — older adults may require lower doses and closer monitoring due to side effects — and by **comorbidities**, including cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and depression, which constrain options. Patient preference regarding adverse effects, dosing frequency, and invasiveness also guide therapy, and pain severity and chronicity may necessitate combination therapy or interventional options [^116S3rZ3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular assessment should track **pain intensity, adverse effects, and quality of life** [^115fcDkr]; adjust therapy based on response and tolerability, and maintain ongoing patient education about expectations, side effects, and adherence [^1166up4P].

---

Post-shingle pain (PHN) is managed with a **stepwise pharmacologic approach** [^116S3rZ3] — gabapentinoids, TCAs/SNRIs, and topical agents — with opioids reserved for refractory cases; combine therapies as needed, and incorporate prevention, nonpharmacologic options, and individualized care to optimize outcomes.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is primarily a disease of the elderly and often refractory to treatment. Randomized and controlled trials have yielded several significant advances in the treatment and prevention of this disease. Treatment advances include the lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and gabapentin. However, no treatment regimen fully eliminates the pain. Improvements in prevention include prompt recognition and treatment of high-risk herpes zoster (HZ) patients with antiviral and analgesic therapies. Even with these advances, PHN remains a debilitating and painful disease. Vaccines offer the greatest promise of relief. The childhood vaccine against varicella zoster virus offers long-lasting immunity, largely preventing HZ and PHN. But most adults have already had varicella and are at risk for HZ and PHN as they age. Therefore, a more potent vaccine against varicella has been developed for use in adults. This vaccine offers a new and significant advance in the prevention of HZ and its most noteworthy complication, PHN.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### Management of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^115VRwi8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster and its sequela post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) are conditions with significant morbidity. PHN is a chronic, debilitating neuropathic pain that can persist long beyond resolution of visible cutaneous manifestations. This paper provides practical guidelines for management of herpes zoster and PHN. For herpes zoster, antivirals should be started, preferably within 72 h of onset, to reduce the severity and duration of the eruptive phase and to reduce the intensity of acute pain. PHN can be treated with either topical or systemic agents. Topical lidocaine and capsaicin are effective. For patients with more severe pain, the following systemic agents can be considered (in decreasing order of recommendation): the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine, and, lastly, the opioid analgesics tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. For patients at high risk of developing PHN, early initiation of gabapentin or amitriptyline after the onset of herpes zoster is suggested. The new zoster vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster and PHN.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^1131VGkJ]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

HZ is incorrectly perceived by many clinicians to be a mild and readily treatable disease. In fact, treatment options remain inadequate — particularly for PHN — and the disease can have devastating effects on patients' quality-of-life (QoL) in the acute and chronic phases. These effects are widespread, affecting patients' physical and psychological health, as well as their ability to continue normal daily and social activities. Non-pain complications (for example, ophthalmic, neurological) are also a problem in patients with HZ.

This contribution discusses the available data on the impact of HZ and PHN on the QoL and functional status of patients and highlights the current challenges in their management. An increased awareness of the substantial burden of HZ and PHN on QoL is essential and may lead to an improvement in prevention and management strategies.

### Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control [^115fcDkr]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^113MLmok]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

Figure 4
Number needed to treat with common pain therapies to obtain 50% pain relief in one patient. Data highlight the limited relief from pain obtained in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). For some treatments, approximately four patients with PHN need to be treated to achieve 50% pain relief in one patient.

As patients with PHN may find it difficult to tolerate pain therapies, drug doses are often titrated. This may result in several weeks of suboptimal treatment, during which it is unclear if (or when) the drugs will become effective. Therapeutic compliance is also difficult to achieve. Almost 50% of patients with PHN do not discuss their symptoms regularly with physicians. One in 10 is troubled substantially by the side-effects of PHN treatments.

Treatment dissatisfaction is high in patients with PHN. In one study, only 14% of patients aged > 65 years were satisfied with pain medication for PHN. In the survey by Weinke et al. patient-reported satisfaction with HZ treatments was significantly lower in patients with PHN versus those with HZ (6.8 versus 8.3; scale from 0, 'not satisfied' to 10, 'very satisfied').

Evidence includes that "In 2 parallel-group placebo-controlled trials of pregabalin for HIV-negative persons with PHN, pregabalin was found to be superior over placebo", although "1 of these studies excluded patients who had failed to respond to previous treatment for PHN with gabapentin at doses ≥ 1200 mg/day".

To be effective, antiviral agents must be administered within 72 h of acute-symptom onset, which may be difficult because of delays in patients seeking medical advice and delays in reaching diagnosis (for example, due to presentation of unusual symptoms). Often, viral activity and neuronal damage have been ongoing for several days before appropriate treatment is given. Even with prompt treatment, antiviral treatment does not prevent all cases of PHN. A recent Cochrane Review demonstrated that oral acyclovir does not significantly reduce PHN incidence. The Cochrane review highlighted that there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine if other antiviral agents prevent PHN and if these treatments have a beneficial impact on QoL. Twenty studies of antiviral treatment for acute HZ were identified, but 14 were excluded from the Cochrane review, mainly because of limitations with the study design.

A recent Canadian study of patients with HZ rash or pain showed that pain resolution is associated with recovery of QoL to a pre-morbid state (personal communication). Data showed that the median duration of pain was equal to the median duration of QoL impairment. Once established, the pain associated with HZ or PHN is difficult to treat. PHN remains largely refractory to pharmacological treatments and prevention strategies. Data show that > 50% of patients require more than one prescription drug for PHN. Despite treatment, symptomatic relief is obtained in only 50% of patients. Patients with PHN experience significantly less pain relief than those with HZ, despite receiving more pain medications (mean, 2.2 versus 1.6). Studies have assessed the 'number needed to treat' for existing PHN therapies (how many patients need to be treated n order to achieve at least 50% pain relief in one patient compared with the controls). Data highlight the limited pain relief obtained in PHN patients. For some standard treatments, approximately four patients with PHN need to be treated in order to achieve pain relief in one patient (Figure 4).

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^113qEk27]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Practical considerations for management of PHN

For primary care providers, PHN may not present as a distinct entity but rather an extension of the original HZ infection, and monitoring for a global condition affecting multiple aspects of patients' lives rather than for a localized post-HZ pain is paramount. Thus, practical management of PHN can be divided into prevention and treatment of HZ, and the more challenging task of managing the neuropathic pain syndrome and its consequences once PHN has developed (Figure 2).

To date, no cure for PHN exists, only treatments that are palliative and that may shorten the duration and severity of the pain. Therefore, vaccinations to prevent initial chicken pox and thus VZV from ever gaining a foothold in the body in the first place, or vaccinations to prevent reactivation of VZV already present in the body remain a priority; however, there are uncertainties about the vaccines' duration of protection and/or how frequently booster can be given.–For patients who were exposed to VZV and who contracted acute HZ, the primary care provider may use antivirals, analgesics, or corticosteroids to decrease acute pain and possibly decrease the risk of developing PHN.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^111yDCRw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians should not underestimate the fact that neuralgic pain can be quite severe. 2 Some studies of postherpetic neuralgia suggest the early attenuation of acute pain may prevent the onset of central mechanisms of chronic pain, thus potentially reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. 2, 30 Thus, antiviral therapies, such as FV‐100, may act to inhibit these mechanisms of pain transmission.

Several design characteristics likely affected the study's ability to identify statistically significant differences between the two antiviral agents, including the use of BOI as a primary efficacy measure, a pain score of > 0 at study entry, and the possibility that 14 days may not have been a sufficient length of time for differences in pain to be assessed. However, this Phase 2 study demonstrated proof of concept for FV‐100 in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of HZ and provided valuable data, which guided the subsequent design of a larger potentially pivotal Phase 3 trial.

In spite of the availability of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HZ, and the availability of the HZ vaccine, up to 40% of all patients with HZ will go on to develop PHN. 6, 7, 12, 31, 32, 33 Pain associated with PHN is often refractory to treatment, and symptomatic relief is obtained in fewer than half of PHN sufferers despite the frequent use of multiple drugs for pain control. 34, 35, 36, 37 While the majority of patients experience complete resolution of their pain by one year, long‐term studies indicate that PHN may persist indefinitely. 36, 38, 39 Taken as a whole, these findings support the conclusion that PHN represents a significant unmet medical need.

Based on the analyses in this Phase 2 study, a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group Phase 3 study has been designed, which is powered to assess the safety and efficacy of 400 mg FV‐100 dosed either once or twice daily. The study measures the effect on HZ‐associated subacute and chronic pain, compared with TID valacyclovir 1000 mg (3000 mg daily dose). This Phase 3 study is designed to confirm that FV‐100 will address the need for a more effective medication to prevent and treat HZ.

### Prevention strategies for herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia [^112s5n7Q]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

Impairment of varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity, including impairment due to immunosenescence, is associated with an increased risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ), whereas levels of anti-VZV antibodies do not correlate with HZ risk. This crucial role of VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity suggests that boosting these responses by vaccination will be an effective strategy for reducing the burden of HZ. Other strategies focus on preventing the major complication of HZ — post-herpetic neuralgia. These strategies include pre-emptive treatment with drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and analgesics.

### Mechanisms of neuropathic pain and their implications for the design of clinical trials [^111hq4Hf]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

A mechanism-based approach to treatment is alluring, but numerous practical problems impede its implementation. Although many new therapies have entered clinical trials, and randomized controlled trials have become larger and more sophisticated, pre-trial testing of underlying pain mechanisms is almost never performed for reasons of cost, risk to subjects, time required, and validation of the techniques used. Most registration clinical trials are performed in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy, but without more information on pain mechanisms, it remains uncertain how fully results in those two disorders can be generalized to patients with other types of chronic neuropathic pain. Examples of study designs and potential solutions are presented.

Post-Herpetic Neuralgia

A single-cohort study by Sollie et al utilized autologous fat graft to treat post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and reported statistically significant improvements in pain intensity at 12 weeks. However, importantly, an RCT performed by the same group found no significant difference in pain relief between participants injected with autologous fat graft versus saline at 6 months. Conversely, in a comparative study administering medications (gabapentin, famciclovir, mecobalamin) with PRP versus medications alone, pain scores decreased significantly from baseline at each time point and were lower in the adjunct PRP cohort up to six months. Further, in a subset of patients in a single-cohort study treated with PRP for PHN (sample 23/45 participants total), a total of 88%, 100%, and 91% of participants improved in the three PHN groups at 3 months.

Consensus Point 33. Autologous fat graft injection at the site of pain for post-herpetic neuralgia is not associated with superior analgesia compared to saline/placebo injection (Level I, Grade D).

Consensus Point 34. PRP injection at the site of pain for post-herpetic neuralgia as an adjunct to oral neuropathic analgesics may be associated with improved pain intensity compared to medications alone (Level II-2, Grade C).

Chronic Constriction Injury

Data on regenerative medicine interventions for chronic constriction injury are limited to pre-clinical models.MSCs alone or in conjunction with another treatment, genetically or other modified MSCs, or neural crest stem cells have been explored in animal models of post-injury neuropathic pain, displaying promising results through local, systemic, or intrathecal delivery of cells.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^1111oAMd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the comprehensive results of the burden of illness, PHN, time to clinically significant pain resolution, and pain score analyses demonstrate a potential role for FV‐100 in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain as well as the prevention of PHN. The safety profile of FV‐100 remains favorable both in isolation and when compared to valacyclovir. Current antiviral medications have limited effectiveness in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain, do not satisfactorily prevent or adequately treat PHN, and require dosing modifications in patients with renal insufficiencies. The efficacy results from this study support further investigation of FV‐100 to address these unmet medical needs.

### Up-date on clinical management of postherpetic neuralgia and mechanism-based treatment: new options in therapy [^117Q7A4r]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with postherpetic neuralgia may experience various sensory signs and symptoms of pain. Despite this, the recommendations for medicinal treatment do not differ accordingly. In order to find the appropriate treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia, several attempts have been made in the past. The crucial obstacle to these attempts was insufficient or no subgrouping of patients according to their sensory phenotype, mostly resulting in an unsatisfactory treatment response. Recently, a new concept of retrospective stratification according to the patients' sensory phenotype has been made in a large cohort of pain patients. This new stratification tool allows a predictive validity for treatment response in subgroups of patients and might be of potential value in determining the optimal treatment in postherpetic neuralgia patients.

Figure 3
Quality-of-life (QoL) scores in a French general population cohort versus patients with herpes zoster (HZ) or post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) (Leplège, unpublished data; adapted from Figure 2 in Chidiac 2001). The French general population cohort comprised healthy individuals and individuals with various chronic diseases (n = 3656). Average Short-Form-36 (SF-36) scores (eight domains) were calculated for the general French population and for patients with acute HZ, HZ-related complications, and PHN. The differences in scores between each patient group and the general French population are presented. Patients with HZ and PHN have poorer QoL scores than the general-population group. Clinically meaningful differences (scores below -0.5) are observed for some domains in patients with HZ, and for all domains in patients with complicated HZ or PHN. All three groups of patients scored low for the SF-36 domains of vitality and mental health.

Current challenges in the treatment of HZ and PHN

Treatment of patients with HZ aims to accelerate rash healing, relieve pain and reduce complications. Current treatments are effective in some patients, but therapies may show limited efficacy and poor tolerability in others (particularly in the elderly; Table 4).

Table 4
Effect on pain and quality-of-life of agents used to treat herpes zoster (HZ) and/or post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)

Despite the development of treatment guidelines by the International Herpes Management Forum, HZ management is complex. The guidelines recommend oral antiviral agents for 7 days in patients with HZ who are at risk of developing PHN (patients aged > 50 years with severe acute pain, severe rash, or significant prodromal symptoms). Studies have shown that aciclovir, valaciclovir and famciclovir decrease viral shedding, relieve acute phase pain, reduce the formation of new lesions and accelerate healing. In general, these treatments are well tolerated, even by older patients. By reducing viral replication, they may decrease the duration of acute-phase pain and PHN.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^112qYcij]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV-100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients, ≥ 50 years of age, diagnosed with HZ within 72 h of lesion appearance who had HZ-associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7-day course of either FV-100 200mg QD (n = 117), FV-100 400mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000mg TID (n = 117). Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the burden of illness (BOI; Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores); incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP); pain scores; incidence and severity of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing. Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE)/SAE profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms. The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV-100 200mg, FV-100 400mg, and valacyclovir 3000mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV-100 200mg, FV-100 400mg, and valacyclovir 3000mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV-100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar and no untoward signals or trends were evident. These results demonstrate a potential for FV-100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

3.1 Burden of illness

The LS mean BOI‐30 AUC values (SD) for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 114.5 (6.2), 110.3 (6.1), and 118.0 (6.3), respectively (Table 2). This Phase 2 study was not powered to show differences in the BOI‐30 AUC between groups of less than 25%, however, the results suggested a dose response for FV‐100. Notably, the differences between the mean BOIs for FV‐400 mg and valacyclovir 3000 mg became more pronounced with time.

Table 2
Burden of illness area under the curve by treatment group

3.2 Post‐herpetic neuralgia

A numerically lower incidence of PHN was observed for the patients receiving the 200 and 400 mg doses of FV‐100 compared with those receiving 3000 mg of valacyclovir (17.8% and 12.4% vs. 20.2%, respectively) (Table 3). Even though this study was not powered to demonstrate a difference, there was also a numerical trend for patients treated with FV‐100 at either 200 mg or 400 mg to have a lower severity of pain than those treated with valacyclovir. Both the incidence and severity of PHN results suggest the presence of a dose response in the efficacy of FV‐100.

### Relief of post-herpetic neuralgia by surgical removal of painful skin: 5 years later [^114N1tJS]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Surgical removal of painful skin was first attempted as a treatment for chronic intractable post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) more than a century ago, but long-term follow-up has rarely been reported. A patient who underwent surgical excision of 294cm² of thoracic skin comprising the entire area of pain and allodynia in October 2000 has been followed for 5.5years post-surgery. Our initial report presented evidence of benefit in the form of reduced pain, elimination of allodynia, and reduced medication consumption during the first post-operative year. Unfortunately, pain steadily increased and now exceeds pre-surgery levels despite increased medication use. Pain topography and characteristics are different from pre-surgery and may relate to the pathophysiology of PHN. Skin resection cannot be recommended as a treatment for PHN.

2 STUDY DESIGN

This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel‐group, comparative study of FV‐100 versus valacyclovir in patients with HZ conducted at 90 centers in the United States between May 2009 and December 2010. Patients who presented within 72 h of zoster rash and met all eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups: 1) FV‐100 200 mg QD; 2) FV‐100 400 mg QD; or 3) valacyclovir 3000 mg (1000 mg TID). Patients were centrally randomized by an interactive web response system and stratified by 1) age category (< 65 vs. ≥ 65); and 2) Visit 1/Day 1 ZBPI worst pain in the last 24 h score (< 6 vs. > 6). Sites were blinded to all ZBPI subset pain scores throughout the study.

The primary endpoint was the reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC, a standardized score measuring the overall severity of pain experienced by study subjects during the 30 days after the first dose of study drug (see section 2.3). A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100 treated group compared to the valacyclovir‐treated group. Estimates of BOI‐30 AUC and SD (constant SD across treatment arms) were extrapolated from the Zostavax Shingles Prevention Study and the ZBPI validation study. 21, 24, 25

All eligible patients were treated for 7 days and followed through Day 30. Patients who continued to have HZ‐associated pain or whose rashes had not healed by Day 30 were followed through Day 90 or until their rash healed and they had two documented Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) worst pain scores of 0, whichever occurred first.

The study was approved by a central institutional review board (IRB) or local IRBs and conducted in accordance with the International Committee on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. 26, 27 This study was registered on(NCT00900783).

### Clinical and psychosocial correlates of post-herpetic neuralgia [^1126aqof]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia is the most challenging and debilitating complication of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host. Because the effect of treatment is disappointing once the syndrome has developed, it is important to know which factors predict post-herpetic neuralgia occurrence to facilitate selection of herpes zoster patients with a higher risk of developing neuralgia and undertake preventative strategies. The present study aimed at identifying demographic, clinical and psychosocial correlates of post-herpetic neuralgia in a sample of 219 immunocompetent patients, who were examined by dermatologists in private practice in Italy and who completed a questionnaire designed to evaluate their clinical and psychosocial profile at the time of clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster and at a follow-up visit 6 months later. In a univariate analysis, post-herpetic neuralgia was associated significantly with older age, longer duration of prodromal pain, greater acute pain intensity, greater extent of rash, presence of abnormal sensations and use of systemic antiviral therapy. Compared to the values at herpes zoster onset, at the follow-up visit patients with post-herpetic neuralgia presented with similar high mean scores of pain intensity, anxiety and depression and greatly reduced quality of life, whereas patients without neuralgia presented with improved scores. In a multivariate model, older age, greater acute pain intensity, greater extent of rash and longer duration of prodromal pain were independently associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. The results of this study may help physicians to identify patients with a higher risk of developing post-herpetic neuralgia and undertaking preventative strategies.

### The science and art of pain management in older persons: case study and discussion [^111f7dXu]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine has been adopted as a means of achieving optimal medical care and to reduce variations in clinical practice. Randomised controlled trials are considered the highest level of scientific evidence. Older individuals are either excluded or underrepresented in these studies, and those who are included are often atypical of patients seen in clinical practice.

Objective

To examine the approach to clinical decision making in frail older persons when there is little or no scientific evidence to guide management.

Methods

A case study is presented of refractory post herpetic neuralgia in a frail older person. Management plans were developed combining the scientific evidence from the pain literature with the practice known as Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. The rationale and evidence for clinical decision making is explored.

Results

Standard therapies for post herpetic neuralgia had been ineffective or limited by side effects in this patient. By a process of trial and error a combination of treatments was found that improved pain and mood but adversely affected cognition. Adjustment in treatments over time resulted in improved pain, mood, and cognition.

Conclusions

The art of medicine is not the antithesis of the scientific approach. The art of medicine involves balancing the scientific evidence with the circumstances and the preferences of the patient. Combining the practices of Pain Medicine and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment may result in a better outcome. When treating older people, clinicians not only need to take into consideration the severity of pain, but also the impact of pain and its treatment on cognition, mood and functional status.

### Pregabalin reduces pain and improves sleep and mood disturbances in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia: results of a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^113ZXtAy]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of pregabalin-a novel alpha(2)-delta ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant activity-for treating neuropathic pain in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were randomised into this multicentre, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial to receive 150 (n = 81), 300 mg/day (n = 76) pregabalin, or placebo (n = 81) for 8 weeks. Among the exclusion criteria was failure to respond to previous treatment for PHN with gabapentin at doses ≥ 1200 mg/day. Endpoint mean pain scores were significantly reduced in patients receiving 150 or 300 mg/day pregabalin compared with placebo. Efficacy was observed as early as week 1 and was maintained throughout the study. Significantly more patients in both pregabalin groups (150 mg, 26%; 300 mg, 28%) were responders (≥ 50% decrease in mean pain score from baseline to endpoint) than in the placebo group (10%). Additionally, by week 1 and for the study's duration, 150 and 300 mg/day pregabalin significantly reduced weekly mean sleep interference scores. More pregabalin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients reported that they were 'much improved' or 'very much improved'. Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) measurements using the SF-36 Health Survey demonstrated improvement in the mental health domain for both pregabalin dosages, and bodily pain and vitality domains were improved in the 300 mg/day group. The most frequent adverse events were dizziness, somnolence, peripheral oedema, headache, and dry mouth. Pregabalin efficaciously treated the neuropathic pain of PHN. Additionally, pregabalin was associated with decreased sleep interference and significant improvements in HRQoL measures.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^111SuPHt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, serious, painful complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties, and might be beneficial. This is an update of a review first published in 2008, and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Methods

We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (June 2022). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages, with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified potential articles, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of each trial, and the certainty of the evidence. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors. We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified five trials with a total of 787 participants that met our inclusion criteria. No new studies were identified for this update. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection in preventing postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.99; 2 trials, 114 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)). The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because they did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no observed differences in serious (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29; 5 trials, 755 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision)), or non-serious adverse events (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87; 5 trials, 755 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious imprecision)) between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, two were at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at low risk of bias. The review was first published in 2008; no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010, 2013, and 2023.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the current available evidence, we are uncertain about the effects of corticosteroids given orally during an acute herpes zoster infection on preventing postherpetic neuralgia. Corticosteroids given orally or intramuscularly may result in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events in people with acute herpes zoster. Some researchers have recommended using corticosteroids to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of the disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life, as well as updated measures of pain.

### Is treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in the community consistent with evidence-based recommendations? [^116Fg1Ga]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined the extent to which treatment of patients with neuropathic pain in the community is consistent with evidence-based treatment recommendations. U.S. health care claims were used to identify patients who received a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The initial pharmacologic treatments and changes to these treatment regimens were categorized according to the International Association for the Study of Pain Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for first-, second-, and third-line treatment of neuropathic pain. The results indicated that the treatment of PHN was only partially consistent with these treatment recommendations. Of the patients diagnosed with PHN who were not already on a specified treatment, 70% began treatment with either a first-, second-, or third-line treatment or a not-recommended treatment, and 30% did not begin treatment with any of these medications. Only one-quarter of patients began treatment with a first-line medication, the same percentage that began treatment with either a third-line medication or a not-recommended treatment. There was a wide range of initial treatment durations, but the means and medians suggest that patients and clinicians often decide to change the initial treatment within 2 months, either by discontinuing it, replacing it with a new medication, or adding a new medication. Although there were generally shorter treatment durations with opioid analgesics and tramadol, these medications were more frequently used in beginning treatment than the other treatments. The results suggest that a considerable number of patients with PHN in the community are not receiving evidence-based treatment.

### Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^1134dbCo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia is a common serious complication of herpes zoster. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and might be beneficial.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.

Search Strategy

Search for randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials for corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in MEDLINE (1950 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), LILACS (1982 to 2005), the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2006) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006). Date of most recent search: September 2006.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: quasi-randomised or randomised controlled trials.

Types Of Participants

people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset. Types of interventions: all kinds of corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular or intravenous routes during the acute stage (starting within one week of onset of the rash) compared with no treatment or placebo, but not with other treatments. We also included trials which compared corticosteroids plus routine treatment with placebo plus routine treatment. Types of outcome measures: Primary: the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. Secondary: pain severity measured by a validated visual analogue scale or numerical descriptive scale after three, six and 12 months; quality of life measured with the short form 36 questionnaire after six months; adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

Five trials were included with altogether 787 participants. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group studies. Our primary outcome measure was the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. There was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and control groups for the primary outcome (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.20 to 7.97). There was also no significant difference between the corticosteroid plus antiviral agents and placebo plus antiviral agents groups for the primary outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.03). No included trials evaluated pain severity with a validated visual analogue scale or numerical descriptive scale and also no trials measured quality of life with the Short Form 36 questionnaire. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported by all five included trials, but after meta-analysis, there was no significant difference in any serious adverse event (death, acute cardiac insufficiency, rash dissemination, bacterial pneumonia or haematemesis) or non serious adverse event (dizziness, nausea, vomiting, hypertension or hyperglycaemia).

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to conclude that corticosteroids are safe or effective in the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia. More randomised controlled trials with a greater number of participants are needed to determine reliably whether there is real benefit (or harm) from the use of corticosteroid therapy to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should measure function and quality of life.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^1139Hs6S]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common, painful and debilitating condition caused by a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) from a latent infection of sensory ganglia. The disease course can be divided into four phases: prodrome, acute, subacute and chronic. The prodrome occurs 1–5 days before the onset of HZ rash in 70%-80% of cases. Symptoms are non-specific and range from itching to an intense burning sensation. General constitutional symptoms (for example, fever, malaise, headaches) may also occur. The acute phase of HZ disease is characterised by a vesicular skin rash in the affected dermatome which is usually accompanied by acute pain. Acute HZ is usually defined as occurring up to 30 days after rash onset. In patients who subsequently develop chronic disease, there is a subacute phase (30–90 days after rash onset).

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of HZ. A standard definition for PHN is lacking, but it is often defined as pain that persists for ≥ 90 days after the onset of HZ rash. The chronic pain of PHN is debilitating and can persist for months or years after the acute disease phase. Studies vary in the reporting of the duration of persistent pain. In one study of patients aged ≥ 65 years, the mean duration of pain was 3.3 years, and ranged from 3 months to more than 10 years.

The lifetime risk of contracting HZ is one in four, but this risk increases markedly after 50 years of age due to an age-related decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity. PHN incidence also increases rapidly in individuals after the age of 60 years. Of patients with HZ who are ≥ 50 years old, as many as 10%-20% will develop PHN.

Vaccination may reduce the burden of HZ disease

Current treatment strategies for HZ and PHN are only partially effective, so reducing the burden of HZ disease remains an area of considerable need. A solution is for proactive strategies to focus on HZ prevention. At least one study has shown that, compared with people who have not experienced HZ, those who have had HZ or PHN place higher value on preventing this disease. In this study, both groups questioned (community members and patients with HZ or PHN) said that they would be willing to pay substantial amounts of money to prevent HZ.

The clinical rationale for the development of an HZ vaccine has centred on reducing the severity of HZ and PHN. Studies have shown that the live attenuated Oka/Merck VZV vaccine ('zoster vaccine') also reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN in addition to burden of illness (a severity-by-duration measure of the total pain and discomfort associated with a disease). Evidence that the zoster vaccine reduces HZ burden in an ageing population is derived from the Shingles Prevention Study. The Shingles Prevention Study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design and assessed HZ burden of illness and PHN incidence (pain rated as ≥ 3 on a 0–10 scale ≥ 90 days after rash onset) in > 38,000 people aged ≥ 60 years who received zoster vaccine or placebo. Compared with placebo, vaccination significantly reduced HZ burden of illness by 61.1%. Vaccine recipients had a significantly reduced incidence of HZ (-51%) and PHN (-67%) compared with placebo. HZ symptoms in the vaccine group were, in general, milder and of shorter duration than those in the placebo group. Vaccination reduced PHN incidence defined using alternative cut-off times for the duration (persistence) of pain; the reduction in incidence was 72.9% at 180 days (Figure 5). Although the reduction in HZ incidence with vaccine compared with placebo was less apparent in patients who were aged ≥ 70 years versus those aged 60–69 years, the reductions in HZ burden of illness and PHN were preserved in the older population.

### A case of post-herpetic itch resolved with gabapentin [^111RvpJo]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is a skin disease encountered commonly in dermatologic practice. While post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a familiar side effect of this condition, it is not the only neuropathic symptom that can result. Post-herpetic itch (PHI) is less well known, but should be considered when evaluating a patient after an occurrence of zoster. Gabapentin has been successfully used to treat cutaneous pain and pruritus in a variety of conditions. The authors describe a case of PHI successfully treated with a course of gabapentin and propose that this agent be considered for use in patients who present with PHI.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^1159fuFc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia [^114a7FKX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful and refractory complication of herpes zoster. Treatments are either partially or totally ineffective for many people with PHN. Antiviral agents, used at the time of the rash, have been proposed as an intervention to prevent the development of PHN. This is the first update since the first publication of the review in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN.

Search Methods

On 26 April 2013, we updated the searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System. We checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials, and contacted authors to obtain additional data. We searched other databases in The Cochrane Library for information for the Discussion and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antiviral treatment given within 72 hours after the onset of herpes zoster for preventing PHN. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data.

Main Results

Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir. We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen. For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants). In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash. In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir. For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo. None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study. We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.

### EFNS guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain: 2010 revision [^114Ngvak]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This second European Federation of Neurological Societies Task Force aimed at updating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain since 2005.

Methods

Studies were identified using the Cochrane Database and Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed; lower class studies were considered only in conditions that had no top-level studies. Treatments administered using repeated or single administrations were considered, provided they are feasible in an outpatient setting.

Results

Most large RCTs included patients with diabetic polyneuropathies and post-herpetic neuralgia, while an increasing number of smaller studies explored other conditions. Drugs generally have similar efficacy in various conditions, except in trigeminal neuralgia, chronic radiculopathy and HIV neuropathy, with level A evidence in support of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), pregabalin, gabapentin, tramadol and opioids (in various conditions), duloxetine, venlafaxine, topical lidocaine and capsaicin patches (in restricted conditions). Combination therapy appears useful for TCA-gabapentin and gabapentin-opioids (level A).

Conclusions

There are still too few large-scale comparative studies. For future trials, we recommend to assess comorbidities, quality of life, symptoms and signs with standardized tools and attempt to better define responder profiles to specific drug treatments.

### Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: a review of therapeutic options [^1119fhmC]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a disabling consequence of the reactivation of the varicella zoster infection. The observation that patients with PHN experience various types of pain suggests that multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms are involved, which may include the peripheral and central nervous systems. A reasonable initial strategy would involve selecting from among multiple agents that have complementary mechanisms of action and that have been proven effective in controlled clinical trials, such as the lidocaine patch 5%, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and opioids. Based on initial assessment and ongoing reassessment, sequential trials should be undertaken until adequate pain relief is achieved. This may ultimately lead to therapy with more than one medication. Safety and tolerability are important considerations in choosing initial therapy, particularly in older patients. Physicians can either add another agent to the current regimen or switch to a new type of monotherapy if there is inadequate response to initial therapy. Alternative therapies, (i.e., ketamine, intrathecal corticosteroid injections) have not been adequately studied. Well-designed, multicenter, controlled clinical trials are needed to develop a treatment algorithm that provides an evidence-based, rational approach to treating PHN.

### Response of intractable post herpetic neuralgia to intrathecal baclofen [^115jc5wc]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

An intractable case of Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) in which all other treatment options were exhausted was successfully treated with intrathecal baclofen infusion with a complex continuous delivery mode. A 72-year old man presented to the pain clinic with a 4-year history of left lower extremity PHN. He had seen multiple experts in the field, failed numerous pharmacological therapies, and interventional techniques. After multiple neuraxial medications were tried, baclofen was chosen and an intrathecal drug delivery system was implanted. Eight months after the procedure he continues to have 80% pain relief. PHN is a devastating complication of shingles. Fortunately, most cases respond to conventional therapies. For intractable cases intrathecal baclofen appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic modality.

### Topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain: applying the evidence [^117HW33B]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (NP) may only achieve partial pain relief with currently recommended first-line oral treatments, which are also associated with systemic adverse events. Topical treatments are currently considered second- or third-line options, but a recent pharmacologic treatment algorithm has called for broader first-line use of these agents. This has highlighted a need to communicate the benefits associated with topical agents, in particular around the efficacy, targeted local action, and limited systemic availability resulting in minimal systemic adverse events and drug-drug interactions.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate the evidence base for topical therapies currently used to treat peripheral NP, discuss the evidence comparing these treatments head-to-head with oral standard of care, and evaluate how they fit into treatment regimens in the "real world".

Methods

This is a narrative review.

Results

Two topical treatments are currently licensed: lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (post-herpetic neuralgia) and the capsaicin 8% patch (peripheral NP). When compared head to head with the oral standard of care (pregabalin), the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster provided similar relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia but did not meet the primary predefined criteria for noninferiority. The capsaicin 8% patch, however, demonstrated noninferior efficacy when compared head-to-head with pregabalin across a wide range of peripheral NP etiologies. Importantly, both treatments demonstrated effective pain relief without the systemic adverse events associated with oral therapies.

Conclusion

First-line use of topical agents may be of particular benefit in patients where the safety and tolerability of oral therapy is a concern.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111qqGq1]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug–drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

### Reduction of painful area as new possible therapeutic target in post-herpetic neuropathic pain treated with 5% lidocaine medicated plaster: a case series [^111MgXwG]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is neuropathic pain persisting after an acute episode of herpes zoster, and is associated with severe pain and sensory abnormalities that adversely affect the patient's quality of life and increase health care costs. Up to 83% of patients with PHN describe localized neuropathic pain, defined as "a type of neuropathic pain characterized by consistent and circumscribed area(s) of maximum pain". Topical treatments have been suggested as a first-line treatment for localized neuropathic pain. Use of 5% lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce abnormal nervous peripheral discharge and via the plaster could have a "protective" function in the affected area. It has been suggested that use of this plaster could reduce pain as well as the size of the painful area. To evaluate this possible outcome, we retrospectively reviewed eight patients with PHN, treated using 5% lidocaine medicated plaster. During a follow-up period of 3 months, we observed good pain relief, which was associated with a 46% reduction in size of the painful area after one month (from 236.38 ± 140.34 cm² to 128.80 ± 95.7 cm²) and a 66% reduction after 3 months (81.38 ± 59.19 cm²). Our study cohort was composed mainly of elderly patients taking multiple drugs to treat comorbidities, who have a high risk of drug-drug interactions. Such patients benefit greatly from topical treatment of PHN. Our observations confirm the effectiveness of lidocaine plasters in the treatment of PHN, indicating that 5% lidocaine medicated plaster could reduce the size of the painful area. This last observation has to be confirmed and the mechanisms clarified in appropriate larger randomized controlled trials.

### A study of shingles and the development of postherpetic neuralgia in east london [^112jQkBd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia following shingles and the factors that are known to predict it were examined in a prospective observational community study of patients with acute shingles presenting to their family doctors. The detection of viral DNA in the blood at presentation as a prognostic indicator for pain was also evaluated. Patients were followed for one year and the persistence of pain following rash assessed. Among 165 patients who had completed 6 months, and 139 one-year follow-up, the prevalence of post herpetic neuralgia was 30% at 6 weeks 27% at 12 weeks, 15.9% at 6 months, and 9% at one year. Age and severity of pain were significantly associated with the persistence of pain beyond 3 months. Viremia at presentation was detected in 66% of patients and was significantly associated with the presence of pain at six months or beyond. Antiviral agents were administered to only 50% of those at highest risk of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) mainly because of presentation longer than 72 hours after the onset of rash. Few patients were prescribed the more potent prodrugs, Valaciclovir and Famciclovir. In conclusion, treatment of acute shingles in this observational community-based study was suboptimal in 50% of cases. More accurate prediction of which subset of elderly patients are most at risk of PHN may enable targeted prescribing of the most potent drugs to those most likely to benefit.

### Assessing the reporting quality in randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for postherpetic neuralgia using the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines [^1132YdU4]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This study evaluates the reporting quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on acupuncture use for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and explores related factors.

Methods

The following six databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, VIP, CNKI, and SinoMed, were systematically searched from their inception to December 2018. RCTs using acupuncture as an intervention for postherpetic neuralgia were selected and incorporated in this study. The reporting quality was assessed based on the CONSORT statement and the STRICTA guidelines. Regression analyses were also conducted on pre-specified study characteristics searching for factors associated with reporting quality.

Results

A total of 137 RCTs were included in this study. The CONSORT based median OQS was 12 (minimum 3, maximum 29). Of the items comprised in the statement, ten were sufficiently reported (reported in over 70% of trials). The remaining fifty-five items were poorly reported (reported by fewer than 5% of trials). The STRICTA based median OQS was 9 (minimum 2, maximum 15). The results showed that eight of the comprised items were well reported (reported in over 70% of trials), and only three were incompletely reported (reported in fewer than 20% of trials). Based on the CONSORT statement related analysis, a post-2010 publication (β coefficient 2.394, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.168–3.620) and funding (β coefficient 4.456, 95% CI: 3.009–5.903) represented independent and significant predictors of a high overall reporting quality. However, only a funding source (β coefficient 1.305, 95% CI 0.219–2.391) was associated with an increased OQS based on STRICTA analysis.

Conclusion

The findings indicated that RCTs on acupuncture for PHN generally had a sub-optimal reporting quality, a situation that improved for those published after 2010 or with funding sources. Therefore, rigorous adherence to the CONSORT statement and the STRICTA guidelines should be emphasized in future studies.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121ddqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic refractory neuropathic pain syndrome. It is characterized by the invasive nerve distribution area maintaining persistent, severe pain after herpes zoster lesions are gone.–18–41% of patients suffering from herpes zoster experience intense pain, the most common chronic complication after the healing of the rash.–The pain persists for months or even years, during which physical, emotional and social function may suffer. Increasing age is a risk factor for PHN, and it has been reported that immunosuppression, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes and recent trauma can also increase risk.

The current pharmacological treatment for PHN is tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and maprotiline), gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids and topical lidocaine patches.–However, the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants have cardiovascular and renal comorbidities which limit their use. Occasionally, despite the administration of complex drug combinations, analgesia is still ineffective.

In recent years, clinical and scientific attention to acupuncture has increased. Acupuncture is a reliable and reproducible treatment for acute and chronic pain.–Reports have shown the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic pain and that the treatment effects persist for weeks.–Many reports have confirmed the therapeutic effects of acupuncture on PHN. These have included case reports and pilot studies which have identified acupuncture as a therapy with promising results for relieving pain without significant adverse reactions.–As more and more PHN treatments are developed, acupuncture might have an advantage for analgesia and reducing adverse reactions. However, this statement lacks evidence. Thus, we have collected and summarized published evidence on acupuncture for PHN.

### Ultrasound-guided selective pulsed radiofrequency treatment of great auricular nerve for post-herpetic neuralgia of the head and neck: a case report [^1147q3xi]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, there was rarely report on the effect of PRF treatment of GAN in PHN patients around the world. We team attempted successfully ultrasound-guided selective PRF treatment of GAN for the first time. The treatment method is safe, effective, applicable and feasible, which can provide more prospective therapy way for PHN in the head and neck, even probably for GAN neuralgia, and be worthy of clinical promotion. In addition, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and SSS might be meaningful to evaluate the efficacy of intractable PHN. The limitation of this paper is that only a sample size meeting the standard is observed and lacks of a follow-up record and data of the post-treatment. We therefore expect more researchers and scholars to test and verify the views elaborated in this case report by expanding the sample size.

### Efficacy of pregabalin in post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^114dFw7u]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diverse types of nerve injury are recognized as triggers of chronic post-traumatic neuropathic pain (PTNP), including post-surgical syndromes. Tissue injury may chronically alter peripheral nociceptive processing, shifting pain from acute to chronic. The need for symptomatic treatment of PTNP is increasing but remains inadequately addressed.

Pregabalin, an alpha 2 -delta (α₂δ) ligand (gabapentinoid), is approved in the United States for the treatment of three neuropathic pain (NeP) conditions: diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and post-spinal cord injury (SCI). An 8-week randomized clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of pregabalin for the management of chronic post-traumatic/post-surgical pain.

A study of longer duration was designed to meet the US regulatory standard for a chronic pain indication: 12 weeks of maintenance or fixed dosing. Methodologic features were incorporated to increase assay sensitivity for the detection of an analgesic signal in this heterogeneous patient population. The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of pregabalin (flexibly dosed, 150–600 mg/day) versus placebo in the treatment of PTNP. Secondary objectives compared the efficacy of pregabalin vs placebo with respect to overall status, pain-related activity limitation, and sleep, in addition to safety and tolerability assessments.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^11498de3]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Optimal management of pain in PHN patients is complex and difficult. Although there are several therapeutic options, PHN treatment is often inadequate, leaving patients undertreated. Better utilization of available options and multimechanistic approaches to PHN management based on the patient's individual characteristics may be the most beneficial. Primary care plays a crucial role in the development and implementation of the PHN treatment plan, and establishing effective communication with patients. Well-devised and well-executed PHN therapy will not only ensure sufficient pain relief but will also facilitate improvements in patients' physical and psychosocial functions.

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for peer-reviewed articles about HZ and PHN using the PubMed search engine and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. Identified studies included those that evaluated the treatment of HZ and/or PHN in terms of efficacy and safety. The same search was repeated for review articles, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Additional searches included bibliographies of the retrieved articles, and Medline searches using the names of authors who had published several articles on HZ or PHN. We first reviewed titles and abstracts for relevance, and selected articles were then reviewed on their entirety. Included articles were English-language studies, addressed epidemiology and burden of HZ, were prospective or retrospective studies that provided clinical information on treated patients, provided detailed methodology and clear outcome measures, demonstrated treatment/prevention of HZ or PHN as a primary purpose, and described treatments feasible for an outpatient setting approved by the FDA or adhering to current guidelines on the care of PHN patients.–Studies and reviews that included other conditions were only included if results were reported separately for each condition. Studies that described case reports or case series were excluded.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^111GEksi]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

### Lidocaine, isopropyl alcohol (xyliderm) [^115P4ABr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours.

Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value < 0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups.

INDICATION AND USAGE

Lidocan™ is indicated for relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. It should be applied only to intact skin.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Lidocan™ is contraindicated in patients with a known history of sensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide type, or to any other component of the product.

Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value < 0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^116S3rZ3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Management

Medications form the basis of first- and second-line therapy for neuropathic pain (Table 1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentanoids, tramadol, lidocaine, and capsaicin are the most effective options. Most of these first- and second-line options come with considerable potential for side effects. Depending on the medication, a three- to eight-week trial is recommended with review midway and at the end of the trial to assess effectiveness. If the patient does not receive significant relief or has adverse effects from a medication, then dosing should be adjusted, an alternative medication or combination therapy should be tried, or the patient should be considered for a trial of neurostimulation.

Table 1
First- and second-line medications for neuropathic pain

Tricyclic Antidepressants. TCAs are one of the most studied antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Their use as a firstline therapy is supported across multiple guidelines. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain post–spinal cord injury and of limited effect in radiculopathy, HIV, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Communication gaps between physicians and patients with postherpetic neuralgia: results from a national study on practice patterns [^1166up4P]. Journal of Pain Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to identify differences in perceptions of care regarding postherpetic neuralgia, including communication patterns between patients and physicians and levels of satisfaction with therapies and care.

Methods

A survey was developed for physicians (neurologists, internists, and family physicians) and patients with postherpetic neuralgia in order to determine their perspectives on its management.

Results

A total of 142 eligible patient respondents were included in the study, and responses were compared with those of 150 primary care physicians and 76 neurologist respondents. Few patients and physicians indicated satisfaction with the currently available treatments for postherpetic neuralgia. While nearly all physicians responded that they discuss the cause of postherpetic neuralgia with a patient, one in four patients indicated that their physician did not discuss the cause. Similarly, one in four patients were not aware of the duration of postherpetic neuralgia, the treatment side effects, or what to expect from treatment. Patients may be less likely to discuss treatment side effects and quality of life issues than physicians perceive.

Conclusion

Physicians and patients have similar perceptions regarding treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia; however, certain gaps in communication were evident, which may be attributable to physician knowledge and communication skills with patients. Strategies to improve issues of expected outcomes and side effects of treatment may be useful to physicians.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^112JRMsE]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical features of PHN

PHN is characterized by constant and/or intermittent paroxysmal pain persisting for ≥ 90 days after the onset of HZ rash. For some patients, PHN is a continuation of the painful symptoms of the acute phase of HZ; others experience completely different pains and sensations. Allodynia is present in ≥ 70% of patients and is usually considered to be the most distressing and debilitating PHN component. Numbness and tingling also contribute to the PHN burden. Clinically, there is an area of scarred skin, which denotes sensory loss and the wider area of dynamic mechanical allodynia. Other neuropathic features include burning, electric shocks, pins and needles and itching. The 'neuropathic itch' in PHN patients may lead to injury in those who scratch itchy skin so much that loses its protective sensation.

Most patients categorise the intensity of PHN as moderate-to-severe (pain scores ≥ 4 on a scale of 0–10) despite receiving analgesic agents. The persistency of PHN means that patients have few periods of respite from erratic, painful and prolonged attacks.

### Topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain in adults [^112jbxcN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic that is sometimes used on the skin to treat neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of topical lidocaine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and to assess the associated adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 1 July 2014, together with the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing any formulation of topical lidocaine with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 and over. We included only full journal publication articles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and that we considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that we considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 12 studies (508 participants) in comparisons with placebo or an active control. Six studies enrolled participants with moderate or severe postherpetic neuralgia, and the remaining studies enrolled different, or mixed, neuropathic pain conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia and postsurgical or post-traumatic neuralgia. Four different formulations were used: 5% medicated patch, 5% cream, 5% gel, and 8% spray. Most studies used a cross-over design, and two used a parallel-group design. Two studies used enriched enrolment with randomised withdrawal. Seven studies used multiple doses, with one to four-week treatment periods, and five used single applications. We judged all of the studies at high risk of bias because of small size or incomplete outcome assessment, or both. There was no first or second tier evidence, and no pooling of data was possible for efficacy outcomes. Only one multiple-dose study reported our primary outcome of participants with ≥ 50% or ≥ 30% pain intensity reduction. Three single-dose studies reported participants who were pain-free at a particular time point, or had a 2-point (of 10) reduction in pain intensity. The two enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal studies reported time to loss of efficacy. In all but one study, third tier (very low quality) evidence indicated that lidocaine was better than placebo for some measure of pain relief. Pooling multiple-dose studies across conditions demonstrated no clear evidence of an effect of lidocaine on the incidence of adverse events or withdrawals, but there were few events and the withdrawal phase of enriched enrolment designs is not suitable to assess the true impact of adverse events (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found no evidence from good quality randomised controlled studies to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief of pain. Clinical experience also supports efficacy in some patients. Several large ongoing studies, of adequate duration, with clinically useful outcomes should provide more robust conclusions about both efficacy and harm.

AHRQ review of non‑opioid pharmacological treatments for chronic pain — short‑, intermediate‑, and long‑term effectiveness — found that in the short term, improvement in pain and function was small with specific anticonvulsant, moderate with specific antidepressants in diabetic peripheral neuropathy/post‑herpetic neuralgia and fibromyalgia, and small with NSAIDs in osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis; in the intermediate term, evidence was limited, with benefit for memantine in fibromyalgia and for serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants in treating low back pain and fibromyalgia; in the long term, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions, evidence on QOL was limited, and no treatment achieved a large improvement in pain or function; and small to moderate, dose‑dependent increases in withdrawal due to adverse events were found.

### Peripheral nerve surgery for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia [^117JtrDM]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that develops in some patients after the resolution of herpes zoster, and has no medical cure. Medications used to treat chronic pain do not hasten resolution of the disorder and may impair function. In this brief case report, we describe our experience with excision and implantation to muscle of peripheral sensory nerves in the affected dermatomes as a novel surgical treatment to reduce pain and improve quality of life for patients with this condition. Of the 3 treated patients, all had resolution of chronic pain after surgery. It is concluded that peripheral nerve surgery offers a promising option to improve pain and quality of life in postherpetic neuralgia patients, without affecting systemic functioning.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for postherpetic neuralgia in Chinese and international patients [^112tm3WL]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a neuropathic pain condition that arises in response to acute herpes zoster infection. The reported incidence of PHN ranges from 5% to 30% of infected adults–and increases with age.–PHN-related pain negatively affects sleep as well as reducing quality of life, physical and social functioning, and psychological well-being.–

Pregabalin is an α2-δ calcium channel subunit ligand indicated globally for the treatment of PHN-related pain, including in the United Statesand across Europe. The efficacy and safety of pregabalin for PHN have been demonstrated in multiple international clinical trials.–In these trials, pregabalin statistically significantly improved pain and disrupted sleep versus placebo, and patients were more likely to report a 30% or 50% improvement in pain, and global improvement, with pregabalin over placebo.–However, few patients in these international trials were Asian or of Asian origin. More recently, clinical trials on pregabalin efficacy and safety for PHN have been conducted specifically in Chinese patients. In these Chinese trials, pregabalin also statistically significantly improved pain and disrupted sleep versus placebo, and patients were more likely to report a 30% improvement in pain, or global improvement, with pregabalin over placebo. Pregabalin is also indicated for PHN-related pain in China. Although pregabalin is minimally metabolized and therefore there is no reason to anticipate that its effectiveness would be different in different patient populations, whether the efficacy and safety profiles of pregabalin are similar in Chinese and international patient populations has not been tested. The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in Chinese patients with PHN with an international patient population with PHN. The impact of baseline pain severity on efficacy responses in the two patient groups was also examined.

### Gabapentin (Neurontin) [^114nwM8F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Postherpetic Neuralgia

NEURONTIN was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Lidocaine plasters for postherpetic neuralgia? [^113JU3qM]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, about 1 in 2,500 people experiences neuropathic pain that is still present 3–6 months after acute herpes zoster (shingles). This condition, known as postherpetic neuralgia, is the most common complication of herpes zoster and can be chronic, intractable and distressing. Treatments used in an attempt to reduce postherpetic neuralgia include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline — an unlicensed indication), antiepileptics (e.g. gabapentin) and opioid analgesics, as well as topical treatments such as capsaicin. However, such treatments may only provide partial pain relief, and tolerability can be a problem, particularly in older patients. Versatis (Grunenthal Ltd), a topical preparation of lidocaine formulated in a plaster, has recently been licensed for treating patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Does it offer useful benefit?

### Postherpetic neuralgia: from preclinical models to the clinic [^112az39q]. Neurotherapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common complication of herpes zoster, which results from reactivation of varicella zoster virus, is a challenging neuropathic pain syndrome. The incidence and severity of herpes zoster and PHN increases with immune impairment or age and may become a greater burden both in terms of health economics and individual suffering. A clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this disease and translation of preclinical outcomes to the clinic may lead to more efficacious treatment options. Here we give an overview of recent findings from preclinical models and clinical research on PHN.

Herpes zoster has an incidence of 350,000 cases per year in the United States. The involvement of the foot and ankle is rare. Most surgeons are not aware of this disease as a cause of extremity pain, its manifestation, and the treatment options. Post-herpetic neuralgia is a common sequela of herpes zoster and can be prevented with prompt treatment. In this article, we present a case of a 53-year-old female with right heel pain secondary to herpes zoster.

### Ultrasound-guided selective pulsed radiofrequency treatment of great auricular nerve for post-herpetic neuralgia of the head and neck: a case report [^114X33kG]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster, which is the pain lasting for 1 month or more after the healing of the herpes zoster rash. However, some scholars also have believed that the such pain lasting for more than 3 months is named as PHN. Clinically, PHN is characterized by central or deafferentation pain with persistent burning or paroxysmal tingling and resistance to peripheral destructive procedures. Commonly, the pain from PHN persists for many months or even years, which causes mental disorders, interferes with sleep and activities of daily living. The treatment methods of PHN mainly include drug therapies and physical therapies. In recent years, pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and great auricular nerve (GAN) block technology have been gradually and widely used for the treatment of PHN and great auricular neuralgia respectively. However, to our knowledge, there were few related reports describing corresponding results when GAN is in the administration of PRF all over the world. Thus, we reported for the first time a case of a patient treating with selective PRF treatment of GAN under the ultrasound-guided due to PHN in the head and neck.

### Prevention and management of adverse events of novel agents in multiple myeloma: a consensus of the European Myeloma Network [^111aMhKC]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster

Pain, scarring, and post-herpetic neuralgia are the most common morbidities associated with herpes zoster reactivation. In pivotal trials, herpes zoster infection occurred in 3–13% of patients receiving bortezomib monotherapy (Table S2B). Therefore, antiviral prophylaxis during the entire duration of treatment with any of the available PIs, but also during treatment with mAbs, is mandatory. Antiviral agents such as acyclovir, valaciclovir, and penciclovir can be used; valaciclovir and penciclovir have greater bioavailability than acyclovir making them particularly suitable for outpatient treatment. Valaciclovir was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia, but randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of the various agents are not available. In the case of overt viral disease, anti-myeloma therapy should be interrupted and antiviral therapy be intensified. Upon symptom relieve, anti-myeloma therapy can be continued, but a risk of renewed virus reactivation remains.

Cytomegalovirus

PIs and high-dose therapy increase the risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation or infection. Such infections not rarely remain unrecognized. For diagnosis of CMV infection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology should be used, because antibody testing may fail due to impaired antibody production. CMV prophylaxis is generally not recommended in multiple myeloma, but may be considered in selective cases with repeated CMV reactivation. In case of active infection, therapy is typically initiated with intravenous ganciclovir. For second-line treatment or in case of poor tolerance or resistance to ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir can be used. Several new drugs (maribavir, brincidofovir, and letermovir) are undergoing clinical trials. Oral valgancyclovir is convenient, usually well tolerated and an option for initial therapy in very fit patients and for prevention of recurrence of infections during periods of aggressive therapy. Treatment should be continued at minimum until a negative PCR test result.

### Epidemiology and treatment of neuropathic pain: the UK primary care perspective [^1125X91S]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

The true incidence of neuropathic pain is unknown, but it is believed to be under-diagnosed and treated inadequately, despite the availability of drugs with proven efficacy. Our objective was to report the epidemiology and drug treatment of neuropathic pain as managed by UK primary care physicians. A descriptive analysis of the epidemiology of incident post-herpetic neuralgia (n = 12,386); trigeminal neuralgia (8268); phantom limb pain (451) and painful diabetic neuropathy (4719) and prescription treatment at diagnosis from computerised UK general practice records (GPRD): January 1992 to April 2002. Incidences per 100,000 person years observation of 40 (95% CI 39–41) for post-herpetic neuralgia, 27 (26–27) for trigeminal neuralgia, 1 (1–2) for phantom limb pain and 15 (15–16) for painful diabetic neuropathy are reported, with rates decreasing over time for phantom limb pain and post-herpetic neuralgia and increasing for painful diabetic neuropathy. Drugs were initiated at first diagnosis record for 46–66% of conditions, usually one item, with antidepressants included in 30% of prescriptions, anticonvulsants in 20% and opioid analgesics in 20%. The most commonly prescribed items were the same across conditions; amitriptyline, carbamazepine, coproxamol, codydramol and codeine+paracetamol. Carbamazepine was prescribed to 58% of the trigeminal neuralgia cohort. In 2600 patients followed to stable therapy, there was a median of one to two drug changes. We provide the primary care managed incidence of four neuropathic pain conditions. For commonly prescribed treatments, changes in therapy are less frequent when initial therapy was with antidepressants or anticonvulsants rather than conventional analgesics.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111XX2WC]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentanoids include gabapentin and pregabalin. They are a group of anticonvulsant medications that act by blocking presynaptic alpha-2-delta calcium channels in the dorsal horn, inhibiting neurotransmitter release. They are considered firstline agents in the treatment of neuropathic pain by multiple international societies. Gabapentin and pregabalin both have been shown to be effective in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pregabalin also has been shown to be superior to placebo in the treatment of spinal cord injury.

A Cochrane review of gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults confirmed that gabapentin is associated with greater rates of pain relief compared with placebo in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but it concluded that evidence for other neuropathic pain conditions was weak. Finnerup and colleagues' systematic review of pharmacologic management of chronic neuropathic pain calculated that the combined NNT 1 of 14 RCTs of gabapentin was 6.3 (5.0–8.3). Similarly, the combined NNT from six RCTs of gabapentin extended-release/encarbil was 8.3 (6.2–13). The NNH 2 for gabapentin for all etiologies combined was 25.6 (15.3–78.6).

Finnerup et al. also assessed the efficacy of pregabalin. The combined NNT of 25 RCTs was 7.7 (6.5–9.4), and the NNH was 13.9 (11.6–17.4). Unlike gabapentin, they also reported a dose response, with a greater response being seen in those taking 600 mg daily than in those taking 300 mg. Pregabalin has also been shown to decrease health care and non–health care costs compared with gabapentin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Gabapentanoids should be trialed for a four- to six-week period with two weeks at the maximum tolerated dose. Poorly tolerated side effects or inadequate pain relief should prompt dosage adjustment, cessation of the medication, progression to other firstline agents, or a trial of combination therapy. The most common adverse effects include somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, and lower extremity edema.

### Assessing the reporting quality in randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for postherpetic neuralgia using the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines [^1163vN2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study revealed suboptimal reporting qualities for RCTs using acupuncture for PHN management. Most trials failed to mention crucial methodological data, registration information, the rationale behind the choice of acupuncture or comparable treatments, the acupuncturist qualification, and the treatment context. However, the findings indicated higher reporting quality in RCTs with funding sources or published after 2010. Therefore, more effort is needed for strict adherence to the CONSORT statement and STRICTA guidelines.

### Is acupuncture an effective postherpetic neuralgia treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dhSb9]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This systematic review includes eight prospective studies containing 498 patients. The meta-analysis showed that pain, the primary outcome, was lower in the acupuncture group than in the control group. Subgroup analysis of the different types showed that EA, fire needling, bloodletting and cupping each relieved more pain than the controls. When the sample size was greater than 60, the acupuncture group showed better relief (ie, VAS score) than the control group. However, there was no significance for sample sizes less than 60. Subgroup analysis showed that the sample size could have affected statistical heterogeneity.

Based on these results, less literature was included in the secondary outcome. In the HAMA outcome, acupuncture was shown to relieve anxiety. These results were significant with a high I² and a low P -value. Only one study was included for QOL, and in it, the acupuncture group had better QOL than the control group. No adverse reactions occurred in the acupuncture groups of the two studies that reported on them.

Interpreting the findings

It is believed that acute zoster infection in nerve damage results in persistent pain which is the main symptom of PHN. Depression and social communication disorder are also associated with pain in postherpetic neuralgia patients. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) recommends tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and gabapentin/pregabalin as first-line treatments for PHN. However, their side effects must be taken into consideration, particularly with elderly patients. China's guidelines for treatment of PHN recommend acupuncture because of its clinical effects. A search of the clinical trial registries showed that large-sample randomized controlled trials of acupuncture for PHN are lacking. Additionally, no rigorous systematic reviews were found either.

This review includes studies of acupuncture treatment for PHN. The meta-analysis shows that acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, relieve anxiety and improve QOL among PHN patients. In the acupuncture group, the incidence of adverse effects was lower than in the control group. These results are similar to those of existing published studies. The VZV Pain Study Group reported that acupuncture could play a role in relieving acute herpetic pain, and no serious treatment-related adverse events were observed in the study.

### Enhancing predictive accuracy for acute herpetic neuralgia treatment: a fresh perspective on pulsed radiofrequency therapy research [letter] [^113K6XmT]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

We have taken a keen interest in the study recently published in your journal, titled "Predictive Value of Current Perception Threshold for Prognosis of Pulsed Radiofrequency in Patients with Acute Herpetic Neuralgia". While the study offers valuable contributions to the field, there are a few areas where additional considerations could enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings.

Firstly, although the study considered the distribution of herpes on both sides of the body, it did not extensively explore the specific characteristics of herpes zoster, such as the location of the lesions and the nature of the associated pain. The presentation of herpes zoster neuralgia varies with the affected nerve ganglia, making detailed information on lesion sites critical for predicting treatment responses and outcomes. For instance, areas like the face and head are notably sensitive due to higher nerve densities, potentially resulting in intensified pain. Failure to thoroughly analyze lesion locations might overlook variations in treatment efficacy, consequently impacting the precision of Current Perception Threshold (CPT) evaluations and the customization of treatment plans.

Secondly, the article fails to address whether an analysis of collinearity among the variables, such as the calculation of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), was performed. As Table 4 illustrates, Zhao et al directly apply results from univariate logistic regression — including age, preoperative NRS scores, and CPT ratios at 5Hz and 2000Hz — to their multivariate logistic regression analysis without assessing collinearity among the variables. In terms of varying CPT ratios, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) may simultaneously impact multiple types of nerve fibers in specific pathological states, potentially exhibiting correlations even among CPT measurements targeting different fibers. A check for collinearity could significantly enhance the robustness and reliability of the model's outcomes.

To enhance patient care, a multidisciplinary approach to managing Acute Herpetic Neuralgia (AHN) should be adopted in the future. This can be achieved by establishing a collaborative treatment team that includes pain management specialists, neurologists, dermatologists, and mental health professionals, offering more comprehensive and effective management strategies. Such a team-based approach leverages the expertise of diverse professionals to tackle the complex and multifaceted challenges associated with herpes zoster neuralgia, thereby improving patient outcomes through an integrated treatment plan.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111pVHjK]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is being implemented, a sizable physician shortage is predicted, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners are predicted to fill the gap in primary care. Therefore, more mid-level providers may coordinate the acute treatment of HZ in urgent-care settings or primary care offices, and they will be responsible for the surveillance and management of PHN. PHN is a complex condition, is difficult to treat, and requires a methodical therapeutic approach, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners are critical in coordinating team-based and patient-centered care.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

Neuropathic Pain within the Distribution of Up to Two Nerves

Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is a "clinical description (and not a diagnosis) which requires a demonstrable lesion or a disease that satisfies established neurological diagnostic criteria". Notably, recognized painful neuropathic conditions include post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), and post-amputation pain.

PHN develops after the reactivation of the herpes zoster virus from its latent state. The virus is kept in a latent state in the dorsal root ganglion by the body's cell-mediated immunity. Commonly affected regions include ophthalmic (32%), thoracic (16.5%), and facial (16%) distributions. Two primary pathophysiologic mechanisms of PHN pain include sensitization and deafferentation. Both gabapentinand pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglionhave demonstrated benefit in patients with PHN. When these are ineffective, PNS may be considered. Likewise, PDN affects millions of patients in the United States, and medications have shown mixed benefits. Amitriptyline, gabapentin, duloxetine, and pregabalin have all shown some benefit in studies, as has topical capsaicin.

When neuropathic pain persists despite pharmacologic interventions, psychological support, and physical and other interventional therapies, neuromodulation may be considered. SCS and PNS are valuable options for patients with persistent neuropathic pain. These therapies reduce pain perception and improve functional outcomes by modulating the electrical signals within nerve pathways. SCS has been particularly effective in treating complex regional pain syndrome and post-surgical pain, while PNS offers targeted relief for specific nerve injuries.

GABARONE was evaluated for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of a total of 563 patients with pain for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash (Table 6).

Each study included a 7- or 8-week double-blind phase (3 or 4 weeks of titration and 4 weeks of fixed dose). Patients initiated treatment with titration to a maximum of 900 mg/day gabapentin over 3 days. Dosages were then to be titrated in 600 to 1200 mg/day increments at 3- to 7-day intervals to the target dose over 3 to 4 weeks. Patients recorded their pain in a daily diary using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). A mean pain score during baseline of at least 4 was required for randomization. Analyses were conducted using the ITT population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Both studies demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at all doses tested.

The reduction in weekly mean pain scores was seen by Week 1 in both studies, and were maintained to the end of treatment. Comparable treatment effects were observed in all active treatment arms. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling provided confirmatory evidence of efficacy across all doses. Figures 1 and 2 show pain intensity scores over time for Studies 1 and 2.

The proportion of responders (those patients reporting at least 50% improvement in endpoint pain score compared to baseline) was calculated for each study (Figure 3).

### Mirogabalin in Japanese patients with renal impairment and pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy or post-herpetic neuralgia: a phase III, open-label, 14-week study [^115HvjJt]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mirogabalin was recently approved in Japan for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, based on data from clinical trials in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), common clinical conditions which cause intense distress for patients. We characterized the safety and tolerability of mirogabalin in Japanese patients with renal impairment.

Patients and Methods

This multicenter, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02607280) enrolled renally impaired individuals aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with DPNP or PHN, and with an average daily pain score (ADPS) of ≥ 4 over the 7 days prior to treatment initiation. Mirogabalin dosage was titrated for 2 weeks, followed by a fixed dose for 12 weeks according to degree of renal impairment: 7.5 mg twice daily for moderate impairment and 7.5 mg once daily for severe impairment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of mirogabalin, evaluated via treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in ADPS from baseline to Week 14.

Results

Overall, 35 patients were enrolled (30 with moderate and 5 with severe renal impairment). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity; the most commonly reported were nasopharyngitis (22.9%) and somnolence (11.4%). Only 4 patients (11.4%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. Mirogabalin significantly decreased ADPS from baseline in patients with renal impairment; least squares mean change from baseline at Week 14 was -1.9 (95% confidence interval: -2.8, -1.0).

Conclusion

Mirogabalin was well tolerated and significantly reduced pain levels when used to treat DPNP/PHN at a fixed dose of 7.5 mg once or twice daily in patients with renal impairment.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1167GdV3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).
