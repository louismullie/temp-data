## Question

What are the current ASCCP guidelines for HPV 16 and 18 testing in cervical cancer screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current ASCCP guidelines for HPV 16 and 18 testing in cervical cancer screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of risk-based management and the clinical action thresholds. Then, I should verify how HPV 16 and 18 fit into primary HPV screening and reflex triage. Next, I will examine specific management pathways for HPV 16/18–positive results, including when to go straight to colposcopy and when expedited treatment is preferred. After that, I should review the evidence base and risk estimates that justify these actions. Finally, I will consider special situations, implementation nuances, and how recent updates and enduring guidelines refine practice, before summarizing practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle. The 2019 ASCCP guidelines moved from result-based to risk-based management, using estimated immediate and 5-year CIN 3+ risks to assign one of six clinical actions, with key thresholds at 4% immediate risk for colposcopy, about 25% for considering expedited treatment, and about 60% for preferring expedited treatment without biopsy, which anchors all subsequent decisions including those for HPV 16 and 18 [^111w4nBk] [^116tJhXY] [^115njFKx].

> I need to check how HPV 16 and 18 are positioned in screening strategies. Primary HPV screening is endorsed as preferred by ACS and acceptable by USPSTF, and the FDA-approved primary HPV assays (e.g. cobas, Onclarity) provide partial genotyping that separates HPV 16, HPV 18, and a pool of other high-risk types, which is integral to risk stratification and triage in the ASCCP framework [^111aq8Do] [^114T4GY6] [^111na6k8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reflex testing. I should confirm that all positive HPV results, including HPV 16/18, should have reflex triage from the same specimen when feasible, typically reflex cytology, because cytology results can push patients into higher risk strata and inform whether expedited treatment is appropriate. If reflex cytology is not feasible, proceeding directly to colposcopy for HPV 16/18 is acceptable, and if triage is not done beforehand, cytology should be collected at colposcopy to guide management [^1164acWi] [^111hdEGk] [^116kqN3S].

> Next, I should review the specific management for HPV 16. HPV 16 confers the highest risk for CIN 3+ and occult cancer; even with NILM cytology, HPV 16–positive results meet or exceed the 4% colposcopy threshold, so referral to colposcopy is recommended. When HPV 16 is combined with HSIL cytology, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is about 60%, so expedited treatment without biopsy is preferred in nonpregnant patients aged 25 years or older, with shared decision-making about fertility implications [^111hdEGk] [^111aq8Do] [^111cWS55].

> Wait, let me verify the stance on HPV 18. Although HPV 18–positive NILM carries an immediate CIN 3+ risk around 3% in some datasets, which is technically below the 4% colposcopy threshold, ASCCP still recommends colposcopy for HPV 18–positive NILM because of the disproportionate association with invasive adenocarcinoma and endocervical glandular lesions that cytology can miss. This is an explicit exception to the numeric threshold justified by cancer risk rather than CIN 3+ risk alone [^111hdEGk] [^117S4XFi].

> I should double-check the evidence base that justifies these actions. The risk estimates derive from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California cohort of 1.5 million patients, with validation in ATHENA and Onclarity datasets, showing that HPV 16–positive results carry markedly elevated immediate CIN 3+ risks and that HPV 18–positive NILM, while lower for CIN 3+, has concerning cancer risks that warrant colposcopy despite the numeric threshold [^1159J35r] [^111DQFW8].

> Let me consider special situations and implementation details. For unsatisfactory cytology with HPV 16/18 positivity, direct colposcopy is recommended. For patients 25 years and older, expedited treatment is framed as preferred when risk is ≥ 60% and acceptable when 25–60%, with particular emphasis on HPV 16–positive HSIL and never/underscreened patients with HPV-positive HSIL. Shared decision-making is essential when fertility impact is a concern, and excisional therapy is generally preferred over ablation for histologic HSIL in the U.S [^117NLpEX] [^11539VrB] [^116tJhXY].

> But wait, what if the lab cannot provide reflex cytology on the same specimen. I should confirm that if reflex triage is not feasible, proceeding directly to colposcopy for HPV 16/18 is acceptable, and if cytology was not obtained in advance, it should be collected at colposcopy to enable risk-aligned management and consideration of expedited treatment if HSIL with HPV 16 is found [^1164acWi] [^116kqN3S].

> Next, I should review how recent updates and the Enduring Guidelines effort refine this. The Enduring Consensus process continues to incorporate new technologies and data, including extended genotyping and self-collection, while maintaining the same risk-based clinical action thresholds. Importantly, HPV 18–positive NILM remains an exception where colposcopy is recommended despite CIN 3+ risk below 4%, reflecting cancer risk considerations rather than CIN 3+ risk alone [^116c4gAr] [^117S4XFi].

> Let me synthesize practical takeaways. HPV 16 and 18 are the highest-risk types and drive more aggressive management: HPV 16 positivity generally mandates colposcopy even with NILM and, when combined with HSIL, supports expedited treatment, whereas HPV 18 positivity warrants colposcopy even with NILM due to cancer risk. Reflex cytology is preferred for all HPV-positive results when feasible, and if not, direct colposcopy for 16/18 is acceptable. These actions are embedded in a risk-based framework that balances benefits and harms and is designed to adapt as vaccination and new tests change population risks [^1124B39z] [^111aq8Do] [^1156s5Kw].

The ASCCP recommends **HPV 16/18 genotyping** for all positive HPV screens because these types carry the highest risk of CIN3+ and occult cancer [^1124B39z]. HPV 16/18–positive results warrant **direct colposcopy** even if cytology is NILM, as risk exceeds the 4% colposcopy threshold [^115njFKx]. For HPV 16–positive HSIL, **expedited treatment** (without biopsy) is preferred in nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years due to immediate CIN3+ risk ≥ 60% [^11539VrB] [^111cWS55]. If reflex cytology is not available, proceed directly to colposcopy for HPV 16/18–positive results [^1164acWi] [^116kqN3S]. These recommendations apply across screening modalities (primary HPV, cotesting, cytology) and are embedded in the 2019 risk-based management guidelines [^112yXLLP].

---

## Rationale for HPV 16/18 genotyping

HPV 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and have the **highest risk of progression to CIN3+ and invasive cancer** [^notfound]. HPV 16 confers the highest immediate CIN3+ risk, even with NILM cytology, and HPV 18 is uniquely associated with adenocarcinoma, which cytology often misses [^114fJbtv] [^113PCiCS]. Thus, identifying these types enables **risk-based management** and timely intervention [^114jqX46].

---

## ASCCP recommendations for HPV 16/18 testing

### Primary HPV screening

- **Reflex triage**: Perform reflex cytology for all HPV-positive results, including HPV 16/18 [^1164acWi] [^116kqN3S].
- **Direct colposcopy**: If reflex cytology is not feasible, refer HPV 16/18–positive patients directly to colposcopy [^1164acWi] [^116kqN3S].
- **Expedited treatment**: For HPV 16–positive HSIL, expedited treatment is preferred in nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years due to immediate CIN3+ risk ≥ 60% [^11539VrB] [^111cWS55].

---

### Cotesting (HPV test plus cytology)

In cotesting, **HPV 16/18 positivity** warrants direct colposcopy even if cytology is NILM, given the elevated risk [^1124B39z] [^115mzXhp]. Management otherwise follows the same risk-based principles as primary HPV screening [^112yXLLP].

---

### Cytology-only screening

For cytology-only screening, **HPV testing is not routinely performed**; if HPV 16/18 results are available from prior testing, manage per risk-based guidelines [^116nq9eV].

---

## Clinical action thresholds

The 2019 ASCCP guidelines use **risk-based clinical action thresholds** to guide management:

| **Clinical action** | **Risk threshold** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Colposcopy | Immediate CIN3+ risk ≥ 4% | HPV 16/18–positive NILM, HPV-positive ASC-US/LSIL [^115njFKx] [^115mzXhp] |
| Expedited treatment | Immediate CIN3+ risk ≥ 60% | HPV 16–positive HSIL, never/underscreened with HPV-positive HSIL [^11539VrB] [^111cWS55] |
| 1-year surveillance | 5-year CIN3+ risk 0.55– < 4% | HPV-positive NILM, HPV-negative ASC-US/LSIL [^116QGrRi] [^1173ytN4] |
| 3-year surveillance | 5-year CIN3+ risk 0.15– < 0.55% | HPV-negative ASC-US/LSIL, HPV-positive NILM after negative HPV test [^1173ytN4] [^116QGrRi] |
| 5-year routine screening | 5-year CIN3+ risk < 0.15% | HPV-negative results, cotest-negative results [^1173ytN4] [^1153JDpZ] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid expedited treatment; manage conservatively with colposcopy and defer treatment until postpartum.
- **Immunosuppression**: Manage per ASCCP/IDSA guidance, typically with more aggressive surveillance [^116ePBd1].
- **Adolescents (< 25 years)**: HPV 16/18 testing is not routinely recommended; manage per age-specific algorithms [^notfound].

---

## Impact of HPV vaccination

HPV vaccination reduces the prevalence of HPV 16/18 infections, but **screening recommendations remain unchanged** because vaccination does not eliminate all high-risk HPV types and is not universally administered [^1166fvnT] [^117FNqes]. The guidelines anticipate declining HPV 16/18 prevalence and are designed to adapt as population risk evolves [^111u4PFo].

---

## Summary of ASCCP HPV 16/18 testing recommendations

- **Genotyping**: Recommended for all positive HPV screens to stratify risk [^1124B39z].
- **Colposcopy**: Direct referral for HPV 16/18–positive results, even with NILM cytology [^1124B39z] [^115mzXhp].
- **Expedited treatment**: Preferred for HPV 16–positive HSIL in nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years [^11539VrB] [^111cWS55].
- **Reflex cytology**: Preferred triage for HPV-positive results; if unavailable, proceed to colposcopy [^1164acWi] [^116kqN3S].
- **Risk-based management**: Applies across screening modalities and integrates current and past results [^112yXLLP] [^111egiA6].

---

The ASCCP's HPV 16/18 testing recommendations reflect a **risk-based approach** that prioritizes early detection and treatment of high-risk infections while minimizing overtreatment of low-risk lesions [^112yXLLP].

### A study of partial human papillomavirus genotyping in support of the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^114fJbtv]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines include recommendations for partial human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping in management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results. The guidelines are based on matching estimates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ risk to consensus clinical action thresholds. In support of the guidelines, this analysis addresses the risks predicted by individual identification of HPV 16 and HPV 18.

Methods

Risk estimates were drawn from a subset of women in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California screening program, whose residual cervical specimens were HPV typed as part of the HPV Persistence and Progression study. We calculated risk of CIN 3+ to assess how identification of HPV 16, HPV 18, or 12 other "high-risk" HPV types would influence recommended clinical management of new abnormal screening results, taking into account current cytologic results and recent screening history. Immediate and/or 5-year risks of CIN 3+ were matched to clinical actions identified in the guidelines.

Results

Identification of HPV 16 at the first visit including HPV testing elevated immediate risk of diagnosing CIN 3+ sufficiently to mandate colposcopic referral even when cytology was Negative for Intraepithelial Lesions or Malignancy and to support a preference for treatment of cytologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. HPV 18 less clearly elevated CIN 3+ risk.

Conclusions

Identification of HPV 16 clearly mandated consideration in clinical management of new abnormal screening results. HPV 18 positivity must be considered as a special situation because of established disproportionate risk of invasive cancer. More detailed genotyping and use beyond initial management will be considered in guideline updates.

### Cervical cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^113qYZmr]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening With the Papanicolaou Test: Benefits Based on solid evidence, regular screening for cervical cancer with the Pap test in an appropriate population of women reduces mortality from cervical cancer. The benefits of screening women younger than 21 years are small because of the low prevalence of lesions that will progress to invasive cancer. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 65 years if they have had a recent history of negative test results. Screening With the Human Papillomavirus DNA Test: Benefits Based on solid evidence, screening with an HPV DNA or HPV RNA test detects high-grade cervical dysplasia, a precursor lesion for cervical cancer. Additional clinical trials show that HPV testing is superior to other cervical cancer screening strategies. In April 2014, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved an HPV DNA test that can be used alone for the primary screening of cervical cancer risk in women aged 25 years and older.

Screening With the Pap Test and the HPV DNA Test: Benefits Based on solid evidence, screening every 5 years with the Pap test and the HPV DNA test in women aged 30 years and older is more sensitive in detecting cervical abnormalities, compared with the Pap test alone. Screening with the Pap test and HPV DNA test reduces the incidence of cervical cancer. Approximately 15 cancer-associated HPV genotypes cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer and precursor lesions of CIN 2 and CIN 3. However, carcinogenic HPV infections are very common, particularly in young women, and most infections clear on their own within 1 to 2 years. Therefore, the challenge of incorporating HPV testing in cervical screening programs is to balance sensitivity for detection of CIN 2 or CIN 2+ and to minimize the over-referral of women with transient HPV infections and cervical changes that are destined to regress. The U. S.

Food and Drug Administration has approved several HPV tests. Most of these tests are based on the detection of DNA from one or more oncogenic types of HPV. One test detects HPV RNA. HPV testing is approved for use in two contexts: as a second test after an equivocal cytology result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; and for primary screening in conjunction with cervical cytology for women aged 30 years and older. ALTS randomly assigned women with ASCUS to one of three management strategies: immediate colposcopy regardless of enrollment test results, referral to colposcopy if HPV test results were positive or if the enrollment cytology was high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and referral to colposcopy only if the cytology was HSIL. The HPV triage strategy was as sensitive as immediate colposcopy to detection CIN 2+, while referring only about half of the women for the procedure. Repeat cytology with referral to colposcopy at the threshold of HSIL was less sensitive for CIN 3+ compared with HPV triage; however, using a cytologic threshold of ASCUS for referral increased sensitivity but resulted in 72% of women with ASCUS undergoing colposcopy. HPV testing is not recommended for adolescent women with ASCUS because most of these women are HPV positive.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^117W3N9d]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The American Cancer Society (ACS) released updated cervical cancer screening guidelines in 2020 that endorse a shift in practice to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in people with a cervix, beginning at ages of 25–65 years. When access to US Food and Drug Administration-approved primary HPV testing is not available, the ACS offers cotesting or cytology as acceptable alternative strategies but suggests that these testing modalities may be excluded from future iterations of the guidelines. The ASCCP recognizes the benefits and risks of primary HPV cervical cancer screening while acknowledging the barriers to widespread adoption, including implementation issues, the impact of limited HPV vaccination in the United States, and inclusion of populations who may not be well represented on primary HPV screening trials, such as underrepresented minorities. The ASCCP endorses the 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement and supports the ACS cervical cancer screening guidelines. Most importantly, the ASCCP endorses any cervical cancer screening for secondary prevention of cervical cancer and recommends interventions that improve screening for those who are underscreened or unscreened.

L.2 Future Directions

A successor to the new technologies group will be proposed to continue the consensus process, and to provide continuous future updates to guidelines as new tests become available for management. Decreases in the overall population prevalence of HPV infection, especially HPV 16/18 genotypes, are expected as individuals vaccinated as adolescents reach screening age. The guidelines outlined in this document are designed to adapt to decreases in oncogenic HPV prevalence because of HPV vaccination as well as new screening and management technologies. As data on the CIN 3+ risks associated with screening test results become available for individuals aged 25 to 29 years who received timely vaccination, we anticipate that decreases in population-level prevalence of HPV infections will affect management recommendations for this age group in the near future. In addition, new technologies that enter the market will be evaluated for their utility in improving the diagnosis and management of CIN 3+. Examples of clinically useful products would be those with increased specificity for detecting high-grade abnormalities or the ability during longitudinal follow-up to distinguish incident (new) from prevalent (persistent) HPV infections. No specific new technologies are listed as creating a comprehensive list of products in development is beyond the scope of this article.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^111aq8Do]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The US FDA approved the cobas HPV test (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), in March 2014, and the Onclarity HPV Test (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), in April 2018, for primary HPV testing for screening for patients 25 years or older. Both these tests offer and are approved for partial HPV genotyping. Use of primary HPV screening will likely increase in the future, as it is more effective than screening with cytology alone and performs similarly to and with lower costs than screening with cotesting. Because HPV–16 positive and HPV 18–positive test results have the highest risk of CIN 3 and occult cancers, additional diagnostic procedures are recommended for all positive test results (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy for NILM and low-grade cytology and expedited treatment for HSIL cytology that is positive for HPV type 16). This guideline replaces interim guidance (2015) for the management of a positive result for HPV primary screening, which recommended direct referral to colposcopy for HPV test results positive for HPV 16 and/or HPV 18, and performance of cytology for positive results due to other (non-16/18) high-risk HPV types. The immediate risk of CIN3+ in patients with HPV 16–positive and HSIL cytology exceeds the treatment threshold of 60%; therefore, these patients should be given the option for expedited treatment without preceding confirmatory biopsy (see Section E.3). Expedited treatment is only possible if cytology is performed. Therefore, reflex cytology is recommended for all HPV-positive primary screening results, regardless of HPV genotype. If reflex testing from the same laboratory specimen as the HPV test is not feasible, patients should proceed directly to colposcopy. In this situation, collection of an additional triage test (e.g. cytology) is recommended at the time of colposcopy to provide further information for risk-based management (e.g. if HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology is identified, treatment may be considered even if CIN 2+ is not identified on biopsy). Combining a test with high specificity (e.g. cytology when it is interpreted as HSIL) with a test with high sensitivity (i.e. HPV test) allows more precise, risk-based management of these patients.

C. GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Guidelines are based on several guiding principles. The first 4 guiding principles are new for 2019, whereas the others are from the 2012 guidelines. As the 2012 guidelines are familiar to providers, we changed management recommendations only when new evidence favored an altered management strategy. Note that management guidelines apply only to patients with current or previous abnormal screening test results; screening guidelines for individuals in the general population, that are not being followed for a screening abnormality, are addressed elsewhere.

New 2019 Principles

1. HPV–based testing is the basis for risk estimation. The term HPV-based testing is used throughout this document and refers to use of either primary HPV testing alone or HPV testing in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting).

Characteristics of HPV infections, including HPV type and the duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of CIN 3+. – Although cytology has high specificity (apart from ASC-US) and can be helpful when estimating immediate risk, its lower sensitivity and lower negative predictive value compared with HPV testing reduces its utility for long-term risk prediction. The results of HPV tests alone or in conjunction with cytology are used to guide recommendations that allow lengthening of follow-up intervals and deferral of colposcopy for low-risk results. Of note, risk estimates underlying the 2019 management guidelines are based on HPV DNA testing.

2.0 Personalized risk-based management is possible with knowledge of current results and past history. A patient's risk of having or developing CIN 3+ is estimated based on current and previous results, as well as history of previous precancer treatment. Management recommendations use thresholds of risk. Recommendations of routine screening, 1-year or 3-year surveillance, colposcopy, or treatment correspond to a risk stratum, a range of risk for CIN 3+. The lower threshold of each risk stratum, called Clinical Action Threshold, defines the level at which the management recommendation changes. The Clinical Action Thresholds for each risk stratum were determined through the consensus process. Risks were estimated for all combination of current results and past history (including unknown history) for which adequate data were available at KPNC. Management can be determined via look-up tables, and use of the tables can be facilitated using decision aids.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^112yXLLP]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Updated US consensus guidelines for management of cervical screening abnormalities are needed to accommodate the 3 available cervical screening strategies: primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, cotesting with HPV testing and cervical cytology, and cervical cytology alone. New data indicate that a patient's risk of developing cervical precancer or cancer can be estimated using current screening test results and previous screening test and biopsy results, while considering personal factors such as age and immunosuppression. Routine screening applies only to asymptomatic individuals who do not require surveillance for prior abnormal screening results.

The 2012 consensus guidelines were the first to be based on the principle of equal management for equal risk, specifically, the risk of a patient developing cervical cancer, estimated by the surrogate end point of the 5-year risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 (CIN 3) or more severe diagnoses (CIN 3+), regardless of which test combinations yielded this risk level. Introduction of risk-based guidelines in 2012 was a conceptual breakthrough, but the recommendations retained a continued reliance on complicated algorithms and insufficiently incorporated screening history. With a more nuanced understanding of how previous results affect risk, and more variables to consider, the 2019 guidelines further align management recommendations with current understanding of HPV natural history and cervical carcinogenesis. More frequent surveillance, colposcopy, and treatment are recommended for patients at progressively higher risk, whereas those at lower risk can defer colposcopy, undergo follow-up at longer surveillance intervals, and, when at sufficiently low risk, return to routine screening. Clearly defined risk thresholds to guide management are designed to continue functioning appropriately when population-level prevalence of CIN 3+ decreases because of HPV vaccination and also as new screening and triage tests are introduced. The revised guidelines provide a framework for incorporating new data and technologies as ongoing incremental recommendation revisions, minimizing the time needed to implement changes that are beneficial to patient care.

### An introduction to the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^115bEekr]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Deciding on the clinical action thresholds for each management option (treatment preferred, treatment or colposcopic biopsy, colposcopic biopsy, surveillance retesting at 1 year, surveillance retesting at 3 years, return at regular screening interval of 5 years) required an 18-month collective effort involving the volunteering cervical health professionals and patient advocates and including a period for public input. These societal decisions were acknowledged to be part of the larger subjective question of "How safe is safe enough? What risk levels in our society warrant escalating to the next, more aggressive clinical actions?"

The clinical action thresholds adopted by consensus voting in October 2019 after substantial study and discussion are intended to endure, providing stability to the US cervical screening effort, even as screening test methods and strategies evolve. When a new test is approved by the Food and Drug Administration that test can be considered for inclusion in the consensus guidelines as soon as sufficient data are available to know what risk of precancer is predicted by a positive result versus a negative result. Adequate prospective data will be necessary before a test can be recommended as the basis for surveillance at 1- or 3-year intervals or return to routine screening at 5-year intervals. Cross-sectional data will be needed to supply the immediate risk estimates that support recommendations for treatment or referral to colposcopy. To give an example, the new consensus is that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy and biopsies (and possibly treatment) is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy whether that risk is due to HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16–positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or any other set of results predicting equally high risk. If a positive result from a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is convincingly shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral to colposcopy, there would be no need for a new consensus conference to determine how to use that test in clinical practice: the management of a positive result would be to refer to colposcopy (with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high). By the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk", the guideline would be evident and easily settled.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^116zbUoo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We detail how risk estimates are used for clinical management according to the principles laid out by the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Guidelines. We also lay out basic principles underlying risk-based management: (a) HPV-negative test results reduce risk; (b) colposcopic examinations at which CIN 2+ is not found reduce risk; (c) HPV-positive test results increase risk; and (d) prior treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3 increases risk. Although these principles are intuitive, their ramifications are far-reaching. At a population level, the risk of CIN 3+ for screening participants at any given age is highest at the time of the initial HPV-based screen (0.45% immediate CIN 3+ risk for patients new to HPV testing in KPNC aged 25–65 years). The first screening round will detect most prevalent CIN 3+ and reduce the risk of CIN 3+ in future screening rounds. This situation is exemplified by patients entering an HPV-based screening program for the first time.

Among 1,546,462 people at the first visit, 92% had a primary HPV-negative test result. Individuals with a negative HPV screening results are at very low risk of developing CIN 3+ within the next 5 years (0.14%); thus, a 5-year screening interval is recommended. As populations begin screening with HPV testing, most individuals will test negative, reducing their need for colposcopy in subsequent screening rounds.

Among the 8% of the population that initially tested HPV positive, immediate CIN 3+ risks ranged from 2.1% for HPV-positive NILM (below the colposcopy threshold), to 4.3% and 4.4% for HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, respectively (defining the colposcopy threshold), to 25% and 26% for HPV-negative HSIL+ and HPV-positive ASC-H, respectively (defining the treatment or colposcopy threshold), to 49% for HPV-positive HSIL+. Reaching the 60% threshold for preferring treatment requires an additional risk factor, such as HPV-16 infectionor a history of not having been screened.

4.0 Colposcopy practice must follow guidance detailed in the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards. Colposcopy with targeted biopsy remains the primary method of detecting precancers requiring treatment. Because patients are managed less aggressively after a colposcopic examination where CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+) is not found, maximizing detection of CIN 2+ at each colposcopy visit is paramount. Evidence-based practice recommends that biopsies be taken of all discrete acetowhite areas, usually 2 to 4 biopsies at each colposcopic examination. For those at lowest risk, defined as less than HSIL cytology, no evidence of HPV 16/18 infection, and a completely normal colposcopic impression (i.e. no acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other visible abnormality, and a fully visualized squamocolumnar junction), untargeted (random) biopsies are not recommended and patients with a completely normal colposcopic impression can be observed without biopsy. To ensure that CIN 2+ is not missed, the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards emphasize the need for biopsies even when the colposcopic impression is normal but any degree of acetowhitening, metaplasia, or other abnormality is present.

2012 Principles Carried Forward

5.0 The primary goal of screening and management is cancer prevention through detection and treatment of cervical precancer. Numerous population-level studies indicate that incidence and mortality from cervical cancer decrease as detection and treatment of high-grade histologic cervical abnormalities (generally defined as CIN 2+) increases. Timely detection and treatment of the highest grade of precancers (CIN 3/AIS) have been the benchmark used for previous guidelinesand remain the primary goal of the 2019 management guideline; a secondary goal (because of the relative rarity of this finding in the United States) is early diagnosis of cervical cancer to reduce related morbidity and mortality. A patient's risk of having or developing CIN 3+ is estimated based on current and previous results, as well as history of previous precancer treatment. Management recommendations are guided by risk thresholds. Recommendations of routine screening, 1- or 3-year surveillance, colposcopy, or treatment each correspond to a risk stratum. These risk strata (ranges of risk for CIN 3+) are defined by Clinical Action Thresholds that were determined through the consensus process (Section E).

DEVELOPMENT AND RATIFICATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS

If the working group determines that there is sufficient evidence and a favorable benefit-harms trade-off for a new test or approach, draft clinical recommendations are developed by the working group using a standardized procedure. When risk estimates are available, recommendations are usually based where the calculated risk estimates fall with respect to the clinical action thresholds. This approach is referred to as "management according to risk". There may be exceptions to the risk-based approach, such as the example of HPV18-positive negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, for which colposcopy referral is recommended not based on the CIN3+ risk — which is below the colposcopy threshold — but because of a disproportionally high risk of cancer attributed to HPV18. When data are insufficient for risk-based recommendations, recommendations may be made based on expert opinion. Recommendations use the terminology previously established for the 2019 guidelines process:

A new approach or technology may be:

Recommended: When there are good data to support use and no other option is acceptable
Preferred: When the option is the best (or one of the best) among multiple options
Acceptable: When it is one of multiple options when data do not clearly favor any single option or when there are data indicating that another approach is superior
Not recommended: When there is weak evidence against use and marginal risk for adverse consequences.
Unacceptable: When there is good evidence against use.

The evidence supporting all recommendations is rated considering the strength of the recommendation (A through E) and the quality of evidence (I–III) as previously described.

Draft recommendations are presented to all stakeholders in the full Enduring Guidelines group for input and revision. Subsequently, draft recommendations are presented to participating organizations members, and to the general public using a Web-based survey to solicit feedback. The public comment period is announced on the ASCCP home page where comments are collected for several weeks. Feedback from the public is reviewed by members of the working group and may lead to further revisions to address substantive comments. Recommendations are finalized and put to an anonymous electronic vote of the Enduring Guidelines group. A two-thirds majority of all voting members is required to pass a recommendation. If a recommendation fails to achieve the two-thirds majority, modifications can be made by the working group or the stakeholder group, and the new recommendation can be voted again; this process can be repeated until the recommendation is passed or abandoned.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening triage: When primary HPV screening is used, performance of an additional reflex triage test for all positive HPV tests regardless of genotype is preferred (CIII). If genotyping results are HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive and reflex triage testing from the same laboratory specimen is not feasible, referral for colposcopy before obtaining additional testing is acceptable (CIII), and if triage is not performed before colposcopy, collection of an additional triage test at the colposcopy visit is recommended (CIII). The US FDA approved the cobas HPV test in March 2014 and the Onclarity HPV test in April 2018 for primary HPV testing for screening for patients 25 years and older, and both these tests offer and are approved for partial HPV genotyping.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — reflex triage for positive HPV tests and HPV16/18 actions: All positive HPV screening tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen, HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer so additional evaluation is necessary even when cytology results are negative, and if HPV 16 or 18 testing is positive and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy.

ASCCP risk-based cervical screening management — framework and thresholds: The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine management, representing an evolution from prior result-based approaches that benchmarked 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ after HPV–cytology cotesting. The 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g., "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management, exemplified by "colposcopic referral when immediate risks of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater". For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, risk profiles of CIN 2+, CIN 3+, and cancer are produced from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test to link estimated risk to clinical action thresholds.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^112q8KFx]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

ASCCP Task Force — ACS 2020 cervical cancer screening update: The American Cancer Society (ACS) updated guidelines in 2020 endorse a shift to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in people with a cervix, beginning at ages of 25–65 years, and when US Food and Drug Administration–approved primary HPV testing is not available, the ACS offers cotesting or cytology as acceptable alternatives but notes these may be excluded in future iterations. The ACS guidelines published in 2020 offer the same 3 options but with a strong recommendation to screen with primary HPV testing, and there are currently 2 HPV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in primary HPV screening — as a sole test, without cytology, although uptake has been slow in the United States since the first approval in 2014. The ASCCP endorses the 2018 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement and supports the ACS cervical cancer screening guidelines, endorses any cervical cancer screening for secondary prevention, and acknowledges barriers to widespread adoption including implementation issues, limited HPV vaccination impact in the United States, and inclusion of populations underrepresented in primary HPV screening trials. Regarding implementation, ASCCP notes practical concerns and that a transition period with an overlap of acceptable screening methods needs to be in place until primary HPV screening is covered by payers, embraced nationally, and does not exclude institutions unable to make a rapid change, recalling that the 2012 guidelines included HPV cotesting and increased the testing interval to 5 years.

Future directions for risk-based cervical screening management emphasize ongoing updates and dissemination. A successor to the new technologies group will be proposed "to continue the consensus process, and to provide continuous future updates to guidelines as new tests become available for management". The guidelines are "designed to adapt to decreases in oncogenic HPV prevalence because of HPV vaccination as well as new screening and management technologies", with expected "decreases in the overall population prevalence of HPV infection, especially HPV 16/18 genotypes,… as individuals vaccinated as adolescents reach screening age". Dissemination aims "to create a new national standard of care for management of abnormal cervical cancer screening test results", using communications that include "presentations at national, regional and local meetings, social media outreach to engage clinicians and medical societies, and development of promotional materials". Because "low-income and minority women bear the greatest burden of cervical cancer", emphasis will be placed on "working with these communities and the providers who serve them", and future research includes "development of an evaluation and impact process for these new recommendations on clinical practices".

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^116E2SXA]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

ASCCP cervical cancer screening endorsement — key positions and management statements are as follows: The ASCCP no longer endorses its 2012 cervical cancer screening guidelines that do not include primary HPV screening and recognizes the need to move toward primary HPV-based cervical cancer screening. The combination of abnormal results that occur from either guidance should be managed using the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines. Patients with signs or symptoms suspicious for cervical cancer (abnormal uterine bleeding, postcoital bleeding, pelvic pain, etc) should have a diagnostic evaluation even if screening tests are negative. Adequate prior cervical cancer screening within 10 years of negative results (3 consecutive negative cervical cytology results or 2 consecutive negative co-testing results) is required to exit from screening. Patients with high-grade precancerous lesions should be followed for at least 25 years even if this extends beyond 65 years of age — the upper limit for screening — as they are at increased risk. The USPSTF recommendations include all screening modalities, providing flexibility that may benefit those who are marginalized, underserved, or experiencing inequity and health disparities.

### Enduring consensus cervical cancer screening and management… [^116c4gAr]. dceg.cancer.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

What are the Enduring Guidelines. The Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines are a collection of updates to the 2019 ASCCP Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors. The Enduring Guidelines are generated by a consensus committee of experts tasked with performing, evaluating, and ratifying risk estimations for cervical cancer screening tests; their decisions on new tests and associated risk estimates will be posted to this web page, along with links to the supporting scientific literature. The Enduring Guidelines are designed to recognize and reduce disparities in cervical cancer prevention. Why are Enduring Guidelines Necessary.

Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors are predicated upon the principle of 'equal management for equal risk: ' clinical management is based on estimated risk within a specific time interval, rather than the results of a specific screening or clinical test. In the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines, the process to estimate risk was explicitly separated from the establishment of clinical action thresholds to allow more frequent updates to the guidelines. The risk estimates that trigger management actions, called Clinical Action Thresholds, were defined by a consensus group including stakeholders from 20 professional societies, federal organizations, and patient advocacy groups. The full risk tables are available online and linked below. The Clinical Action Thresholds are expected to be in place for the next decade.

Risk estimations for a limited set of tests and other variables were generated by investigators at the National Cancer Institute. These estimates, in the context of the Clinical Action Thresholds, underlie the current set of guidelines. As new technologies become available and population characteristics change, e.g. increasing impact of HPV vaccination, new risk estimates will be needed frequently, and existing guidelines updated.

TABLE 1
Participating Organizations

Box 1. Essential Changes From Prior Management Guidelines

1) Recommendations are based on risk, not results.

Recommendations of colposcopy, treatment, or surveillance will be based on a patient's risk of CIN 3+ determined by a combination of current results and history (including unknown history). The same current test results may yield different management recommendations depending on the history of recent past test results. 2) Colposcopy can be deferred for certain patients.
Repeat HPV testing or cotesting at 1 year is recommended for patients with minor screening abnormalities indicating HPV infection with low risk of underlying CIN 3+ (e.g. low-grade cytologic abnormalities after a documented negative screening HPV test or cotest).
At the 1-year follow-up test, referral to colposcopy is recommended if results remain abnormal. 3) Guidance for expedited treatment is expanded (i.e. treatment without colposcopic biopsy).
Expedited treatment was an option for patients with HSIL cytology in the 2012 guidelines; this guidance is now better defined.
For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older, expedited treatment, defined as treatment without preceding colposcopic biopsy demonstrating CIN 2+, is preferred when the immediate risk of CIN 3+ is ≥ 60%, and is acceptable for those with risks between 25% and 60%. Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 (HPV 16) (i.e. HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology) and never or rarely screened patients with HPV-positive HSIL regardless of HPV genotype.
Shared decision-making should be used when considering expedited treatment, especially for patients with concerns about the potential impact of treatment on pregnancy outcomes. 4) Excisional treatment is preferred to ablative treatment for histologic HSIL (CIN 2 or CIN 3) in the United States. Excision is recommended for adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). 5) Observation is preferred to treatment for CIN 1.
Treatment remains acceptable for patients with repeat diagnoses of CIN 1 persisting 2 years or more. 6) Histopathology reports based on Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for reporting histologic HSIL should include CIN 2 or CIN 3 qualifiers, i.e. HSIL(CIN 2) and HSIL (CIN 3). 7) All positive HPV tests, regardless of genotype, should have additional reflex triage testing performed from the same laboratory specimen (e.g. reflex cytology).
Additional testing from the same laboratory specimen is recommended because the findings may inform colposcopy practice. For example, those with HSIL cytology and concurrent positive testing for HPV genotype 16 qualify for expedited treatment.
HPV 16 or 18 infections have the highest risk for CIN 3 and occult cancer, so additional evaluation (e.g. colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative.
If HPV 16 and 18 testing is positive, and additional laboratory testing of the same sample is not feasible, the patient should proceed directly to colposcopy. 8) Continued surveillance with HPV testing or cotesting at 3-year intervals for at least 25 years is recommended after treatment of histologic HSIL, CIN 2, CIN 3, or AIS. Continued surveillance at 3-year intervals beyond 25 years is acceptable for as long as the patient's life expectancy and ability to be screened are not significantly compromised by serious health issues.
The 2012 guidelines recommended return to 5-year screening intervals and did not specify when screening should cease. New evidence indicates that risk remains elevated for at least 25 years, with no evidence that treated patients ever return to risk levels compatible with 5-year intervals.
Surveillance with cytology alone is acceptable only if testing with HPV or cotesting is not feasible. Cytology is less sensitive than HPV testing for detection of precancer and is therefore recommended more often. Cytology is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually. Cytology is recommended annually when 3-year intervals are recommended for HPV or cotesting. 9) Human papilloma virus assays that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for screening should be used for management according to their regulatory approval in the United States. (Note: all HPV testing in this document refers to testing for high-risk HPV types only).
For all management indications, HPV mRNA and HPV DNA tests without FDA approval for primary screening alone should only be used as a cotest with cytology, unless sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data are available to support primary HPV testing in management.

F.2 Updated Management of Primary HPV Screening (Replaces Interim Guidance)

Guideline: When primary HPV screening is used, performance of an additional reflex triage test (e.g. reflex cytology) for all positive HPV tests regardless of genotype is preferred (this includes tests positive for genotypes HPV 16/18) (CIII). However, if primary HPV screening test genotyping results are HPV 16 or HPV 18 positive and reflex triage testing from the same laboratory specimen is not feasible, referral for colposcopy before obtaining additional testing is acceptable (CIII). If genotyping for HPV 16 or HPV 18 is positive, and triage testing is not performed before the colposcopy, collection of an additional triage test (e.g. cytology) at the colposcopy visit is recommended (CIII).

HPV-based testing: this term is used in this document to describe the use of either cotesting or primary HPV screening for surveillance after abnormalities. It does not apply to reflex HPV testing for triage of ASC-US cytology in this document. The HPV testing and positive HPV results discussed throughout this document refer to high-risk HPV types only.

Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST): this term refers to 2-tiered pathology criteria for evaluating histologic specimens obtained via colposcopic biopsy

Primary HPV testing: testing with HPV testing alone as a screening or surveillance test.

Reflex testing: this means that laboratories should perform a specific additional triage test in the setting of a positive screening test to inform the next steps in management. For example, an ASC-US cytology should trigger a reflex HPV test. New for these guidelines, a positive a positive primary HPV screening test should trigger both a reflex genotyping test (to determine the presence/absence of HPV 16/18 if that information is not included in the initial primary test result) and also a reflex cytology test to determine whether the patient would be a candidate for expedited management.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^1159J35r]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines for the management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions (treatment, optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy, colposcopy/biopsy, 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, 5-year return to regular screening) based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer (CIN 3+) for the many different combinations of current and recent past screening results. This article supports the main guidelines presentationby presenting and explaining the risk estimates that supported the guidelines.

Methods

From 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years were screened with human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology cotesting scheduled every 3 years. We estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current test results paired with history of screening test and colposcopy/biopsy results.

Results

Risk tables are presented for different clinical scenarios. Examples of important results are highlighted; for example, the risk posed by most current abnormalities is greatly reduced if the prior screening round was HPV-negative. The immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ used to decide clinical management are shown.

Conclusions

The new risk-based guidelines present recommendations for the management of abnormal screening test and histology results; the key risk estimates supporting guidelines are presented in this article. Comprehensive risk estimates are freely available online at.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^116oe3JF]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The new risk-based management consensus guidelines will use risk and clinical action thresholds to determine the appropriate course of management of cervical screening abnormalities. These risk-based management guidelines represent an evolution of the 2012 guidelines, which incorporated human papillomavirus (HPV) test results into an existing cytology-based management framework by benchmarking 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 or higher (CIN 3+) after HPV-cytology cotest results to that of cytology-only results. Since 2013, screening has continued to evolve with HPV vaccination, the introduction of new screening technology, and new knowledge of how history of negative HPV testing changes the clinical meaning of test results. To address these changes while ensuring that future revisions to management guidelines are equitable and simple to apply, the 2019 guidelines will move from result-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral for HPV-positive ASC-US cytology") to risk-based management (e.g. "colposcopic referral when immediate risk of having CIN 3+ is 4% or greater").

In this article, we described the additional data sources and improved risk estimation methods used to estimate risks that support the 2019 guidelines. For each management scenario and past/current test result combination, we produced a risk profile of CIN grade 2 or higher (CIN 2+), CIN 3+, and cancer risks from the time of the current test until 5 years after the current test. We formalized how risk is used to determine the recommended risk-based management through the use of clinical action thresholds. Finally, we validated risk estimates by examining portability of risk-based management to diverse settings, including underinsured and underserved patients, using risks estimated from 3 independent, previously unpublished cohorts/trials and one published comparison.

ASCCP 2019 unsatisfactory cytology — management recommendations state: "For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII)". "Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII)". "Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII)". "For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII)". "If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII)". Figure 5 operationalizes this via "No HPV or unknown result (any age)", "HPV Negative (age ≥ 25 years)", and "HPV Positive (unknown genotype) (age ≥ 25 years)" leading to "Repeat Age-based Screening after 2 to 4 months", while "HPV 16 or 18 Positive" goes to colposcopy; the caption clarifies that "unknown genotype" includes both scenarios described.

New 2019 principles — testing and risk foundation — HPV-based testing is the basis for risk estimation and refers to use of either primary HPV testing alone or HPV testing in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting). Characteristics of HPV infections, including HPV type and the duration of infection, determine a patient's risk of CIN 3+. Although cytology has high specificity, it has lower sensitivity and lower negative predictive value than HPV testing and reduced utility for long-term risk prediction, and risk estimates underlying the 2019 management guidelines are based on HPV DNA testing.

Using screening data from 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years underwent human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology co-testing scheduled every 3 years, and the study estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current results with past screening and colposcopy/biopsy history; risk tables are presented for scenarios common in clinical practice.

L.1 Current considerations — The 2019 guidelines are designed to take into account factors that influence Clinical Action Thresholds, with screening history profoundly influencing risk estimates, specifically current HPV and cytology test results, previous HPV test results, and history of histologic HSIL; unknown history is considered separately as a risk factor. Additional factors considered because of associations with cervical cancer include HPV vaccination, age, hormonal contraception use, history of sexually transmitted infection, parity, cigarette smoking, obesity, and sexual behaviors including age of first intercourse and multiple partners. HPV vaccination at adolescence (generally before the age of 18 years) does seem to reduce the risk of HPV 16/18 infections and associated histologic HSIL, although HPV vaccination status was omitted from this version of the guidelines.

ASCCP risk-based management — exceptions to colposcopy threshold: For patients with ASC-H cytology, colposcopy is recommended regardless of HPV result (AII). In the KPNC data, HPV-positive ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 26% and a cancer risk of 0.92%, whereas HPV-negative ASC-H had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 3.4%, but an immediate cancer risk of 0.69%, and the working group recommended colposcopy for all patients with ASC-H, regardless of HPV test results. For patients with HPV 18–positive NILM, colposcopy is recommended (AII) (note colposcopy is also recommended for HPV 16–positive NILM), as HPV 18–positive NILM had a 3.0% prevalent CIN 3+ risk with cancer risk 0.2% immediately and 0.56% at 5 years; given the elevated cancer risk, referral to colposcopy is recommended.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^1166fvnT]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2020 cervical cancer screening — average-risk individuals — starts with primary testing at age 25 and specifies: Starting at age 25 y, primary HPV test alone every 5 y (preferred) and Use an FDA-approved HPV test for primary screening. Cotesting every 5 y or cytology alone every 3 y are acceptable options, and Cotesting or cytology testing alone are acceptable where access to primary HPV testing is limited or not available; as the United States makes the transition to primary HPV testing, the use of cotesting or cytology alone for cervical cancer screening will not be included in future guidelines. For abnormal results, For management of positive results and subsequent surveillance, refer to ASCCP 2020 Risk-Based Management Consensus Guideline (Perkins, 2020). For aged > 65 y, Discontinue screening if adequate negative prior screening; Individuals aged > 65 y without documentation of prior screening should continue screening until criteria for cessation are met; and Adequate negative prior screening is currently defined as 2 consecutive, negative primary HPV tests, or 2 negative cotests, or 3 negative cytology tests within the past 10 y, with the most recent test occurring within the past 3–5 y, depending on the test used. After hysterectomy, Individuals without a cervix and without a history of CIN2 or a more severe diagnosis in the past 25 y or cervical cancer ever should not be screened. For those HPV vaccinated, Follow age-specific screening recommendations (same as unvaccinated individuals). Frequency guidance states Individuals should not be screened more frequently than at the recommended interval for the test used and should not be screened annually at any age by any method. Annual testing may be recommended as surveillance after abnormal screening results.

Clinical action thresholds — management recommendations are based on Clinical Action Thresholds and correspond to risk strata. The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold "approximates the risk after a negative human papillomavirus (HPV)–based screening test" and such patients are "recommended to receive screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing". The 3-year return threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen", and patients with risks at or below it but above the 5-year threshold are "recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years". "One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy". The colposcopy threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result", and these patients are "recommended to receive colposcopy". The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H)" and such patients are "recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment", with "Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy". The expedited treatment preferred threshold "approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16– positive HSIL cytology" and "It is preferred that patients with risk at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the effect of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes".

Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines — average-risk individuals: Adoption of the USPSTF guidelines expands recommended options for those aged 30 years and older to include screening every 5 years with primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing, and primary hrHPV testing uses high-risk HPV testing alone (no cytology) with a test that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stand-alone screening. Consistent with prior guidance, screening should begin at age 21 years, and screening recommendations remain unchanged for average-risk individuals aged 21–29 years and those who are older than 65 years. Management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results should follow current ASCCP guidelines.

### American cancer society, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and American Society for Clinical Pathology screening guidelines for the prevention and early detection of cervical cancer [^117KaTW1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2012). Low credibility.

An update to the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline regarding screening for the early detection of cervical precancerous lesions and cancer is presented. The guidelines are based on a systematic evidence review, contributions from six working groups, and a recent symposium co-sponsored by the ACS, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), which was attended by 25 organizations. The new screening recommendations address age-appropriate screening strategies, including the use of cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, follow-up (e.g., management of screen positives and screening interval for screen negatives) of women after screening, age at which to exit screening, future considerations regarding HPV testing alone as a primary screening approach, and screening strategies for women vaccinated against HPV16/18 infections.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^115tvbyJ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines for the management of cervical cancer screening abnormalities recommend 1 of 6 clinical actions (treatment, optional treatment or colposcopy/biopsy, colposcopy/biopsy, 1-year surveillance, 3-year surveillance, 5-year return to regular screening) based on the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cancer (CIN 3+) for the many different combinations of current and recent past screening results. This article supports the main guidelines presentation by presenting and explaining the risk estimates that supported the guidelines.

Methods

From 2003 to 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), 1.5 million individuals aged 25 to 65 years were screened with human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology cotesting scheduled every 3 years. We estimated immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for combinations of current test results paired with history of screening test and colposcopy/biopsy results.

Results

Risk tables are presented for different clinical scenarios. Examples of important results are highlighted; for example, the risk posed by most current abnormalities is greatly reduced if the prior screening round was HPV-negative. The immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ used to decide clinical management are shown.

Conclusions

The new risk-based guidelines present recommendations for the management of abnormal screening test and histology results; the key risk estimates supporting guidelines are presented in this article. Comprehensive risk estimates are freely available online at https://CervixCa.nlm.nih.gov/RiskTables.

G.2 Unsatisfactory Cytology

Guideline: For patients with an unsatisfactory cytology result and no, unknown, or a negative HPV test result, repeat age-based screening (cytology, cotest, or primary HPV test) in 2 to 4 months is recommended (BIII). Triage using HPV testing is not recommended (DIII). Before repeat cytology, treatment to resolve atrophy or obscuring inflammation when a specific infection is present is acceptable (CIII). For patients 25 years and older who are cotested and have unsatisfactory cytology and a positive HPV test without genotyping, repeat cytology in 2 to 4 months or colposcopy is acceptable (BII). If a positive HPV test with partial genotyping is positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18, direct referral for colposcopy is recommended (BII) (see Figure 5).

FIGURE 5
This figure describes the steps involved in clinical management of unsatisfactory cytology. Note that "unknown genotype" refers to both HPV testing without genotyping, and HPV testing where genotyping is negative for HPV 16 and 18 but positive for other high-risk HPV types.

Rationale: Literature was reviewed from 2012 to 2019, and no evidence was found to change recommendations. – When cotesting is performed, a negative HPV test in the setting of an unsatisfactory cytology may reflect an inadequate sample. Although a negative HPV test (performed from the same vial as the cytology) may be adequate for testing even when the cytology cellularity is inadequate for diagnosis, interpreting the HPV result in the setting of insufficient cellularity has not been validated, which is of concern given that repeat testing is not recommended for up to 5 years after a negative HPV screen. Negative results on HPV tests that are not FDA approved for primary cervical cancer screening should not be considered valid in the absence of adequate cytology (Section F.3). In summary, a negative HPV result from a cotest with inadequate cellularity on cytology should not be interpreted as negative primary HPV test and should be repeated.

WHY THE 2019 REVISION WAS NEEDED

The revision was motivated by the complexity of the 2012 guidelines and the queue of soon-to-be available new tests. It gradually became clear that there were too many acceptable choices in use, or in final development, to continue as before. In a departure from previous versions, the 2019 guidelines therefore do not present separate algorithm figures for most screening and triage combinations. For example, there are no algorithm figures entitled "Triage of ASC-US" or "Follow-up of HPV-Positive Results". Dozens of algorithm diagrams would have been required to cover the many test combinations now in use or proposed to be introduced soon (such as extended genotyping or dual-stain cytology), along with the influence of past screening history on the meaning of current abnormal test results.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and ASCCP agreed formally in 2017 through a Memorandum of Understanding to embark on a new set of guidelines. Three times before, in 2001, 2006, and 2012, the NCI and ASCCP had collaborated in a formal consensus guidelines process and also helped produce several other related guidances.

The role of NCI epidemiologists and statisticians who specialize in cervical screening has been to provide state-of-the-art epidemiologic evidence regarding test performance based on NCI and other research. The role of ASCCP has been to convene and conduct a consensus process bringing together US clinical organizations and other important "stakeholders" to create the guidelines. The objective of the new agreement was to produce clear and simple consensus recommendations based on risk, to achieve a "long shelf-life" for this version of the 2019 guidelines before another guidelines conference is needed, despite the abundance of competing tests and strategies.

### A study of partial human papillomavirus genotyping in support of the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^113y6uYL]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening strategies are shifting from cytology to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. HPV testing is more sensitive and, when negative, offers greater reassurance against cancer. However, most infections are typically benign, clearing within 2 years of acquisition, and in most cases do not require invasive diagnostic procedures or treatment.

Secondary "triage" testing of HPV-positive women is an important step in clinical management. Cytology is currently recommended as a triage strategy, with most nonnormal cytologic results among HPV-positive women leading to immediate colposcopy. Among HPV-positive women, HPV genotyping can be used in addition to cytology to effectively stratify the risk of precancer. In the 2012 guidelines and 2015 clinical guidance, partial genotyping was incorporated into management; women with HPV-positive, cytology of Negative for Intraepithelial Lesions or Malignancy (NILM) were referred to colposcopy if the highest-risk HPV types (HPV 16 or HPV 18) were detected.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved several HPV tests that provide genotyping information. Commercially available clinical tests vary in the degree to which they can identify specific HPV types, from no individual typing to extended genotyping. Regardless of typing capability, the number of types actually reported by screening assays in the United States is currently restricted (as of the beginning of 2020) to the highest-risk types: HPV 16, HPV 18, and sometimes HPV 45.

The large National Cancer Institute/ Kaiser Permanente Northern California Persistence and Progression (PaP) study was initiated in 2006 partially to help guide the use of typing as a triage after positive HPV testing. This analysis uses data from the PaP study to fit risk estimates for partial HPV genotyping into the clinical action thresholds for the new 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines.

We considered genotyping results as a categorical variable with the following hierarchical levels: type 16 positive, else type 18 positive, and else positive for other high-risk types. An alternative grouping of genotyping that we explored used the following levels: type 16 positive; else type 18 positive; else type 45 positive; else positive for 31, 33, 52, or 58; and else positive for 35, 39, 51, 56, 59, 66, or 68. We calculated survey weights (i.e. as the inverse of sampling fractions) for each patient in the PaP cohort with genotyping results to reconstitute the larger KPNC first and second rounds of testing in the precolposcopy clinical scenario. We then estimated genotype-specific CIN 3+ risks by applying extensions of the prevalence-incidence model for survey data.

We did not use variables outside of current HPV and cytology results, current genotyping results, and history of screening/histopathology results in risk estimation. Other cofactors, including age, race, hormonal contraceptives use, smoking, and income, had minimal or no clinically important effects on CIN 3+ risk in the KPNC.

Defining Risk Thresholds for Clinical Management

Representatives from 19 organizations attended the initial guidelines meeting and convened 7 working groups (including treatment, colposcopy, and surveillance working groups) to determine the consensus clinical action thresholds used to define risk-based clinical management. The 6 clinical management options considered include 3 levels of immediate intervention as follows: (a) expedited treatment (i.e. without preceding colposcopy/biopsy) is preferred, (b) either treatment or colposcopy/biopsy is acceptable, (c) colposcopy/biopsy is recommended; 2 levels of shortened testing intervals as followed: (d) retest in 1 year, (e) retest in 3 years; or (f) continue with/return to routine testing in 5 years as per US Preventive Services Task Forceand American Cancer Society screening guidelines. The treatment working group defined 2 risk levels in which expedited treatment without colposcopy could be used. The surveillance working group limited the options of shortened testing intervals to the 1- and 3-year testing intervals used in the 2012 guidelines.

E.1 Clinical Action Thresholds Leading to Recommendation of Surveillance

Introduction

Surveillance is defined as follow-up testing at a shorter interval than that currently recommended for routine screening with either HPV primary testing or cotesting (5 years). Surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk of CIN 3+ based on current test results and screening history is higher than the risk for the general screening population, but lower than the risk at which colposcopy is recommended. Unlike colposcopy and treatment, which are performed as soon as possible after a qualifying abnormal result, surveillance entails retesting at intervals of 1 to less than 5 years. Therefore, we used the 5-year risk of CIN 3+ as the estimated risk level when assigning surveillance Clinical Action Thresholds. Surveillance intervals are defined in Figure 1 and explained in detail hereinafter. Surveillance thresholds are based on the principle of equal management for equal risks and were designed to support current screening and surveillance recommendations, which are generally accepted as a reasonable balance of benefits and harms. In the 2012 guidelines, intervals of 1 and 3 years were used for surveillance, with return to routine HPV-based screening at 5 years. Because clinicians and patients are familiar with these intervals, and review of evidence did not reveal a compelling reason to change these intervals, these intervals are retained. Note that for observation in very high-risk patients (e.g. untreated CIN2, AIS treated with conization) colposcopy and repeat testing at 6-month intervals is recommended.

Guideline: When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of less than 0.15% based on past history and current test results, return to routine screening at 5-year intervals using HPV-based testing is recommended (AII).

Rationale: Using the principle of equal management for equal risk, this Clinical Action Threshold corresponds to the 5-year CIN 3+ risk after negative HPV-based screening (HPV testing or cotesting) in the general population (see Table 1 A in Egemen et al) for whom national guidelines recommend a 5-year return. Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks in the KPNC database after a negative HPV test and cotest are 0.14% (95% CI = 0.13%–0.15%) and 0.12% (95% CI = 0.12%–0.13%), respectively. Note that cytology alone is never recommended at 5-year intervals.

THE GENERAL APPROACH TAKEN TO CREATE THE NEW GUIDELINES

The ASCCP and NCI cooperatively planned and supported the consensus process, with administrative support provided by the ASCCP. The convening of the consensus group is described in the main guidelines article. Once convened, the major task of the participating representatives was to decide on durable clinical action thresholds, striving to represent US consensus as to what clinical actions are recommended for increasing severity of cervical screening abnormalities. The following axiomatic principles were followed: the main purpose of cervical screening in the United States is to find precancerous lesions ("precancer") that can be treated easily to prevent invasive cervical cancer. Putting aside temporarily whether precancer is best defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/CIN 3/AIS, or CIN 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), or histologic high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/AIS, there are a limited number of clinical actions available to clinicians and patients when faced with a cervical screening abnormality. Logically, a patient known to be at very high risk of having precancer has the greatest need of preventive treatment; at the highest risk, expedited treatment might be preferred without need for colposcopic biopsy. At somewhat lower but still high risk, colposcopic biopsies are recommended to find or rule out precancer requiring treatment. At lower but nonnegligible risk, colposcopy is not needed, but surveillance at shortened intervals is prudent (1 and 3 years were maintained as the 2 levels of concern/attention) to reduce the risk of "interval cancers" occurring before the next testing visit. Women at very low risk provided by a negative human papillomavirus (HPV) test (or HPV and cytology cotest) are recommended to continue screening at the 5-year interval.

In women at highest risk (either 2 or all 3 of high-grade cytology, HPV 16/18 positivity, and high-grade colposcopy impression), "immediate treatment without biopsy confirmation is an alternative". Screening is transitioning with "3 primary screening strategies approved in the US (cytology alone, HPV alone, and cytology-HPV co-testing)", and "dependable risk strata can be defined without HPV genotyping", with a systematic review indicating that "the risk within strata is comparable across studies" and that future strata can be "adapted and benchmarked to currently established risk thresholds".

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — colposcopy referral threshold and equal-risk principle specify that the clinical action threshold for referral to colposcopy is a 4.0% immediate risk of CIN 3+. Patients with an underlying immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 4.0% or more are recommended to have colposcopy when this risk follows HPV-positive ASC-US, HPV-positive low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or greater, HPV 16-positive NILM, a posttreatment positive HPV test, or other equally high-risk results. If a new triage test for HPV-positive patients is shown to convey a CIN 3+ risk greater than or equal to 4.0% upon immediate referral, the management of a positive result would be upgraded to referral to colposcopy, with optional or even preferred, expedited treatment if risk is sufficiently high, consistent with the guiding principle of "Equal Management of Equal Risk".

Cervical cancer screening — exit criteria and follow-up for older patients specify that guidelines require 3 consecutive negative cervical cytology results or 2 consecutive cotesting results 10 years before cessation of screening with the last testing within 5 years; the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines recommend that patients with persistent minor abnormalities or prior treatment of high-grade precancerous lesions be followed for at least 25 years, even if this extends beyond 65 years of age, and under-screening remains common, with 13% of patients aged 65 years not properly screened and 37.1% in women without a regular primary care provider, with most invasive cervical cancers in patients older than 65 years occurring in those who did not meet exit criteria.

### Enduring consensus guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management: introduction to the scope and process [^112bi4Po]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer screening aims at reducing cervical cancer risk by detecting cancer precursors; successfully treating these lesions prevents cervical cancer. For decades, cervical cancer screening was based on cervical cytology. Recently, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has been integrated into screening and management approaches due to its high sensitivity and the strong, long-term reassurance of a low cancer risk provided by a negative test. Human papillomavirus-based screening has been proven to be superior to cytology screening for detection of cervical precancer and the reduction of cancer incidence in large international trials and observational studies. However, to achieve successful cervical cancer prevention, completion of multiple steps including triage, colposcopy, and treatment are necessary. The goal of this multistep process is to provide reassurance to most individuals that the risk of cancer is low while identifying the small proportion of individuals at high risk who need treatment.

In the United States, screening and management recommendations are developed by various organizations (Figure 1). Screening guidelines have been developed independently by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) and have been widely adopted. After a positive screening result, the most current management recommendations are covered by the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (referred to hereafter as 2019 consensus guidelines)and the ASCCP colposcopy standards. Previously, major guidelines were updated every 7–10 years through a consensus process. However, the field of cervical cancer prevention is changing rapidly, creating a need to quickly integrate new approaches into clinical guidelines. For example, since publication of the 2019 consensus management guidelines, 2 new tests that may have a role in managing positive screening result have received regulatory approval. To address this need, the Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines (referred to hereafter as Enduring Guidelines) effort was created as a standing committee to continuously evolve the risk-based process established for the 2019 consensus management guidelines and, after this process, assess new technologies and studies for potential incorporation into the management guidelines.

### A study of partial human papillomavirus genotyping in support of the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^114gnw26]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management of abnormal cervical cancer screening results — this study evaluates partial human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping and risk estimates to support clinical action thresholds, focusing on identification of HPV 16 and HPV 18, using data from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California screening program. The introduction states that the 2019 ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines include recommendations for partial HPV genotyping and that immediate and/or 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ were estimated. The methods note that risk estimates were drawn from a subset of women in Kaiser Permanente Northern California whose residual cervical specimens were HPV tested as part of the HPV Persistence and Progression study. The triage context is described: secondary "triage" testing of HPV-positive women is an important step in patient management; cytology is currently recommended as a triage strategy; and among HPV-positive women, HPV genotyping can be used in addition to cytology to effectively stratify the risk of precancer, with prior guidance referring women with HPV-positive NILM to colposcopy when specific types HPV 16 or HPV 18 were detected. The conclusions further highlight that in management of new abnormal screening results, HPV 18 positivity must be considered as a special situation because of established disproportionate risk of invasive cancer.

### The ASCCP cervical cancer screening task force endorsement and opinion on the American cancer society updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^111tnczp]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening strategies — USPSTF (2018) and ACS (2020) specify age- and history-based intervals and modalities. For age < 21 years, both list no screening, and for ages 21–25 years, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years while ACS lists no screening. For ages 25–29, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years, and for ages 30–65, USPSTF lists cytology alone every 3 years, cotesting every 5 years, or primary HPV test every 5 years. For ages 25–29 and 30–65 in ACS (2020), preferred is primary HPV test every 5 years and acceptable options are cotesting every 5 years or cytology alone every 3 years. Screening cessation differs: USPSTF states no screening after adequate negative prior screening, defined as 2 consecutive negative primary HPV tests, 2 negative cotests, or 3 negative cytology tests within the last 10 years with the most recent in the past 3–5 years, while ACS states no screening is necessary in those without a history of CIN 2+ or a more severe diagnosis in the past 25 years or cervical cancer ever. After total hysterectomy, USPSTF states no screening is necessary without a history of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer, while ACS uses the CIN 2+ criterion with the 25-year lookback; for prior HPV vaccination, both direct to follow age-specific recommendations.

### Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines [^117JCDY4]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

Updated cervical cancer screening guidelines (ACOG/ASCCP/SGO) emphasize that cervical cytology, primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing, and co-testing are all effective in detecting cervical precancerous lesions and cancer, and that the specific strategy selected is less important than consistent adherence to routine screening guidelines. Given these concerns, ACOG, ASCCP, and SGO continue to recommend cervical cancer screening initiation at age 21 years. Human papillomavirus vaccination is another important prevention strategy, and obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should continue to strongly recommend HPV vaccination to eligible patients and stress the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine. The text notes that inadequate cervical cancer screening remains a significant problem in the United States with persistent health inequities, and states that cervical cancer prevention, screening, and treatment are critical components of comprehensive reproductive health care.

Box 1 — summary of updates to 2019 Guidelines highlights endorsement and management changes. Endorsement of the 2021 Opportunistic Infections guidelines for screening and management of HIV+ or immunosuppressed patients is noted. Guidelines were clarified around cytology-only screening; for patients 25 and older who are still receiving cytology-only screening, 2012 guidelines should be followed. Guidelines were revised for repeating an unsatisfactory cytology; cytology should be repeated as soon as convenient and no later than 4 months. After treatment for CIN2+, 3 negative HPV tests or cotests at 6, 18, and 30 months are recommended before the patient can return to a 3-year testing interval. Guidelines were clarified for use of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (primary HPV) for patients undergoing observation for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2.

ASCCP surveillance clinical action thresholds — 5-year CIN 3+ risk–based return intervals are specified with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk less than 0.15% based on past history and current test results, return to routine screening at 5-year intervals using HPV-based testing is recommended (AII). When patients have an estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 0.15% or greater but less than 0.55% based on history and current test results, repeat testing in 3 years with HPV-based testing is recommended (AII). Estimated 5-year CIN 3+ risks in the KPNC database after a negative HPV test and cotest are 0.14% (95% CI = 0.13%–0.15%) and 0.12% (95% CI = 0.12%–0.13%), respectively, and note that cytology alone is never recommended at 5-year intervals.

We also conducted validation studies using estimated immediate and 3-year risks of test results in the Onclarity trialand in the ATHENA study. The Onclarity trial was designed to obtain FDA-approval in the US for use of high-risk HPV pooled detection, with individual identification of types 16, 18, and 45. The analysis cohort consisted of 29,513 patients 25 years and older who were tested with cytology and Onclarity at baseline. All patients with abnormal cytology or high-risk HPV-positive results were referred to colposcopy at baseline and entered into the longitudinal phase of the study. In addition, random selections of patients with negative cotests were referred to colposcopy at baseline (approximately 5%) or entered into the longitudinal phase of the study (approximately 10%). Biopsies and endocervical curettage (ECC) samples underwent a blinded review by 2 pathologists with third pathologist review used for adjudication. The ongoing longitudinal phase consists of 3 additional rounds of annual testing with cytology and Onclarity. In the longitudinal phase of the study, patients with ASC-US or greater cytology results are referred to colposcopy and censored from the study if CIN 2+ was detected. In addition, all patients are also referred to colposcopy at the final study visit.

The ATHENA study was a multicenter trial designed to evaluate primary screening with the cobas test, which tests for high-risk HPV and individually identifies genotypes 16 and 18. For this effort, the analysis cohort consisted of 40,871 patients 25 years and older who were tested with cytology, the cobas test, and earlier generation Roche HPV tests at baseline. Patients with abnormal cytology or who were positive by earlier generation Roche HPV tests were referred to colposcopy, along with a random sample of cotest-negative patients. Biopsies and ECC samples were reviewed by a panel of 3 pathologists who were masked to the screening test results. Patients who underwent colposcopy and did not have CIN 2+ were eligible for the longitudinal phase of the study, which consisted of annual cotesting with cytology and the cobas test. In the longitudinal phase of the study, patients with ASC-US or greater are referred to colposcopy and censored from the study if CIN 2+ was detected. At the final visit, patients were invited to have an exit colposcopy.

F.3 Statement on HPV Tests Used in Management

Guideline: HPV assays should be used for management according to their regulatory approval for screening, unless there are sufficient data to support use of the assay differently (AI).

Rationale: Several HPV assays have been approved in the United States for clinical use in screening and triage. None of these assays have specific indications for management, but they are widely used for postcolposcopy and posttreatment surveillance. For these indications, HPV assays approved for screening should be used according to their regulatory approval. For example, when an HPV test has been approved for cotesting, it should be used in management in the context of cotesting, unless there are sufficient, exceptionally rigorous data to support use of the assay differently (e.g. as outlined in Clarke et al.). Approved assays include target- and signal-amplification assays of HPV DNA, as well as HPV mRNA. Most FDA-approved HPV DNA assays have similar performance characteristics. Most assays are approved for adjunct testing with cytology (also referred to as cotesting), whereas a subset of HPV DNA assays have also been approved for primary HPV testing alone, without concomitant cytology.

Guideline: For nonpregnant patients 25 years or older with an estimated immediate risk of CIN 3+ of 60% or greater based on history and current results, treatment using an excisional procedure without previous biopsy confirmation is preferred but colposcopy with biopsy is acceptable (BII).

Rationale: In the 2012 guidelines, expedited treatment (i.e. without biopsy confirmation) was an acceptable management option for HSIL cytology. Patients with HSIL cytology undergoing expedited treatment are diagnosed with CIN 3+ in 49% to 75% of cases. – The KPNC data show similar risks: HPV-positive HSIL cytology has immediate risks of CIN 3+ and CIN 2+ of 49% and 77%, respectively. Two clinical situations currently exceed the 60% threshold where expedited treatment is preferred. HSIL cytology that is HPV 16–positive has an immediate CIN 3+ of 60%, CIN 2+ risks of 77%, and immediate cancer risks of 8.1%. In the CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, women with HPV-positive HSIL cytology (regardless of genotype) who were underscreened (generally defined as no screening in > 5 years) had an immediate CIN 3+ risk of 64% and CIN 2+ risks of 82% (cancer risk not available). Based on the KPNC data, for clinical situations that exceed the 60% threshold, 1.7 patients will receive diagnostic excisional procedures for every CIN 3+ treated, a low rate of overtreatment.

E. PARADIGM SHIFT: CLINICAL ACTION THRESHOLDS

This section explains the paradigm shift from results-based to risk-based guidelines. We describe the primary Clinical Action Thresholds on which management recommendations are based and the clinical situations in which these Clinical Action Thresholds are applied. For most abnormal screening results and subsequent management visits, the recommendations are based on risks estimated and validated by prospective data from large cohorts. Clinicians can use the 2019 guidelines to manage their patients via the tables in Egemen et al or by using an app or website designed to facilitate navigation of the tables available at, including a no cost version. Sections G to K describe recommendations for rare clinical situations where management is based on factors other than risk estimates.

Management recommendations are based on Clinical Action Thresholds and correspond to risk strata (see Figure 1):

Transition to primary HPV testing — implementation considerations: The transition to primary HPV testing is expected to be a slow process, and costs and personnel burdens for hospitals/medical centers, public health agencies, and insurance providers are considerable and real, with feasibility affected by the financial state and focus of the medical health system in the wake of COVID-19.

New HPV-positive infections after a preceding HPV-negative result — among individuals with current NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL cytology, new typed HPV-positive results might be managed with 1-year follow-up based on 5-year CIN 3+ risk of 3.8% or lower; in the same group, infections with known HPV 16 or HPV 18 would be referred to colposcopy, and newly untyped or partially typed HPV-positive infections with high-grade cytology had immediate CIN 3+ risk of 10.0% or higher and would always be referred to colposcopy.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^1149h3vk]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

HPV-based prior results and high-quality colposcopy modify near-term management — after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, a new abnormal screening result has substantially reduced estimated risk of CIN 3+, often leading to surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy; in contrast, a previous negative cytology result alone does not similarly reduce risk. A colposcopic examination confirming low-grade or normal histology reduces estimated risk in the next 2 years and allows patients with HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL at their 1-year follow-up to return for repeat HPV or cotesting in 1 more year rather than immediately return to colposcopy.

Screening tests and clinical management in the KPNC describe testing platforms and intervals: Since 2001, HPV testing was used to triage atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); beginning in 2013, patients 30 years and older underwent concurrent HPV and cytology cotests, and in 2013 cotesting was extended to ages 25–29 years. Clinical HPV testing used Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) and reported infection with any of the 13 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 59, and 68). From 2003 to 2009, cytology used the BD FocalPoint Slide Profiler, transitioning in 2009 to liquid-based cytology using BD SurePath, with results reported according to the 2001 Bethesda system. Patients who tested HPV negative/NILM were asked to return for testing in 3 years versus the 5-year testing interval recommended nationally since 2012, and sensitivity analyses restricting to those returning in 5 or more years had risk estimates not much different from 3 years. Patients with HPV-negative/ASC-US or HPV-positive/NILM were monitored annually and referred to colposcopy for a subsequent abnormal cytology result or HPV positivity (after 2005). Histopathology results were ordered as normal, CIN stages 1, 2, and 3, AIS, or cancer, with < CIN 2 or < CIN 3 indicating results less severe than those thresholds and CIN 2+ or CIN 3+ indicating at least as severe as those thresholds.

ASCCP risk-based management — follow-up of HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) presents immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ with recommended actions for patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative ASC-US test result. For current HPV-negative with NILM cytology, the table lists n 13,918, CIN 3+ cases 14, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.10, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.14, and recommended management "5-y follow-up" with recommendation confidence score 58. For current HPV-negative with ASC-US cytology, n 1,701 with CIN 3+ cases 11, CIN 3+ immediate risk 0.06, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 0.78, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 82. For current HPV-negative with LSIL cytology, n 193 with CIN 3+ cases 5, CIN 3+ immediate risk 2.4, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 3.1, and recommended management "1-y follow-up" with confidence 80. For current HPV-positive with HSIL+ cytology, n 26 with CIN 3+ cases 8, CIN 3+ immediate risk 36, CIN 3+ 5-y risk 36, and recommended management "Colposcopy/treatment" with confidence 86. The table specifies that the "Recommended management" column gives the recommendation for clinical management based on the clinical action thresholds decided by the guideline.

### Risks of CIN 2 +, CIN 3 +, and cancer by cytology and human papillomavirus status: the foundation of risk-based cervical screening guidelines [^113A8YkK]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Five years have passed since the last American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP)-sponsored consensus conference on cervical cancer screening and management, held in 2012. The current guidelines succeeded in introducing the important principle of "equal management of equal risk" and in harmonizing management strategies by applying this principle to different combinations of test results. However, current recommendations remain undeniably complicated and, in some instances, controversial.

Formal preparation for the next round of ASCCP-sponsored guidelines has now begun, with the goal of making the recommendations both simpler and more precise. Algorithm diagrams for each test result will be replaced with fully risk-based, tailored recommendations for each woman. Based on level of risk of precancer/cancer, the guidelines will suggest a recommended action. For example, in response to risk assessment, the guidelines might recommend that the clinician "consider treatment" (if risk is extremely high), "perform colposcopy and biopsy" (if risk is high), "retest in 1 year" (or some other interval chosen by the guidelines group, for intermediate risk), "rescreen routinely" at an agreed interval (for low risk), or "exit screening" (if risk of subsequent cancer is virtually zero or risk of testing outweighs disease risk).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors: erratum [^111STseh]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

2019 ASCCP risk-based management erratum — Figure 2 legend for minimally abnormal HPV-positive ASC-US specifies corrected risk estimates and recommendations. This figure demonstrates how a patient with a common minimally abnormal screening test result (HPV-positive ASC-US) would be managed based on risk estimates. The initial screening result would lead to colposcopy (immediate risk 4.45%). If colposcopy shows less than CIN 2, the 5-year risk is 2.9% (1-year return). At the 1-year return visit, a second HPV-positive ASC-US result has an immediate risk of 3.1% (1-year return). If the HPV-based test performed for the second post-colposcopy surveillance test is negative, return in 3 years is recommended. If the second post-colposcopy surveillance test results are either a positive HPV test with any cytology result or a negative HPV test result with a cytology result of ASC-H or higher, colposcopy is recommended. Return in 1 year is recommended for HPV-negative ASCUS or LSIL results. Note similar management would be recommended if the initial abnormality preceding colposcopy were any minimally abnormal test result (i.e., less severe than ASC-H). The erratum clarifies that the prior legend instead reported immediate risk 4.2% and a 5-year risk of 3.2% (1-year return).

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors [^116QGrRi]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP risk-based management — one-year surveillance thresholds and indications are as follows: When the estimated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risk is below the threshold for immediate colposcopy (4.0% immediate risk) and above the 3-year follow-up threshold (≥ 0.55% at 5 years), repeat testing in 1 year with human papillomavirus (HPV)-based testing is recommended (AII). Follow-up at 1 year is recommended after screening tests showing minimal abnormalities — HPV-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) or HPV-negative/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) with unknown previous screening history (immediate risks 2.1% and 1.9% respectively) — and after colposcopy with biopsies of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less preceded by a low-grade cotest result (defined as HPV-positive LSIL, HPV-positive atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US], or repeated HPV-positive NILM). Because risk is substantially reduced after a documented negative HPV primary screening test or cotest or normal colposcopic examination with biopsy confirmation of less than CIN 2, 1-year surveillance, not colposcopy, is recommended for most patients with new HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL results after a documented negative HPV test or cotest within approximately 5 years or colposcopic examination less than CIN 2 within the past year. Three-year surveillance is recommended for patients whose risk falls between the 3- and 5-year follow-up thresholds; patients with an HPV-negative ASC-US screening result in the setting of an unknown history can return at 3 years (estimated 5 year CIN 3+ risk of 0.40%), and patients with a low-grade cotest result followed by colposcopy less than CIN 2 and a negative follow-up HPV test or cotest reach the 3-year return threshold. A previous negative cytology result alone does not reduce subsequent risk like a negative HPV-based screen; therefore, cytology alone is not used to modify subsequent management recommendations.

K.3 Managing patients older than 65 years with a history of prior abnormalities — If patients over age 65 years undergo human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, cotesting, or cytology, management according to guidelines for patients aged 25 to 65 years is recommended (CII). If surveillance is indicated for prior abnormal screening or treatment for precancer, discontinuing surveillance is unacceptable if the patient is in reasonably good health and testing is feasible (DII), whereas discontinuation of surveillance is recommended for patients with a limited life expectancy (EIII). As context, approximately 20% of cervical cancers occur in patients older than 65 years, and patients with previous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) seem to have an elevated lifetime risk of developing cervical cancer and thus may require surveillance testing beyond the age of 65 years. For sampling challenges, vaginal estrogen use for a limited time (3 weeks) can be considered to obtain adequate sampling.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^115FDQwA]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

KPNC database — screening scope and outcomes are specified: From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2017, more than 1.5 million patients aged 25–65 years underwent combined human papillomavirus (HPV) and cytology testing, and more than 200,000 aged 21–24 years were primarily screened with cytology. Biopsy outcomes were complete through the end of 2016 with partial data through September 31, 2017, documenting 16,222 CIN 2, 9,712 CIN 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and 696 cancer histologic diagnoses. Compared with the database available up to 2010 used for the 2012 guidelines, the current database includes more than 500,000 additional screening participants, 7 additional years of follow-up, and approximately 150% more CIN 3+, enabling more precise risk estimates for clinical scenarios and test results.

### 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines: methods for risk estimation, recommended management, and validation [^112kUTR1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To manage cervical screening abnormalities, the 2019 ASCCP management consensus guidelines will recommend clinical action on the basis of risk of cervical precancer and cancer. This article details the methods used to estimate risk, to determine the risk-based management, and to validate that the risk-based recommendations are of general use in different settings.

Methods

Based on 1.5 million patients undergoing triennial cervical screening by cotesting at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2003 to 2017, we estimated risk profiles for different clinical scenarios and combinations of past and current human papillomavirus and cytology test results. We validated the recommended management by comparing with the estimated risks in several external data sources.

Results

Risk and management tables are presented separately by Egemen et al. and Demarco et al. Risk-based management derived from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California largely agreed with the management implied from the estimated risks of the other data sources.

Conclusions

The new risk-based guidelines present management of abnormal cervical screening results. By describing the steps used to develop these guidelines, the methods presented in this article can provide a basis for future extensions of the risk-based guidelines.

Risks were estimated for a given testing round, and beginning with the second round risks informed precolposcopy management after immediately prior results of HPV negative, HPV positive/NILM, cotest negative, HPV negative/ASC-US, or HPV negative/LSIL; risk estimates were not provided for other prior abnormal results such as HPV positive/ASC-US or HPV positive/LSIL.

Risk-based management scenarios and eligibility after a prior HPV-negative screen are outlined as follows: Scenario 1 describes initial management of abnormal screening results; Table 1A addresses patients without a documented recent HPV test result, and to qualify for Table 1B, a patient's current abnormal screening test result must be preceded by a negative HPV test documented in the medical record within the past approximately 5 years (e.g., a normal screening interval); Scenario 2 describes surveillance after abnormal results not requiring immediate colposcopy referral, including management of current cotest results after a previous result of HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM; Scenario 3 describes management upon receipt of colposcopy/biopsy results; Scenario 4 describes management after a colposcopy at which CIN 2+ was not found, with Table 4a for low-grade index tests and Table 4b for high-grade index tests; Scenario 5 addresses management after treatment for CIN 2 or CIN 3; and notably, HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL preceded by a negative HPV test are now recommended to be followed-up in 1 year rather than immediately referred to colposcopy.

ASCCP 2019 — Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by ASC-H cytology allows "Observation: Cytology < 25 years HPV-based testing ≥ 25 years at 1 and 2 years", "Diagnostic Excisional Procedure^a", or "Review of cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings". With observation, "Negative Cytology or HPV-based testing at 1 year and 2 years" proceeds to "HPV-based testing in 3 years", while "Abnormal Test Results" are managed per guideline. Excisional treatment is triggered by age-stratified follow-up cytology: "Age ≥ 25 years: Cytology HSIL at 1 or 2 years or ASC-H at 2 years" and "Age < 25 yrs: Cytology HSIL or ASC-H at 2 years", each leading to "Diagnostic Excisional Procedure^a". Footnotes specify excision "Only if colposcopy visualizes the entire squamocolumnar junction and upper limit of lesion(s), and endocervical sampling is < CIN 2" with the exception "Except in pregnant women".

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^114g1FE1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) follow-up — immediate and 5-year cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN 3+) risks with management are tabulated for current HPV and cytology results obtained during surveillance. Patients who are under surveillance after a prior HPV-negative LSIL test result can be managed by Table 28b. For HPV-negative NILM, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.40 with recommended 3-y follow-up and recommendation confidence score 57. For HPV-negative ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ 5-y risks are 4.0 and 4.4 with recommended 1-y follow-up and recommendation confidence scores 100 and 96. For HPV-positive NILM, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 4.0 and 8.6 with recommended 1-y follow-up. For HPV-positive ASC-US and LSIL, CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks are 5.3 and 6.9, and 5.0 and 7.9, respectively, with recommended Colposcopy. Special situations include HPV-positive ASC-H with CIN 3+ immediate and 5-y risks of 50 and 50 managed with Colposcopy and HPV-positive HSIL+ with risks 33 and 33 managed with Colposcopy/treatment. After Cotest negative ×2, CIN 3+ 5-y risk is 0.27 with recommended 3-y follow-up. In the 2012 guidelines, repeat cotesting at 3 years was recommended for HPV-negative NILM after HPV-negative LSIL and this recommendation does not change; however, HPV-negative ASC-US, HPV-negative LSIL, and HPV-positive NILM after HPV-negative LSIL lead to 1-year surveillance rather than immediate colposcopy. Evaluation of return intervals indicates that 2 negative cotests after HPV-negative LSIL do not provide enough reassurance to return to 5-year regular screening.

ASCCP risk-based management — when CIN 2+ is not identified after ASC-H or HSIL cytology allows review of cytology, histology, and colposcopy; if HSIL cytology with histologic LSIL (CIN 1) or less, either immediate diagnostic excision or observation with HPV-based testing and colposcopy at 1 year is acceptable if colposcopy fully visualizes the squamocolumnar junction and lesion limits and endocervical sampling, if collected, is less than CIN 2. For ASC-H with complete colposcopic visualization and negative endocervical sampling, observation at 1 year with HPV-based testing is recommended and a diagnostic excisional procedure is not recommended. If observation is elected and all tests are negative at the 1‑year visit, repeat HPV-based testing is recommended in 1 year; a diagnostic excisional procedure is recommended for HSIL cytology at the 1‑ or 2‑year visit or ASC‑H persisting at 2 years.

TABLE 1
Contribution of Carcinogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Genotypes and CIN3+ Progression Risk for Progression to Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 3 or Worse

The IARC combines carcinogenic HPV types into 4 groups based on their risk of progression and attribution to cancer: HPV16, HPV18/45, HPV16-related types (HPV33, 31, 52, 58, 35), and the remaining other carcinogenic or probable carcinogenic types (HPV 39, 51, 59, 56, 68). However, the clinical management of HPV types and type groups is not prescribed by the IARC ranking and may vary across settings, depending on specific risk-based thresholds and available triage options, as well as on colposcopy and treatment capacity. The guidelines presented here fill that gap and were specifically developed for the US setting.

Most HPV assays approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) predate the current IARC classification, so assay configurations deviate from ideal type groupings. For example, commercial US assays either individually report HPV45 or group it with the other 12 carcinogenic types (HR12). Some assays group HPV35 with types from the lowest risk group. Human papillomavirus 66 was formerly considered a carcinogen but has now been reclassified as noncarcinogenic; nevertheless, because HPV66 is reported in current assays, it is included in Enduring Consensus Cervical Cancer Screening and Management Guidelines (referred to hereafter as Enduring Guidelines) recommendations for management.

In 2015, ASCCP and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened a panel that developed guidance for using HPV testing with limited genotyping (16, 18, HR12, Figure 1) as a primary cervical cancer screening test. Immediate colposcopy referral was recommended because of HPV16's high cancer risk and because of HPV18's high risk of endocervical glandular lesions (adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] and adenocarcinoma) frequently missed by cytology. For individuals with HR12-positive results, cytology triage was recommended. In 2019, the ASCCP Risk-Based Management Consensus Guidelines (hereafter referred to as 2019 Guidelines) reaffirmed this approach, which constitutes the foundation for extended genotyping recommendations. –

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114T4GY6]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Cervical cancer screening — comparison with other U.S. guidelines describes that the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cytology alone for women aged 21 to 29 years, and for women aged 30 to 65 years either every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone, or every 5 years with cotesting; for ages 30 to 65 years, cytology alone and HPV testing alone are preferred and cotesting is an alternative. The USPSTF does not recommend screening in individuals aged > 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise under surveillance, and screening also is not recommended for those who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and no history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. The primary difference from ACS is the ACS's strong recommendation to begin screening at age 25 years with primary HPV testing preferred (with cytology and cotesting acceptable), whereas the 2018 USPSTF begins at age 21 years with cytology alone and transitions at age 30 years to one of the three options. A 2015 SGO/ASCCP panel concluded that HPV testing starting at age 25 years can be considered as an alternative and indicated that rescreening after a negative primary HPV screen should occur no sooner than every 3 years, while also stating that cytology alone and cotesting remain as screening options; ACOG guidelines encompass cytology alone, cotesting, and primary HPV testing consistent with ASCCP/SGO interim guidance. The American College of Physicians' 2015 best-practice advice was largely concordant with 2012 consensus guidance and stated no preference between cytology alone every 3 years and cotesting every 5 years, aligning with the USPSTF at that time.

### ASCCP colposcopy standards: risk-based colposcopy practice [^1121PCkz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2017). Medium credibility.

ASCCP colposcopy standards — biopsy practice in women with very high risk of precancer: In nonpregnant women 25 years and older with very high risk of precancer (at least 2 of the following: HSIL cytology, HPV 16 and/or HPV 18 positive, high-grade colposcopy impression), either immediate excisional treatment without biopsy confirmation or colposcopy with multiple targeted biopsies is acceptable. Endocervical sampling should be conducted according to the 2012 ASCCP Management Guidelines, and if biopsies are taken and do not show precancer, management according to the 2012 ASCCP Management Guidelines is recommended. Supporting evidence notes that a systematic review of see-and-treat management strategies for women with HSIL cytology found that 89% of all women with HSIL had CIN 2+.

### Risk estimates supporting the 2019 ASCCP risk-based management consensus guidelines [^111wnrgd]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). High credibility.

ASCCP 2019 risk-based management — immediate and 5-year risks of CIN 3+ for abnormal screening results when there are no known prior HPV test results are presented with recommended actions. For Unknown HPV-positive HSIL+, CIN 3+ immediate risk is 49 and CIN 3+ 5-year risk is 53 with Colposcopy/treatment. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-H, risks are 26 immediate and 35 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive LSIL, risks are 4.3 immediate and 6.9 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive ASC-US, risks are 4.8 immediate and 7.3 at 5 years with Colposcopy. For Unknown HPV-positive NILM, risks are 2.1 immediate and 4.8 at 5 years with 1-y follow-up. For Unknown HPV-negative NILM, risks are 0.04 immediate and 0.12 at 5 years with 5-y follow-up. Notes specify that HPV-negative ASC-H and AGC are referred to colposcopy although they do not exceed the 4% immediate colposcopy threshold, and that HPV-negative HSIL+ is seen in only 0.01% of the population with an immediate risk of 25%; HPV-positive "ALL" are excluded from the table to avoid duplication.

### Summary of current guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management of abnormal test results: 2016–2020 [^116p5EEw]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer can be prevented through routine screening and follow-up of abnormal results. Several guidelines have been published in the last 4 years from various medical societies and organizations. These guidelines aim to personalize screening and management, reducing unnecessary testing in low-risk patients and managing high-risk patients with more intensive follow-up. However, the resulting complexity can lead to confusion among providers. The CDC, NCI, and obstetrician-gynecologists involved in guideline development summarized current screening and management guidelines. For screening, guidelines for average-risk and high-risk populations are summarized and presented. For management, differences between the 2012 and 2019 consensus guidelines for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors are summarized. Current screening guidelines for average-risk individuals have minor differences, but are evolving toward an HPV-based strategy. For management, HPV testing is preferred to cytology because it is a more sensitive test for cancer precursor detection and also allows for precise risk stratification. Current risk-based screening and management strategies can improve care by reducing unnecessary tests and procedures in low-risk patients and focusing resources on high-risk patients. Knowledge of screening and management guidelines is important to improve adherence and avoid both over- and under-use of screening and colposcopy.

FIGUR'E 1
This figure demonstrates how patient risk is evaluated. For a given current results and history combination, the immediate CIN 3+ risk is examined. If this risk is 4% or greater, immediate management via colposcopy or treatment is indicated. If the immediate risk is less than 4%, the 5-year CIN 3+ risk is examined to determine whether patients should return in 1, 3, or 5 years.

The 5-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative screening test using HPV testing or cotesting in the general population, for whom retesting in 5 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold are recommended to receive routine screening at 5-year intervals with HPV-based testing (Section E.1).
The 3-year return Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after a negative cervical cytology screen in the general population, for whom retesting in 3 years is recommended by national screening guidelines. Patients with risks at or below this threshold but above the 5-year threshold are recommended to receive HPV-based testing in 3 years (Section E.1).
One-year return is recommended for patients with risks above the 3-year threshold but below the Clinical Action Threshold for colposcopy (Section E.1).
The colposcopy Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL screening result in the general population, for whom colposcopy is recommended in the 2012 guidelines. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment threshold are recommended to receive colposcopy (Section E.2).
The expedited treatment or colposcopy acceptable Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV-positive atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) cytology screening result in the general population. Patients with risks at or above this threshold but below the expedited treatment preferred threshold are recommended to receive counseling from their providers to choose between evaluation with colposcopy and biopsy or expedited treatment (Section E.3). Expedited treatment is defined as treatment without confirmatory colposcopic biopsy.
The expedited treatment preferred Clinical Action Threshold approximates the risk for a patient after an HPV 16–positive HSIL cytology screening result in the general population. It is preferred that patients with risks at or above this threshold receive expedited treatment unless they are pregnant, younger than 25 years, or have concerns about the potential effects of treatment on future pregnancy outcomes that outweigh concerns about cancer (Section E.3).
Of note, patients with histologic HSIL (CIN 2) who have chosen observation are recommended to receive colposcopy and HPV-based testing at 6-month intervals (Section I.3).

### Cervical cancer screening: updated guidelines from the American… [^111wyGTu]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Primary HPV testing alone every five years is more sensitive for dysplasia than cytology and more specific than cotesting with HPV testing and cytology.
- Primary HPV testing every five years from 25 to 65 years of age reduces cancers and cancer deaths as much as cytology from 21 to 30 years of age and cotesting from 30 to 65 years of age while also reducing pelvic examination burden by about one-half.
- Cervical cancer screening can be discontinued after 65 years of age in women at low risk due to previous negative screening. From the AFP Editors Cervical cancer screening programs are successful, decreasing cancer incidence dramatically since the 1950s to just less than 14, 000 cases in 2020. Yet, more than 4, 000 patients die annually from cervical cancer, with racial and socioeconomic disparities continuing to contribute to this number. The American Cancer Society has released new guidelines for cervical cancer screening.

Best Screening Test The primary goal of screening is to prevent cervical cancer by detecting treatable abnormalities and precancerous lesions. Early detection of invasive cervical cancer is a secondary goal. In 2018, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended primary human papillomavirus testing without cytology as an option for cervical cancer screening. Both primary HPV tests are approved for patients 25 years and older. Primary HPV testing is more sensitive and has a higher long-term negative predictive value than cytology. In vaccinated patients, abnormal cytology findings are primarily caused by HPV types with low cancer risk. Cotesting with cytology and HPV testing increases false-positive results compared with primary HPV testing with minimal effect on cervical cancer detection.

Screening Recommendations In a major shift from their 2012 guideline, the ACS recommends that patients with a cervix undergo primary HPV testing every five years, without cytology, beginning at 25 years of age and, for most patients, stopping at 65 years of age. The recommendation not to initiate screening until age 25 is based on several factors. Less than 1% of cervical cancers are diagnosed in patients younger than 25 years, and early screening does not prevent these cancers. Many abnormal findings in patients 21 to 24 years of age would regress without intervention because HPV infections in this group are commonly transient. Large observational studies suggest that screening younger patients offers little benefit in reducing cervical cancer, and treatment can increase risks of preterm birth. Primary HPV testing is not yet available in many locations. Until it is an option, screening can be performed through cotesting every five years or cytology alone every three years.

Although vaccination reduces risks of positive HPV test results and precancerous lesions, evidence is insufficient to modify screening recommendations for vaccinated patients. When to Stop Cervical Cancer Screening Although one in five cervical cancer deaths occurs in patients older than 65 years, most were diagnosed at a younger age or had insufficient screening. Testing beyond this age in previously screened patients adds little benefit with a cost of more colposcopies. Cervical cancer screening is no longer required in low-risk patients older than 65 years who have not been diagnosed with grade 2 or greater cervical intraepithelial neoplasia within the past 25 years and who have had negative screening results for the past 10 years using any recommended interval. Benefits and Risks Based on models, there will be similar mortality and fewer cancers with five-year primary HPV screening compared with screening using previous recommendations as shown in Table 1.

Use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cytology for cervical cancer screening in women 30 years and older — algorithmic management is specified as follows: Under "Cytology Negative", "HPV (-)" leads to "Routine Screening Not before 3 years", while "HPV (+)" leads to "Repeat BOTH Tests @ 12 mos". After repeating both tests, "Both Negative" proceeds to "Routine Screening @ 3 years", "Cytology Negative HPV (+)" proceeds to "Colposcopy", and "Cytology Abnormal Any HPV Result" proceeds to "Colposcopy". For "Cytology ASCUS or Greater", the pathway is to "Manage per ASCCP Guideline". The footnote clarifies to "test only for high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV".

Risk-based colposcopy practice — adapting to previous risk and colposcopy impression, colposcopy practice may be modified based on the risk level, which the guideline notes can be estimated from screening and triage tests (e.g., cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) with HPV 16/18 genotyping) and the colposcopic impression, and risk markers can be combined to stratify patients into groups with very different risk; when the risk of precancer is very high, immediate treatment may be recommended, whereas if the risk is very low, expectant management with serial cytology and HPV testing but no biopsy may be warranted, and for intermediate risks, multiple biopsies of acetowhite lesions lead to increased detection of precancer.

Validation — ATHENA study comparisons similarly show higher baseline risks but mostly aligned management, with a noted HPV-positive/NILM exception: ATHENA had "greater overall immediate CIN 3+ risks (0.79% vs 0.46%, p < .001) and greater proportions of patients who tested HPV positive/NILM (7.7% vs 4.1%, p < .001) at the initial screen", and for HPV-positive NILM, risks "remained significantly higher than that of KPNC (O/Es from 1.3–2.2)". Management "largely agreed, with the exception of HPV positive/NILM (immediate CIN 3+ risk: 4.6%; O/E: 2.2 [95% CI 1.8–2.6])", and with genotyping, examples included "colposcopy referral for types 16 and 18 and a 1-year return for non-16/18 HPV-positive NILM results".

ASCCP risk-based management — limitations and special-case cytology handling: The risks for some rare combinations could not be estimated with confidence, and for rare high-grade cytology such as ASC-H, AGC, and HSIL+, risk estimation after diagnoses of CIN 1 or less was less reliable and results are managed cautiously. Anticipated vaccine-era effects are noted: HPV vaccination is expected to decrease prevalence in patients between ages 25–29 years, and once enough data accrue on the vaccinated population, risk scores will be re-evaluated to determine recommended management for the vaccinated population.

ASCCP 2019 — Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL cytology is managed via three initial options: "Observation: Colposcopy & Cytology < 25 years Colposcopy & HPV-based testing ≥ 25 years at 1 year", "Diagnostic Excision Procedure^a", or "Review of cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings". During observation, "Abnormal Test Results" are managed per guideline, while "Age-specific retesting in 1 year " follows if "All Tests Negative", and with continued negativity transition to "HPV-based testing every 3 years for at least 25 years". If follow-up shows "Cytologic HSIL at 1 year", management follows guideline with "Continued observation for age < 25 years only", whereas "ASC-H/HSIL cytology at 2 years" leads to "Diagnostic Excisional Procedure". Footnote criteria state excision is appropriate "Only if colposcopy visualizes the entire squamocolumnar junction and upper limit of lesion(s), and endocervical sampling is < CIN 2".

American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) 2019 management of common cervical screening abnormalities — Key actions include: For HPV-negative atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 3 yrs; for HPV-negative low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For HPV-positive cytology negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM), colposcopy is recommended. If genotyping is positive for HPV 16, HPV 18, or both with ASC-US or LSIL, colposcopy is recommended. For HPV-positive ASC-US or LSIL with negative screening results within the previous 5 yrs, repeat HPV test with or without concurrent Pap test in 1 yr. For high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cytology that is HPV 16 positive, expedited treatment is recommended; if HPV is untyped, positive for a genotype other than HPV 16, or negative with HSIL, colposcopy or expedited treatment is acceptable. Footnotes specify that negative HPV test or cotest results only defer colposcopy if from screening within the last 5 years and that expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged ≥ 25 years.

4) Patient Scenarios Not Initially Addressed in the 2019 Guidelines:

Additional guidance was developed to address scenarios for which the 2019 Guidelines did not initially provide management recommendations. This guidance was voted on in July 2021 and previously published. To summarize, this guidance (1) outlined management guidelines for cytology results without HPV testing among individuals aged 25 years and older and (2) clarified management when previous guidelines had not been followed:

(a) Guideline for individuals aged 25 and older screened with cytology alone: For individuals aged 25 years or older screened with cytology alone, the 2012 guidelines should be followed. In the 2012 guidelines, colposcopy is recommended for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or a more severe cytologic interpretation.
(b) Guideline for cases in which colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed: In cases in which a colposcopy was previously recommended but not completed, the recommendation is for colposcopy if the previous result was high-grade cytology [atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells (AGC), HSIL, or a more severe cytologic interpretation]. If the previous cytology result was not high grade, and the patient undergoes repeat testing with HPV testing or cotesting instead of colposcopy: colposcopy is recommended if the result on repeat testing indicates a second consecutive HPV-positive result and/or persistent cytologic abnormality (ASC-US or a more severe cytologic interpretation); repeat HPV testing or cotesting in 1 year is acceptable if the result on repeat testing is HPV negative or cotest negative.

I.5 Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) Diagnosed Repeatedly for at Least 2 Years

Guideline: For patients 25 years or older with histologic LSIL (CIN 1) who is diagnosed at consecutive visits for at least 2 years, observation is preferred (BII) but treatment is acceptable (CIII). If treatment is selected and the entire squamocolumnar junction and all lesions were fully visualized during colposcopic examination, either excision or ablation treatments are acceptable (CII).

Rationale: Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) is the histologic manifestation of HPV infection. CIN 1 may be associated with oncogenic (high-risk) or low-risk HPV infections and may be due to persistent infection with 1 type or sequential infections with different types. HPV 16 is less common in CIN 1 than in CIN 3. Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) and cytologic ASC-US/HPV+ and LSIL are the same biologically and thus should be managed similarly. Regression rates are high, especially in younger patients, and subsequent diagnosis of CIN 2+ is uncommon regardless of whether CIN 1 is found on endocervical sampling or a biopsy of the transformation zone. The KPNC data showed a similar, relatively low 5-year risk of CIN 3+ of approximately 2% when CIN 1 or no lesion was found on colposcopy/biopsy after HPV-positive cytologic ASC-US or LSIL. In the KPNC data set of individuals with CIN 1 on biopsy on 2 consecutive visits, the subsequent follow-up demonstrated that 52% were HPV negative, 48% were HPV positive, and of the HPV-positive group, 92% had NILM, ASC-US, or LSIL cytology. A study of 126 women undergoing LEEP for CIN 1 diagnosed at consecutive visits for 2 years found that 87% had CIN 1 or negative pathology, whereas 13% had histologic HSIL (CIN 2+). Based on these data, and considering the potential harms of treatment, the present recommendations prefer continued observation of those with histologic LSIL (CIN1) diagnosed on consecutive visits for at least 2 years. Treatment is an acceptable option based on patient preference, after shared decision-making. Because the immediate estimated CIN3+ risk is less than the 25% treatment threshold, this is considered a special situation.
