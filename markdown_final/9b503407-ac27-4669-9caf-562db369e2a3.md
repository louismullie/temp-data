## Question

what viral infection causes initial fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by rash on face, arms, and upper trunk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which viral infection presents with initial fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by a rash on the face, arms, and upper trunk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which viral illnesses classically start with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Then, I should verify which of those subsequently develop a rash and, critically, where that rash tends to appear. Next, I will compare key differentials that can mimic this pattern, including measles, rubella, Zika, chikungunya, enteroviruses, and COVID-19. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline confirmatory testing and management considerations, making sure I double-check the timing and distribution of the rash before concluding [^112uGnjz].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical triad: fever followed by nausea and vomiting, then a rash on the face, arms, and upper trunk. This sequence suggests a prodromal systemic phase with gastrointestinal involvement followed by a mucocutaneous eruption, which narrows the field toward classic childhood viral exanthems and select arboviruses, but I need to check which specifically match both the timing and the anatomic distribution of the rash [^112uGnjz].

> Wait, let me verify the leading candidate: measles (rubeola) typically begins with high fever and coryzal symptoms, followed by cough and conjunctivitis, and then a morbilliform rash that classically starts on the face and behind the ears and spreads downward to the trunk and extremities, often appearing around day 3–5 of illness; gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting can occur, though they are less prominent than the respiratory features, so the distribution fits and the sequence is plausible, but I should confirm the prominence of GI symptoms in this case before concluding definitively [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; rubella can also present with fever and a generalized morbilliform rash that includes the face and trunk, but its prodrome is usually milder and gastrointestinal symptoms are less characteristic, so rubella is less likely to fit a presentation dominated by early nausea and vomiting, though I should acknowledge it remains a differential if the prodrome is atypical or exposure risk is high [^notfound].

> I will now examine arboviral options. Zika virus frequently causes a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash that can involve the face, trunk, and extremities, and pediatric cohorts show fever, rash, and leukopenia peaking within 3 days of onset; however, gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting are not a defining feature, so while the rash distribution can match, the prominence of early vomiting makes Zika less likely as the primary explanation here, though co-infection or regional epidemiology could modify pretest probability [^115qq35U] [^115YvPfK].

> Let me consider chikungunya next. Chikungunya often presents with abrupt fever and severe arthralgia, and the rash is generalized and maculopapular, frequently involving the trunk and limbs; nausea and vomiting can occur but are not classic hallmarks, and the intense arthralgia would usually be a standout feature, so if joint pain is absent or minimal, chikungunya becomes less compelling for this specific symptom complex [^116K57C9].

> But wait, what if this is an enterovirus such as coxsackie or echovirus? Hand-foot-and-mouth disease typically shows fever with oral lesions and a rash on hands, feet, and sometimes buttocks, which does not match a face and upper-trunk predominant eruption; other enteroviruses can cause nonspecific exanthems, yet the classic acral and oral involvement is not described here, making enterovirus a weaker fit for this distribution despite their propensity for GI symptoms [^114fKzQn] [^114HdsfZ].

> I should double-check COVID-19 as a contemporary consideration. COVID-19 in children and adults can present with fever, nausea, and vomiting, and a subset develop mucocutaneous-enteric illness with rash; however, the rash morphology and distribution are variable and nonspecific, and COVID-19 lacks the predictable centrifugal spread from face to trunk that characterizes measles, so while possible, it does not as cleanly match the classic exanthem pattern described [^116x2bVn] [^117NfTfw] [^117Qu6No].

> Let me reconsider the measles hypothesis in light of the full triad. The sequence of high fever with systemic symptoms, followed by a morbilliform eruption beginning on the face and spreading to the upper trunk and extremities, aligns with measles pathophysiology and typical clinical evolution; gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, are recognized albeit less prominent than respiratory features, and the anatomic distribution fits the classic centrifugal spread, strengthening measles as the most likely diagnosis in this scenario [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to confirm this at the bedside and in the lab. Measles remains a clinical diagnosis supported by epidemiology and exam, with Koplik spots (enanthem) often preceding the rash by 1–2 days; serologic confirmation with measles-specific IgM or RT-PCR provides laboratory verification, and given the public health implications, suspected cases should be reported promptly while implementing isolation precautions during the infectious period [^notfound].

> I need to ensure management advice is aligned with best practice. Supportive care with attention to hydration, antipyretics, and monitoring for complications is standard; vitamin A supplementation is recommended in children, and clinicians should remain vigilant for secondary bacterial infections and respiratory involvement, coordinating with public health for contact tracing and outbreak control as indicated [^112uGnjz].

> Final synthesis: The most likely viral infection matching initial fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by a rash on the face, arms, and upper trunk is measles (rubeola), given the characteristic timing and centrifugal spread of the exanthem; key differentials such as rubella, Zika, chikungunya, enteroviruses, and COVID-19 are less consistent with the described distribution or the prominence of early gastrointestinal symptoms in this case, though travel and exposure history should always be elicited to refine the differential and guide testing [^115qq35U] [^116K57C9] [^114fKzQn] [^116x2bVn].

The most likely viral infection causing **fever, nausea, and vomiting** followed by a **rash on the face, arms, and upper trunk** is **measles (rubeola)** [^114HdsfZ]. Measles typically begins with a prodrome of high fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a **maculopapular rash** that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities [^notfound]. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, are common in children [^notfound]. Other viral infections with similar features include **rubella** (German measles), **roseola infantum** (exanthem subitum), and **parvovirus B19** (fifth disease) [^114UoADN]; however, measles best matches the described rash distribution and prodrome [^notfound]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by serology or PCR, and management is supportive care with isolation [^112uGnjz].

---

## Clinical features of measles

Measles has a characteristic clinical course, with a **prodromal phase** followed by a **distinctive rash** [^notfound]:

- **Prodromal phase**: High fever (often ≥ 40°C), cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and malaise. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, are common, especially in children [^notfound].

- **Enanthem**: Koplik spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa) appear 1–2 days before the rash.

- **Rash**: A maculopapular rash begins on the face and behind the ears, then spreads to the trunk, arms, and legs, typically lasting 5–7 days [^notfound].

- **Resolution**: The rash fades in the same order it appeared, often leaving a brownish discoloration.

---

## Differential diagnosis

Several viral infections can present with **similar symptoms**, but measles most closely matches the described rash distribution and prodrome [^notfound]:

| **Viral infection** | **Clinical features distinguishing from measles** |
|-|-|
| Rubella (German measles) | - Milder fever <br/> - Prominent lymphadenopathy <br/> - Rash similar but less intense <br/> - No Koplik spots [^notfound] |
| Roseola infantum (HHV-6) | - High fever followed by rash after defervescence <br/> - Rash starts on trunk and spreads to extremities <br/> - Less prominent gastrointestinal symptoms [^notfound] |
| Parvovirus B19 (fifth disease) | - "Slapped cheek" facial rash <br/> - Lace-like rash on trunk and limbs <br/> - Minimal gastrointestinal symptoms [^notfound] |
| Enteroviruses (e.g. coxsackievirus) | - Vesicular rash on hands, feet, and mouth <br/> - Less prominent facial involvement <br/> - Seasonal occurrence [^114fKzQn] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by laboratory testing:

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on characteristic prodrome, Koplik spots, and rash distribution [^notfound].

- **Laboratory confirmation**: Serologic testing (measles IgM) or PCR can confirm the diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Consider other viral exanthems based on clinical features and epidemiology [^112uGnjz].

---

## Management and prevention

Management is supportive, including antipyretics, hydration, and isolation to prevent transmission. Vaccination with the **MMR vaccine** is highly effective in preventing measles [^notfound].

---

Measles is the **most likely viral infection** causing fever, nausea, and vomiting followed by a rash on the face, arms, and upper trunk. Its characteristic prodrome and rash distribution distinguish it from other viral exanthems [^notfound].

A 9-year-old girl presented to her primary care pediatrician via telemedicine during the initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic because of 4 days of warmth perceived by her mother, decreased energy, and a new rash on her upper extremities. After 10 additional days of documented fever > 38°C, worsening fatigue, and 1 day of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, she was allowed to schedule an in-person visit with her pediatrician after testing negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. She appeared ill on arrival to clinic, and her pediatrician recommended evaluation in an emergency department. Her initial laboratory testing revealed nonspecific elevation in several inflammatory markers and leukopenia, and she responded well to intravenous hydration. Over the next 2 weeks, her fever persisted, constitutional symptoms worsened, and she developed progressively painful cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. She was evaluated in clinic by several specialists and eventually was urged to present to the emergency department again, at which time she was admitted to the PICU. After consulting additional specialists and waiting for laboratory results, the team reached a definitive diagnosis and initiated therapy; however, she experienced rapid clinical decline shortly thereafter. The specialists who assisted with identification of the underlying etiology of her symptoms were able to work together to manage the subsequent complications.

### Zika virus outside Africa [^111odssj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Manifestations

The first well-documented report of human ZIKV disease was in 1964 when Simpson described his own occupationally acquired ZIKV illness at age 28. It began with mild headache. The next day, a maculopapular rash covered his face, neck, trunk, and upper arms, and spread to his palms and soles. Transient fever, malaise, and back pain developed. By the evening of the second day of illness he was afebrile, the rash was fading, and he felt better. By day three, he felt well and had only the rash, which disappeared over the next 2 days. ZIKV was isolated from serum collected while he was febrile.

In 1973, Filipe et al. reported laboratory-acquired ZIKV illness in a man with acute onset of fever, headache, and joint pain but no rash. ZIKV was isolated from serum collected on the first day of symptoms; the man's illness resolved in ≈1 week.

Of the 7 ZIKV case-patients in Indonesia described by Olson et al. all had fever, but they were detected by hospital-based surveillance for febrile illness. Other manifestations included anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and dizziness. One patient had conjunctivitis but none had rash. The outbreak on Yap Island was characterized by rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia. Other less frequent manifestations included myalgia, headache, retroorbital pain, edema, and vomiting.

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus for clinicians-epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention [^115u4pEK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The prehemorrhagic phase frequently lasts 1–5 days and is usually characterized by nonspecific symptoms. Those symptoms include sudden onset of fever, which lasts for an average of 4–5 days, and nonspecific signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, dizziness, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Headache occurs in almost 70% of patients and tends to be severe. Two thirds of patients describe the pain as mimicking a migraine crisis, including throbbing and being accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia; half of patients describe the headache as worsening with activity. Characteristically, those patients might also develop upper body (face, neck, and chest) hyperemia, conjunctivitis, and congested sclera. Because of the lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, a high index of suspicion on the basis of a thorough exposure and travel history is essential for recognition.

The hemorrhagic illness phase typically begins 3–5 days after symptom onset and is usually short, lasting 1–3 days. This phase begins with a petechial rash of the skin and mucous membranes and might progress to more severe hemorrhagic features at multiple sites, including ecchymoses; cerebral hemorrhage; bleeding from the nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis and melena), and genitourinary (hematuria) tract; menometrorrhagia; and hemoptysis. Epistaxis is present in < 50% of patients in the hemorrhagic phase, hematemesis in < 35% of patients, hematuria, melena and hematochezia in 10%–20% of patients, and intraabdominal or intracerebral bleeding in 1%–2% of cases. Large ecchymoses are present in 30%–45% of patients, and although they are not pathognomonic, their presence should suggest CCHF over other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and described in up to one third of patients. Severe disease during this phase is often characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, evidence of coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are typically elevated. Renal insufficiency and hypotension are common in severe cases.

### Age-dependent manifestations and case definitions of paediatric zika: a prospective cohort study [^115qq35U]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Background

Paedeatric Zika remains an understudied topic. WHO and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Zika case definitions have not been assessed in children. We aimed to characterise clinical profiles and evaluate the diagnostic performance of the WHO and PAHO case definitions in a large cohort of paediatric Zika cases.

Methods

From January, 2016 to February, 2017, encompassing the major 2016 Zika epidemic, participants in the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (PDCS) in Managua, Nicaragua, were encouraged to visit the study health centre at first indication of any illness. PDCS participants were aged 2–14 years, healthy at enrolment, and recruited before the initiation of the present study. Molecular and serological assays were used to test participants exhibiting any of four broad clinical profiles suspected of resulting from a symptomatic Zika virus infection. These clinical profiles were: fever and at least two of headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, and leukopenia; fever and at least two of nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, and any dengue warning sign; undifferentiated fever without evident cause, with or without any other clinical finding; and afebrile rash with or without any other clinical finding. We characterised acute clinical findings (signs, symptoms, and complete blood counts) in both Zika cases and non-Zika cases.

Findings

We prospectively followed a cohort of about 3700 children, of which 1110 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Four participants with laboratory-confirmed Zika (three co-infections with dengue virus, one missing complete blood count data) and two participants who were non-Zika cases (missing complete blood count data) were excluded from analysis. We analysed 556 laboratory-confirmed Zika and 548 non-Zika cases. The WHO case definition captured 176 confirmed Zika cases, and the PAHO definition 109 confirmed Zika cases, who presented with the most clinical findings and a dengue-like clinical profile. The remaining two thirds of Zika cases, principally characterised by undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash, were missed. Among Zika cases, rash (n = 440)-particularly generalised erythematous rash (n = 334)-fever (n = 333), leukopenia (n = 217), and headache (n = 203) were most common and peaked within 3 days of illness onset. The most common Zika presentation over the first week of illness was rash only (n = 80). The sensitivity of Zika case definitions increased across paediatric age (from 11.3% to 56.1% for the WHO case definition and from 6.0% to 36.6% for the PAHO case definition), as the prevalence of most clinical findings (particularly arthralgia) increased with age, irrespective of previous dengue virus infection. Consequently, Zika manifested differently across paediatric age; older Zika cases presented with a dengue-like clinical profile while younger Zika cases presented with undifferentiated fever or afebrile rash.

Interpretation

We provide the most thorough description of paediatric Zika to date. Most paediatric Zika cases go undetected under the WHO and PAHO case definitions, suggesting that current standards for Zika case ascertainment require revision. Zika manifests with mild but differing clinical profiles across paediatric age, presenting major challenges to diagnosis, surveillance, and efforts to control future Zika epidemics.

### The increasing importance of dengue virus infection in Saudi arabia: a review [^1121EsAU]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 80% of initial dengue virus infections occur without any noticeable symptoms, with fewer than 20% of those infected showing clinical signs. Dengue fever typically manifests as intense headaches, mild fever, skin rashes, muscle and joint discomfort, as well as feelings of nausea and vomiting. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is marked by elevated body temperature, enlarged liver (megalohepatia), instances of bleeding, shock, and frequently, disruptions in cardiovascular function. Initially, DHF was documented as primarily impacting individuals under the age of 15, but subsequent research has revealed its occurrence in adults as well.

Infection with the dengue virus initiates acute febrile syndrome;. Some studies suggest that the dengue virus non-structural protein-1 is found abundantly in a patient's serum, both as a soluble lipoprotein and on cell surfaces, and these elevated levels might be linked to disease severity and play a role in the development of severe dengue in the host;. A single infection with a specific dengue virus serotype can grant long-lasting immunity against that serotype and offer limited cross-protection against different serotypes in the short term. However, it has been observed that a second infection with a different dengue serotype, known as heterotypic secondary dengue viral infection, significantly increases the risk of severe dengue, including the potentially life-threatening conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome;. Moreover, certain clinical symptoms and non-communicable conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes have been recently linked to the severity of dengue infection.

### Ebola virus disease and critical illness [^112b5QD9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation of Ebola virus disease

The clinical presentation of EVD falls along a spectrum ranging from minimally symptomatic infection to severe illness with hemorrhagic complications, shock, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days but may depend on the mode of transmission: 5–7 days following a percutaneous inoculation and a mean of 9 days following direct mucus membrane contact with infected bodily fluids. EVD typically begins with nonspecific initial signs and symptoms including fever, fatigue, weakness, and headache, similar to many infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, often leading to a missed diagnosis and continued transmission. A fleeting maculopapular rash can be seen within the first week. Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea) usually follow 4–6 days after illness onset and can lead to hypovolemia and shock with multisystem organ dysfunction. Gastrointestinal losses and anorexia can precipitate hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Hypoxia and ventilation failure tend to occur with severe illness and may be exacerbated by vascular injury and accompanying large-volume fluid requirements. Serious hemorrhagic complications are relatively rare, while more mild bleeding may occur in approximately 30% of cases. Delirium and encephalopathy or encephalitis may reflect metabolic encephalopathy or direct neuroinvasion and hiccups may be of central or peripheral neurological origin.

Clinical outcomes

While the cumulative case fatality proportion in West Africa is approximately 40% as of May 2016, it has varied substantially during the course of the outbreak (being higher near the beginning). In comparison, the cumulative case fatality proportion for patients treated in Western Europe and the United States during 2014–2015 was 18.5% (Table 2). Case fatality remains highest among young children and older adults. Pregnant women often experience spontaneous abortion followed by bleeding, as well as preterm labor and stillbirth if Ebola virus infection occurs later in pregnancy. Vertical transmission and subsequent neonatal mortality has been virtually uniform in the few documented live births by women with acute EVD. A high Ebola viral load at time of admission is associated with more severe illness and mortality, with other markers of organ dysfunction variably associated with outcomes.

### Zika virus disease comparing children and adults in a dengue-endemic setting [^116M793q]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mosquito-borne viral diseases have rapidly spread globally in the recent years. Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are mosquito-borne viral diseases that have become public health concerns worldwide because of their expanding geographic areas, the potential threat of severe clinical courses in DENV infections, as well as teratogenicity and spectrum of neuro-abnormalities in ZIKV infections.

Both DENV and ZIKV are flaviviruses transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquito species, especially Aedes aegypti, and both share some similar clinical features. The complexity of serological diagnosis due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies among flaviviruses is disadvantageous, and specific molecular testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is needed to confirm infection. Since 2015, ZIKV has attracted global concern because of a large epidemic in Latin America, associated with serious congenital neurological consequences and Guillain–Barre syndrome. It was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO on February 1, 2016and later was announced on November 18, 2016 to be incorporated into the longer term public response.

According to the WHO, DENV is endemic in more than 100 countries, of which countries in the WHO regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific are the most seriously affected. As of July 2, 2019, the WHO reported ZIKV in 148 countries, some of which are also the most DENV-affected countries.

Dengue virus infection manifests with a diverse range of symptoms from mildly undifferentiated fever to severe diseases, although it may be asymptomatic in 70–80% of cases. According to the WHO, the clinical manifestations can be classified as dengue fever (DF) and severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever), and suspected dengue is characterized by high fever accompanied by two of the following symptoms: headache, retrobulbar pain, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue fever has no apparent evidence of plasma leakage and is usually not a severe disease, whereas dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia, which can lead to shock and bleeding.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^113tN6tT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Description of SARS

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4–6 days; most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure. Some evidence suggests that the incubation period may be as long as 14 days in some persons.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (,–). In some patients, headache, myalgia, and malaise precede the onset of fever by up to 1 day, and fever may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms appear. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2–7 days after illness onset, although they are among the initial symptoms in up to 30% of patients (,–). The most common respiratory complaints are lower respiratory tract symptoms, including nonproductive cough and dyspnea; productive cough is reported in up to 25% of patients (,–). In some series, < 10% of patients reported upper respiratory complaints, but in others the reported prevalence of rhinorrhea or sore throat is as high as 25% among patients with SARS. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms has varied by report, but nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of these symptoms has been reported in up to 25% of patients with SARS at the time of initial evaluation. In one series, diarrhea developed in 73% of patients at some point in the course of illness. Fever and diarrhea have been the dominant initial symptoms in some patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon.

Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure may not have typical symptoms of SARS. For patients in this group who have strong epidemiologic risk factors for SARS, the diagnosis should be considered in almost any change in health status, even if the patients do not exhibit typical clinical features.

Physical Findings

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia have been reported in 40% to 75% of patients upon admission to the hospital (,–) but may be less common in patients who are evaluated earlier in the course of illness as outpatients. Upon auscultation of the lungs, rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series, and less commonly in others. Some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. As many as 15%–44% of patients may have a normal measured body temperature when first evaluated.

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Autochthonous dengue outbreak, paris region, France, September-October 2023 [^114ZBA8j]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The Study

On September 13, 2023, a 36-year-old woman from Limeil-Brévannes, a city 15 km south of Paris, who had no consistent medical history started having symptoms of fever (> 38°C), malaise, and headache. Her 7-year-old son experienced the same symptoms during September 11–13 and had a maculopapular rash that disappeared 5 days after the onset. Also, the woman's partner had symptoms begin on September 14 and had a fever (> 38°C), chills, frontal headache, myalgia, a papular rash, and itching on the trunk and upper limbs. The case-patients reported no travel abroad or to other regions of France.

On September 19, the woman continued to be feverish daily and began to have nausea and vomiting. She consulted the emergency department of Hôpital Henri Mondor, Créteil, south of Paris, where blood tests were performed. Tests revealed thrombocytopenia (105,000 cells/μL; reference range 150,000–450,000 cells/μL), leukopenia (700/μL; reference range 1,000–4,000 U/L), and increased alanine aminotransferase (213 U/L; reference range < 35 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (266 U/L; reference range < 35 U/L), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (135 U/L; reference range < 40 U/L). C-reactive protein was 2.4 mg/L (reference range < 5 mg/L). Major and common causes of viral hepatitis were excluded, and serologic tests for hepatitis A–C, HIV, and cytomegalovirus were negatives. Epstein-Barr virus serology was compatible with a previous infection.

### Efavirenz [^111iykjo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- your urine turns dark
- you feel sick to your stomach (nausea)

- your bowel movements (stools) turn light in color
- you have lower stomach area (abdominal) pain

- Seizures can happen in people who take efavirenz. Seizures are more likely to happen if you have had seizures in the past. Tell your doctor if you have had a seizure or if you take a medicine to help prevent seizures.

- Changes in your immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome) can happen when you start taking HIV-1 medicines. Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your doctor if you start having new symptoms after starting your HIV-1 medicine.

- Changes in body fat can happen in people who take HIV-1 medicine. These changes may include increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck ("buffalo hump"), breast, and around the main part of your body (trunk). Loss of fat from the legs, arms, and face may also happen. The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known.

The most common side effects of efavirenz tablets include:

- rash
- abnormal dreams

- dizziness
- tiredness

- nausea
- trouble sleeping

- headache
- vomiting

- difficulty concentrating

Some patients taking efavirenz have experienced increased levels of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

### Clinical features of Marburg virus disease: a review of all reported patients since 1967 [^113gUfL1]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The review of clinical descriptions from 18 outbreaks confirms that MVD most often begins with general, non-specific symptoms that are difficult to distinguish from other endemic febrile illnesses. Given the nonspecific nature of its initial presentation, early recognition and diagnosis are inherently challenging, especially in remote and resource-limited settings.,

The most frequently reported symptoms were general systemic signs such as fever, fatigue, headache, and myalgia, occurring in over half of the reported cases. Fever was present in over 90% of patients, making it a consistent feature of the disease, although not a discriminating one. These early symptoms closely resemble those of other common diseases in endemic areas, including malaria, typhoid fever, and various arboviral infections. As a result, reliance on general symptoms alone is unlikely to be sufficient for the timely identification of MVD, especially during the early stages of an outbreak or in the absence of known epidemiological links.

Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most prevalent syndromic presentation, with nausea or vomiting and diarrhea reported in more than half of patients. Abdominal pain was also common. These symptoms are often present early in the disease course and may precede more specific signs, such as hemorrhagic manifestations. Importantly, gastrointestinal involvement has been observed consistently across most outbreaks, though notable variation was seen. For example, during the 2004–2005 outbreak in Angola, gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in only about one-third of patients, a finding that may reflect differences in data collection, disease evolution, or access to care. The high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms highlights the importance of considering MVD in patients presenting with febrile illness and significant digestive involvement, particularly in outbreak-prone areas or among exposed individuals.

### Recurrent fever and rash [^115m3F1V]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Periodic fever is uncommon in children. The differential diagnosis is large, even though associated symptoms such as rash may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Atypical presentations require thoughtful evaluation. This article describes a case of a 4-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with recurrent fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgias, and rash. His hospital course is described along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of tumor necrosis receptor-1 alpha periodic syndrome.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Monitoring for adverse events related to treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in persons with HIV — individuals receiving self-administered daily chemoprophylaxis should be seen monthly to assess adherence and toxicity, and generally a clinician should not prescribe > 1 month's supply of drugs; it is recommended that persons with HIV have serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin measured before starting LTBI and repeated if abnormal, and persons with concomitant chronic viral hepatitis should be monitored closely when treated for LTBI. With isoniazid, liver enzymes typically increase in the first 3 months but return to normal despite continued therapy; if serum aminotransferase levels increase to greater than five times the upper limit of normal without symptoms or greater than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms (or greater than two times the upper limit of normal among patients with baseline abnormal transaminases), chemoprophylaxis should be stopped. At each visit, patients should be asked about potential adverse effects (including unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesia of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever lasting 3 or more days, abdominal tenderness, easy bruising or bleeding, and arthralgia) and told to immediately stop medications and return to the clinic for an assessment should any occur; factors that increase the risk of clinical hepatitis include daily alcohol consumption, underlying liver disease, and concurrent treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs; the decision to resume therapy should be made after weighing hepatic risk versus benefit and in consultation with an expert in treating LTBI in persons with HIV infection.

### Clinical characteristics of children and young people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in United kingdom: prospective multicentre observational cohort study [^116x2bVn]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Symptoms

The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%; 431/617), cough (39%; 233/599), nausea/vomiting (32%; 179/564), and shortness of breath (30%; 173/570) (fig 1). Fever and rhinorrhoea were less common with increasing age; however, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and sore throat showed an increasing trend with age (supplementary figure D). A heatmap and dendrogram of presenting symptoms showed three distinct clusters of clinical phenotypes (fig 2). These comprised most commonly a discrete respiratory illness (green cluster) of cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose, lower chest wall indrawing, and wheeze, with clustering of both upper and lower respiratory symptoms together. Next was a cluster representing a systemic mucocutaneous-enteric illness (purple cluster) of headache, myalgia, sore throat, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, rash, lymphadenopathy, and conjunctivitis. Finally, we observed a rarer neurological cluster of seizures and confusion (red cluster). The systemic mucocutaneous-enteric cluster includes the symptoms specified in the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C ("muco-cutaneous inflammation" and "acute gastrointestinal problems"), in addition to sore throat, myalgia, headache, and fatigue. The two main clusters "respiratory" and "systemic mucocutaneous-enteric" were not entirely dichotomous. Minor overlap occurred between a sub-cluster of "fever, cough, and shortness of breath" and a sub-cluster of "vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, and rash" but very little overlap with "runny nose, wheeze, and lower chest wall indrawing".

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116T8M3k]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — HSR from ABC, with or without skin involvement and excluding SJS/TEN, has onset with first use within first 6 weeks of initiating ABC and with reintroduction within hours of initiating ABC, and presentation includes symptoms such as high fever, diffuse skin rash, malaise, nausea, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea). Estimated frequency is < 1% to 9% (varies by ethnicity). Risk factors include HLA-B✱5701, and HSR is very uncommon in people who are HLA-B✱5701 negative; the prevalence of HLA-B✱5701 is generally lower in people from Africa and East Asia. Prevention and monitoring directives are: Screen for HLA-B✱5701. ABC should not be prescribed if HLA-B✱5701 is present. The medical record should clearly indicate that ABC is contraindicated in these patients. When starting ABC, counsel patients and families about the signs and symptoms of HSR to ensure prompt reporting of reactions. Management guidance is: Discontinue all ARV drugs and investigate other causes of the symptoms (e.g., a concurrent viral illness). Provide symptomatic treatment. Most symptoms resolve within 48 hours after discontinuing ABC. Do not rechallenge with ABC even if the patient is HLA-B✱5701 negative.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include largely minimal or absent symptoms during acute and chronic phases, laboratory-only abnormalities, and risks for progressive liver disease. Both acute and chronic HCV infections are usually minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, and fewer than 20% of patients with acute infection have characteristic symptoms such as low-grade fever, mild right-upper-quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dark urine, and jaundice; unexplained elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may be the only laboratory finding. Recognition of acute HCV infection with new-onset liver enzyme elevations is clinically important since treatment during the early phases of infection is more efficacious than during the chronic phase; over time, cirrhosis develops in approximately 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection within 20 years after infection, with risk factors including older age at infection, male sex, obesity, and concomitant alcohol use, and HIV coinfection adversely affects the course of HCV infection.

### Clinical manifestations of dengue in children and adults in a hyperendemic region of Colombia [^1132pd48]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of dengue typically occur 5–7 days after infection, with severe dengue occurring in some cases. Diagnosis primarily hinges on a distinct fever lasting less than a week, absence of upper respiratory symptoms, and at least two of the following: headache and/or pain behind the eyes, general discomfort, muscle or joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting, skin rash, petechiae, a positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver enzymes. These symptoms vary between children and adults.

Previous research indicates that adults with dengue often suffer from myalgia, retro-orbital pain, nausea, and arthralgia, whereas children tend to exhibit vomiting and rashes. Rapid progression to severe dengue, marked by vascular leakage in children and bleeding in adults, differs between age groups. Notably, febrile and gastrointestinal symptoms in Bangladeshi children and hepatomegaly and fatigue in Thai infants were observed. Yet, the distinction between pediatric and adult symptoms remains vague. With dengue's rise in Latin American children, the need for targeted health interventions has become critical in reducing school absenteeism, hospitalizations, and potential increases in child mortality.

Dengue may be challenging to recognize because of its undifferentiated presentation, with symptoms that are similar to those of other viral illnesses, making differentiation especially difficult in children, who have high exposure to febrile diseases. In addition, given the absence of specific treatments for dengue, early detection of disease is essential. The need to identify clear warning signs for early and effective medical response is paramount. In effect, our study aimed to differentiate the signs and symptoms (clinical and hematological) between individuals under 12 years and those 12 years and older in an endemic Colombian region.

Pathophysiology and clinical disease

Following the bite of an OROV-infected midge or mosquito –, there is a 3–8-day incubation period before disease onset –. The patient from whom the virus was first isolated (Melajo Forest, Trinidad, 1955) reported symptoms that included fever, backache, and cough without a sore throat in an illness that lasted three days with no recurring symptoms. In subsequent documented cases, the symptom most commonly reported during acute disease is fever (~39 °C), which is frequently accompanied by headache/retro-orbital pain, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, and photo-phobia. Less frequent symptoms include a rubella-like rash, meningitis, encephalitis, dizziness, anorexia, and other systemic manifestations. Hemorrhagic phenomena such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and petechiae, or gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea are even more infrequent.

During the acute disease, patients experience viremia that peaks on day 2 after the onset of clinical symptoms and decreases over the next several days. Elevated liver enzymes and leukopenia (values as low as 2000 leukocytes/mL) also occur. In most people, the acute disease is relatively short, lasting from 2 to 7 days but in some, particularly those who experience central nervous system involvement (meningitis and encephalitis), the disease can last for 2–4 weeks and may include loss of strength (asthenia).

In approximately 60% of clinical cases, the disease recurs after the patient becomes afebrile (normally within 2–10 days but occasionally up to a month). Recurrence is associated with a range of symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, asthenia, dizziness, and meningitis. The mechanisms responsible for the recurring disease remain undefined. Once the patient finally recovers, there are no reported long-term sequelae or reports of additional recurrence events at a later date and, although the disease can be severe, no cases of human fatality have been reported. Currently, it is unclear whether certain OROV genotypes are more likely to produce more severe or unusual symptoms.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^116rXd2r]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Disease transmission and symptoms

The first evidence showed that TF, as the HFMD, is a very contagious disease transmitted by close contact making under-five children a particular group at risk. Infants can be infected mainly through nappies or if they touch unclean surfaces or put infected objects directly into the mouth.

The main symptoms of TF are described as high fever, intense arthralgias with sometimes joint swelling, and a rash localized in the mouth (tongue, gums, inside of the cheek), palms, and soles. Doctors now report some atypical localization of the lesions; they can also be found on the buttocks or even the shedding of nails. The lesions are described as red, painful, growing blisters.

Additional symptoms like many viral infections include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, body aches, and influenza-like symptoms. The symptoms may have different presentations or intensity from one child to another, as illustrated by the two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom a week after returning from a trip to Kerala. The two siblings, a five-year-old boy and a 13-month-old girl presented a vesicular rash without fever or other systemic symptoms. The girl's rash was more florid, and she gave two days after painful oral lesions while his brother was in a healing process. After six days, the boy's lesion completely healed without scarring, while his sister had to wait until 16 days for the same result. The Enterovirus PCR was positive for both children, and the EV typing by sequencing showed Coxsackie A-16, another finding in favor of the likeliness of the tomato flu as an atypical presentation of the HFMD.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Interferon-α (IFN-α) adverse effects in children — approximately 5% require treatment discontinuation; influenza-like symptoms comprising fever, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are seen in 80% of patients during the first month of therapy, and these side effects decrease substantially during the first 4 months of therapy. Subtle personality changes, which resolve when therapy is discontinued, have been reported in 42% of children. Neutropenia, which resolves after discontinuation of therapy, is the most common laboratory abnormality; anemia and thrombocytopenia are less common, and additional reported effects include abnormalities in thyroid function, loss of appetite with transient weight loss and impaired height growth that usually resolves after completion of therapy, epistaxis, transient mild alopecia, and antinuclear auto-antibodies.

Abacavir (ABC) major toxicities — More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, anorexia. Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) have been observed in approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving ABC, and HSRs generally occur during the first 6 weeks of therapy but have also been reported after a single dose of ABC. The risk of an ABC HSR is associated with the presence of the HLA-B✱5701 allele, and the risk is greatly reduced by not using ABC in those who test positive for the HLA-B✱5701 allele. The HSR to ABC is a multiorgan clinical syndrome usually characterized by rash, or signs or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: fever; constitutional symptoms, including malaise, fatigue, or achiness; gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; respiratory signs and symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis; and laboratory and radiologic abnormalities, including elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis — including fatal cases — also have been reported, and pancreatitis with laboratory abnormalities can occur. If an HSR is suspected, ABC should be stopped immediately and not restarted because hypotension and death may occur upon rechallenge. Rare: Increased levels of liver enzymes, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated triglycerides have been reported, and pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis — including fatal cases — have been reported.

### Severe rift valley fever may present with a characteristic clinical syndrome [^112GDPyT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is an emerging pathogen that is transmitted in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Egypt, and the Arabian peninsula. Outbreaks of RVF, like other diseases caused by hemorrhagic fever viruses, typically present in locations with very limited health resources, where initial diagnosis must be based only on history and physical examination. Although general signs and symptoms of human RVF have been documented, a specific clinical syndrome has not been described. In 2007, a Kenyan outbreak of RVF provided opportunity to assess acutely ill RVF patients and better delineate its presentation and clinical course. Our data reveal an identifiable clinical syndrome suggestive of severe RVF, characterized by fever, large-joint arthralgia, and gastrointestinal complaints and later followed by jaundice, right upper-quadrant pain, and delirium, often coinciding with hemorrhagic manifestations. Further characterization of a distinct RVF clinical syndrome will aid earlier detection of RVF outbreaks and should allow more rapid implementation of control.

5 Pathophysiology and clinical disease

After being bitten by an OROV-infected midge or mosquito, a 3–8-day incubation period precedes the onset of the disease. The patient, from whom the virus was first isolated (Melajo Forest, Trinidad, 1955), reported symptoms such as fever, backache, and cough without a sore throat in an illness that lasted three days with no recurring symptoms. In subsequently documented cases, the most commonly reported symptom during acute disease is fever (∼39 °C), often accompanied by headache/retro-orbital pain, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, and photo-phobia. Less frequent symptoms encompass a rubella-like rash, meningitis, encephalitis, dizziness, anorexia, and other systemic manifestations. Hemorrhagic phenomena, such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, and petechiae, or gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, are even more infrequent.

During the acute disease, viremia peaks on day 2 after the onset of clinical symptoms and gradually decreases over the next several days31. Elevated liver enzymes and leukopenia (values as low as 2000 leukocytes/mL) also manifest. In most individuals, the acute disease is relatively short, lasting from 2 to 7 days, but in some, particularly those with central nervous system involvement (meningitis and encephalitis), the disease can persist for 2–4 weeks and may include asthenia (loss of strength).

Recurrence is associated with a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, myalgia, asthenia, dizziness, and meningitis. The mechanisms responsible for the recurring disease remain undefined. Once the patient eventually recovers, there are no reported long-term sequelae or accounts of additional recurrence events at a later date, and, although the disease can be severe, no cases of human fatality have been reported. Currently, it is unclear whether certain OROV genotypes are more likely to produce more severe or unusual symptoms.

### Family cluster of mayaro fever, Venezuela [^117ASDY2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Of note, convalescent-phase serum samples from an additional unrelated patient (a 40-year-old woman who lived in a nearby rural location), obtained approximately 4 months after she had recovered from a self-limited febrile illness with polyarthritis similar to that described in the patients involved in this report, showed high (25,600) MAYV IgG antibody titers. These samples were negative for IgM antibody, however, which provides further evidence that MAYV was enzootic in the area.

As observed in this study, Mayaro fever cases are usually sporadic and occur in persons with a history of recent activities in humid tropical forests. Typically, Mayaro fever ensues approximately 1 week after infection. However, shorter incubation periods, similar to those observed in these Venezuelan cases, are occasionally observed. Members of the family described in this outbreak had symptoms and clinical courses consistent with previously documented MAYV patients. Abrupt onset of fever, frontal headaches, myalgias, and incapacitating arthralgias were predominant complaints. A maculopapular rash, also a common manifestation in up to 90% of children and 50% of adults, was prominent in these patients, lasting 2 days and followed by desquamation. Up to one third of patients initially have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but these symptoms were not experienced in this family.

Little information is available on the kinetics of MAYV IgM antibodies for Mayaro fever patients during long-term follow-up examinations. While obtaining acute-phase blood samples from the patients in this study was bit possible, existing data indicate that detectable IgM antibody develops after viremia subsides, which is usually 4–5 days after the onset of symptoms. Our data indicated that IgM antibody persisted for > 3 but < 6 months for our patients. These are the first documented data on the persistence of IgM antibody following a Mayaro viral infection and will be useful for interpreting diagnostic test results. To our knowledge, this is the first report of human cases of MAYF in Venezuela and, therefore, further documents the public health importance of this disease.

TABLE 1
Demographic and behavioral characteristics.

Medical history, symptoms, and signs of the patients were shown in Table 2. Only 17 (9.6%) patients reported a history of smallpox vaccination, whereas no difference was observed between smallpox vaccination and clinical outcomes. Hundred and seven patients had at least one co‐morbid other sexually transmitted infection, the most common being syphilis, followed by gonorrhea. Fourteen patients had a self‐reported history of allergy, nine of whom were drug allergies. Skin rash was the most common symptom or sign (Figure 1A). There were 278 patients (97.2%) with a typical rash, and no significant difference was found between HIV‐negative and HIV‐positive patients. The most common sites of rash were groin/perineum/perianal, limbs, trunk, head/face/neck, palms, and soles in order, and the most common types of rash were vesicles or pustules, maculopapular rash, and ulcers in order. The majority of patients (45.0%) had < 5 lesions. In addition to the rash, the remaining commonly observed symptoms or signs were fever (70.0%), lymphadenopathy (45.4%), anal and perianal pain (17.8%), fatigue (17.3%), myalgia (15.6%), headache (13.6%), skin pruritus (11.3%), genital swelling/pain (9.7%), sore throat (9.1%), diarrhea (7.1%), nausea and vomiting (3.5%), cough (2.6%), night sweats (2.3%), mouth ulcers (1.9%), conjunctivitis (0.8%). The proportion of anal and perianal pain was significantly higher in HIV‐positive patients than in HIV‐negative patients (23.4% vs. 11.2%; OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.21–4.85, χ² = 6.44, p = 0.011). Other symptoms or signs did not differ significantly. In addition, 53 (21.3%) patients reported complications, including anal and perianal lesions, perineal and genital infections, cellulitis, gastrointestinal obstruction, and esophagitis (Figure 1B). Skin sequelae occurred in only 2 (2.0%) patients.

Acute HBV infection is asymptomatic in approximately 70% and < 1% develop fulminant hepatic failure; when symptoms manifest, they may include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and arthralgias with or without jaundice. Most people with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue. Between 15% and 40% of people with chronic HBV infection will eventually develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or liver failure, and up to 25% of people will die prematurely from complications of chronic HBV infection.

### Addressing the risk of monkeypox exposure during gastrointestinal endoscopy [^112onHpP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics of MPV infection

The classical presentation of MPV mirrors that of smallpox, characterized by a febrile prodrome associated with mucocutaneous and systematic features (i.e. fever, lethargy, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, and headache). After the prodrome, skin lesions begin in the mouth, and spread to the face, trunk, and extremities. In the current outbreak, the clinical presentation has distinctive features: in 528 MPV infections from 16 countries, the initial lesions were limited primarily to the anogenital region, with later spread to the body, limbs and face (Fig. 1). Interestingly, most persons infected with MPV had fewer than 10 skin lesions, which can delay diagnosis. Anorectal lesions can be associated with rectal pain, proctitis, tenesmus, and diarrhea. Notably, in the current outbreak, systemic prodromal symptoms may occur only after anogenital or mucosal lesions develop. Thus, gastroenterology consultation may be sought before MPV is diagnosed, an important consideration for those referred for upper or lower endoscopy.

The median duration from exposure to symptoms is 7 days, and PCR data suggest mucocutaneous lesions may contain viable MPV particles for up to 21 days after symptom onset. Over 14–21 days after their initial appearance, skin lesions that began as macules progress to papular, vesicular, and pustular lesions before crusting scabs are shed (Fig. 1).

### Viral exanthems [^112uGnjz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the United States. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases.

Summary

Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

### Safety netting versus overtreatment in paediatrics: viral infection or incomplete Kawasaki disease? [^115eEyDc]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of childhood identified initially in Japan in the 1960s. Incidence of KD in children aged 5 and under varies worldwide from 4.9 per 100 000 children in Denmark to 211 or more in Japan or those of Japanese descent. The exact aetiology of KD remains unknown. It is of major concern as 10%–25% of confirmed untreated cases may develop coronary aneurysms and have increased risk of myocardial ischaemia, infarction and sudden death. A subset of incomplete cases who do not meet all established criteria for KD are also recognised in the literature to be at equivalent risk of serious sequelae and are more likely to go untreated. This recognition failure leading to treatment delay increases the risk of immediate and delayed coronary artery aneurysm, which is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. The following case of intermittent prolonged fever and rash in a 4-year-old boy illustrates the difficulty clinicians face to treat prophylactically when a common presentation of upper respiratory tract infection partially fulfils the diagnostic criteria for a more severe illness such as incomplete KD (iKD).

### Molecular mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [^116wPPH3]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical picture of SARS

The mean incubation period of SARS was estimated to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval, 5.2 to 7.7). The mean reported time from the onset of clinical symptoms to the hospital admission varied between three and five days.

Main clinical features of the disease are in the initial period common symptoms such as persistent fever, myalgia, chills, dry cough, dizziness, and headache. Further, although less common symptoms are sore throat, sputum production, coryza, vomiting or nausea, and diarrhea. Special attention has been paid to the symptom of diarrhea: Watery diarrhea has also been reported in a subgroup of patients one week after the initial symptoms.

The clinical course of the disease seems to follow a bi- or triphasic pattern. In the first phase viral replication and an increasing viral load, fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms can be found. These symptoms generally improve after a few days. In the second phase representing an immunopathologic imbalance, major clinical findings are oxygen desaturation, a recurrence of fever, and clinical and radiological progression of acute pneumonia. This second phase is concomitant with a fall in the viral load. The majority of patients is known to respond in the second phase to treatment. However, about 20% of patients may progress to the third and critical phase. This phase is characterized by the development of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly necessitating mechanical ventilation.

### Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19: a systematic review [^117NfTfw]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an unprecedented global public health challenge, leading to thousands of deaths every day worldwide. Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19.

Methods

The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and April 6th 2020. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria were (a) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (b) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (c) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, or radiological examinations.

Results

A total of 38 studies (1124 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1117 had their severity classified: 14.2% were asymptomatic, 36.3% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.1% were severe, and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (47.5%), followed by cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%), and nausea/vomiting (7.1%). One hundred forty-five (36.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (10.9%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count was reported in 12.9% of cases. Abnormalities in computed tomography were reported in 63.0% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows, and consolidations. Only one death was reported.

Conclusions

Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adult cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children.

### Characteristics of the rash associated with west nile virus fever [^114xpsGM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We characterized rash in 15 patients with West Nile virus (WNV) fever. Generalized, maculopapular rash typically occurred on days 5–12 of illness. Dysesthesia was reported by 27% of patients, and pruritus by 33% of patients. Because the rash was nonspecific and serologic test results were often negative for WNV at presentation, convalescent-phase testing was frequently required to diagnose WNV fever.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^111CfZDr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV infection — nevirapine (NVP) rash and hypersensitivity reactions: Onset "occurs most frequently in the first few weeks of therapy but can occur through 18 weeks" and presentation comprises "flu-like symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, myalgia, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice) with or without skin rash that may progress to hepatic failure with encephalopathy". Frequency is reported as "Occurs in 4% of patients on average, with a range of 2.5% to 11%". Risk factors in adults include "ARV-naive with a higher CD4 count (> 250 cells/mm³ in women; > 400 cells/mm³ in men)", "Female sex (risk is threefold higher in females than in males)", and "Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection", while in children "NVP hepatotoxicity and HSR are less common in prepubertal children than in adults, and both are uncommon in infants". When Starting NVP or Restarting NVP After Interruptions of > 14 Days, "A 2-week lead-in period with once-daily dosing, followed by dose escalation to twice daily as recommended, may reduce the risk of reaction" and "This may not be necessary in children aged < 2 years", and "Counsel families about signs and symptoms of HSR to ensure prompt reporting of reactions". Management states: "Discontinue all ARV drugs", "Consider other causes of hepatitis and discontinue all hepatotoxic medications", "Provide supportive care as indicated and monitor the patient closely", "Do not reintroduce NVP", and "It is unclear whether it is safe to use other NNRTIs after a patient experiences symptomatic hepatitis due to NVP, and many experts would avoid the NNRTI drug class when restarting treatment".

### Chikungunya infection in travelers [^116K57C9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Fever and joint pain were noted in all patients. The median duration of fever was 4 days (range 2–7 days), and joint pain was mainly distal and symmetric, involving wrist (18 patients, 81%), ankles (17 cases, 77%), phalanx (16 patients, 73%), knees (14 patients, 64%), and elbows and shoulders (4 patients each, 18%). The other extradermatologic signs were asthenia in 17 patients (77%), headache in 13 (59%), muscle pain in 12 (55%), swelling in 10 (45%), peripheral lymphadenopathy in 9 (41%), bleeding from the nose or gums in 4 (18%), nausea or vomiting in 3 (14%), and eyesight trouble in 1 (4%). In the 6 patients seen during the first week of symptoms (acutely ill patients), lymphopenia was present in 67%, thrombocytopenia in 50%, and increase of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase in 67%.

Skin manifestations occurred in 17 patients (77%). Because skin eruption occurs during the first week of the disease, however, only 6 (27%) patients with these signs were seen at the time of consultation. All 6 had a generalized exanthema consisting of noncoalescent macular or papular lesions (Figure). The elementary cutaneous element was an erythematous macule in 5 patients and maculopapules in 1. The number of macules was > 50, and the anatomic location of the rash was abdomen, thorax, back, and limbs. No lesions were seen on the face; palms and soles were involved in 3 patients. Islands of normal skin were seen in 5 patients. An aphthoid lesion was seen in 1 patient. Pruritus of the skin or a burning sensation was reported in 3 patients. Bleeding from the nose or gum, purpura, petechiae, ecchymosis, and bullous lesions were not observed. Erythema followed the onset of fever by 1 to 2 days, lasted 3–7 days, and disappeared without scaling in all cases, regardless of the patient's skin color.

### Morbilliform eruptions: differentiating low-risk drug eruptions, severe cutaneous adverse reactions, viral eruptions, and acute graft-versus-host disease [^114HdsfZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral exanthems typically involve similar locations to high-risk drug eruptions, including involvement of the hands, feet, face, and buttocks. Features, including brighter erythema and less pruritus, are typically associated with viral eruptions but can be difficult to quantify. The primary differentiator of viral and drug eruptions is typically location, with acral, facial, and gluteal involvement all associated with viral eruptions. Seasonality should also be considered; viral eruptions more commonly occur in the spring and summer. Finally, systemic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, cough, headache, irritability, and vomiting are more frequently seen in viral eruptions, but can precede the rash by weeks.

Once a high-risk identification has been made and after evaluating for potential SCARs, evaluation of viral causes should be considered. Additional workup should be tailored on the basis of clinical suspicion. For instance, a respiratory panel should be ordered if upper respiratory tract infection symptoms are present. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis warrant specific testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Arthralgias should prompt workup for parvovirus B19 and, in patients with the appropriate travel history, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Chikungunya virus. Acral and oral involvement should raise suspicion for enterovirus, coxsackievirus, and echovirus. Finally, those who are underimmunized or unimmunized should be tested for measles and rubella viruses. Viral testing is of particular importance if the virus in question, such as HIV, affects patient outcomes. Other laboratory values, such as skin or serum cytokines, are not clinically useful to differentiate viral from other causes of drug eruptions at this time. Because the histopathology of viral eruptions can be nonspecific, skin biopsy is unlikely to be beneficial.

Abacavir — hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and HLA-B✱5701 guidance states that HSRs can be fatal and usually occur during the first few weeks of therapy, with symptoms that may include fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, malaise or fatigue, loss of appetite, and respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. To predict the risk of HSRs, test patients for the HLA-B✱5701 allele before starting therapy; patients who test positive for the HLA-B✱5701 allele should not be given ABC, and patients with no prior HLA-B✱5701 testing who are tolerating ABC do not need to be tested.

Case details

An 11-year-old Chinese girl with a history of exogenous obesity presented initially with 2-days of a generalized pruritic rash preceded by 4 days of diarrhea and vomiting. On examination, disseminated non-follicular pinhead-sized pustules were seen over the trunk and limbs on a background of oedematous erythema (Fig 1) with no mucosal involvement. Investigations revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers, though her renal and liver functions were normal. No infectious organism was isolated. Drug history was unrevealing for new medications. She was diagnosed clinically with AGEP triggered by gastroenteritis of possible viral origin and was treated with mometasone furoate 0.1% lotion and emollients. She made an uneventful recovery with collarette desquamation in 2 weeks. The patient experienced second similar pustular eruption 11 months later over her face and trunk 1-day after the ingestion of dimenhydrinate for motion-sickness while on a vacation. The rash resolved with cessation of the drug without further intervention within 7 days. A third episode occurred 3 months after the second, where she presented again with a similar cutaneous eruption over the face, neck, limbs and trunk, preceded by rhinorrhea and fever for 1 week. Enterovirus/Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were isolated from a respiratory swab and no new medication was ingested during this period. A fourth episode occurred 5 months later again preceded by Enterovirus/Rhinovirus swab-positive upper respiratory tract symptoms for 2 weeks prior and the intake of diphenhydramine, tripolidine, and pseudoephedrine 1day prior to the onset of her rash. As her fourth episode was more temporally related with her drug intake, Diphenhydramine was deemed the likely causative agent, rather than a parainfectious trigger. This was further supported by the patient's previous history of AGEP from dimenhydrinate, which is metabolized into the active ingredient diphenhydramine for antiemetic efficacy. The clinical features of each episode are highlighted in Table I. She was diagnosed with recurrent AGEP – 2 episodes triggered by infections and 2 episodes triggered by drugs (dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine) within the span of 2 years. In all 4 episodes, the patient made an uneventful recovery with topical steroids and emollients, with postpustular desquamation observed by 14 days in all 4 episodes. She was symptom-free between episodes.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^112LwugA]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Natural history and clinical manifestations of infectious mononucleosis — Humans are the only source of this infection, and transmission occurs primarily through oral secretions. The incubation period is long (30–50 days). Many have a prodrome of malaise and headache, and fever (rarely > 104°F, > 40°C) can last up to 3 weeks. Typical findings include pharyngitis in ~80%, splenomegaly in 50%-100%, palatal petechiae in ~25%, and a rash on the trunk and upper arms in ~10%-40%. Exudative pharyngitis and tonsillar enlargement can cause airway compromise, while jaundice, central nervous system complications, and myocarditis are rare. Rash is significantly more common if the patient has been treated with ampicillin or amoxicillin, symptoms usually resolve in 4–8 weeks, and occasionally patients present with periorbital edema.

Initial approach to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia

Clinical presentation and initial laboratory findings

Fever has been reported with variable incidence among case series, ranging between 43 and 98% of the patients, hence the absence of fever does not exclude COVID-19 infection. Cough is the second most common symptom (59–72%), followed by myalgia (15%) and fatigue (23%). Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) has been reported in 10% of the patients usually preceding the onset of fever and dyspnea. ARDS has been described to be present in 17–41% of these patients, with a median time from first symptom to progression to ARDS of 8 days.

In regard to initial laboratory findings, white blood cell count tends to be normal and lymphopenia is present in 80% of the patients. CRP has been found to be consistently elevated in patients with COVID-19 infection and shares an inverse relationship with oxygen requirement levels, and may be used for mortality prognostication. Other prognostic laboratory values sharing a direct relationship with mortality in COVID-19 infection are IL-6, LDH and serum ferritin and D-dimer. Procalcitonin levels are moderately elevated in these patients and have not been consistently associated to predict mortality of the disease. In addition to the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19, routine blood cultures and viral panel should be sent to rule out the presence of any other microorganism as a main culprit or as co-infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115fQRF5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) treatment monitoring in people with HIV — evaluation, laboratory checks, risk factors, stopping thresholds, and consultation — are specified as follows: individuals receiving TB-preventive therapy should be evaluated by a clinician monthly, and people with HIV should have aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin measured before starting LTBI and repeated if abnormal, with closer monitoring for those with concomitant chronic viral hepatitis or older age. Following initiation of isoniazid, ALT and AST often increase during the first 3 months but typically return to normal despite continued therapy. Factors that increase the risk of drug-induced clinical hepatitis include daily alcohol consumption, underlying liver disease, pregnancy and early postpartum, and concurrent treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs. At each visit, patients should be asked about adherence, new medications, and alcohol use, screened for adverse effects including unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesia of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever lasting 3 or more days, abdominal tenderness, easy bruising or bleeding, and arthralgia, and told to stop medications immediately and return for assessment if any occur (AIII). LTBI therapy should be stopped (AIII) if ALT or AST rise to greater than five times the upper limit of normal without symptoms, greater than three times the upper limit of normal AND total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal without symptoms, or greater than three times the upper limit of normal with symptoms (or greater than two times the baseline value for patients with baseline abnormal transaminases). Decisions about resuming therapy should weigh hepatic risk versus TB prevention benefit and ideally involve consultation with an expert in treating LTBI in people with HIV; if a local expert is not available, clinicians can contact the CDC (tbinfo@cdc.gov) to utilize remote TB medical consultation services through the CDC-funded TB Center of Excellence.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) clinical manifestations in children — most acute HBV infections in children are asymptomatic, though prodromal lethargy, malaise, fatigue, nausea, and anorexia can occur, followed by jaundice and right‑upper‑quadrant pain; Gianotti‑Crosti syndrome and other rashes may be seen, and extrahepatic immune‑complex manifestations in HIV‑infected children include arthralgias, arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, thrombocytopenia, and glomerulonephritis, with rare cases of acute hepatic failure during perinatal and childhood HBV infection. Most children with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic; one quarter of infants and children with chronic HBV eventually will develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, typically over 2 to 3 decades, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma correlates with HBV DNA levels and duration of infection, with the highest risk in people infected in early life; children infected perinatally may remain immunotolerant for a decade or more.

Introduction: DRESS syndrome is a rare but serious complication to a variety of drugs. Symptoms of DRESS syndrome includes fever, cutaneous and mucosal involvement, lymphadenopathy, visceral organ involvement especially liver but also renal, cardiac and pulmonary involvement. The syndrome is characterized by hematologic abnormalities (eosinophilia, mononucleosis-like atypical lymphocytes), and viral reactivation. The symptoms develop 2–8 weeks after exposure to the drug.

Objectives: A case of DRESS syndrome in a 16-year-old girl diagnosed with JIA triggered by Salazopyrine is presented to increase the awareness of the syndrome.

Methods: Case-report

Results: Salazopyrine was prescribed to a 16-year-old girl with JIA, due to former adverse reaction to methotrexate (nausea). Symptoms of DRESS syndrome arose 28 days after initializing Salazopyrine. Initial symptoms consisted of mild fever and maculo-papular rash primarily located in the face mimicking a mild virus infection. She developed edema of the face and on the extremities. Salazopyrine treatment was suspended 6 days after the initial symptoms in suspicion of drug reaction, but 6 weeks after initial Salazopyrine treatment she was admitted to hospital with a generalized maculopapular rash, oral blisters, lymphadenopathy, and generalized edema. The skin was warm, highly red and itching. Tonsils were red and swollen with lymphadenopathy located on the neck, in the axilla- and the inguinal regions. Mild gastrointestinal involvement in form of colitis was observed. She presented with leukocytosis (21,9×10⁹/L), atypical lymphocytosis, eosinophilia (3.17×10⁹/L) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 191 U/L and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 122 U/L. Reactivation of herpes virus infection was not seen. A chest radiograph showed minimal pleural effusion with no other pulmonary involvement.

### Diagnosis of COVID-19 in children: the story evolves [^112psjX1]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presenting features of COVID-19 differ in children from adults, with lower rates of fever and cough and more prominence of vomiting and diarrhoea. Currently, haematological, biochemical and radiological findings in children infected with COVID-19 are not diagnostic and do not consistently predict severe disease.

Prospective research is required to help identify any patient groups who are at risk of developing severe infection and features which may be used to identify these children early in the disease course.

### Delayed antibiotics for symptoms and complications of respiratory infections [^114VHnXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections is controversial. Any benefits have to be weighed against common adverse reactions (including rash, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting), cost and antibacterial resistance. There has been interest in ways to reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections. One is delaying the use of prescribed antibiotics by more than 48 hours for acute upper respiratory tract infections. Such methods have been shown to reduce prescribing. This review asks what effect this practice has on the clinical course of the illness.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effect of delayed antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections compared to immediate use of antibiotics

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Groups' specialised register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 1 2004), EMBASE (1990 to September 2003) and Current Contents (1998 to 2003). The search was carried out by an expert librarian. Abstracts of identified articles were used to determine which studies were trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving patients of all ages defined as having acute otitis media, acute pharyngitis, sore throat, common cold, a viral upper respiratory tract infection, acute sinusitis, and acute bronchitis were included in which delayed antibiotics are compared to antibiotics used immediately. Delayed antibiotic use was defined as the use of or advice to use antibiotics more than 48 hours after the initial consultation. 'Immediate antibiotic use' was defined as the immediate use of oral antibiotics given at the initial consultation. Clinical outcomes measured included: the presence or absence of fever, cough, pain, duration and severity of illness, complications of the disease, adverse effects from the antibiotics. Trial quality was assessed independently by two reviewers who were blinded to the author, journal and results of each study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was collected by two reviewers who were blinded to the author and journal. Data were analysed and reported using RevMan.

Main Results

Seven trials were eligible on the basis of design and all reported patient-centred outcomes. Methodological quality of included trials was generally high. There was no difference between immediate and delayed antibiotic groups for symptoms on day one and day seven. For most symptom measures there was no significant difference between the immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. Missing data and marked heterogeneity between study outcomes prevented pooling of results as a meta-analysis. Three studies out of six reporting fever, all involving patients with sore throat, indicated that there was more fever in the delayed antibiotic group. The remaining three studies showed no difference. There was no significant symptom difference for patients with cough or the common cold between the two intervention groups. Pain and malaise severity scores at day three significantly favoured the immediate antibiotic group in children with acute otitis media (Little 2001). In this study by Little 2001 of children with otitis media proxies for other malaise related outcomes were reported, including 'last day of crying' which favoured the immediate antibiotic group by approximately 16 hours (0.69 days; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.07). In the same study, just over half a spoon of paracetamol a day less was used in the immediate antibiotic group (0.59; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.93). There was no significant difference between the intervention groups for the adverse outcome of rash. Two studies reported the outcome of vomiting which was reduced in the immediate antibiotic group in children with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis in El-Daher 1991 but there was no difference in children with sore throat in Little 1997. Diarrhoea was reported by three studies of which two showed no difference Little 1997; Arroll 2002a while Little 2001 reported less diarrhoea in the delayed antibiotic group in children with otitis media.

Reviewers' Conclusions

When considering treatment options for upper respiratory tract infections, the option of delayed antibiotics has been used in an attempt to reduce the use of antibiotic prescriptions. This review shows that for all symptom scores the evidence varies between trials. Most symptom outcomes show no difference between immediate and delayed antibiotic groups. Three of the six studies, all involving patients with sore throat, indicated that patients in the delayed antibiotic group had significantly more fever that their counterparts in the immediate antibiotic group. The other three showed no difference for the outcome of fever. There is evidence indicating that for children with otitis media, pain and malaise scores are worse in the delayed antibiotic group compared to the immediate antibiotic group. This price must be weighed up against the benefits of reduced antibiotic prescribing. Future randomised controlled trials of delaying antibiotics as an intervention should fully report symptoms as well as changes of prescription rates.

### Etravirine (Intelence) [^116g3Fyo]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe Skin Reactions

Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported with INTELENCE. Rash has been reported most commonly in the first 6 weeks of therapy. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking INTELENCE and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of your skin or whites of your eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on your right side below your ribs). Patients should understand that if severe rash occurs, they will be closely monitored, laboratory tests will be ordered and appropriate therapy will be initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug Interactions

INTELENCE may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medication or herbal products, including St. John's wort [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection, as in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Fat Redistribution

Inform patients that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including INTELENCE, and that the cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Pregnancy Registry

Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant individuals exposed to INTELENCE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Instruct mothers with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Gastrointestinal symptoms were also prominent, with nausea or vomiting reported in 65.8% of cases, diarrhea in 52.6%, and abdominal pain in 42.8%. These symptoms were among the most consistent across different outbreaks and often presented early in the disease course.

Respiratory symptoms were variably reported. Dyspnea was present in 31.1% of cases, sore throat or dysphagia in 28.9%, and hiccups in 20.3%. Cough and chest pain were reported less frequently, in 5.2% and 5.8% of cases, respectively.

Hemorrhagic manifestations, while less common than general or gastrointestinal symptoms, were nonetheless clinically significant. Hematemesis was the most frequently reported hemorrhagic sign (43.1%), followed by bloody diarrhea (33.5%), gum bleeding (22.5%), epistaxis (20.3%), and injection site bleeding (9.8%). Less frequent bleeding manifestations included vaginal bleeding (8.6%), hematuria (4.6%), petechiae (4.0%), and subconjunctival hemorrhage (3.7%).

Neurologic symptoms were rare, with convulsions reported in only 2.5% of cases.

The overall case fatality rate (CFR) across all 722 reported cases was 72% (95% CI: 68.8–75.0%). Among the subset of 325 cases with available clinical data, the CFR was slightly higher at 77%, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.86). Among PCR-confirmed cases alone (n = 200), 88 deaths were reported, resulting in a CFR of 44% (95% CI: 37.1–50.9%), which was significantly lower than the CFR among not-confirmed cases (83%, p < 0.001).

### Clinical features of Marburg virus disease: a review of all reported patients since 1967 [^114ujFiy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Since 1967, 18 MVD outbreakshave occurred, including imported cases in Western countries, accounting for a total of 722 cases. After screening, 21 papers covering 16 of these outbreaks and providing detailed clinical descriptions of 325 cases (45% of all reported cases) were included in the review (Fig. 2).,

Fig. 2
Heat map of relative frequencies of MVD symptoms from 325 cases in 16 outbreaks.

All included articles are observational studies describing specific outbreaks. Each study provides either patient-specific or aggregated descriptions of symptoms, and in some cases, information on patient outcomes.

There is substantial heterogeneity among the selected studies. They differ significantly in the time of data collection, spanning from 1967 to 2024; in geographical setting, including various African countries and high-income countries; and in context, ranging from large outbreaks in resource-limited settings to isolated imported cases.

The overall frequency of symptoms is summarized in Fig. 3. General systemic symptoms were the most commonly reported. Fever was the most frequent symptom, occurring in 296 cases (91.1%), followed by fatigue (74.8%), headache (64%), and myalgia (47.1%). Rash was observed in 11.7% of cases and conjunctivitis in 27.1%.

### Novel thogotovirus associated with febrile illness and death, United States, 2014 [^111agARo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The Case-Patient

The patient was a previously healthy man > 50 years of age from Bourbon County, Kansas, USA. While working outdoors on his property in late spring 2014, the patient had several tick bites and found an engorged tick on his shoulder several days before he became ill with nausea, weakness, and diarrhea. The following day, a fever, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia developed. On the third day of illness, the patient went to his primary care physician, who empirically prescribed doxycycline for a presumed tickborne illness because of his history of tick bites, symptoms, and no reported travel outside the immediate area. The following morning, the patient's wife found him obtunded (experiencing reduced consciousness) but arousable. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital.

At the hospital, he had a temperature of 37.3°C, a pulse rate of 84 beats/min, and an increased blood pressure of 151/65 mm Hg. The patient had a papular rash on his trunk, but otherwise results of his physical examination were unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings showed leukopenia (2,200 cells/μL), lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 550 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (72,000 cells/μL), mild hyponatremia (sodium 133 mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3.0 mmol/L), a creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL) within the reference range (0.6 mg/dL–1.2 mg/dL), a slightly increased level of blood urea nitrogen (25 μg/dL), and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (138 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (86 U/L). He was admitted because of the principal problems of dehydration, syncope, and possible tickborne illness. He was given an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus, then maintenance fluids, and doxycycline (200 mg IV every 12 h for the first 24 h, then 100 mg IV every 12 h).

### Rickettsiosis caused by Rickettsia parkeri, Mexico [^114zCzFk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study documents a case of human rickettsiosis caused by R. parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest in Yucatan, Mexico. This finding represents the fifth Rickettsia species identified as infecting humans in southeastern Mexico, but in a municipality, Dzemul, with no previous Rickettsia spp. infections reported among humans or identified in vectors or reservoir hosts. Because this rickettsiosis causes mild to moderate febrile illness with initial symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, rash, it might masquerade as dengue fever in our region and other areas where dengue is common.

Our report emphasizes the importance of continuing to characterize clinical manifestations of rickettsioses in Mexico. Health providers in this region should include this recently discovered rickettsiosis in differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses.

### Acute human immunodeficiency virus syndrome in an adolescent [^115HoDfT]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion illness is a difficult diagnosis to make because of its nonspecific and protean manifestations. We present such a case in an adolescent. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 5-day history of fever, sore throat, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient also reported a nonproductive cough, coryza, and fatigue. The patient's only risk factor for HIV infection was a history of unprotected intercourse with 5 girls. Physical examination was significant for fever, exudative tonsillopharyngitis, shotty cervical lymphadenopathy, and palpable purpura on both feet. Laboratory studies demonstrated lymphopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and urinalysis were normal. The following day, the patient remained febrile. Physical examination revealed oral ulcerations, conjunctivitis, and erythematous papules on the thorax; the purpura was unchanged. Serologies for hepatitis B, syphilis, HIV, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Bacterial cultures of blood and stool and viral cultures of throat and conjunctiva showed no pathogens. Coagulation profile and liver enzymes were normal. Within 1 week, all symptoms had resolved. The platelet count normalized. Repeat HIV serology was positive, as was HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction. Subsequent HIV viral load was 350 000, and the CD4 lymphocyte count was 351/mm³. HIV is the seventh leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24 in the United States, and up to half of all new infections occur in adolescents. Our patient presented with many of the typical signs and symptoms of acute HIV infection: fever, fatigue, rash, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, emesis, and diarrhea. Other symptoms commonly reported include headache, myalgias, arthralgias, aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy, thrush, weight loss, night sweats, and genital ulcers. Common seroconversion laboratory findings include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. The suspicion of acute HIV illness should prompt virologic and serologic analysis. Initial serology is usually negative. Diagnosis therefore depends on direct detection of the virus, by assay of viral load (HIV RNA), DNA polymerase chain reaction, or p24 antigen. Both false-positive and false-negative results for these tests have been reported, further complicating early diagnosis. Pediatricians should play an active role in identifying HIV-infected patients. Our case, the first report of acute HIV illness in an adolescent, emphasizes that clinicians should consider acute HIV seroconversion in the appropriate setting. Recognition of acute HIV syndrome is especially important for improving prognosis and limiting transmission. It is imperative that we maintain a high index of suspicion as primary care physicians for adolescents who present with a viral syndrome and appropriate risk factors.

### Oropouche virus disease among U.S. travelers-United States, 2024 [^1117Dw7k]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Investigation and Results

Natural History and Clinical Symptoms

Oropouche virus (Simbu serogroup, genus Orthobunyavirus) is endemic to the Amazon region and was previously identified as a cause of human disease in several countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean. The virus circulates in a sylvatic cycle, possibly involving certain vertebrate hosts (e.g. sloths, nonhuman primates, and birds) and mosquitoes, and an urban cycle in which humans serve as amplifying hosts with known vectors being biting midges (Culicoides paraensis) and possibly mosquitoes (e.g. Culex quinquefasciatus).

The clinical signs and symptoms of Oropouche virus disease are similar to those of other arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. After an incubation period of 3–10 days, patients typically experience abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. Other symptoms might include retroorbital pain, photophobia, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, maculopapular rash, conjunctival injection, and abdominal pain. Initial symptoms usually last only a few days, but up to 70% of patients are reported to have recurrent symptoms within days to weeks after resolution of their initial illness. Although illness is typically mild, hemorrhagic manifestations (e.g. epistaxis, gingival bleeding, melena, menorrhagia, and petechiae) or neuroinvasive disease (e.g. meningitis and meningoencephalitis) can rarely occur. No vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Oropouche virus disease exist; treatment is supportive.

Recent Outbreaks in South America and Cuba

During December 2023–June 2024, large Oropouche virus disease outbreaks were recognized in areas with known endemic disease, and the virus emerged in new areas in South America and Cuba where it had not been historically reported. As of August 2024, over 8,000 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. These large outbreaks have resulted in travel-associated cases, with 19 Oropouche virus disease cases in European travelers returning from Cuba (n = 18) and Brazil (one) during June–July 2024. Recently, cases of severe disease leading to two deaths and vertical transmission associated with fetal death and possible congenital malformations in Brazil have raised concerns about the threat of Oropouche virus to human health.

### Ebola and other highly contagious diseases: strategies by the Society of Interventional Radiology for interventional radiology [^115GPmYj]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ebola virus disease (EVD) clinical presentation, transmission, and diagnostic confirmation are described as follows: After an incubation period of 2–21 days, symptoms appear abruptly, and the skin should be examined for a diffuse maculopapular rash with varying degrees of erythema 5–7 days into the illness. EVD propagates through mucosal surfaces or parental route after exposure to an infected living or deceased patient or animal, and needle-stick exposures have also been reported as a route of transmission. Suspicion for EVD is based on travel to endemic areas within 21 days, fevers, and/or exposure to a patient with EVD, and a definitive diagnosis requires a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for viral antigen or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibody production against the virus.

### Ebola hemorrhagic fever associated with novel virus strain, Uganda, 2007–2008 [^114VK2wn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Description of Cases

Illnesses in 192 persons met the definition for suspected EHF. Of these, 42 (22%) were laboratory confirmed as positive for a novel Ebola virus species (Bundibugyo ebolavirus); 74 (38%) remained probable, and 76 (40%) were laboratory negative and classified as noncases.

Overall, 39 of the 116 persons with confirmed and probable EHF died (CFR 34%). For male patients, the CFR was 35% (23/65) and for females, 31% (16/51). The CFR for confirmed EHF was 33% (14/42) and for suspected EHF, 34% (25/74). Case-patients' ages ranged from 3 weeks to 70 years (mean 34 years, median 35 years). Most 40 (36%) case-patients were crop farmers; 14 (12%) were healthcare workers.

Symptoms

The median incubation period from contact with an infected person to symptom onset was 7 days (range 2–20 days). The most frequent symptoms were fever (100%), intense fatigue (92%), headache (87%), abdominal pain (87%), vomiting (83%), and diarrhea (83%). Bleeding manifestations (including hematuria; hematemesis; bleeding from the eyes, nose, and vagina; and/or bloody stool) occurred in 52% of case-patients, and most (59%) case-patients who died had some form of bleeding. Other symptoms reported were dysphagia (54% of case-patients), dyspnea (52%), and rash (50%). Median duration from symptom onset to recovery was 10 days (range 2–26 days). Median duration from symptom onset to death was 10 days (range 3–21 days).

The outbreak showed 3 successive cycles of transmission (Figure 2). Each transmission cycle lasted 6 weeks, with an interval of 3–11 days, and was characterized by a typical epidemic peak followed by gradual decline. The highest peak occurred on November 25. Despite the timely detection and initiation of investigations during the 30th epidemiologic week, the successive transmission cycles indicated delayed laboratory confirmation and declaration of the outbreak. Outbreak confirmation was delayed until the 48th epidemiologic week, resulting in inadequate control measures before the outbreak was confirmed.

### Lamotrigine-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) during primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection [^117CTBGY]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe, potentially life-threatening idiosyncratic drug reaction that may result in skin eruption, mucous membrane involvement, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy, with wide-ranging internal organ involvement. The authors report the case of a 21-year-old man who was prescribed lamotrigine for anxiety disorder. After 2weeks of treatment, he developed a pruritic morbilliform rash on his trunk and upper extremities that was associated with fever, sore throat, bilateral scleral injection, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. A laboratory work-up revealed elevated transaminases and atypical lymphocytosis. He was found to have an active Epstein-Barr virus infection. Lamotrigine was discontinued due to suspicion of DRESS; the patient received pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone taper, which resulted in a significant improvement of symptoms. At follow-up 3weeks later, signs and symptoms had completely resolved. Follow-up laboratory tests revealed that liver dysfunction had normalised.

### Diagnosis and management of monkeypox: a review for the emergency clinician [^1167JNjf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The outbreak of monkeypox in May and June 2022 is the largest outside of central and western Africa since the 2003 outbreak in the United States. Monkeypox, like smallpox, is caused by an orthopoxvirus, though its clinical manifestations tend to be less severe. It is characterized by a prodromal flu-like illness with lymphadenopathy followed by a centrifugally spreading rash, sometimes involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa. Although the vast majority of cases resolve with symptomatic management, a small number of patients can suffer severe outcomes including, but not limited to, secondary bacterial skin infections, pneumonitis, ocular sequelae, encephalitis, hypovolemia, and death. Local, state, and federal health authorities should be involved in the care of people under investigation for this illness. With confirmed cases worldwide and the possibility of community spread, emergency clinicians need to be aware of the manifestations and management of this disease, both to treat those with the disease as well as to provide education to those exposed and at risk of infection.

### The emerging zika virus threat: a guide for dermatologists [^115YvPfK]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We provide a guide for dermatologists to follow if they encounter patients with a rash and clinical history suspicious of Zika virus infection, including diagnostic testing and management options. We also provide an illustrative case report of a patient from Brazil who was diagnosed with Zika virus infection after presenting with a generalized pruritic rash. One of the most prominent symptoms of Zika virus infection is a cutaneous eruption. As such, it is especially necessary for dermatologists to understand this virus so that they may appropriately recognize this entity as a diagnostic consideration in the clinic. The rash associated with Zika virus infection is most commonly an erythematous maculopapular eruption that presents after an initial 3–4 days of fever, headache, and arthralgia or myalgia. The rash typically lasts for an average of 6 days, and can spread to involve any part of the body, including the face, torso, extremities, palms, and soles.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116Dc1up]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acute HIV infection — definition and clinical features — Acute HIV infection occurs soon after transmission and is typically characterized by the lack of anti-HIV antibodies and the presence of viremia, which can be detected by an HIV RNA test or p24 antigen test. Recent HIV infection is considered the period of ≤ 6 months after infection during which anti-HIV antibodies become detectable. People with acute HIV infection may experience fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and other symptoms; however, illness is generally nonspecific, and people can be asymptomatic or experience relatively mild symptoms. Clinicians may fail to recognize acute HIV infection because its manifestations are similar to those of many other viral infections, such as COVID-19, influenza, and infectious mononucleosis.

### Ross river virus disease reemergence, Fiji, 2003–2004 [^111eqr7M]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Case 2

On March 5, 2004, a 44-year-old Canadian woman returned to Canada after visiting New Zealand for 2 months and Fiji for 1 month; she did not travel through Australia or another known Ross River virus–endemic area. She had previously visited Fiji uneventfully in 1995. On March 14, she experienced the abrupt onset of fatigue; the next day she was feverish, nauseated, and anorexic and had severe arthralgia in her ankles and feet. For several days, she experienced extreme hypersensitivity to touch, particularly of her soles, severe enough to prevent weight bearing, and had mild ankle swelling. Her joint pains worsened over several days and spread to her knees, hips, and upper extremities. On March 16, she noticed a nonpruritic, erythematous, maculopapular rash, with small vesicular lesions on the palms, which involved the extremities and face but not the trunk; the rash resolved after 4 days. On March 17, she had normal CBC results and serum creatinine kinase level, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and an ESR of 62 mm/h. By day 10 of illness, she was able to resume limited sedentary work. One month after illness onset, fatigue and joint pain persisted, but physical examination results were normal, apart from difficulties in ambulation due to pain; tests for ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative, C-reactive protein level was normal, and ESR was 30 mm/h. Four months after illness onset, she continued to have gradually resolving arthralgia and fatigue that limited daily activities. At CDC, serologic tests were performed on serum specimens obtained on days 16 and 33 of illness (Table).

### Interim guidance for prevention and treatment of monkeypox in persons with HIV infection-United States, August 2022 [^112G66WT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Signs and Symptoms: Classically, monkeypox occurs in three stages. After an incubation period of approximately 1–2 weeks, a prodrome, characterized by fever and lymphadenopathy occurs, which is followed by the onset of a deep-seated vesicular or pustular rash that often begins centrally and spreads to the limbs. Transmission of monkeypox can occur through direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids, through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, or through touching items, such as clothing or linens, that previously touched a patient's infectious rash or body fluids. § Patients are considered contagious until the scabs have crusted over and fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed underneath.

The enteroviruses, RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family, are ubiquitous pathogens which include more than 70 different serotypes that infect people of all ages and tend to occur seasonally in the summer and fall. Clinical manifestations may vary diversely with one serotype, while multiple serotypes can present with identical symptoms and may mimic bacterial infections. Most enterovirus infections cause benign, self-limiting disease; however, they can also produce severe and sometimes fatal illnesses such as meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, neonatal sepsis, and polio. Severe enterovirus infections are being diagnosed and treated earlier with better prognostic outcomes due to the advances of polymerase chain reaction technology in accurately detecting virus in patient fluids as well as the recent development of new antiviral therapies.

### Differential clinical symptoms among acute phase Indian patients revealed significant association with dengue viral load and serum IFN-gamma level [^114pYkeE]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During last three decades, dengue (DF), an arthropod-borne viral disease is increasingly prevalent worldwide including India, resulting in serious public health problems.

Objective

This study was carried out during 2012–2013 to evaluate the association of WHO-classified dengue disease symptoms with viral load (VL) and serum IFN-gamma levels in dengue patients from India.

Study Design

Blood samples were collected from dengue symptomatic febrile patients (n = 127). DEN-VL was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using RNA, extracted from plasma and anti-DENV-IgM was detected by ELISA. Serum IFN-gamma level was detected by ELISA among DENV infected and age-matched control individuals. Association between DEN-VL and IFN-gamma level in patient's sera with WHO-classified disease symptoms was statistically analyzed.

Results

DENV RNA and anti-DENV-IgM was detected among 94% (n = 73) and 36% (n = 28) of dengue infected patients (n = 78) respectively. Fever, nausea, rash, aches & pains, leucopenia and persistent vomiting were significantly correlated with DENV infection (P-value < 0.05). Only patients with high-VL exhibited leucopenia, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain and clinical fluid accumulation, which were warning signs of dengue infection according to revised WHO-criteria (P-value < 0.05). Clinical symptoms of DENV infected patients, viz. leucopenia, abdominal pain and persistent vomiting were significantly correlated to each other (P-value < 0.05). Increased serum IFN-gamma level was detected among dengue patients compared to control individuals. DEN-VL and symptoms like nausea, leucopenia, persistent vomiting and abdominal pain were significantly negatively correlated with serum IFN-gamma level (P-value < 0.05).

Conclusion

Serum IFN-gamma level and dengue viremia among acute stage patients might be used as early prognostic marker for disease severity prediction.

### Pityriasis rosea: diagnosis and treatment [^1158uASm]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Pityriasis rosea is a common self-limiting rash that usually starts with a herald patch on the trunk and progresses along the Langer lines to a generalized rash over the trunk and limbs. The diagnosis is based on clinical and physical examination findings. The herald patch is an erythematous lesion with an elevated border and depressed center. The generalized rash usually presents two weeks after the herald patch. Patients can develop general malaise, fatigue, nausea, headaches, joint pain, enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and sore throat before or during the course of the rash. The differential diagnosis includes secondary syphilis, seborrheic dermatitis, nummular eczema, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, tinea corporis, viral exanthems, lichen planus, and pityriasis rosea-like eruption associated with certain medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and consists of corticosteroids or antihistamines. In some cases, acyclovir can be used to treat symptoms and reduce the length of disease. Ultraviolet phototherapy can also be considered for severe cases. Pityriasis rosea during pregnancy has been linked to spontaneous abortions.

### Epidemiologic features and clinical course of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore [^117VnXs9]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.

Objective

To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.

Exposures

Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.

Results

Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.

### Viral exanthems: an update [^114UoADN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Classic viral exanthems, such as measles, rubella, and Fifth disease, have great historical significance and, despite vaccine successes, still occur both in the United States and across the world. Because they are either less commonly seen (e.g., measles) or recognized by pediatricians (e.g. Fifth disease), viral exanthems that present to dermatology clinics are often "atypical" and may cause diagnostic confusion. This article will first review a general approach to the patient with a possible viral exanthem, discuss several current issues germane to "classic" exanthems, and delve into greater detail regarding atypical presentations.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Immune reconstitution syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Myocardial infarction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.

Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^113vpQNh]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### Characteristics of the first confirmed case of human infection with mpox virus clade Ib in China [^115KM68e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Clinical features

We examined the clinical features of this clade Ib case. A retrospective investigation revealed that the patient first experienced nonspecific discomfort, followed 2 days later by the appearance of pinprick-like lesions on the arms. Widespread skin rashes affecting the extremities, face, buttocks, trunk, palms, and dorsum of the hands were observed by the 10th DPO. However, no lesions were identified in the oral cavity, perineum, or anus. This clinical pattern differed from clade Ia outbreaks reported elsewhere, where 89% of patients had genital skin lesions, and the mean lesion density was highest in the genital area among adults.

In addition to the above-described typical symptoms, this patient also presented with abdominal pain, back pain, and headache. A computed tomography scan revealed inguinal lymphadenopathy. These signs and symptoms were nonspecific and contributed to the difficulty of achieving an early diagnosis. Attention should be paid to such nonspecific symptoms, which may be mistaken for other common viral infections (e.g. respiratory or intestinal infections) in the early stages of mpox. It is therefore important to strengthen the differential diagnosis to ensure that patients are assessed promptly and accurately. This requires clinicians to maintain a high level of vigilance and diagnostic sensitivity, enabling timely viral testing and screening to guide appropriate treatment options and avoid misdiagnosis and delays in care.

Previous studies have shown that vaccination against smallpox can provide cross-protective immunity against mpox, potentially reducing disease severity and transmission risk. The severity of disease is higher for clade 1a (case fatality rate of up to 12%) than for other clades (case fatality rate of 0.0%–3.6%). The patient in this case had not been vaccinated against smallpox or mpox; however, she did not develop severe symptoms. Given the evolving nature of MPXV, ongoing research and robust public health responses remain essential for managing potential future outbreaks.

### Fever in the not-so-typical pediatric patient [^111yfqeo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Fever is one of the most common chief complaints for patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Most of the time, these patients are diagnosed with a virus and treated with supportive care; however, there are a subset of patients with chronic conditions or special circumstances that require a more thorough approach when they enter the ED with a fever. This article will go into detail about why we must be on high alert when these children present with a fever and how we should approach them medically.

### Symptoms of scarlet fever | Group A strep… [^116T6hUF]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms General symptoms Some symptoms of scarlet fever are common to other infections, too. These may include:

- Fever or chills
- Headache or body aches
- Nausea or vomiting
- Sore throat and pain when swallowing
- Stomach pain. Physical signs Some physical signs are typical of scarlet fever. They show in the following areas:

- Skin
- **Tongue, throat, and neck Skin Signs of scarlet fever on the skin include**:

- A red rash that feels rough like sandpaper
- Brighter red skin in the creases of the underarm, elbow, and groin
- Pale area around the mouth
- Skin peeling as the rash fades.

Tongue, throat, and neck Signs in these areas include: Early in illness: Whitish coating on the tongue Later in illness: "Strawberry" tongue
- Red and swollen tonsils
- Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck
- Tiny, red spots on the roof of the mouth, called petechiae
- Very red throat
- White patches or streaks of pus on the tonsils. How symptoms change over time Rash appears and spreads One to 2 days after the illness begins, a red rash usually appears. However, the rash can appear before illness or up to 7 days later. The rash may first appear on the neck, underarm, and groin. Over time, the rash spreads over the body. The rash usually begins as small, flat blotches that slowly become fine bumps that feel like sandpaper. Color of skin can vary Although the cheeks might look flushed, there may be a pale area around the mouth.

Underarm, elbow, and groin skin creases may become brighter red than the rest of the rash. Rash fades and skin may peel The rash from scarlet fever fades in about 7 days. As the rash fades, the skin may peel around the fingertips, toes, and groin area. This peeling can last up to several weeks.

### Clinical features of dengue… [^113LGT4V]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation Dengue begins abruptly after a typical incubation period of 5–7 days, and the course follows 3 phases: febrile, critical, and recovery. Early clinical findings are nonspecific. Dengue requires a high index of suspicion because recognizing early signs of shock and promptly initiating intensive supportive therapy with intravenous fluids can reduce risk of death among patients with severe dengue to < 0. 5%. Febrile Phase
- Fever typically lasts 2–7 days and can be biphasic.
- Other signs and symptoms may include severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and arthralgia, macular or maculopapular rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations including petechia, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result.
- Some patients have injected oropharynx and facial erythema in the first 24–48 hours after onset.

Warning Signs Warning signs of progression to severe dengue usually occur in the late febrile phase around the time of defervescence, and include persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy/restlessness, postural hypotension, liver enlargement, and progressive increase in hematocrit. Recovery Phase
- As plasma leakage subsides, the patient enters the recovery phase and begins to reabsorb extravasated intravenous fluids and pleural and abdominal effusions.
- As a patient's well-being improves, hemodynamic status stabilizes, and diuresis ensues. The patient's hematocrit stabilizes or may fall because of the dilutional effect of the reabsorbed fluid, and the white cell count usually starts to rise, followed by a recovery of platelet count.
- The recovery-phase rash may desquamate and be pruritic.

WHO 2009 Dengue Classification Dengue is defined by a combination of ≥ 2 clinical findings in a febrile person who lives in or traveled to a dengue-endemic area. Clinical findings include nausea, vomiting, rash, aches and pains, a positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, or any warning sign.

### HFMD symptoms and… [^114fKzQn]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash on the hands and feet.
- HFMD is common in infants and children younger than 5 years old.
- Most children have mild symptoms for 7 to 10 days. Signs and symptoms HFMD symptoms usually include fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. Fever and flu-like symptoms Children often get a fever and other flu-like symptoms 3 to 5 days after they catch the virus. These can include:

- Fever
- Eating or drinking less
- Sore throat
- Feeling unwell. Skin rash Your child can get a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also show up on the buttocks, legs, and arms. The rash usually is not itchy and looks like flat or slightly raised red spots; sometimes with blisters that have an area of redness at their base. Fluid in the blister can contain the virus that causes HFMD. Keep blisters clean and avoid touching them.

Complications HFMD is usually not serious and complications from it are rare. Nearly all people get better in 7 to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. Dehydration Some people, especially young children, can get dehydrated. This can happen if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores. Parents can prevent dehydration by making sure their child drinks enough liquids. Viral meningitis Although very rare, a small number of people with HFMD get viral meningitis. This causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The infected person may require to be hospitalized for a few days. Keep Reading: About Viral Meningitis Encephalitis or paralysis While extremely rare, a small number of people. with HFMD get encephalitis or paralysis.

Healthcare providers can usually identify HFMD by examining the rash appearance while considering the child's age and other symptoms. Sometimes, they might collect samples from the child's throat or poop. Then they will send them to a laboratory to test for the virus.
