## Question

Best drug for moderate alcohol use disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is best for moderate alcohol use disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "moderate AUD" is defined and whether severity modifies pharmacotherapy choice. Then, I should verify which medications have the strongest evidence base and how guidelines rank them. Next, I will compare efficacy and safety profiles, including numbers needed to treat and adverse effects. After that, I need to consider patient-specific factors that might favor one agent over another. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note alternatives if first-line therapy is unsuitable, ensuring I anchor this to high-quality meta-analyses and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Moderate alcohol use disorder in DSM-5 is defined by 4–5 diagnostic criteria, and importantly, the strength of evidence and guideline recommendations for pharmacotherapy are generally aligned across moderate to severe AUD, so the "best" choice is not fundamentally different for moderate versus severe presentations, though individualization matters [^111zTVqR].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to prioritize medications with the highest-quality evidence. Multiple high-credibility meta-analyses and contemporary guidelines converge on two first-line options: oral naltrexone 50 mg/day and acamprosate, with naltrexone typically favored for reducing heavy drinking and acamprosate favored for maintaining abstinence, and both supported by moderate-to-high certainty evidence and strong or first-line recommendations in major guidelines [^111zTVqR] [^116t6QHX] [^111zTVqR].

> I will now examine naltrexone's efficacy. Oral naltrexone 50 mg/day reduces return to heavy drinking with a number needed to treat around 11, and it also reduces return to any drinking, albeit with a smaller absolute effect and an NNT around 18, which is still clinically meaningful. These effects are consistent across multiple meta-analyses and are reflected in first-line endorsements from the VA/DoD and Canadian guidelines, with the added advantage of once-daily dosing and an injectable option to support adherence [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx] [^111zTVqR] [^116t6QHX].

> Now, let me consider acamprosate. Acamprosate shows a consistent benefit for maintaining abstinence with an NNT around 11 for preventing return to any drinking, and it is particularly useful in patients who are already abstinent or who can achieve abstinence before initiation. However, it does not consistently reduce heavy drinking, and the three-times-daily dosing can be a barrier to adherence, which I should keep in mind when matching to patient preferences and routines [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx] [^114mZAq9].

> Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness. Head-to-head and network meta-analyses generally show no consistent superiority of naltrexone versus acamprosate overall, reinforcing that the choice should be individualized. Mechanistically, naltrexone's opioid receptor blockade reduces reward and craving, whereas acamprosate modulates glutamatergic systems to stabilize abstinence, which aligns with their differing clinical strengths [^11371CXP] [^114W4YHx] [^117JPGDc] [^114mZAq9].

> I need to check safety and tolerability. Naltrexone commonly causes nausea and occasionally vomiting, and it is contraindicated with current opioid use or acute hepatitis; acamprosate commonly causes gastrointestinal upset, especially diarrhea, but is not hepatically metabolized, making it suitable in liver disease. Both are generally well tolerated, and the risk of serious adverse events is low, which supports routine outpatient use with counseling [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx] [^114mZAq9].

> But wait, what if the patient's goal is reduction rather than abstinence, or if adherence to daily pills is a concern. In that scenario, naltrexone is often preferred because of its stronger effect on heavy drinking and the availability of extended-release injectable naltrexone, which can improve adherence and has been associated with reduced acute care utilization in real-world settings. I should confirm there are no opioid needs or hepatic contraindications before choosing naltrexone [^115VWcqA] [^116xgbfu] [^111zTVqR].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives for patients who cannot take or do not respond to first-line agents. Topiramate has moderate-quality evidence for reducing heavy drinking and is recommended by VA/DoD as an alternative, though it is not FDA-approved for AUD and requires slow titration due to cognitive and paresthesia side effects. Gabapentin may be considered when first-line options are unsuitable, particularly in patients with insomnia or withdrawal symptoms, but evidence is mixed and dosing frequency can limit adherence [^111zTVqR] [^1143fnFR] [^117NG7gH] [^111RqAdL].

> Let me synthesize. For most patients with moderate AUD, oral naltrexone 50 mg/day is the best first-line choice because it robustly reduces heavy drinking, has a favorable adherence profile, and fits common patient goals of reduction. Acamprosate is an excellent alternative when the patient is already abstinent or prioritizes abstinence maintenance, and extended-release naltrexone is a strong option when adherence to daily therapy is a concern. All pharmacotherapies should be paired with psychosocial treatment, as combined modalities outperform either alone in meta-analyses and are considered best practice [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx] [^114Sw4YZ] [^113QLxYU].

> I should double-check special populations and caveats. In patients with ongoing opioid therapy or acute hepatitis, naltrexone is contraindicated and acamprosate or off-label topiramate should be considered. In adolescents and young adults, evidence for medications is limited and behavioral interventions are first-line, though naltrexone may be used selectively. In patients with significant liver disease, acamprosate is preferred because it is not hepatically metabolized [^117NG7gH] [^116BBmKn] [^114mZAq9].

> Final recommendation: For moderate alcohol use disorder, start with oral naltrexone 50 mg/day if there are no contraindications, counsel on expected benefits and side effects, and combine with behavioral therapy. If naltrexone is contraindicated or not tolerated, use acamprosate 666 mg three times daily, ideally after a period of abstinence. Consider extended-release naltrexone when adherence is a priority or daily dosing is impractical. Reassess at 12 weeks and pivot to topiramate or gabapentin if first-line therapy fails or is unsuitable, always aligning the choice with the patient's goals and comorbidities [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx] [^116t6QHX] [^111zTVqR].

---

The best medication for moderate alcohol use disorder is **naltrexone** [^115VWcqA] because it **reduces heavy drinking and craving** [^112jNXnX] with the strongest evidence and guideline support [^116t6QHX]. Acamprosate is a **close alternative** [^114W4YHx] for maintaining abstinence, especially in patients who are already abstinent or cannot take naltrexone [^114mZAq9]. Topiramate or gabapentin are **second-line options** [^111zTVqR] when first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective [^111qobAn]. Medication should always be combined with psychosocial treatment [^114Sw4YZ], and the choice should be individualized based on patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profile [^116rFP64].

## First-line pharmacotherapies

Key characteristics of first-line pharmacotherapies:

| **Aspect** | **Naltrexone** | **Acamprosate** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the rewarding effects of alcohol, reducing craving and heavy drinking [^117JPGDc]. | Acamprosate modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission, stabilizing brain activity and reducing the risk of relapse, particularly in abstinent patients [^114mZAq9]. |
| Efficacy | Naltrexone significantly reduces heavy drinking and craving, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 11 for preventing return to heavy drinking [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx]. | Acamprosate is effective in maintaining abstinence, with an NNT of 11 for preventing return to any drinking [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx]. |
| Safety and tolerability | Naltrexone is generally well tolerated, with gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting) being the most common. It is contraindicated in patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure and in those currently using opioids [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx]. | Acamprosate is well tolerated, with gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, nausea) being the most common. It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [^115VWcqA] [^114W4YHx]. |
| Clinical considerations | Naltrexone is available in oral and extended-release injectable formulations, which can improve adherence. It is particularly effective in patients with high craving and heavy drinking patterns [^117JPGDc] [^114TwxyN]. | Acamprosate is most effective in patients who are already abstinent or committed to abstinence. It requires three times daily dosing, which may affect adherence [^114mZAq9]. |

---

## Second-line pharmacotherapies

Topiramate and gabapentin are **second-line options** [^111zTVqR] for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to first-line medications [^111qobAn]. Topiramate reduces heavy drinking and craving but may cause cognitive impairment and paresthesia [^112a76vg]; gabapentin is useful for patients with insomnia or anxiety and may reduce heavy drinking and craving, though evidence is less robust than for first-line agents [^111RqAdL] [^1148aLyH].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

Head-to-head trials and meta-analyses show **no consistent superiority** of naltrexone over acamprosate or vice versa [^11371CXP]; the choice should be individualized based on patient characteristics, preferences, and treatment goals [^116rFP64]. Naltrexone is preferred for patients aiming to reduce heavy drinking, while acamprosate is preferred for those aiming for abstinence [^1111ptfT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association (APA), Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD), and Canadian guidelines recommend **naltrexone and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies** for moderate to severe AUD [^116vLf6i] [^111zTVqR] [^116t6QHX]. They emphasize combining pharmacotherapy with psychosocial interventions for optimal outcomes [^114Sw4YZ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

- **Comorbidities**: Hepatic impairment favors acamprosate; renal impairment favors naltrexone.
- **Medication adherence**: Once-daily naltrexone or monthly injectables may improve adherence compared with three-times-daily acamprosate.
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient goals and tolerance [^116rFP64].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Naltrexone is the **best first-line medication** for moderate AUD because it effectively reduces heavy drinking and craving, with strong evidence and guideline support [^115VWcqA] [^116t6QHX]. Acamprosate is a **strong alternative**, particularly for patients aiming for abstinence or when naltrexone is contraindicated [^114mZAq9]. Topiramate or gabapentin are **second-line options** for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to first-line agents [^111zTVqR]. Medication should always be combined with psychosocial treatment, and the choice should be individualized based on patient characteristics and preferences [^114Sw4YZ].

### Meta-analysis of naltrexone and acamprosate for treating alcohol use disorders: when are these medications most helpful? [^1111ptfT]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Although debates over the efficacy of oral naltrexone and acamprosate in treating alcohol use disorders tend to focus on their global efficacy relative to placebo or their efficacy relative to each other, the underlying reality may be more nuanced. This meta-analysis examined when naltrexone and acamprosate are most helpful by testing: (i) the relative efficacy of each medication given its presumed mechanism of action (reducing heavy drinking versus fostering abstinence) and (ii) whether different ways of implementing each medication (required abstinence before treatment, detoxification before treatment, goal of treatment, length of treatment, dosage) moderate its effects.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified 64 randomized, placebo-controlled, English-language clinical trials completed between 1970 and 2009 focused on acamprosate or naltrexone.

Results

Acamprosate had a significantly larger effect size than naltrexone on the maintenance of abstinence, and naltrexone had a larger effect size than acamprosate on the reduction of heavy drinking and craving. For naltrexone, requiring abstinence before the trial was associated with larger effect sizes for abstinence maintenance and reduced heavy drinking compared with placebo. For acamprosate, detoxification before medication administration was associated with better abstinence outcomes compared with placebo.

Conclusions

In treatment for alcohol use disorders, acamprosate has been found to be slightly more efficacious in promoting abstinence and naltrexone slightly more efficacious in reducing heavy drinking and craving. Detoxification before treatment or a longer period of required abstinence before treatment is associated with larger medication effects for acamprosate and naltrexone respectively.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder: a review [^114TwxyN]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol consumption is associated with 88 000 US deaths annually. Although routine screening for heavy alcohol use can identify patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been recommended, only 1 in 6 US adults report ever having been asked by a health professional about their drinking behavior. Alcohol use disorder, a problematic pattern of alcohol use accompanied by clinically significant impairment or distress, is present in up to 14% of US adults during a 1-year period, although only about 8% of affected individuals are treated in an alcohol treatment facility.

Observations

Four medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate. However, patients with AUD most commonly receive counseling. Medications are prescribed to less than 9% of patients who are likely to benefit from them, given evidence that they exert clinically meaningful effects and their inclusion in clinical practice guidelines as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone, which can be given once daily, reduces the likelihood of a return to any drinking by 5% and binge-drinking risk by 10%. Randomized clinical trials also show that some medications approved for other indications, including seizure disorder (eg, topiramate), are efficacious in treating AUD. Currently, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacogenetics to personalize AUD treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alcohol consumption is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, and heavy alcohol use is the major risk factor for AUD. Simple, valid screening methods can be used to identify patients with heavy alcohol use, who can then be evaluated for the presence of an AUD. Patients receiving a diagnosis of the disorder should be given brief counseling and prescribed a first-line medication (eg, naltrexone) or referred for a more intensive psychosocial intervention.

### Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VWcqA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder affects more than 28.3 million people in the United States and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To compare efficacy and comparative efficacy of therapies for alcohol use disorder.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from November 2012 to September 9, 2022 Literature was subsequently systematically monitored to identify relevant articles up to August 14, 2023, and the PubMed search was updated on August 14, 2023.

Study Selection

For efficacy outcomes, randomized clinical trials of at least 12 weeks' duration were included. For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

Data from 118 clinical trials and 20 976 participants were included. The numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 person from returning to any drinking were 11 (95% CI, 1–32) for acamprosate and 18 (95% CI, 4–32) for oral naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/d. Compared with placebo, oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) was associated with lower rates of return to heavy drinking, with a number needed to treat of 11 (95% CI, 5–41). Injectable naltrexone was associated with fewer drinking days over the 30-day treatment period (weighted mean difference, -4.99 days; 95% CI, -9.49 to -0.49 days) Adverse effects included higher gastrointestinal distress for acamprosate (diarrhea: risk ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.27–1.97) and naltrexone (nausea: risk ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.51–1.98; vomiting: risk ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.91) compared with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^111oBSQr]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States, with alcohol-related deaths increasing during the pandemic. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommends that physicians offer pharmacotherapy with behavioral interventions for patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. Several medications are available to help patients reduce drinking and maintain abstinence; however, in 2019, only 7.3% of Americans with alcohol use disorder received any treatment, and only 1.6% were prescribed medications to treat the disorder. Strong evidence shows that naltrexone and gabapentin reduce heavy-drinking days and that acamprosate prevents return-to-use in patients who are currently abstinent; moderate evidence supports the use of topiramate in decreasing heavy-drinking days. Disulfiram has been commonly prescribed, but little evidence supports its effectiveness outside of supervised settings. Other medications, including varenicline and baclofen, may be beneficial in reducing heavy alcohol use. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients who do not have mood disorders, but they may help patients who meet criteria for depression to decrease their alcohol intake. Systematic policies are needed to expand the use of medications when treating alcohol use disorder in inpatient and outpatient populations.

### Combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder [^114Sw4YZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a mental disorder characterised by a strong desire to consume alcohol and impaired control of alcohol use, with devastating consequences. Many people with AUD do not respond to psychosocial or pharmacological interventions when these are provided alone. Combining these interventions may improve the response to treatment, though evidence remains limited.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of AUD in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in November 2023, without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions versus pharmacological or psychosocial interventions alone, or no intervention/treatment as usual (TAU), in adults with AUD. Our primary outcomes were continuous abstinent participants, frequency of use (measured as heavy drinkers, percentages of abstinent days, heavy-drinking days), amount of use (number of drinks per drinking day), adverse events, serious adverse events, dropouts from treatment, and dropouts due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, performed random-effects meta-analyses, and evaluated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 21 RCTs (4746 participants). The most studied pharmacological and psychosocial interventions were naltrexone (81.0%) and cognitive behavioural therapy (66.7%), respectively. Most participants were men (74%), aged about 44 years, with AUD, without comorbid mental disorders or other substance use disorders; 15 RCTs detoxified participants before treatment. We judged 28.5% of the studies as at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, performance bias for objective and subjective outcomes, and detection bias for subjective outcomes; all studies were at low risk of detection bias for objective outcomes; 85.7% of studies were at low risk of attrition bias; 14.2% of studies were at low risk of reporting bias. 1) Compared to psychosocial intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions probably reduce the number of heavy drinkers (above the clinically meaningful threshold (MID) of 2%; absolute difference (AD) -10%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18% to -2%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97; 8 studies, 1609 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may increase continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 5%, 95% CI 1% to 11%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34; 6 studies, 1184 participants; low-certainty evidence). They probably have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; mean difference (MD) 4.16, 95% CI 1.24 to 7.08; 10 studies, 2227 participants);
- serious adverse events (MID 1%; AD -2%, 95% CI -3% to 0%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.12; 4 studies; 524 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD -3%, 95% CI -5% to 0%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01; 15 studies, 3021 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 2%, 95% CI 0% to 5%; RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.52; 8 studies, 1572 participants) (all moderate-certainty evidence). They may have little to no effect on:

- heavy-drinking days (MID 5%; MD -3.49, 95% CI -8.68 to 1.70; 4 studies, 470 participants);
- number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.01; 7 studies, 805 participants); and
- adverse events (MID 30%; AD 17%, 95% CI -5% to 46%; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.68; 4 studies, 508 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). 2) Compared to pharmacological intervention alone, combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on:

- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD -1.18, 95% CI -4.42 to 2.07; 2 studies, 1158 participants); and
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 1%, 95% CI -10 to 14%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.47; 3 studies, 1246 participants) (all low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about their effect on:

- continuous abstinent participants (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI -5% to 18%; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.40; 1 study, 241 participants);
- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD 2%, 95% CI -4% to 8%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 1 study, 917 participants);
- the number of drinks per drinking day (MID 1 drink; MD -2.40, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.82; 1 study, 241 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD -1%, 95% CI -3% to 6%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.72; 2 studies, 1165 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). 3) We are uncertain about the effect of combined pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, when compared to TAU, on:

- the number of heavy drinkers (MID 2%; AD -5%, 95% CI -13% to 2%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.03; 1 study, 616 participants);
- the rate of abstinent days (MID 8%; MD 3.43, 95% CI -1.32 to 8.18; 1 study, 616 participants);
- dropouts from treatment (MID 10%; AD 0%, 95% CI -10% to 15%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.65; 2 studies, 696 participants); and
- dropouts due to adverse events (MID 5%; AD 3%, 95% CI 0% to 15%; RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 12.67; 1 study, 616 participants) (all very low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

As implications for practice, our findings indicate that adding pharmacological to psychosocial interventions is safe and helps people with AUD recover. These conclusions are based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Given the few studies and very low-certainty evidence, any benefits of adding psychosocial to pharmacological interventions or comparing the combined intervention to TAU are less clear. As implications for research, further studies should investigate the effects of the combined intervention compared to pharmacotherapy or TAU.

Alcohol addiction: an area of large unmet medical needs

Excessive alcohol use accounts for about 5% of global disease burden and close to 6% of all deaths. By many measures, the harm from alcohol exceeds that from illicit drugs. A population of alcohol-addicted people with very heavy drinking, defined as > 100 or 60 g/day for males or females, respectively, are disproportionately affected. This population, ~0.8% of people aged 15–65 years in a group of European countries, accounts for about half of all liver cirrhosis cases, and has a life expectancy that is dramatically shortened, by 25 — 31 years.

Only about 25% of people with alcoholism ever receive treatment; for those who do, the lag from filling diagnostic criteria to receiving treatment is about a decade. This treatment gap is in large part caused by a lack of effective treatments with good patient acceptance. Behavioral treatments with support for efficacy exist, but their effect sizes are modest. Pharmacotherapies for alcoholism are few, have limited efficacy and patient acceptance, and their uptake in clinical practice is minimal. It is frequently claimed that alcoholism medications are not developed because their commercial potential would be small, but data suggest otherwise. The market in alcoholism treatment provision has been estimated to ~$35 billion/year in the US alone. However, treatment for the most part takes place outside the medical system. A lack of medications with robust effect sizes and good patient acceptance is a major reason for this situation, but other factors, such as insufficient physician training in addiction medicine, also contribute.

Alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy — recommendation for moderate-severe AUD states: "we recommend offering one of the following medications: - Naltrexone (oral or extended-release) - Topiramate" with "(Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended)". Evidence notes that "Two RCTs (183, 184) and three SRs/meta-analyses (185–187) showed moderate quality evidence that naltrexone and topiramate improved alcohol consumption outcomes for the treatment of AUD". Use guidance specifies that "These medications should be offered in conjunction with a psychosocial intervention and after considering the preferences of appropriately informed patients", that "Dosing of these pharmacotherapies should be consistent with medication trials and published recommendations", and that "In the absence of contraindications, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of one of these medications over another; therefore, treatment should be individualized considering patient preferences and history".

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^114DMazN]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is the cause of an ongoing public health crisis, and accounts for ~5% of global disease burden. A minority of people with recreational alcohol use develop alcohol addiction (hereafter equated with "alcohol dependence" or simply "alcoholism"), a condition characterized by a systematically biased choice preference for alcohol at the expense of healthy rewards, and continued use despite adverse consequences ("compulsivity"). Alcoholism is arguably the most pressing area of unmet medical needs in psychiatry, with only a small fraction of patients receiving effective, evidence-based treatments. Medications currently approved for the treatment of alcoholism have small effect sizes, and their clinical uptake is negligible. No mechanistically new medications have been approved since 2004, and promising preclinical results have failed to translate into novel treatments. This has contributed to a reemerging debate whether and to what extent alcohol addiction represents a medical condition, or reflects maladaptive choices without an underlying brain pathology. Here, we review this landscape, and discuss the challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities to retool drug development in this important therapeutic area.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^111qucMm]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is the cause of an ongoing public health crisis, and accounts for ~5% of global disease burden. A minority of people with recreational alcohol use develop alcohol addiction (hereafter equated with "alcohol dependence" or simply "alcoholism"), a condition characterized by a systematically biased choice preference for alcohol at the expense of healthy rewards, and continued use despite adverse consequences ("compulsivity"). Alcoholism is arguably the most pressing area of unmet medical needs in psychiatry, with only a small fraction of patients receiving effective, evidence-based treatments. Medications currently approved for the treatment of alcoholism have small effect sizes, and their clinical uptake is negligible. No mechanistically new medications have been approved since 2004, and promising preclinical results have failed to translate into novel treatments. This has contributed to a reemerging debate whether and to what extent alcohol addiction represents a medical condition, or reflects maladaptive choices without an underlying brain pathology. Here, we review this landscape, and discuss the challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities to retool drug development in this important therapeutic area.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^113cat4e]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Several medications approved for the treatment of alcohol addiction, and a few more with data supporting their off-label use might not seem so bad. The realities on the ground unfortunately paint a different picture. The medications reviewed in the section above are prescribed to a vanishingly small fraction of alcohol-addicted patients. Even within the US Veterans Health Administration, where prevalence of alcohol use disorders is high, and where systematic strategies for their identification are in place, only about 3% of patients diagnosed with alcoholism receive any prescription medication, while corresponding numbers have been estimated to 0.07% overall and 5.8% of those seeking specialty treatment elsewhere. A quarter century of considerable public investment in research funding, and of academic efforts to bring forward pharmacotherapies for alcohol addiction have had little if any impact on the real world of patients. This is arguably one of the key facts behind a growing backlash against the concept of addiction as a brain disease.

### Alcohol use disorders [^116rFP64]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Alcohol use disorders are common in developed countries, where alcohol is cheap, readily available, and heavily promoted. Common, mild disorders often remit in young adulthood, but more severe disorders can become chronic and need long-term medical and psychological management. Doctors are uniquely placed to opportunistically assess and manage alcohol use disorders, but in practice diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. Brief behavioural intervention is effective in primary care for hazardous drinkers and individuals with mild disorders. Brief interventions could also encourage early entry to treatment for people with more-severe illness who are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Sustained abstinence is the optimum outcome for severe disorder. The stigma that discourages treatment seeking needs to be reduced, and pragmatic approaches adopted for patients who initially reject abstinence as a goal. To engage people in one or more psychological and pharmacological treatments of equivalent effectiveness is more important than to advocate a specific treatment. A key research priority is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of most affected people who have comorbid mental and other drug use disorders.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an underrecognized, significant public health issue with adverse effects on individuals and society. An estimated 28.1 million adults in the US have AUD, which is associated with substantial morbidity, including increased rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and injuries. Alcohol-related deaths increased 70% from 2012 to 2022, with sharp increases observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 178 000 individuals in the US died in 2020 and 2021 from excessive alcohol use, a 23% increase from 2016 and 2017. An estimated 1 in 5 deaths among people aged 20 to 49 years are attributable to alcohol. Furthermore, alcohol-related morbidity and mortality are increasing rapidly among Black and Hispanic individuals, women, and people living in rural areas of the US.

Evidence-based treatments for AUD include behavioral therapies and medications. The 4 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications for AUD (MAUD), acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone (oral and extended-release injectable), are safe, relatively inexpensive, and cost-effective. Oral naltrexone and acamprosate have the strongest evidence for AUD treatment and are recommended by the American Psychiatric Association as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone may help with reducing heavy drinking and cravingand has been associated with reduced progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Acamprosate is associated with maintenance of abstinence from alcohol. Disulfiram may be less effective than other MAUD but can help decrease the likelihood of relapse among individuals adherent to the medication regimen; American Psychiatric Association clinical guidelines recommend disulfiram for patients with a goal of abstinence from alcohol. MAUD regimens differ based on route of administration (oral or injectable), dosing schedules, contraindications, adverse effect profiles, and the individual's ability to initiate medication while still drinking alcohol. Given these differences, true patient-centered care requires access to the range of medications. These medications are relatively low cost (< $50 for a 1-month supply), with the exception of injectable naltrexone, which is not available as generic (> $1000 per monthly injection). Despite clinical guideline recommendations, among the estimated 28.1 million adults identified in a community sample as meeting criteria for having AUD, less than 3% received MAUD in 2023 and less than 2% of Black and Hispanic individuals with AUD received MAUD.

### Baclofen for alcohol use disorder [^112eZeea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related impairments belong to the most widespread psychiatric disorders leading to specific psychophysical, affective and cognitive symptoms and consequences for psychosocial well-being and health. Alcohol consumption is increasingly becoming a problem in many developing regions and AUD prevalence is estimated at 4.1% worldwide, with highest prevalence in European countries (7.5%), and the North America (6.0%). Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating patients with AUD.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of baclofen for treating people with AUD, who are currently drinking, with the aim of achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two further databases and two clinical trials registries, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles. The date of the most recent search was 30 January 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for relapse prevention of AUD with placebo, no treatment or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs (1128 participants). All studies but three recruited fewer than 100 participants. Participants had a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria who were currently drinking. The mean age of participants was 48 years, and there were more men (69%), than women. All studies compared baclofen to placebo, except for one study that evaluated baclofen versus acamprosate. The included studies considered baclofen at different doses (range 10 mg a day to 150 mg a day). In all but one of the studies, participants in both the baclofen and placebo groups received psychosocial treatment or counselling of various intensity. We judged most of the studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias. We did not find any difference between baclofen and placebo for the primary outcomes: relapse-return to any drinking (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04; 5 studies, 781 participants, moderate certainty evidence); frequency of use by percentage of days abstinent (MD 0.39, 95% CI -11.51 to 12.29; 6 studies, 465 participants, low certainty evidence) and frequency of use by percentage of heavy drinking days at the end of treatment (MD 0.25, 95% CI -1.25 to 1.76; 3 studies, 186 participants, moderate certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.10; 4 studies, 430 participants, high certainty evidence); the dropout rate at the end of treatment (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.26, 8 studies, 977 participants, high certainty evidence) and dropout due to adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.07; 7 studies, 913 participants, high certainty evidence). We found evidence that baclofen increases amount of use (drink per drinking days), (MD 1.55, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.77; 2 studies, 72 participants, low certainty evidence). Among secondary outcomes, there was no difference on craving (MD 1.38, 95% CI -1.28 to 4.03, 5 studies, 469 participants), and anxiety (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.28; 5 trials, 509 participants). We found that baclofen increased depression (SMD 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.48; 3 studies, 387 participants). Concerning the specific adverse events we found that baclofen increased: vertigo (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.74; 7 studies, 858 participants), somnolence/sedation (RR 1.48, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.96; 8 studies, 946 participants), paraesthesia (RR 4.28, 95% CI 2.11 to 8.67; 4 studies, 593 participants), and muscle spasms/rigidity (RR 1.94, 95%CI 1.08 to 3.48; 3 studies, 551 participants). For all the other adverse events we did not find significant differences between baclofen and placebo. For the comparison baclofen versus acamprosate, we were only able to extract data for one outcome, craving. For this outcome, we found that baclofen increased craving compared with acamprosate (MD 14.62, 95% CI 12.72 to 16.52; 1 study, 49 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

None of the primary or secondary outcomes of the review showed evidence of a difference between baclofen and placebo. The high heterogeneity among primary studies results limits the interpretation of the summary estimate, the identification of moderators and mediators of baclofen's effects on alcohol use remains a challenge for further research. Even though some results from RCTs are promising, current evidence remains uncertain regarding the use of baclofen as a first-line treatment for people with AUDs.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder [^113DpUxm]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen adults for alcohol misuse and provide persons engaged in risky or hazardous drinking behaviors with brief behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol misuse. However, only a minority of American adults with high-risk alcohol use receive treatment. Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder… [^117R7DH4]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Medications for the Treatment of AUD An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review that included 135 studies of pharmacologic treatment of AUD in outpatient settings found moderate evidence to support the use of naltrexone and acamprosate, and insufficient evidence to support the use of disulfiram. The review also concluded that the evidence was lacking for most other medications, including those for off-label use and those undergoing trials. However, there is some evidence for topiramate and valproic acid. Naltrexone. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, reduces alcohol consumption in patients with AUD, and is more successful in those who are abstinent before starting the medication. 8 The opioid receptor system mediates the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Alcohol ingestion stimulates endogenous opioid release and increases dopamine transmission. Naltrexone blocks these effects, reducing euphoria and cravings.

20 Naltrexone is available in oral and injectable long-acting formulations. A Cochrane review that included 50 randomized trials and 7, 793 patients found that oral naltrexone decreased heavy drinking and slightly decreased daily drinking. The number of heavy drinking days and the amount of alcohol consumed also decreased. Injectable naltrexone did not decrease heavy drinking, but the sample size was small. A Cochrane review of 25 trials including 2, 641 patients showed that those taking an anticonvulsant consumed 1. 5 fewer drinks per day than those taking placebo. Ondansetron. Ondansetron may decrease alcohol consumption in patients with AUD.

In three studies, ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased alcohol consumption and cravings and increased abstinence in young adults with early AUD. 39–41 In another trial, a higher dosage of ondansetron combined with cognitive behavior therapy decreased depression, anxiety, and hostility.

### Improving the utilisation of medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder at discharge [^1149rTwh]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Lessons and limitations

Our project aimed to improve the utilisation of an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder to reduce unhealthy drinking and decrease the healthcare and societal costs of excessive alcohol use. We anticipated significant barriers to using MAT for alcohol use disorder, given low rates of use nationally. However, a key lesson from our project was the success in combining structural changes and education interventions. Adding MAT medications to the formulary and automatically recommending MAT through the EMR during the hospitalisation improved the convenience of prescribing MAT. Just-in-time teaching, handouts and brief talks to relevant prescribers helped reduce stigma and improve prescriber and patient knowledge of MAT.

During PDSA cycle 1, we received feedback that discharge was an inconvenient time to discuss and initiate a new medication. This could have been reflected in the rapid increase in our primary outcome measure after the educational interventions, followed by a more modest increase as time progressed. During PDSA cycle 2, we sought to create an opportunity to discuss and initiate MAT earlier in the hospital course, including at admission when the suspicion for alcohol withdrawal is often the highest. These further interventions led to a rapid increase in prescribing to meet our project goal.

While we achieved our goals, there still may be opportunity to increase MAT usage among our patient population. Nearly all patients treated for withdrawal also received a consult from the substance use navigator service, indicating at least some openness to decreasing their use. While the navigators are not prescribers, including familiarity with and regular suggestion to discuss MAT with their prescriber in their practice may lead further patients to initiate MAT. As previously discussed, only 11.3% of US people in 2019 who received any treatment for alcohol use disorder were prescribed MAT. In our study, a sizeable proportion of patients who sought treatment may have preferred psychotherapy or peer support groups without medication due to safety concerns or other considerations. We were unable to track referrals to therapy or peer support for this intervention but doing so is an opportunity for future study. In addition, while the patients that we targeted who were treated for alcohol withdrawal meet at least some of the criteria for alcohol use disorder, we may have missed a sizeable portion of patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder who are not treated for withdrawal. Besides our education interventions to prescribers, our project did not directly target these patients. Our project did not see an effect on readmission rates, yet as the use of MAT increases, we hope to understand better which patients are more likely to receive MAT and why they are readmitted.

### Predicting individual treatment response in alcohol use disorders: a reverse translational proof-of-concept study [^111zZxrH]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) represent a worldwide unmet medical emergency accounting for 3 million yearly deaths globally. The AUD prevalence in Europe and in the Americas is estimated at 8–12% across genders, with peaks of 17% in the USA and > 22% in eastern Europe; similar prevalence is found in developing and westernizing countries.

Alcohol dependence has long been recognized as a clinical syndrome. However, notwithstanding the bulk of time and resources dedicated to study this condition, and the fairly advanced biological characterization achieved, approved AUD medications show limited and heterogeneous efficacy. In addition, in spite of the high expectancy and effort devoted, promising targets have failed to translate into clinical use. These failures brought despondency in professionals working in the field of psychiatric disorders in general, and of addiction in particular, and led major pharmaceutical companies to abandon drug research and development (R&D) in this field as it is perceived as at high risk of business. Indeed, psychiatric drugs are the longest and more expensive to develop, and those with the lowest clinical approval success rate.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting, such as a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for monotherapy. Administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity as another strategy. Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Overview of alcohol use disorder [^115RT2i4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is regularly consumed throughout most of the world, including by nearly half the U.S. population age 12 or older. Heavy drinking, which is also common, contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose current U.S. prevalence is 11%. However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis receiving any treatment. Risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is also effective. The three medications approved in the United States to treat AUD-disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate-are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are used off-label. Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically. Despite the growing availability of efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for AUD, it remains a highly stigmatized condition. Research aimed at enhancing the identification and treatment of AUD, including precision therapeutics, could broaden the acceptability of AUD treatment, benefiting affected individuals and their families and reducing the stigma associated with the disorder.

### Pharmacogenetic approaches to the treatment of alcohol addiction [^114fUZEx]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Addictive disorders are partly heritable, chronic, relapsing conditions that account for a tremendous disease burden. Currently available addiction pharmacotherapies are only moderately successful, continue to be viewed with considerable scepticism outside the scientific community and have not become widely adopted as treatments. More effective medical treatments are needed to transform addiction treatment and address currently unmet medical needs. Emerging evidence from alcoholism research suggests that no single advance can be expected to fundamentally change treatment outcomes. Rather, studies of opioid, corticotropin-releasing factor, GABA and serotonin systems suggest that incremental advances in treatment outcomes will result from an improved understanding of the genetic heterogeneity among patients with alcohol addiction, and the development of personalized treatments.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with alcohol use disorders in outpatient settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11371CXP]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorders cause substantial morbidity and early mortality yet remain greatly undertreated. Medications are considerably underused.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of medications (US FDA-approved and others) for adults with alcohol use disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, FDA website, and clinical trials registries (January 1, 1970, to March 1, 2014).

Study Selection

Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks' duration that reported eligible outcomes and head-to-head prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes or harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTs) or harm (NNHs).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

We included 122 RCTs and 1 cohort study (total 22,803 participants). Most assessed acamprosate (27 studies, n = 7519), naltrexone (53 studies, n = 9140), or both. The NNT to prevent return to any drinking for acamprosate was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; risk difference [RD], -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.04) and was 20 (95% CI, 11 to 500; RD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.002) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). The NNT to prevent return to heavy drinking was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; RD -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). Meta-analyses of trials comparing acamprosate to naltrexone found no statistically significant difference between them for return to any drinking (RD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.08) or heavy drinking (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06). For injectable naltrexone, meta-analyses found no association with return to any drinking (RD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.03) or heavy drinking (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.13) but found an association with reduction in heavy drinking days (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.6%; 95% CI, -8.5% to -0.56%). Among medications used off-label, moderate evidence supports an association with improvement in some consumption outcomes for nalmefene (heavy drinking days per month: WMD, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.0; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.02; 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.28) and topiramate (% heavy drinking days: WMD, -9.0%; 95% CI, -15.3% to -2.7%; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.48). For naltrexone and nalmefene, NNHs for withdrawal from trials due to adverse events were 48 (95% CI, 30 to 112) and 12 (95% CI, 7 to 50), respectively; risk was not significantly increased for acamprosate or topiramate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Both acamprosate and oral naltrexone were associated with reduction in return to drinking. When directly compared with one another, no significant differences were found between acamprosate and naltrexone for controlling alcohol consumption. Factors such as dosing frequency, potential adverse events, and availability of treatments may guide medication choice.

### Supervised disulfiram should be considered first-line treatment for alcohol use disorder [^115Q6Zrt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the United States, the armamentarium of FDA-approved medications available for AUD treatment is remarkably small. Disulfiram, 1 of only 3 approved medications, is consistently designated as a second-line option in national treatment guidelines, citing inconsistent evidence, lack of patient preference, and safety concerns. These concerns, however, stem from a misguided interpretation of the evidence that exclusively relies upon double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT). When viewed instead as both a medication and a behavioral intervention, open-label RCTs become a more appropriate research method, yielding overwhelmingly favorable efficacy data for disulfiram, and supervised disulfiram, in particular. With these data in mind, supervised disulfiram should be redesignated as a first-line intervention in both treatment guideline creation and clinical pathway tools. The addiction medicine community can no longer afford to neglect this critical therapeutic resource.

### Topiramate treatment of alcohol use disorder in clinical practice [^115Bm8wR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication with increasingly strong evidence, supporting its use for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) based on clinical trials. These clinical cases summarize the initiation and titration of topiramate in AUD treatment. The core issues of patient selection, consideration of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions, side-effect profile, safety and effectiveness are reviewed. Addiction physicians should take a leading role in using topiramate to treat AUDs, working with patients to balance the benefits of topiramate with the risk.

### Sobering perspectives on the treatment of alcohol use disorder… [^115PtTqg]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Treatment options for the 30 million individuals with alcohol use disorder 4 in the US include behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy. Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are 3 approved drugs for treating AUD. Since disulfiram works only through aversive effects, with no impact on the desire to drink, it tends to work best in supervised settings and with highly motivated patients with strong social supports. 5 A recent systematic review suggested the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 person from returning to drinking was 11 for acamprosate and 18 for oral naltrexone. 1 Naltrexone use, in addition, was associated with a substantial decrease in heavy drinking. 1 Moreover, these drugs are well tolerated by patients with minimal side effects. In this population-based study, Bernstein et al7 report on MAUD prescribing to Medicare patients with alcohol-related hospitalizations.

7 In a propensity score–matched analysis, receipt of a prescription for either naltrexone, acamprosate, or disulfiram was associated with a 42% lower risk of all-cause mortality or hospital readmission within the next month. 7 Roughly 6 patients would need to fill a prescription for MAUD to prevent 1 repeat emergency visit or hospital admission within a month. The substantial effect size was primarily driven by reductions in all-cause rehospitalization. This study provides an estimate of the effect of prescribing MAUD to patients following an alcohol-related hospitalization. The results also reaffirm the underuse of MAUD: among the nearly 10 000 admitted patients eligible for study inclusion, only 1 in 50 filled a discharge prescription. 7 This low rate of use is consistent with past studies.

6, 8 However, the infrequency of prescriptions raises questions about the external generalizability and the extent to which the dramatic reduction in subsequent use of acute care services reflects the effects of MAUD alone. An important question is how the results of this study should influence clinical practice. Despite its methodological shortcomings, this study by Bernstein et al7 highlights the benefits of prescribing MAUD at hospital discharge — benefits consistent with those seen in clinical trials. 1 In addition, the study provides a compelling argument for clinicians to offer MAUD to all hospitalized patients with AUD. 7 During a hospitalization, patients experience health vulnerability which may drive behavior change. Implementation of a discharge pathway for patients with AUD on internal medicine wards was associated with substantially increased prescribing. 14.

### Disulfiram should remain second-line treatment for most patients with alcohol use disorder [^112PE2MB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is responsible for a significant burden of medical, economic, and social harm globally and across the United States. Currently, only three FDA-approved medications for AUD are available, and most patients with AUD never receive pharmacotherapy. Disulfiram, the first medication that FDA approved for treatment of AUD, is recommended as a second-line treatment option by several national treatment guidelines citing safety concerns and lack of high-quality comparative studies. In this issue, Holt argues that disulfiram should be reclassified as a first-line treatment for AUD based on promising open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for disulfiram as a behavioral intervention. Review of the literature suggests that disulfiram can be a useful treatment for a highly selected group of patients with no medical or psychiatric contraindications, high motivation for abstinence, and adequate family support. Unfortunately, many patients with AUD, a disorder characterized by high rates of medical and psychiatric multimorbidity and social vulnerability, fall outside of this narrow selection criteria. Prescribers should consider other FDA-approved medications as first-line treatment options for most patients with AUD, reserving disulfiram for the rare patients in whom the potential for benefit clearly outweighs risk of harm.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^113dwQtZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

It should also be noted that a deep understanding of a drug's mechanism of action is in no way a condition sine qua non to therapeutic efficacy. After all, the site of action of substances, such as cocaine has been known for decades and yet there is no better advancement in therapeutics for cocaine addiction. Also, alcohol's known actions on the dopamine system have been targeted many times, with negative or even detrimental outcomes in all these trials (reviewed in ref.). It has become clear that, without the ability to determine the specific state of an individual's dopamine system and its responsivity, direct pharmacological interference with DA receptors and transporters is unlikely to succeed as a viable treatment approach.

The failure so far to achieve more than at best marginal gains in alcoholism treatment through pharmacotherapy strongly suggest that business as usual in alcoholism research should not be considered an acceptable option. Non-medical strategies, such as addressing societal factors that promote addictionand implementing policies that limit alcohol consumptionshould of course be pursued to reduce the disease burden from alcohol use, but do not replace effective medical treatments for people who nevertheless develop alcohol addiction, in particular the population of people with dependence and very heavy drinking.

### Reductions in World Health Organization risk drinking level are associated with reductions in alcohol use disorder diagnosis and criteria: evidence from an alcohol pharmacotherapy trial [^115yunbq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the validity of World Health Organization (WHO) risk drinking level reductions as meaningful endpoints for clinical practice and research. This study examined whether such reductions were associated with a lower likelihood of a current alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis and fewer AUD criteria.

Methods

We conducted a secondary data analysis to address these objectives using data from a multisite randomized controlled trial of gabapentin enacarbil extended release in treating moderate to severe AUD among adults (N = 346). Participants received gabapentin enacarbil extended release or placebo for 6 months. The timeline follow-back was used to assess WHO risk drinking level reductions, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) AUD diagnosis and criteria at baseline (past year) and end of treatment (past month).

Results

Most participants (80.1%) achieved at least a 1-level reduction in the WHO risk drinking levels from baseline to end of treatment, and nearly half of participants (49.8%) achieved at least a 2-level reduction. At least a 1-level reduction or at least a 2-level reduction in WHO risk drinking level predicted lower odds of an active AUD diagnosis (1-level: odds ratio, 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66–0.84]; 2-level: odds ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64–0.79]) and fewer AUD criteria (1-level: B, -1.66 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.98]; 2-level: B, -1.76 [95% CI, -2.31 to -1.21]) at end of treatment.

Conclusions

World Health Organization risk drinking level reductions correlate with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) AUD diagnosis and criteria, providing further evidence for their use as endpoints in alcohol intervention trials, which has potential implications for broadening the base of AUD treatment.

### Pharmacotherapies for adults with alcohol use disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111yu1FJ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine medications' comparative efficacy and safety for adults with alcohol use disorders.

Methods

We searched eleven electronic data sources for randomized clinical trials with at least 4 weeks of treatment reporting on alcohol consumption (total abstinence and reduced heavy drinking), dropouts, and dropouts due to adverse events. We conducted network meta-analyses using random-effects, frequentist models, and calculated summary rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

We included 156 trials (N = 27,334). Nefazodone (RR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.42–3.13), aripiprazole (RR = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.36–2.88), carbamazepine (RR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03–3.32), and nalmefene (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01–1.35) were associated with the most dropouts. Baclofen (RR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.97) and pregabalin (RR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43–0.94) caused fewer dropouts than placebo. Nalmefene (RR = 3.26; 95% CI, 2.34–4.55), fluvoxamine (RR = 3.08; 95% CI, 1.59–5.94), and topiramate (RR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.36–3.51) caused more dropouts from adverse events over placebo. Gamma-hydroxy-butyrate (RR = 1.90; 95% CI, 1.03–3.53), baclofen (RR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.39–2.34), disulfiram (RR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.39–2.10), gabapentin (RR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.04–2.67), acamprosate (RR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15–1.54), and oral naltrexone (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01–1.32) improved total abstinence over placebo (Fig. 3C). For reduced heavy drinking, disulfiram (RR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10–0.35), baclofen (RR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.91), acamprosate (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.86), and oral naltrexone (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.90) were efficacious against placebo.

Conclusions

The current meta-analyses provide evidence that several medications for AUDs are effective and safe and encourage the expanded use of these medications in the clinical setting. Our review found that acamprosate (2–3 g/d), disulfiram (250–500 mg/d), baclofen (30 mg/d), and oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) had the best evidence for improving abstinence and heavy drinking for patients with AUD.

### The impact of alcohol use severity on anxiety treatment outcomes in a large effectiveness trial in primary care [^116g387h]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The presence of anxiety disorders is associated with poorer alcohol use disorder treatment outcomes, but little is known about the impact of alcohol use problems on anxiety disorder treatment outcomes despite their high comorbidity. The current study examined the impact of alcohol use symptom severity on anxiety disorder treatment outcomes in a multi-site primary care effectiveness study of anxiety disorder treatment.

Method

Data came from the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) effectiveness trial. Participants (N = 1004) were randomized to an evidence-based anxiety intervention (including cognitive behavioral therapy and medications) or usual care in primary care. Participants completed measures of alcohol use, anxiety, and depression at baseline, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up periods. Patients with alcohol dependence were excluded.

Results

There were no significant moderating (Treatment Group × Alcohol Use Severity) interactions. The majority of analyses revealed no predictive effects of alcohol use severity on outcome; however, alcohol problems at baseline were associated with somewhat higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the 18-month follow-up.

Conclusions

These data indicate that patients with alcohol problems in primary care can be effectively treated for anxiety disorders. Baseline alcohol problems were associated with some poorer long-term outcomes, but this was evident across CALM and usual care. These findings provide preliminary evidence that there may be no need to postpone treatment of anxiety disorders until alcohol problems are addressed, at least among those who have mild to moderate alcohol problems. Replication with more severe alcohol use disorders is needed.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: outpatient management [^113E6nER]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.

### Baclofen for alcohol use disorder [^116AwnMx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most widespread psychiatric disorders leading to detrimental consequences to people with this disorder and others. Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (30-day prevalence of at least one occasion of 60 g of pure alcohol intake among current drinkers) is estimated at 20% and the prevalence of AUD at 5% of the adult general population, with highest prevalence in Europe and North America. Therapeutic approaches, including pharmacotherapy, play an important role in treating people with AUD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2018.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of baclofen on achieving and maintaining abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption in people with AUD compared to placebo, no treatment or any other pharmacological relapse prevention treatment.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 22 November 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' treatment duration and 12 weeks' overall study duration comparing baclofen for AUD treatment with placebo, no treatment or other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. relapse, 2. frequency of use, 3. amount of use, 4. adverse events, 5. dropouts from treatment and 6. dropouts from treatment due to adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 7. craving, 8. anxiety, 9. depression and 10. frequency of most relevant adverse events.

Main Results

We included 17 RCTs (1818 participants) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition or International Classification of Diseases 10th edition criteria. Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments. We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias. Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg). Compared to placebo, moderate-certainty evidence found that baclofen probably decreases the risk to relapse (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.99; 12 studies, 1057 participants). This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants. High-certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants). This result was confirmed among all subgroups of participants except non-detoxified or those who received medium doses. There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD -0.45, 95% CI -1.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high-certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high-certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high-certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulted lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants). Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events. Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low-certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low-certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low-certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low-certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI -11.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated. Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low-certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI -3.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated.

Authors' Conclusions

Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^117JPGDc]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Current options

Medications with three mechanisms are currently approved for the treatment of alcohol addiction by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The oldest, the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram, remains most widely used. Its mechanism of action is peripheral, and cannot alleviate craving or other subjective states associated with alcoholism. Its use is associated with low compliance, and does not have support for significant efficacy unless administered under supervision. Disulfiram continues to have a place in clinical practice when sobriety needs to be ensured for some time, for instance to diagnose psychiatric co-morbidity. It is otherwise of limited interest for the present discussion.

Proof-of-principle for a neuropharmacological intervention in alcohol addiction was first provided by the mu-preferring opioid antagonist naltrexone –. Opioid peptides with activity at mu-receptors are released by alcohol intake, and contribute to alcohol reward –. Naltrexone is thought to interfere with this cascade. The overall effect size of naltrexone is modest, but this represents an average of a heterogeneous response, that varies strongly as a function of individual patient characteristics. Among these characteristics, predictors of clinical response include a family history of alcohol problems, early onset of problem drinking, being male, experiencing strong alcohol reward-related memories or cravings, and complying with treatment. The role of compliance can be viewed in light of extensive empirical data in support of the notion that opioid transmission plays a key role for the "liking" of natural rewards. Based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that naltrexone has a potential to attenuate healthy rewards, and that this limits the incentive to seek and comply with this treatment. A depot formulation of naltrexone was developed to improve compliance, but high cost limits its use. Another opioid antagonist approved for alcoholism treatment in Europe, nalmefene, shares its main mechanism of action with naltrexone, making major differences in clinical profile unlikely.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1145zm9j]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — anticonvulsants and adjuncts — reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

### A meta-analysis of the efficacy of gabapentin for treating alcohol use disorder [^111RqAdL]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Studies of the efficacy of gabapentin for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) have yielded mixed findings. The aims of our study were to estimate gabapentin's effects on six alcohol-related outcomes, test potential moderators, examine publication bias and evaluate the quality of the studies.

Methods

Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Using PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, we selected RCTs of gabapentin's effects on alcohol consumption or a biochemical correlate of it, excluding studies limited to other primary outcomes or that combined gabapentin with other medications. We assessed study quality and used a random-effects model to analyze each outcome measure and the Egger regression test and funnel plots to assess publication bias.

Results

We identified seven RCTs of gabapentin that met study criteria. The quality of the studies overall was good, and there was no evidence of publication bias. Four to seven studies contributed to the analysis of the six outcome measures. For all outcome measures the effect estimates were in a direction that favored gabapentin over placebo. However, only for percentage of heavy drinking days was there good evidence of a benefit (g = -0.64, 95% confidence interval = -1.22 to -0.06).

Conclusions

Although gabapentin appears to be more efficacious than placebo in treating AUD, the only measure on which the analysis clearly favors the active medication is percentage of heavy drinking days. Additional studies are needed to define more clearly the role of gabapentin in AUD treatment.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114mZAq9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acamprosate — alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy: Meta-analyses found acamprosate improved alcohol consumption outcomes relative to placebo, most notably return to drinking after abstinence, and acamprosate may act by normalizing central glutamatergic dysregulation in AUD. Trials have been discordant, with numerous European trials finding effectiveness while some U.S. trials failed to show such benefits, and European studies showing significantly reduced risk of discontinuing treatment whereas trials in the rest of the world demonstrated increased risk of treatment discontinuation associated with acamprosate. The divided dose administration three times daily and large tablet size presents a challenge and can negatively affect adherence; patients who are highly motivated, abstinent before initiation, and not discouraged by the burden of three times-daily dosing are well suited for acamprosate, and acamprosate may be considered for patients also taking prescribed opioids or with significant hepatic damage/impairment since it is not subject to hepatic clearance. Moderate quality evidence of significantly elevated rates of certain adverse events (e.g., anxiety, diarrhea, vomiting) suggests some level of harm, yet the same moderate quality evidence supports significantly reduced return to any drinking and drinking days in outpatient specialty care, with very low to low quality evidence showing no significant between-group differences in return to heavy drinking and heavy drinking days.

### An intensive longitudinal examination of topiramate treatment for alcohol use disorder: a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial [^112nNYzn]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Previous findings have been equivocal as to whether a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2832407) in GRIK1, which encodes a glutamate receptor subunit, moderates the effects of topiramate treatment for drinking reduction. We leveraged intensive longitudinal data to provide greater precision and allow an examination of intermediate outcomes addressing this question. We used data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypotheses that topiramate treatment reduces daily heavy drinking, desire to drink and positive alcohol expectancies and that these effects are stronger in rs2832407*C-allele homozygotes.

Design

Secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial.

Setting

University of Pennsylvania Treatment Research Center in the United States.

Participants/Cases

Participants were 164 individuals (70.1% male, mean age = 51.42, 36.0% rs2832407*C-allele homozygotes) who sought to reduce or stop drinking.

Intervention and Comparator

Participants were assigned to medication (topiramate or placebo), with stratification by genotype group (CC versus AA/AC) and treatment goal (reduce versus abstain).

Measurements

During the 12-week treatment period, participants completed daily interactive voice response (IVR) surveys.

Findings

On any given day during treatment, participants who received topiramate had lower odds of IVR-reported heavy drinking [odds ratio (OR) = 0.259, b (standard error, SE) = -1.351 (0.334), P < 0.001] and lower levels of desire to drink [b (SE) = -0.323 (0.122), P = 0.009] and positive alcohol expectancies [b (SE) = -0.347 (0.138), P = 0.013] than those who received placebo. Participants who received topiramate also reported greater reductions in positive alcohol expectancies during the first 2 weeks of treatment than those who received placebo [b (SE) = -0.028 (0.008), P = 0.001], but topiramate did not impact the daily rate of change in heavy drinking or desire to drink. Genotype did not moderate the effects of topiramate on any outcomes examined (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Topiramate is an effective medication for individuals seeking to reduce heavy drinking. The effects are not moderated by the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2832407.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112W2q4U]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the most effective interventions in recently detoxified, alcohol dependent patients for implementation in primary care.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Study selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more interventions that could be used in primary care. The population was patients with alcohol dependency diagnosed by standardised clinical tools and who became detoxified within four weeks.

Data extraction

Outcomes of interest were continuous abstinence from alcohol (effectiveness) and all cause dropouts (as a proxy for acceptability) at least 12 weeks after start of intervention.

Results

64 trials (43 interventions) were included. The median probability of abstinence across placebo arms was 25%. Compared with placebo, the only intervention associated with increased probability of abstinence and moderate certainty evidence was acamprosate (odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.33, corresponding to an absolute probability of 38%). Of the 62 included trials that reported all cause dropouts, interventions associated with a reduced number of dropouts compared with placebo (probability 50%) and moderate certainty of evidence were acamprosate (0.73, 0.62 to 0.86; 42%), naltrexone (0.70, 0.50 to 0.98; 41%), and acamprosate-naltrexone (0.30, 0.13 to 0.67; 17%). Acamprosate was the only intervention associated with moderate confidence in the evidence of effectiveness and acceptability up to 12 months. It is uncertain whether other interventions can help maintain abstinence and reduce dropouts because of low confidence in the evidence.

Conclusions

Evidence is lacking for benefit from interventions that could be implemented in primary care settings for alcohol abstinence, other than for acamprosate. More evidence from high quality randomised controlled trials is needed, as are strategies using combined interventions (combinations of drug interventions or drug and psychosocial interventions) to improve treatment of alcohol dependency in primary care.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders [^114U8rKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are a potentially disabling group of disorders that frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorders. Comorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders are associated with poorer outcomes, and are difficult to treat with standard psychosocial interventions. In addition, improved understanding of the biological basis of the conditions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medications for the treatment of people with both diagnoses.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders, specifically: to provide an estimate of the overall effects of medication in improving treatment response and reducing symptom severity in the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with comorbid alcohol use disorders; to determine whether specific medications are more effective and tolerable than other medications in the treatment of particular anxiety disorders; and to identify which factors (clinical, methodological) predict response to pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.

Search Methods

Review authors searched the specialized registers of The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR, to January 2014) and the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG, to March 2013) for eligible trials. These registers contain reports of relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Review authors ran complementary searches on EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH) (to August 2013). We located unpublished trials through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER service and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to August 2013). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All true RCTs of pharmacotherapy for treating anxiety disorders with comorbid alcohol use disorders. Trials assessing drugs administered for the treatment of drinking behaviour, such as naltrexone, disulfiram and acomprosate were not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

A systematic review is a standardised evaluation of all research studies that address a particular clinical issue. Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We calculated categorical and continuous treatment effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for treatment using a random-effects model with effect-size variability expressed using Chi(2) and I(2) heterogeneity statistics.

Main Results

We included five placebo-controlled pharmacotherapy RCTs (with 290 participants) in the review. Most of the trials provided little information on how randomization was performed or on whether both participants and study personnel were blinded to the intervention. Two of the three trials reporting superiority of medication compared with placebo on anxiety symptom outcomes were industry funded. We regarded one trial as being at high risk of bias due to selective reporting. Study participants had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) III- and DSM IV-diagnosed alcohol use disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (two studies), social anxiety disorder (SAD; two studies) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; one study). Four trials assessed the efficacy of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine); one RCT investigated the efficacy of buspirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) partial agonist. Treatment duration lasted between eight and 24 weeks. Overall, 70% of participants included in the review were male. There was very low quality evidence for an effect of paroxetine on global clinical response to treatment, as assessed by the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale (CGI-I). Global clinical response was observed in more than twice as many participants with paroxetine than with placebo (57.7% with paroxetine versus 25.8% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 2.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.41; 2 trials, 57 participants). However, there was substantial uncertainty regarding the size of the effect of paroxetine due to the small number of studies providing data on clinically diverse patient samples. The second primary outcome measure was reduction of anxiety symptom severity. Although study investigators reported that buspirone (one trial) was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of anxiety symptoms over 12 weeks, no evidence of efficacy was observed for paroxetine (mean difference (MD) -14.70, 95% CI -33.00 to 3.60, 2 trials, 44 participants) and sertraline (one trial). Paroxetine appeared to be equally effective in reducing the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine in one RCT. The maximal reduction in anxiety disorder symptom severity was achieved after six weeks with paroxetine (two RCTs) and 12 weeks with buspirone (one RCT), with maintenance of medication efficacy extending to 16 with paroxetine and 24 weeks with buspirone. There was no evidence of an effect for any of the medications tested on abstinence from alcohol use or depression symptoms. There was very low quality evidence that paroxetine was well tolerated, based on drop-out due to treatment-emergent adverse effects. Nevertheless, levels of treatment discontinuation were high, with 43.1% of the participants in the studies withdrawing from medication treatment. Certain adverse effects, such as sexual problems, were commonly reported after treatment with paroxetine and sertraline.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence-base for the effectiveness of medication in treating anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorders is currently inconclusive. There was a small amount of evidence for the efficacy of medication, but this was limited and of very low quality. The majority of the data for the efficacy and tolerability of medication were for SSRIs; there were insufficient data to establish differences in treatment efficacy between medication classes or patient subgroups. There was a small amount of very low quality evidence that medication was well tolerated. There was no evidence that alcohol use was responsive to medication. Large, rigorously conducted RCTs would help supplement the small evidence-base for the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for anxiety and comorbid alcohol use disorders. Further research on patient subgroups who may benefit from pharmacological treatment, as well as novel pharmacological interventions, is warranted.

### Improving the utilisation of medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder at discharge [^1179h9da]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder, a constellation of behaviours and symptoms related to dependence and abuse, was present in 11.0% of US adults in 2020. Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of death and healthcare expenditures in the USA, accounting for 1 in 10 deathsand an average of 29 years of life lost per death. Economically, alcohol use is estimated to cost around US$249 billion annually in lost productivity, healthcare expenditures and social costs.

MAT is an approach to substance use disorders that combines medication with behavioural interventions. Currently, there are three United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the treatment of alcohol use disorder: naltrexone (available oral and as long-acting injectable), acamprosate and disulfiram. Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist that is well tolerated, with reported effects of reduced cravings, reduced relapse rates and an overall decrease in alcohol use. It is estimated to reduce the risk of return to heavy drinking by 17% and trended towards abstinence. Acamprosate's mechanism is still unknown but it has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of any drinking by 14% and maintain abstinence drinking.

MAT remains underused nationally as only 1.1% of adults with alcohol use disorder reported receiving MAT in 2020. While many patients may refuse medication, a survey of outpatient providers noted lack of comfort and knowledge as the most common reasons for avoiding pharmacotherapy. An educational intervention combined with a new discharge protocol at a tertiary medical centre showed a significant increase in naltrexone prescriptions and reduced all-cause emergency department visits and inpatient readmissions.

### Real-world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol use disorders in a Swedish nation-wide cohort of 125 556 patients [^1139ZyWY]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) cause health problems and are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity world‐wide. More than 5% of the global disease burden is caused by harmful use of alcohol, and in 2016 more than 3 million people died due to alcohol‐related causes. The harmful use of alcohol is associated with risk of mental and behavioral disorders, and regular alcohol abuse can lead to serious somatic diseases. Alcohol use also increases the risk of injuries resulting from violence and accidents.

The mainstay of AUD treatment is psychosocial intervention, but combining psychosocial treatments with pharmacotherapy can lead to better outcomes. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are approved for the treatment of AUD in the United States and Europe. Nalmefene is also approved in Europe. According to the latest meta‐analyses and systematic reviews on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), these medications have shown their efficacy in comparison with placebo: disulfiram under supervision to advance treatment adherence, acamprosate in maintaining abstinence, naltrexone, especially in reducing binge drinking, and nalmefene in reducing heavy drinking days. Despite their potential to improve clinical outcome for individuals with AUD, these medications are under‐utilized. Deficient knowledge of these medications and possible doubts about their effectiveness may lead to the low utilization rate. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as pharmacotherapy for managing alcohol withdrawal, but not recommended for use after detoxification. Nonetheless, benzodiazepine misuse is common among people with AUD. All mentioned medications can cause some adverse effects, disulfiram even fatal ones, but very little is known about overall health outcomes (such as risks of hospitalization and mortality) associated with specific treatments in real‐world circumstances. Furthermore, the possible association of specific treatments with work‐related outcomes (such as sickness absences and disability pensions) is less well established, despite the fact that AUD has a strong effect on work performance. As patients included in RCTs are highly selected populations, it is not known how effective treatments are in non‐selected patient population in real‐world treatment settings.

The aim of this study is to investigate the real‐world effectiveness of pharmacological treatments of alcohol dependence on (1) risk of hospitalization due to AUD as a main outcome and (2) hospitalization due to any cause, alcohol‐related somatic causes and work disability and death as secondary outcomes.

### Targeted oral naltrexone for mild to moderate alcohol use disorder among sexual and gender minority men: a randomized trial [^116QQAbD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors sought to determine the efficacy of targeted naltrexone in sexual and gender minority men (SGM) who binge drink and have mild to moderate alcohol use disorder.

Methods

In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a total of 120 SGM who binge drink and have mild to moderate alcohol use disorder were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive targeted oral naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo with weekly counseling for 12 weeks. The study's primary endpoints were binge-drinking intensity, defined as 1) number of drinks in the past 30 days; 2) any binge drinking in the past week; 3) number of binge-drinking days in the past week; and 4) number of drinking days in the past week. The study also measured changes in alcohol use with two alcohol biomarker measures: ethyl glucuronide in urine samples and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) in dried blood spot samples.

Results

Ninety-three percent completed the trial, with 85% of weekly follow-up visits completed. In intention-to-treat analyses, naltrexone was associated with a significantly reduced reported number of binge-drinking days (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56, 0.98; number needed to treat [NNT] = 2), weeks with any binge drinking (IRR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72, 0.96; NNT = 7.4), number of drinks per month (IRR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.52, 0.91; NNT = 5.7 for 10 drinks), and alcohol craving scores (coefficient = -9.25, 95% CI = -17.20, -1.31). In as-treated analyses among those who took their medication on average at least 2.5 days per week (the median frequency in the study), naltrexone reduced any binge drinking (IRR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.99), number of binge-drinking days (IRR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.96), and PEth concentrations (coefficient = -55.47, 95% CI = -110.75, -0.20). At 6 months posttreatment, naltrexone had sustained effects in number of drinks per month (IRR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.97), number of binge-drinking days (IRR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.95), and any binge drinking in the past week (IRR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63, 0.99).

Conclusions

Targeted naltrexone significantly reduced drinking outcomes among SGM with mild to moderate alcohol use disorder during treatment, with sustained effects at 6 months posttreatment. Naltrexone may be an important pharmacotherapy to address binge drinking in populations with mild to moderate alcohol use disorder.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QLxYU]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The goal of this meta-analysis is to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of CBT in conjunction with pharmacotherapy for AUD/SUD. This meta-analysis provides effect-size estimates across 3 distinct subgroups that may be informative to best-practice guidelines or individual clinician decision-making: (1) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with usual care (eg, clinical management, nonspecific drug counseling) plus pharmacotherapy, (2) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy (eg, motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management) plus pharmacotherapy, and (3) CBT added to usual care and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy alone. Sensitivity analyses included tests of heterogeneity, study influence, and publication bias. Given the robust literature on CBT for addiction, the critical role of pharmacotherapy in addiction treatment, and the notion that combined treatments may be most effective, this meta-analytic review seeks to inform clinical practice and best-practice guidelines for addiction.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zv8wS]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first targeted meta-analysis of CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy for adults with AUD and other SUDs to summarize the data in a manner relevant to clinical practice guidelines. Furthermore, we provided pooled effect size estimates by consumption outcome type and outcome point. Most of these subgroup estimates showed acceptable homogeneity, which suggests that the selected variables were informative effect-size modifiers for the sample of clinical trials reviewed. In the present study, a small and statistically significant effect size was observed across outcome type and time for CBT combined with pharmacotherapy when compared with usual care combined with pharmacotherapy. For context in interpreting this effect, meta-analyses among this patient population generally show effect sizes that are in the small-to-moderate range, and this includes effect sizes for pharmacological interventions. This contrast suggests that prescribing clinicians should favor CBT over usual care to improve clinical outcomes for addiction, in the context of pharmacotherapy.

The second subgroup contrast was combined CBT and pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy combined with pharmacotherapy. Here, results suggested no unique benefit of adding CBT to pharmacotherapy compared with other evidence-based behavioral modalities. Such modalities may include contingency management, motivation enhancement therapy, 12-step facilitation, and interpersonal therapy, all of which have received some level of empirical support for addiction, including meta-analytic support at various follow-up periods. The lack of superiority of CBT over other evidence-based behavioral treatment for addiction is consistent with our recent findings, and this meta-analysis extends this result to combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments. Although there may be evidence of some advantage for contingency management, removal of contingency management trials in this review did not change our substantive conclusions. This suggests that CBT is not superior to other evidence-based behavioral treatments for addiction, yet when combined with the aforementioned superiority to usual care, we suggest that clinicians favor an evidence-based behavioral therapy, CBT or otherwise, in conjunction with pharmacological treatments.

### Dry January: the best option for public health? [^116q7JJc]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The harms of alcohol consumption are well established, with alcohol use disorder among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current WHO documentation states that alcohol consumption is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions. In 2021, The Lancet Oncology published a study estimating that 4.1% of new cancer cases in 2020 were attributable to alcohol consumption and The Global Burden of Disease Study has shown that the "level of consumption that minimises health loss is zero".

Treatment for alcohol use disorder can be largely categorised into four main elements — cessation, psychological therapy, moderation, and medicinal treatments. Research suggests that one of the main reasons that people do not seek treatment for alcohol use disorder is that they are not ready to stop drinking completely and do not continue with treatment after an initial referral for this same reason. Although some individuals might be unable to practice moderation, for many there are considerable benefits in reducing consumption. While current clinical guidelines for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and high-risk drinking include both moderation (variably defined by units or blood alcohol concentration) and cessation, the idea that those who are alcohol dependent must become teetotal remains pervasive in the general population and medical community. However, a 2017 article in The Lancet Psychiatry showed that a reduction in WHO drinking risk level was associated with significantly lower odds of alcohol dependency 3 years later, especially for very high-risk drinkers. In another study of patients with alcohol use disorder, reductions of one or two WHO drinking risk levels were associated with significant improvements in mental health and quality of life, significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, and improvements in liver enzyme concentrations. A further study in people with alcohol use disorder showed that those who reduced their risk levels by 2.8 units had similar grey matter volumes to complete abstainers, while those who reduced their levels by only 1.2 units had significantly smaller frontal grey matter and thalamic volumes than abstainers and those who maintained reductions of 2.8 units.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113sXtmt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal (mild–moderate) — non-benzodiazepine alternatives: For managing mild-moderate alcohol withdrawal in patients for whom risks of benzodiazepines outweigh benefits (e.g., inadequate monitoring available, abuse liability, or allergy/adverse reactions), the guideline states "we suggest considering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an alternative" and rates this as "Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed". The discussion notes that while the standard of care for treatment of alcohol withdrawal is benzodiazepines, risks such as inadequate monitoring, misuse liability, or allergy/adverse reactions may necessitate alternatives, and in such cases the anticonvulsants gabapentin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid appear reasonable. Available evidence suggests that reduction of withdrawal symptoms, time to withdrawal completion, and adverse events are generally equivalent to benzodiazepines, although direct comparisons indicate it is not entirely clear if these medications are equivalent for preventing withdrawal delirium or withdrawal seizures where there is elevated risk. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis using CIWA-Ar found that non-benzodiazepine medications for alcohol withdrawal have similar effectiveness compared to benzodiazepine therapy based on CIWA-Ar scores, and these agents may have particular utility for ambulatory medically supervised withdrawal when concerns exist about prescribing a controlled substance such as a benzodiazepine.

### Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder… [^114W4YHx]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 118 clinical trials and 20 976 participants, 50 mg/d of oral naltrexone and acamprosate were each associated with significantly improved alcohol consumption-related outcomes compared with placebo. Meaning These findings support oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line therapies for alcohol use disorder. Conclusions and Relevance In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder. Compared with placebo, oral naltrexone was associated with a statistically significant improvement in return to heavy drinking with a number needed to treat of 11.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 118 clinical trials, the highest strength of evidence for treatment of alcohol use disorder was available for acamprosate and oral naltrexone. Randomized clinical trials that directly compared naltrexone, 50 mg/d, with acamprosate did not consistently established superiority of either medication. Studies of naltrexone had moderate strength of evidence for reducing return to any drinking, return to heavy drinking, percentage of drinking days, and percentage of heavy drinking days at the 50-mg/d oral dose compared with placebo. Fewer data were available for the 100-mg/d oral and injectable doses. Studies of acamprosate showed moderate strength of evidence for significant reduction in return to any drinking and reduction in drinking days compared with placebo. Acamprosate was not associated with benefit for return to heavy drinking.

In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone, 50 mg/d, and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder.

### Anticonvulsants for alcohol dependence [^112a76vg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem that is characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Besides psychosocial interventions, different pharmacological interventions have been or currently are under investigation through Cochrane systematic reviews.

Objectives

The primary aim of the review is to assess the benefits/risks of anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trials Register (October 2013), PubMed (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1974 to October 2013) and CINAHL (1982 to October 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing anticonvulsants alone or in association with other drugs and/or psychosocial interventions versus placebo, no treatment and other pharmacological or psychosocial interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

A total of 25 studies were included in the review (2641 participants). Most participants were male, with an average age of 44 years. Anticonvulsants were compared with placebo (17 studies), other medications (seven studies) and no medication (two studies). The mean duration of the trials was 17 weeks (range four to 52 weeks). The studies took place in the USA, Europe, South America, India and Thailand. Variation was reported in the characteristics of the studies, including their design and the rating instruments used. For many key outcomes, the risk of bias associated with unclear or unconcealed allocation and lack of blinding affected the quality of the evidence. Anticonvulsants versus placebo: For dropouts (16 studies, 1675 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.74 to 1.19, moderate-quality evidence) and continuous abstinence (eight studies, 634 participants, RR 1.21, 95% Cl 95% 0.97 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence), results showed no evidence of differences. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that anticonvulsants reduced drinks/drinking days (11 studies, 1126 participants, mean difference (MD) -1.49, 95% Cl -2.32 to -0.65) and heavy drinking (12 studies, 1129 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% Cl -0.51 to -0.19). Moreover, withdrawal for medical reasons (12 studies, 1410 participants, RR 1.22, 95% Cl 0.58 to 2.56, moderate-quality evidence) showed no evidence of difference, but for specific adverse effects (nine studies, 1164 participants), two of 18 adverse event outcomes favoured placebo. The direction of results was confirmed by subgroup analyses for topiramate and partially for gabapentin and valproate. Anticonvulsants versus naltrexone: No evidence of difference was shown in dropout rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06), severe relapse rates (four studies, 427 participants, RR 0.69, 95% Cl 0.44 to 1.07) and continuous abstinence rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 1.21, 95% Cl 0.99 to 1.49); anticonvulsants were associated with fewer heavy drinking days (three studies, 308 participants, MD -5.21, 95% Cl -8.58 to -1.83), more days to severe relapse (three studies, 244 participants, MD 11.88, 95% Cl 3.29 to 20.46) and lower withdrawal for medical reasons (three studies, 245 participants, RR 0.13, 95% Cl 0.03 to 0.58).

Authors' Conclusions

At the current stage of research, randomised evidence supporting the clinical use of anticonvulsants to treat alcohol dependence is insufficient. Results are conditioned by heterogeneity and by the low number and quality of studies comparing anticonvulsants with other medications. The uncertainty associated with these results leaves to clinicians the need to balance possible benefits/risks of treatment with anticonvulsants versus other medications as supported by evidence of efficacy.

### Helping patients who drink too much: an evidence-based guide for primary care clinicians [^1149gQtq]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, but few heavy drinkers receive treatment. Primary care physicians are in a position to address heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders with patients, and can do so quickly and effectively. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has published a guide for physicians that offers an evidence-based approach to screening, assessing, and treating alcohol use disorders in general health care settings. Screening can be performed by asking patients how many heavy drinking days they have per week. Assessing patients' willingness to change their drinking behaviors can guide treatment. Treatment recommendations should be presented in a clear, nonjudgmental way. Patients who are not alcohol-dependent may opt to reduce drinking to lower risk levels. Patients with alcohol dependence should receive pharmacotherapy and brief behavioral support, as well as disease management for chronic relapsing dependence. All patients with alcohol dependence should be encouraged to participate in community support groups

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^1148aLyH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy: For patients with moderate-severe alcohol use disorder for whom first-line pharmacotherapy is contraindicated or ineffective, we suggest offering gabapentin (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence cited includes an RCT (n = 150) in which gabapentin with counseling significantly improved abstinence and heavy drinking in DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and another RCT showing that adding gabapentin to oral naltrexone improved drinking outcomes relative to naltrexone alone in the first six weeks after drinking cessation. A multisite RCT of extended-release gabapentin did not demonstrate significant differences in alcohol use or cravings versus placebo, whereas a single-site RCT found reduced alcohol consumption among participants with higher pre-study withdrawal symptom severity, suggesting gabapentin may be more effective in individuals with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The effects of gabapentin likely occur through modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the need for more frequent dosing than once daily may make adherence difficult. The guideline notes increased concerns for misuse with reports of doses higher than prescribed for euphoric effects, but also describes a high margin of safety and potential utility for patients with co-occurring neuropathic pain, some with sleep disorders, and those with clinically significant hepatic disease because it is eliminated renally; overall, the Work Group judged that relative benefits for alcohol outcomes and pain treatment slightly outweighed harms including potential for misuse and central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as an alternative option. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Evaluation of drinking risk levels as outcomes in alcohol pharmacotherapy trials: a secondary analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials [^115XYAym]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration recognizes total abstinence and no heavy drinking days as outcomes for pivotal pharmacotherapy trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Many patients have difficulty achieving these outcomes, which can discourage seeking treatment and has slowed the development of medications that affect alcohol use.

Objective

To compare 2 drinking-reduction outcomes with total abstinence and no heavy drinking outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data were obtained from 3 multisite, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of medications for treating alcohol dependence (naltrexone, varenicline, and topiramate) in adults with DSM-IV-categorized alcohol dependence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Within each trial, the percentage of participants in active and placebo conditions who met responder definitions of abstinence, no heavy drinking days, a WHO 1-level reduction, and a WHO 2-level reduction was computed by month with corresponding effect sizes (Cohen h).

Results

Across the 3 trials (N = 1169; mean [SD] age, 45 [10] years; 824 [70.5%] men), the percentage of participants classified as responders during the last 4 weeks of treatment was lowest for abstinence (naltrexone, 34.7% [100 of 288]; varenicline, 7.3% [7 of 96]; topiramate, 11.7% [21 of 179]) followed by no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, 51.0% [147 of 288]; varenicline, 24.0% [23 of 96]; topiramate, 20.7% [37 of 179]), WHO 2-level reduction (naltrexone, 75.0% [216 of 288]; varenicline, 55.2% [53 of 96]; topiramate, 44.7% [80 of 179]), and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, 83.3% [240 of 288]; varenicline, 69.8 [67 of 96]; topiramate, 54.7% [98 of 179]) outcomes. Standardized treatment effects observed for the WHO 2-level reduction outcomes (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.214 [95% CI, 0.053–0.375]; varenicline, 0.273 [95% CI, -0.006 to 0.553]; topiramate, 0.230 [95% CI, 0.024–0.435]) and WHO 1-level reduction (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.116 [95% CI, -0.046 to 0.277]; varenicline, 0.338 [95% CI, 0.058–0.617]; topiramate, 0.014 [95% CI, -0.192 to 0.219]) were comparable with those obtained using abstinence (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.142 [95% CI, -0.020 to 0.303]; varenicline, 0.146 [95% CI, -0.133 to 0.426]; topiramate, 0.369 [95% CI, 0.163–0.574]) and no heavy drinking days (naltrexone, Cohen h = 0.140 [95% CI, -0.021 to 0.302]; varenicline, 0.232 [95% CI, -0.048 to 0.511]; topiramate, 0.207 [95% CI, 0.002–0.413]).

Conclusions and Relevance

WHO drinking risk level reductions appear to be worthwhile indicators of treatment outcome in AUD pharmacotherapy trials. These outcomes may align with drinking reduction goals of many patients and capture clinically meaningful improvements experienced by more patients than either abstinence or no heavy drinking days.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yGsWE]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a pressing public health concern. Combined behavioral and pharmacological interventions are considered best practices for addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line intervention, yet the superiority of CBT compared with other behavioral treatments when combined with pharmacotherapy remains unclear. An understanding of the effects of combined CBT and pharmacotherapy will inform best-practice guidelines for treatment of SUD.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the published literature on combined CBT and pharmacotherapy for adult alcohol use disorder (AUD) or other SUDs.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Register, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Embase databases from January 1, 1990, through July 31, 2019, were searched. Keywords were specified in 3 categories: treatment type, outcome type, and study design. Collected data were analyzed through September 30, 2019.

Study Selection

Two independent raters reviewed abstracts and full-text articles. English language articles describing randomized clinical trials examining CBT in combination with pharmacotherapy for AUD and SUD were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Inverse-variance weighted, random-effects estimates of effect size were pooled into 3 clinically informative subgroups: (1) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with usual care plus pharmacotherapy, (2) CBT plus pharmacotherapy compared with another specific therapy plus pharmacotherapy, and (3) CBT added to usual care and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy alone. Sensitivity analyses included assessment of study quality, pooled effect size heterogeneity, publication bias, and primary substance moderator effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Substance use frequency and quantity outcomes after treatment and during follow-up were examined.

Results

The sample included 62 effect sizes from 30 unique randomized clinical trials that examined CBT in combination with some form of pharmacotherapy for AUD and SUD. The primary substances targeted in the clinical trial sample were alcohol (15 [50%]), followed by cocaine (7 [23%]) and opioids (6 [20%]). The mean (SD) age of the patient sample was 39 (6) years, with a mean (SD) of 28% (12%) female participants per study. The following pharmacotherapies were used: naltrexone hydrochloride and/or acamprosate calcium (26 of 62 effect sizes [42%]), methadone hydrochloride or combined buprenorphine hydrochloride and naltrexone (11 of 62 [18%]), disulfiram (5 of 62 [8%]), and another pharmacotherapy or mixture of pharmacotherapies (20 of 62 [32%]). Random-effects pooled estimates showed a benefit associated with combined CBT and pharmacotherapy over usual care (g range,0.18–0.28; k = 9). However, CBT did not perform better than another specific therapy, and evidence for the addition of CBT as an add-on to combined usual care and pharmacotherapy was mixed. Moderator analysis showed variability in effect direction and magnitude by primary drug target.

Conclusions and Relevance

The present study supports the efficacy of combined CBT and pharmacotherapy compared with usual care and pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy did not perform better than another evidence-based modality (eg, motivational enhancement therapy, contingency management) in this context or as an add-on to combined usual care and pharmacotherapy. These findings suggest that best practices in addiction treatment should include pharmacotherapy plus CBT or another evidence-based therapy, rather than usual clinical management or nonspecific counseling services.

### Translating medication effects for alcohol use disorder across preclinical, human laboratory, and clinical trial outcomes using meta-analysis [^1179iSYf]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Human laboratory studies, including alcohol cue-reactivity paradigms, are often conceptualized as a bridge between preclinical research and clinical trials. These controlled settings allow for the quantification of proximal medication effects (e.g. subjective craving) under standardized conditions and are hypothesized to reflect the early clinical potential of AUD pharmacotherapies. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether medications that show efficacy in preclinical models also reduce alcohol cue-induced craving in the human laboratory.

The choice of which animal paradigm to use to test potential medications for AUD is often subjective with no consensus on which animal models or paradigms should be prioritized. The hypothesis that medication effects on preclinical endpoints can predict human laboratory outcomes or alcohol drinking in RCTs remains untested. Recent studies have employed novel meta-analytic techniques to provide quantitative evidence in support of human behavioral pharmacology endpoints in predicting clinical trial outcomes. Ray, et al. showed that medication effect sizes in alcohol challenge studies predict medication effect sizes in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). A similar approach was used to test the relationship between medication effect sizes on cue-induced craving in alcohol reactivity studies and medication effect sizes on abstinence and heavy drinking endpoints in RCTs. In contrast to alcohol challenge studies, alcohol cue-reactivity studies effect sizes were not statistically associated with medication effect sizes on abstinence and heavy drinking outcomes in RCTs. Importantly, these novel meta-analytic methods can be applied to test whether medication effects on preclinical models used to study AUD are associated with efficacy in alcohol cue-reactivity human laboratory studies and RCTs. These findings will provide quantitative evidence regarding behavioral pharmacology methods, such as choice of paradigm, that can be prioritized to screen novel compounds for AUD at the preclinical level of analysis.

### Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence: the COMBINE study: a randomized controlled trial [^114zK4Ko]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Alcohol dependence treatment may include medications, behavioral therapies, or both. It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.

Interventions

Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.

Results

All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone x behavioral intervention interaction (P = 0.009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53–0.98; P = 0.02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P < .001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.

Conclusions

Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.

### Medications for treating alcohol dependence [^114PDXLA]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Medications for treating alcohol dependence primarily have been adjunctive interventions, and only three medications — disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate — are approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Disulfiram, an aversive agent that has been used for more than 40 years, has significant adverse effects and compliance difficulties with no clear evidence that it increases abstinence rates, decreases relapse rates, or reduces cravings. In contrast, naltrexone, an anticraving agent, reduces relapse rates and cravings and increases abstinence rates. Acamprosate also reduces relapse rates and increases abstinence rates. Serotonergic and anticonvulsant agents promise to play more of a role in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication, the anticonvulsant topiramate and several serotonergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, ondansetron) have been shown in recent studies to increase abstinence rates and decrease drinking.

### Alcohol use disorder treatment: the association of pretreatment use and the role of drinking goal [^113C9vTc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In a recent study conducted in a family medicine setting, the medication acamprosate was found not to be efficacious in the treatment of alcohol dependence, but a drinking goal of abstinence was found to have positive effects on alcohol use outcomes. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to further understand which patients with an alcohol use disorder may be most successfully treated in a primary care setting.

Methods

The study was exploratory and used a trajectory-based approach based on data from the acamprosate treatment trial of 100 participants (recruited mostly by advertisement) who were randomly assigned to receive either acamprosate or a matching placebo. Post hoc trajectories of alcohol use before treatment were identified to examine whether trajectory classes and their interactions with treatment arm (acamprosate or placebo), pretreatment drinking goal (abstinence or a reduction), and time predicted alcohol use outcomes.

Results

Three distinct trajectory classes were identified: frequent drinkers, nearly daily drinkers, and consistent daily drinkers. Consistent daily drinkers with a goal of abstinence significantly improved over time on the primary outcome measure of percent days abstinent when compared with frequent and nearly daily drinkers. In addition, all participants with a goal of abstinence, regardless of trajectory class, significantly reduced their percentage of heavy drinking days over time.

Conclusions

Patients with an alcohol use disorder who have a drinking goal of abstinence, in particular consistent daily drinkers, may maximally benefit from alcohol use disorder treatment, including the use of medication, in a primary care setting.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy (inpatient), ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line therapy in patients with moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as an alternative option. Administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) if benzodiazepines are contraindicated. Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### First-line medications for the outpatient treatment of alcohol use disorder: a systematic review of perceived barriers [^111Gp8pW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common illness with significant health and economic consequences. Although three pharmacotherapeutic agents have been shown to decrease heavy drinking days among individuals with AUD, they are vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The objective of this review was to elucidate barriers that may prevent patients from obtaining medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting.

Methods

Electronic searches of Medline and EMBASE were conducted, and reference lists were hand-searched. All study designs which discussed the use of MAT for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened the search output to identify potentially eligible articles, the full texts of which were retrieved and assessed for inclusion.

Results

After eliminating duplicate citations and articles that did not meet eligibility criteria, 23 articles were included in the review. Perceived barriers to obtaining pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were grouped into 3 themes: lack of knowledge and concerns about efficacy and complexity of prescribing; treatment philosophy and stigma; medication accessibility including formulary restrictions, geographical and socioeconomic barriers.

Conclusions

Although evidence-based pharmacotherapeutics have been approved for the treatment of AUD, our findings suggest patients continue to experience barriers to the use of these medications. Efforts should be made to increase rates of prescribing by providers and the use of medications by patients. More research is needed to further elucidate perceived barriers to MAT use, along with strategies to overcome them.

Literature search strategy- randomized clinical trials

The literature search method for randomized clinical trials is detailed in. A PubMed search was conducted for randomized clinical trials on AUD medications published between January 2018 through April 2023. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) randomized trial, (2) double- or single-blinded, (3) placebo or active controlled, (4) primary endpoint includes any measure of alcohol consumption, (5) 4 or more weeks of treatment with the study medication, and (6) 12 or more weeks of follow-up after randomization. Results from this search were combined with a previous search of the literature (refer to) to yield the final clinical trial dataset spanning from 1985–2023.

The search resulted in a final sample of 139 RCT studies across 19 medications that were included in the present meta-analysis. There were a total of 23,701 participants included in these RCT studies. The PRISMA flow chart for this literature search has been previously reported in but is provided in Fig. 1C for convenience.

Data analytic plan

Effect size estimation

We calculated unbiased Cohen's d as the effect size for alcohol consumption and preference in each preclinical 2-BC study, alcohol lever presses in each preclinical reinstatement study, and cue-induced craving in each human laboratory cue-reactivity study. For all of these paradigms, Cohen's d was defined as the difference between the mean of the active medication group and the mean of the control group, divided by the pooled standard deviation (whereandare the sample sizes of the treatment and control groups, andare the sample means of the treatment and control groups, andandare the sample variances of the treatment and control groups). This effect size is commonly referred to as Hedges' g though Hedges noted its bias, especially with small per-study sample sizes. To address this bias, Hedges proposed an unbiased correction to Hedges' g, which was calculated using the formula. Negative values of Cohen's d indicate lower alcohol consumption and preference (preclinical 2-BC studies), reduced lever presses (preclinical reinstatement studies), and lower cue-induced craving (human laboratory cue-reactivity studies) in the medication group compared to the control group.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115uwS79]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM Clinical Practice Guideline — pregnant patients with alcohol withdrawal: Inpatient treatment should be considered for all pregnant patients with alcohol use disorder who require withdrawal management, and inpatient treatment should be offered to pregnant patients with at least moderate alcohol withdrawal (i.e. CIWA-Ar scores ≥ 10). The CIWA-Ar is an appropriate symptom assessment scale to use with pregnant patients, and clinicians should consider signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache, anxiety, and insomnia to be connected to alcohol withdrawal rather than pregnancy that will abate once the alcohol withdrawal has been effectively treated. During withdrawal management, consult with an obstetrician. Before giving any medications to pregnant patients, ensure that patients understand the risks and benefits of the medication, both for the patient and the developing fetus. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the medications of choice in the treatment of pregnant patients with alcohol withdrawal; due to the high teratogenic risk, valproic acid is not recommended for pregnant patients. For patients at risk for preterm delivery or in the late third trimester, use of a short-acting benzodiazepine is recommended to minimize neonatal benzodiazepine intoxication. In cases of alcohol withdrawal treated close to delivery, assess the newborn for benzodiazepine intoxication, sedative withdrawal, and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) including Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), and inform pregnant patients of wraparound services that address newborn needs and potential effects from in‑utero substance exposure.

### Sleep as an important target or modifier in alcohol use disorder clinical treatment: example from a recent gabapentin randomized clinical trial [^113vTQTw]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alcohol consumption affects sleep both in healthy populations and in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, sleep has typically not been considered within AUD pharmacotherapy trials. We used data from a completed gabapentin clinical treatment trial to explore the medication's effect on patient-rated insomnia measured by a standard insomnia rating (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) and whether this influenced gabapentin's effects on alcohol consumption.

Methods

This study included 90 individuals with current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition AUD criteria reporting current or past alcohol withdrawal. Participants were assigned to placebo or gabapentin (up to 1200 mg/day) for a 16-week randomized controlled trial with percent heavy drinking days (PHDD) and percent abstinent days (PDA) as outcomes. Utilizing mixed-effects models, this study assessed medication effects on ISI over the trial. We then examined the interaction of baseline ISI and medication on drinking. Finally, given our previous finding of alcohol withdrawal influencing gabapentin efficacy, we added change in ISI as a potential "moderator" of the interaction of medication effects and alcohol withdrawal on drinking.

Results

Sleep (ISI) improved more in those treated with gabapentin (60.6% reduction) compared with placebo (37.8% reduction; P = 0.013). Higher baseline ISI predicted drinking in gabapentin-treated individuals (lower PHDD [P = 0.026] and higher (PDA [P = 0.047]). ISI was an independent predictor of PHDD decrease and PDA increase (P < 0.001; P = 0.002), but this did not significantly moderate gabapentin's effectiveness.

Conclusions

Although gabapentin positively impacts both alcohol use and sleep, its effect on drinking is not fully dependent on sleep improvement, implying a direct biological mechanism on alcohol use.

Alcohol use by youth — treatment approaches — The National Institute on Drug Abuse guide emphasizes that treatment is not "one size fits all" and must consider individual needs, and the AAP clinical report on SBIRT includes a list of optimal standards for a substance use disorder treatment program. Behavioral therapies are effective in treating alcohol and other substance use disorders and include individual therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy, while family-based approaches, including multidimensional family therapy and multisystemic therapy, have been proven to be effective. Addiction medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone; medication-assisted therapies are not commonly used to treat adolescent AUDs but may be used in specific circumstances, and these medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^1118mXnX]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic approaches discussed here should be taken as illustrative concepts, rather than specific clinical options, or drug development pathways. It is still early days. But some important takeaways to guide future treatment development efforts already seem to be emerging:
The development of alcohol addiction certainly does not render patients completely insensitive to reward contingencies. It does, however, lead to the emergence of systematic biases in reward choice preferences. It is reasonable to assume that these reflect a persistent pathology of neurocircuitry that integrates outcome values and guides action selection. As a result, patients repeatedly make maladaptive choices, under conditions when people without an addiction decide advantageously. It is unclear to us why this pathophysiology would not qualify for being a disease mechanism.
Alcohol use in patients with alcohol addiction represents a shift of choice behaviors away from non-drug rewards and toward alcohol. It seems unlikely to us that the brain pathology behind this shift can be understood through research strategies that study alcohol reinforcement in the absence of alternatives.
The pathological shift in choice preferences, and continued use despite adverse consequences that are the hallmarks of alcohol addiction occurs only in a minority of alcohol users. It seems unlikely to us that it can be understood by studying behaviors that emerge in all animals tested.
While worthwhile, identifying the vulnerable minority and using it for screening candidate therapeutics poses challenges when it come to throughput. A complementary approach in identifying novel therapeutic mechanisms may come from studies of the resilient majority.
Using pharmacotherapeutic strategies that have activity-dependent effects in its infancy, but seems to offer a new area of exploration that may fruitfully combine behavioral and pharmacological interventions.
Precision medicine is the road forward to improve outcomes in the treatment of alcohol addiction. Although tailoring medicines towards subpopulations presenting with distinct genetic factors and intermediate phenotypes seems counterintuitive to expensive medication development efforts, the issue at hand is to increase effect sizes towards levels that are clinically meaningful and thereby to gain patient and prescriber trust in such therapies. Their increased acceptance is likely to raise utilization and ultimately also sales.

### Effects of 10 add-on HF-rTMS treatment sessions on alcohol use and craving among detoxified inpatients with alcohol use disorder: a randomized sham-controlled clinical trial [^114Mbxxx]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is frequently a chronic relapsing disorder in those in addiction treatment, characterized by loss of control over intake, despite awareness of the harmful consequences. Furthermore, a negative emotional state can arise when alcohol is not available, and the mental health of the patient can be severely affected with comorbidities such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. Often AUD patients experience intense urges or an irresistible desire to consume alcohol, also known as craving. It is a world‐wide health problem, with 2.6% of the world population meeting criteria for AUD. Each year in the Netherlands alone, already more than 30 000 individuals are hospitalized for the treatment of AUD.

Current AUD treatment mainly consists of psychological and pharmacological interventions. Pharmacological treatment consists of anti‐craving medication, such as naltrexone and acamprosate. Some of the available psychological treatments are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (focusing upon improving problem‐solving skills, enhancing drinking refusal skills and developing effective coping strategies by cognitive–behavioral treatment methods), motivational enhancement therapy (MET) (with a focus on enhancement of motivation to change behavior through motivational interviewing) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (which focuses upon acceptance of emotions and commitment to values that are set at the beginning of treatment) or contingency management (consisting of providing rewards when patients remain abstinent). The effectiveness of MET, CBT and ACT in alcohol and substance use disorder is small to moderate when compared to no treatment. The effectiveness of contingency management is moderate when provided during treatment; however, this effect is abandoned after longer follow‐up periods. Despite these various treatment options, relapse rates are still approximately 60% 1 year after treatment. These high relapse rates indicate a need of novel treatment options for AUD.

### Patient information: treatment of alcohol use disorder… [^112jNXnX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The severity of AUD ranges from mild to severe, and symptoms have the potential for recurrence and remission. No matter how severe the disorder is, individuals can benefit from treatment. To diagnose AUD, a doctor performs a face-to-face evaluation, assessment of symptoms, and review of medical history, and obtains information from family members if applicable. The doctor conducts a diagnostic evaluation for any co-occurring mental health conditions. People with AUD have a higher rate of anxiety and depressive disorders than those without AUD. Treatment for AUD can vary depending on individual goals. In general, the goals of AUD treatment are to reduce and manage symptoms and improve health and functioning. People commonly think of "rehab, " a 28-day residential program, for AUD treatment. However, most people do not need or benefit from 28-day residential treatment.

Advances have led to evidence-based treatments that are less intensive and can be accessed through a primary care physician or mental health clinic. Components of effective treatment include medications and behavioral treatments, ideally in combination. Community mutual-aid groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous can also help support a person's goals, but peer support groups are not meant to replace formal medical treatment. Three medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for AUD. These medications are nonaddictive and are designed to help manage disease. Medication may not be effective or necessary for everyone with AUD, but as part of a personalized treatment plan, they can help an individual meet their goals. Naltrexone has been proven to reduce heavy drinking days and help promote abstinence. It can also help manage cravings to drink for some people. It is a once-daily pill or once-monthly injection.

Acamprosate has been proven to reduce heavy drinking and maintain abstinence once someone is already sober. It can also help manage cravings in some people. Disulfiram blocks the breakdown of alcohol in the body and causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea if alcohol is consumed. These symptoms can help some people not to drink alcohol. Several evidence-based psychotherapy options exist for AUD. One is cognitive behavior therapy, which focuses on the relationships among thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help manage urges and triggers. This therapy can also address co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment that works for everyone. What is effective for one person may not be a good fit for someone else. The decision to get treatment is often more important than the type of treatment used.

### Personalized treatment of alcohol dependence [^112BTiej]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacogenetic and adaptive treatment approaches can be used to personalize care for alcohol-dependent patients. Preliminary evidence shows that variation in the gene encoding the μ-opioid receptor moderates the response to naltrexone when used to treat alcohol dependence. Studies have also shown moderating effects of variation in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter on response to serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence. Adaptive algorithms that modify alcohol treatment based on patients' progress have also shown promise. Initial response to outpatient treatment appears to be a particularly important in the selection of optimal continuing care interventions. In addition, stepped-care algorithms can reduce the cost and burden of treatment while maintaining good outcomes. Finally, matching treatment to specific problems present at intake or that emerge during treatment can also improve outcomes. Although all of these effects require replication and further refinement, the future of personalized care for alcohol dependence appears bright.

### Using machine learning to classify individuals with alcohol use disorder based on treatment seeking status [^111Z9SB1]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), is highly prevalent and is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Less than 10% of persons who meet lifetime criteria for AUD receive any type of treatment. As the etiology of AUD represents a complex interaction between neurobiological, social, environmental and psychological factors, low treatment utilization likely stems from barriers on multiple levels. Large-scale epidemiological surveys identified multiple societal, demographic and personal factors influencing treatment-seeking status. However, the fact remains that the majority of people with AUD do not receive treatment. Given this issue, it is important from both a research and clinical standpoint to determine what characteristics are associated with treatment utilization in addition to merely asking individuals if they wish to enter treatment.

In research settings, proof-of-concept human laboratory studies that include alcohol administration and/or self-administration are a cost-effective approach to study alcohol-related pharmacological and behavioral effects of alcohol and to screen new medications that have shown promise in animal studies. In these human laboratory studies, alcohol may be administered with the study medication to determine the safety of the combination; in addition, early efficacy of the putative treatment on drinking or craving measures may be assessed. Given the ethical concern of administering alcohol to treatment-seeking patients, only nontreatment-seeking subjects are typically studied. If there are phenotypic differences between treatment and nontreatment-seekers that directly influence outcomes of early-phase studies, these phenotypic differences are a potential confound in assessing the utility of an experimental treatment for AUD. Therefore, understanding the phenotypic differences between these populations provides the opportunity to take into account potential confounding variables in these early phase clinical studies.

Literature search strategy- cue-reactivity studies

A detailed description of the literature review method for cue-reactivity studies is reported in. In short, a PubMed search was conducted for human laboratory studies published through January 3, 2022. Studies that met the following criteria were included in the meta-analysis: (1) randomized trial that included the administration of a pharmacological agent for the treatment of AUD (approved or being developed) along with a placebo comparison, (2) laboratory alcohol cue exposure paradigm (inclusive of neural alcohol cue-reactivity tasks), (3) cue-induced craving self-reports, and (4) peer-reviewed articles reported or translated into the English language.

The search resulted in a final sample of 36 cue-reactivity studies across 15 medications. There were a total of 1640 participants included in these studies. The PRISMA flow chart and risk of bias assessment was previously provided but is also provided in Fig. 1B for convenience.

### A randomized controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine for adolescent and young adult alcohol use disorder [^112iWoGV]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) often emerges during adolescence and peaks during young adulthood, predicting long-term problematic substance use patterns. Effective AUD interventions tailored for young people are needed to mitigate long-term effects; however, current treatments are only modestly effective. Evaluation of novel approaches is warranted, and prior findings suggested N-acetylcysteine as a viable pharmacotherapy candidate. To evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine, compared to placebo, in reducing alcohol use among treatment-seeking adolescents and young adults with AUD.

Method

Between March 2019 and February 2024, a fully powered, double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat clinical trial was conducted in an outpatient setting among treatment-seeking young people ages 15–25 who met criteria for AUD. Participants (N = 126; (mean [SD] age, 21.0 [2.4] years; 78 [62%] female) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an 8-week course of 2400 mg/day (administered as 1200 mg twice daily) N-acetylcysteine (n = 65) or placebo (n = 61) and were followed for 6 months total. All participants received weekly clinician-led alcohol intervention sessions, including elements of motivational interviewing and goal setting. Adverse events were assessed by the medical clinician and medication adherence videos were observed asynchronously by study staff to confirm medication taking. The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in alcohol use (total standard drinks during the last four weeks of treatment), compared between N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups. Secondary outcomes included number of drinking days, heavy drinking days, and drinks per drinking day during the last four weeks of treatment.

Results

Video-confirmed medication adherence (overall = 82.7%) and rates of adverse events did not differ between groups. There were no overall differences in primary or secondary alcohol use outcomes between those in the N-acetylcysteine versus placebo groups (primary efficacy endpoint: 37.9 [SE = 3.8] standard drinks over the last four weeks of treatment in the N-acetylcysteine group vs. 42.6 [6.3] in the placebo group, RR = 1.19 [95% CI: 0.89, 1.61], p = .24); however, baseline AUD severity modified treatment efficacy. In exploratory analyses, participants with moderate to severe AUD, N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced alcohol consumption compared to placebo (31.7 vs. 44.4 standard drinks over the last four weeks of treatment, p = .01) but not frequency of alcohol use. In participants with mild AUD, N-acetylcysteine did not significantly reduce alcohol use compared to placebo.

Conclusion

N-acetylcysteine may be a useful adjunctive treatment for moderate to severe AUD but is potentially less suitable for mild cases. In exploratory analyses, N-acetylcysteine was effective in reducing alcohol consumption among youth with moderate to severe AUD, but not among those with mild AUD nor was there an effect on frequency of alcohol use for any group. This could be especially relevant for adolescents, who typically drink less often than adults but tend to consume larger amounts of alcohol when they do drink; thus, changes in alcohol consumption may be more impactful than changes in frequency. These findings highlight the importance of considering AUD severity in both clinical treatment planning and the design of youth AUD trials. Because individuals with more severe AUD are the most likely to seek treatment, trials may consider oversampling youth with moderate to severe AUD to improve the relevance and effectiveness of interventions. Future studies should consider similar stratified approaches to evaluate other potential treatments for adolescents and young adults with AUD.

### Topiramate pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder and other addictions: a narrative review [^113aGMEe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topiramate is a non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant medication with multi-faceted pharmacologic action. It has emerged as an efficacious pharmacotherapeutic option for the treatment of addiction, especially alcohol use disorder (AUD). We present a broad narrative review of the putative mechanism of action and clinical utility of topiramate with regard to AUD and other substance use disorders. Collective evidence suggests topiramate is an effective treatment option in AUD, with notable efficacy in reducing harmful drinking patterns in AUD. Though not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the indication of AUD, topiramate should be considered as a pharmacological treatment option with high utility among AUD patients. Early pharmacogenetic studies raise the intriguing possibility of identifying patients likely to respond to topiramate using genetic testing, and initial studies show that topiramate may also be useful in treating cocaine use disorder, smoking cessation and behavioral addictions. However, further research is needed in all these areas.

### Efficacy and safety of alcohol reduction pharmacotherapy according to treatment duration in patients with alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116n6MbR]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Relapse is common in alcohol dependence (AD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), so alcohol reduction therapy should be measured over as long a period as possible; however, existing reviews do not consider the duration of treatment and therefore alcohol reduction therapy may not have been appropriately evaluated. This review evaluated the efficacy and safety of alcohol reduction pharmacotherapy in patients with AD or AUD according to the duration of treatment.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed 15 pharmacological agents. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for eligible trials through to May 2021. Outcomes were heavy drinking days (HDD), total alcohol consumption (TAC), any adverse event and days without drinking.

Results

Fifty-five RCTs (n = 8891) were included. Nalmefene was superior to placebo for reducing HDD (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.37, -0.18) and TAC (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.35, -0.16) in the long-term, but not in the short-term. Topiramate was superior to placebo for reducing HDD (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.59, -0.12) and days without drinking (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.11, 0.82), and baclofen was superior for reducing TAC (SMD -0.70, 95% CI -1.29, -0.11), in the short-term. The frequency of adverse events was higher with nalmefene and topiramate than with placebo.

Conclusion

Nalmefene, topiramate and baclofen may be effective as alcohol reduction pharmacotherapy; however, only nalmefene has demonstrated long-term efficacy, and nalmefene and topiramate have a significantly higher frequency of adverse events compared with placebo.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116pCCqe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a pressing public health concern, which calls for clinicians and scientists to identify and implement best practices in treatment. To that end, the combination of pharmacological and behavioral interventions has long been considered the criterion standard in addiction care, although differences between best practices for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and SUD have been noted. For SUDs without a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved pharmacotherapy, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis, behavioral treatments are the principal approach. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line behavioral approach for treating AUD and other SUDs (AUD/SUD). Cognitive behavioral therapy is a time-limited, multisession intervention that targets cognitive, affective, and environmental risks for substance use and provides training in behavioral self-control skills to help an individual achieve and maintain abstinence or harm reduction.

Despite the importance of combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions for AUD/SUD, few meta-analyses on this intervention approach have been performed. Typically, meta-analytic reviews in the AUD/SUD literature have been conducted on specific pharmacotherapies, groups of pharmacotherapies, or specific behavioral interventions, such as CBT. As a result, the evidence-informed guideline will relate only to the selection of a single, stand-alone therapy, whether pharmacological or behavioral, and not their combination. For example, in a review of 122 clinical trials of AUD pharmacotherapies delivered in outpatient settings, the authors could not conclude about the efficacy of pharmacotherapies when combined with a behavioral cointervention.

The meta-analytic evidence on CBT supports efficacy at short- and long-term follow-ups. In an early review (1999) of 26 studies by Irvin et al, the authors found CBT to be generally effective across a range of conditions, but effect sizes were roughly 5 times higher when CBT was combined with pharmacotherapy than when delivered as a stand-alone intervention. This subgroup analysis was based on 4 studies and should therefore be interpreted with caution. In 2009, Magill and Rayfollowed up this work with a meta-analysis of 53 CBT clinical trials, reporting a similar overall effect size and a larger effect when CBT was combined with pharmacotherapy than when delivered alone, but the difference in effect-size magnitude between groups was smaller than observed in the previous review including 13 studies.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^117NG7gH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Topiramate and naltrexone — alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy — are supported for reducing alcohol consumption outcomes with distinct tolerability and implementation considerations. While topiramate is not approved for AUD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is recommended because of the moderate quality evidence for a significant reduction in heavy drinking and promotion of abstinence, and a pilot RCT in Veterans with AUD and co-occurring PTSD showed benefit associated with topiramate in reducing alcohol consumption, craving, and PTSD symptom severity. Side effects associated with naltrexone tend to be minimal with options for monthly injection or once-daily dosing, whereas topiramate may cause dizziness, negative cognitive effects, or weight loss. Oral naltrexone and topiramate are available as low cost generics, but injectable naltrexone has higher cost and feasibility concerns; topiramate may require multiple visits for adequate titration and tolerability assessment, and naltrexone's opioid blockade effect may preclude use in patients who require opioid pain medications. Despite these minor concerns and given the positive efficacy evidence for these medications, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for recommendation.

### Follow-up and reasons for extended-release naltrexone discontinuation for alcohol use disorder after hospital initiation [^116xgbfu]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Only 1.9% of the 28.9 million individuals in the USA with alcohol use disorder (AUD) received AUD pharmacotherapy in the past year. This is a large treatment gap given the 178 307 individuals who die yearly of complications from unhealthy alcohol use. With the increasing prevalence and morbidity related to AUD, hospitalisations for AUD have also increased. Thus, hospitalisation presents an opportunity to identify patients with AUD and offer treatment.

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for AUD that reduces drinking days and heavy drinking days.XR-NTX decreases healthcare costs and acute care utilisation, and increases retention in treatment. Compared with oral naltrexone (NTX), XR-NTX adherence may be higher. It may not face some of the challenges of oral NTX including: a high attrition rate within the first few months of starting treatment, polypharmacy making it difficult to adhere to daily medications and patients preferring a non-daily AUD medication. We offered XR-NTX to hospitalised patients with moderate-to-severe AUD and describe the follow-up rates for XR-NTX after hospital initiation and reasons for XR-NTX discontinuation in the outpatient setting after hospital discharge.

### Medication treatment of different types of alcoholism [^113NwbgN]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Alcoholism remains a serious cause of morbidity and mortality despite progress through neurobiological research in identifying new pharmacological strategies for its treatment. Drugs that affect neural pathways that modulate the activity of the cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system have been shown to alter drinking behavior, presumably because this dopaminergic system is closely associated with rewarding behavior. Ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen are examples. Subtyping alcoholism in adults into an early-onset type, with chronic symptoms and a strong biological predisposition to the disease, and a late-onset type, typically brought on by psychosocial triggers and associated with mood symptoms, may help in the selection of optimal therapy. Emerging adults with binge drinking patterns also might be aided by selective treatments. Although preliminary work on the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism and its treatment has been promising, the assignment to treatment still depends on clinical assessment. Brief behavioral interventions that encourage the patient to set goals for a reduction in heavy drinking or abstinence also are part of optimal therapy.
