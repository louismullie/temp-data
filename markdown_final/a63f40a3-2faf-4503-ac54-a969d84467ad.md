## Question

What are possible causes of central abdominal pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the possible causes of central (epigastric/periumbilical) abdominal pain are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the relevant anatomy and pain neurophysiology for the epigastric and periumbilical regions. Then, I should prioritize immediate life-threatening cardiac and vascular mimics that can present as central abdominal pain. Next, I will consider surgical abdominal emergencies, followed by common gastrointestinal medical causes. After that, I need to evaluate functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes, extra-abdominal and referred etiologies, and patient-specific risk factors. Finally, I should integrate decision tools, labs and imaging, assemble a tiered differential, and outline a practical clinical pathway including safe analgesia and follow-up, while self-checking assumptions throughout [^1149qknL] [^111jUMNZ].

> Let me first confirm the anatomical and visceral pain context for central pain. Epigastric and periumbilical discomfort maps to midline visceral afferents from the stomach, duodenum, pancreas, proximal small bowel, and transverse colon, with potential contributions from hepatobiliary structures and substantial referred input from cardiac, thoracic, and retroperitoneal sources via convergent spinal pathways, which explains why central pain often lacks precise localization and may reflect life-threatening mimics despite minimal abdominal findings [^115brwkA] [^111jUMNZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; central pain is a classic masquerader of cardiac and vascular disease, so I need to rule those out first. Acute coronary syndrome, especially inferior or posterior MI, can present as epigastric pain with nausea, particularly in older adults, women, and people with diabetes, so an early ECG and troponin are warranted even when chest pain is absent, and I shouldn't anchor on a gastrointestinal diagnosis too early [^111jUMNZ] [^117JGrYW]. I should also consider aortic emergencies (AAA rupture or dissection) and mesenteric ischemia when pain is severe or out of proportion to the exam, keeping a low threshold for urgent imaging and vascular consultation in the appropriate phenotype [^1149qknL].

> Next, I will now examine time-sensitive surgical abdominal emergencies that can present centrally. Perforated peptic ulcer can cause sudden, severe epigastric pain with peritoneal rigidity and free air, acute pancreatitis typically produces epigastric pain radiating to the back with elevated lipase, esophageal rupture follows forceful emesis with severe retrosternal or epigastric pain, and small bowel obstruction causes colicky central pain with vomiting and distension; early appendicitis frequently starts as periumbilical visceral pain before localizing as somatic RLQ tenderness as inflammation reaches the peritoneum [^111jUMNZ] [^1149qknL].

> Wait, let me verify the common medical gastrointestinal causes and their relative frequency in primary care, because pretest probability should shape testing. Gastroenteritis is common, gastritis and peptic ulcer disease remain frequent, biliary and pancreatic disease may manifest centrally, and a substantial proportion of patients ultimately have non-specific abdominal pain without a structural diagnosis; IBS and functional dyspepsia are important considerations, but I need to ensure red flags are absent before labeling functional disease [^112MiJLT] [^112u2hNN]. I should also remember that IBS involves recurrent abdominal pain with bowel habit disturbance and multifactorial mechanisms including visceral hypersensitivity and altered brain–gut signaling, which can bias symptom interpretation toward functional diagnoses when structural disease has been excluded [^112M21Uj].

> I need to check for functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes once structural and inflammatory causes are unlikely. IBS pain reflects visceral hypersensitivity and brain–gut dysregulation; centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS) presents with chronic, continuous pain minimally related to physiological events and often requires central neuromodulators and psychological therapies; and functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) consists of intermittent cramping without bowel habit change or red flags and may respond to antispasmodics while monitoring for evolving features of IBS or other pathology [^112M21Uj] [^114nxzhQ] [^117DVFSv]. But wait, what if I misstate analgesic implications in CAPS? The randomized trial reported short-term lack of efficacy of lidocaine and the opioid receptor blocker sufentanil in CAPS; hold on, I should verify the pharmacology, because sufentanil is actually a potent mu-opioid agonist, not a blocker, so the correct interpretation is that neither peripheral lidocaine nor the centrally acting opioid agonist changed short-term outcomes, underscoring the primacy of central mechanisms and non-opioid strategies in CAPS management [^117LWK2G] [^116kjn2X]. Given the central component, evidence-based use of central neuromodulators tailored to predominant symptoms, and exploration of endocannabinoid-targeting strategies in IBS-related pain, can be appropriate when individualized and risk–benefit balanced [^112HwQWX] [^111m5yah].

> Let me consider non-gastrointestinal intra-abdominal sources that can mimic visceral pain. Abdominal wall pain is often overlooked; a positive Carnett's sign (tenderness that persists or increases with tensing) and a focal trigger point support the diagnosis and can guide targeted local anesthetic injection, whereas retroperitoneal causes like nephrolithiasis or pyelonephritis can project centrally and should be considered with flank or urinary features and appropriate urinalysis and imaging, and in women, ectopic pregnancy and adnexal torsion must be rapidly excluded with pregnancy testing and pelvic imaging when indicated [^111WSypB] [^1149qknL].

> I should double-check referred and extra-abdominal mimics because they can derail anchoring. Lower lobe pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pleurisy can present with upper abdominal discomfort, neurogenic etiologies like pre-eruptive zoster or thoracic radiculopathy can mimic visceral pain, and metabolic or toxicologic causes such as DKA, hypercalcemia, uremia, porphyria, or narcotic bowel syndrome/opioid-induced hyperalgesia should be considered in the right context and medication history [^117JGrYW] [^114nxzhQ].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors and contextual clues to refine pretest probability. Age steers the differential toward Meckel's and intussusception in children, biliary and ulcer disease in adults, and vascular or malignancy-related pathology in older adults; pregnancy changes the calculus toward obstetric and gynecologic emergencies; immunocompromise can blunt classic signs and broaden infectious causes; medications like NSAIDs raise ulcer risk and opioids can worsen hyperalgesia; travel or immigration adds parasitic diseases to the list; and a family history of migraine supports consideration of abdominal migraine in recurrent midline pain, particularly with vasomotor symptoms and nausea [^112SnJKg] [^1174yu3S].

> I need to ensure my diagnostic heuristics are evidence-informed. Clinical red flags associated with significant intra-abdominal pathology include guarding, tachycardia, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis, whereas the absence of vomiting or guarding with normal pulse and white count lowers the likelihood of a condition requiring active intervention, supporting observation in selected cases with clear return precautions and reassessment plans [^116wdgrL] [^1136EALE]. Imaging selection should be guided by location and suspected etiology: ultrasound is first-line for biliary disease, CT is the workhorse for undifferentiated acute pain or suspected obstruction or diverticulitis, and MRI is a radiation-sparing alternative in specific contexts; importantly, clinician gestalt and pain location alone are insufficient to rule in or out key CT-diagnosable entities, emphasizing judicious but appropriate imaging when serious disease remains a concern [^117PDmzo] [^112FZXaV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially stated ECG for adults older than 40, but I should correct that to a risk-based approach: any adult with epigastric pain and cardiovascular risk factors or concerning features warrants ECG and troponin rather than using age alone as a hard cutoff [^1149qknL].

> Let me synthesize a tiered differential so I don't miss time-critical disease while keeping probabilities in mind. Emergent considerations include cardiac ischemia, perforated viscus, mesenteric ischemia, acute pancreatitis with severe systemic features, and esophageal rupture; urgent conditions include small bowel obstruction, complicated peptic ulcer disease, acute diverticulitis, cholecystitis or cholangitis, pyelonephritis, and ectopic pregnancy; non-urgent outpatient conditions include GERD and peptic ulcer disease without alarm features, functional dyspepsia, IBS, abdominal wall pain, chronic pancreatitis, and IBD; and functional or hypersensitivity syndromes such as CAPS, FACP, abdominal migraine, and narcotic bowel syndrome round out the list when structural disease is excluded [^1149qknL] [^117JGrYW].

> I should confirm a practical clinical pathway that balances safety and parsimony. Stabilize and obtain vitals, bedside glucose, and ECG when cardiac ischemia is plausible; take a focused history of onset, radiation, associated GI and cardiopulmonary symptoms, medication and travel exposures, and pregnancy status; perform a careful abdominal exam including peritoneal signs and Carnett's sign; identify red flags; obtain targeted labs such as CBC, BMP, LFTs, lipase, urinalysis, pregnancy test, and troponin as indicated; and select imaging based on risk and suspected etiology, with CT abdomen/pelvis for red flags or unclear diagnoses after initial assessment and ultrasound first for biliary disease [^117PDmzo] [^111WSypB]. Let me reconsider the role of analgesia; withholding opioids to "preserve the exam" is outdated, and evidence shows early analgesia reduces suffering without impairing diagnostic accuracy, so I should treat pain while continuing diagnostic evaluation and consider an empiric PPI in likely dyspepsia absent alarm features, ensuring clear return instructions and 24–48 hour follow-up for low-risk presentations [^1113AvxK] [^112u2hNN].

> But wait, I should also acknowledge when centrally directed strategies are appropriate. In patients with confirmed disorders of gut–brain interaction and persistent visceral pain, individualized neuromodulator therapy aligned to predominant symptoms, psychological therapies, and investigational approaches targeting endocannabinoid signaling or peripheral nociceptive mechanisms can be considered, recognizing current evidence gaps and the need to avoid opioid escalation given risks of hyperalgesia and poor efficacy for chronic visceral pain [^112HwQWX] [^111m5yah] [^111axdUo].

> Key principle, I should double-check that I haven't narrowed too quickly. Central abdominal pain has a wider and more treacherous differential than quadrant-specific pain because of convergent visceral pathways and referred sources; therefore, early attention to life-threatening mimics, disciplined use of red flags and imaging, and a stepwise transition to functional diagnoses only after exclusion of structural disease underpin safe, efficient care and better outcomes for patients with this common and challenging presentation [^111jUMNZ] [^1149qknL] [^112MiJLT].

Central abdominal pain has diverse etiologies, including **gastrointestinal disorders** (such as gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, and irritable bowel syndrome) [^112M21Uj], **vascular emergencies** (such as abdominal aortic aneurysm and mesenteric ischemia) [^1149qknL], **metabolic/endocrine issues** (such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypercalcemia) [^1114fmQt], **infectious diseases** (such as gastroenteritis and parasitic infections) [^112SnJKg], and **functional or centrally mediated syndromes** (such as functional dyspepsia and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome) [^114nxzhQ]. A thorough **clinical evaluation** — including history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing — is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management [^1149qknL].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

- **Gastritis and peptic ulcer disease**: Inflammation or ulceration of the stomach or duodenum can cause central abdominal pain, often associated with nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia [^111jUMNZ].

- **Pancreatitis**: Inflammation of the pancreas typically presents with severe central abdominal pain radiating to the back, often associated with nausea and vomiting [^1149qknL].

- **Small bowel obstruction**: Obstruction of the small intestine causes central abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and constipation [^112FZXaV].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: A functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits [^112M21Uj].

---

## Vascular causes

Vascular causes include **abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** — a dilatation of the abdominal aorta that can cause central abdominal pain, particularly if ruptured or leaking — and **mesenteric ischemia**, in which reduced intestinal blood flow causes severe central abdominal pain often disproportionate to physical findings [^1149qknL].

---

## Metabolic and endocrine causes

Metabolic and endocrine causes include **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** — a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis — presenting with central abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and **hypercalcemia**, in which elevated calcium levels can cause central abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation [^1114fmQt].

---

## Infectious causes

Infectious causes include **gastroenteritis**, a gastrointestinal infection causing central abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and **parasitic infections**, in which parasites such as Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica can cause central abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss [^112SnJKg].

---

## Functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes

Functional and centrally mediated pain syndromes include **functional dyspepsia**, which presents with chronic upper abdominal pain or discomfort without an identifiable organic cause and is often associated with bloating, nausea, and early satiety, and **centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS)**, a chronic abdominal pain syndrome thought to result from central sensitization and altered pain processing in the central nervous system [^111axdUo] [^114nxzhQ].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause of central abdominal pain:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history, including onset, duration, character, associated symptoms, and risk factors, followed by thorough physical examination [^1114fmQt].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, liver function tests, amylase/lipase, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers [^1136EALE].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as indicated [^117PDmzo].

- **Endoscopy**: Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy if gastrointestinal pathology is suspected [^111jUMNZ].

---

Central abdominal pain can result from **gastrointestinal, vascular, metabolic, infectious, and functional conditions**. A thorough **clinical evaluation**, with targeted diagnostic testing, is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^1114fmQt].

### Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome [^112M21Uj]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS):

- **Definition**: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea, or both), often with associated bloating.

- **Pathophysiology**: The etiology of IBS is poorly understood. Potential etiological mechanisms include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections, and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10–20% of patients with diarrhea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of IBS is estimated at 196 cases per 100,000 person-years, with an estimated prevalence of 5–12% based on Rome II criteria.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: There is no evidence that IBS is associated with an increased risk of mortality. However, patients with IBS exhibit a poorer quality of life and utilize the healthcare system to a greater degree than patients without the diagnosis.

### Centrally mediated disorders of gastrointestinal pain [^114nxzhQ]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), formerly known as functional abdominal pain syndrome, can be distinguished from other functional gastrointestinal disorders by its strong central component and relative independence from motility disturbances. CAPS is a result of central sensitization with disinhibition of pain signals rather than increased peripheral afferent excitability.

A newly described condition, narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS)/opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia, is characterized by the paradoxical development of or increases in abdominal pain associated with continuous or increasing dosages of opioids. Patients experience relief only when opioids are withdrawn.

Both conditions are defined in the context of epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, and treatment, with an emphasis on the importance of the physician-patient relationship in all aspects of care.

Some types of parasites are endemic to certain locations, while immigration and travel are responsible for worldwide cases. A parasite may involve a specific organ or migrate through several organs. It may also induce a cyst formation that could be complicated by rupture, superinfection, or mass effect. Clinical and radiological findings may vary for different types of parasites and their sites of involvement.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^117DVFSv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is frequently encountered in the general population. It may present either on its own or in association with a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID; also known as a disorder of gut-brain interaction), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and biliary pain. Although national and international guidelines exist for managing the symptoms of IBS, including abdominal pain, recommendations for the general diagnosis and symptomatic management of FACP are lacking.

The lack of guidance on how to diagnose and manage FACP reflects the absence of a standard, accepted definition, and limited focused literature on this complaint. The Rome Foundation has developed and updated its own criteria, currently up to Rome IV, to diagnose FGIDs, including those associated with FACP, such as IBS, functional dyspepsia, biliary pain, postprandial distress syndrome, epigastric pain syndrome, and narcotic bowel syndrome (also referred to as opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia). However, although the Rome criteria are a useful tool for gastroenterologists and researchers, they do not fully capture the presentation of FACP seen in everyday practice. Nor are they practical enough to be used routinely by primary care physicians (PCPs)/general practitioners (GPs), pharmacists, or patients, whose primary objective — once structural, organic causation has been ruled out — is symptom alleviation. The present expert guidance attempts to address these issues by providing a consensus definition for FACP and by presenting…

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated.

The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Updates in diagnosis and management of chronic abdominal pain [^116rQpFd]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain is a common problem seen by pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologists alike. There should not be evidence of underlying organic pathology, with diagnosis based upon the Rome IV criteria. Although it frequently occurs, routine diagnostic testing is not always necessary. Providing assurance and helpful coping strategies is key in the management of chronic abdominal pain. Sometimes other expertise is needed when developing these strategies.

### Ex vivo study of human visceral nociceptors [^115nyZRJ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom of gastrointestinal (GI) disease. For many patients, this is a chronic problem without any clear underlying pathology. Treating chronic abdominal pain is clinically challenging due to the lack of efficacy or the presence of gut-specific side effects of many analgesics. As a result, abdominal pain is a significant factor in the long-term morbidity associated with many GI diseases, negatively impacting quality of life indicators such as fatigue, sleep, and depression. Conditions characterized by chronic pain are consistently identified as a major burden on the healthcare system, underpinning the need to develop new, safe, and effective treatments from both clinical and socioeconomic perspectives.

One approach to analgesic development has been to target sensory nerves called nociceptors, which transduce painful or noxious stimuli from the periphery to the central nervous system. This approach has therapeutic potential, as evidenced by the effectiveness of local anesthetics, which inhibit peripheral input into the pain pathway. A goal of research in this area has been to identify mechanisms specific to nociceptor activation that can reproduce the efficacy of local anesthetics without the side effects associated with pan-sodium channel blockade. In particular, the identification of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels as key transducers of noxious stimuli, such as heat, cold, and pressure, and as downstream effectors of receptor activation by inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, ATP, or prostaglandins, has been the focus of ongoing research.

### Multiple roles for Nav1.9 in the activation of visceral afferents by noxious inflammatory, mechanical, and human disease-derived stimuli [^114e3wPH]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic dysregulation of visceral sensation can lead to abdominal pain, which is clinically challenging to treat. A hallmark of chronic visceral pain is heightened sensitivity to gut motility and distension of visceral organs, typically in response to past or ongoing inflammation. In some patient groups, therapeutic inhibition of mechanosensitivity in visceral afferents has proven effective in treating pain. However, opportunities for improved intervention will likely come from targeting mechanisms of activation common to both inflammatory and mechanical stimulation of the viscera.

The activity of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) underpins electrogenesis in excitable cells. The 9 genes (SCN1A–SCN5A and SCN8A–SCN11A) encoding the Nav1.1 to Nav1.9 α-subunits exhibit tissue-specific expression and describe proteins with varying biophysical characteristics. Of those expressed in peripheral neurons, three channels (Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9) are strongly associated with pain behaviors in both rodents and humans. Specifically, Nav1.9 mediates a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current that is activated at voltages close to the resting membrane potential of sensory neurons. As a consequence of these biophysical properties, Nav1.9 is proposed to contribute to the resting membrane potential and regulate nerve terminal excitability. More recently, we, as well as others, have shown that the Nav1.9 sodium current may be enhanced by the algogenic mediator ATP and the inflammatory mediator PGE2, acting through G protein–coupled pathways.

### Targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome [^111m5yah]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The management of visceral pain in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, notably irritable bowel syndrome, presents a considerable clinical challenge, with few available treatment options. Patients are increasingly using cannabis and cannabinoids to control abdominal pain. Cannabis acts on receptors of the endocannabinoid system, an endogenous system of lipid mediators that regulates gastrointestinal function and pain processing pathways in health and disease.

The endocannabinoid system represents a logical molecular therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological functions of the endocannabinoid system with a focus on the peripheral and central regulation of gastrointestinal function and visceral nociception. We address the use of cannabinoids in pain management, comparing them to other treatment modalities, including opioids and neuromodulators. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic candidates targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome.

### Association of pain location with computed tomography abnormalities in emergency department patients with abdominal pain [^112FZXaV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, the usage of computed tomography (CT) imaging has risen dramatically in emergency department (ED) patients with abdominal pain. Recognizing the potential disadvantages of overuse, efforts are being made to reduce imaging.

- **Objective**: We determined the operating characteristics for the location of abdominal pain for the entities of acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction. We hypothesized that patients with pain localized to the upper abdomen would be less likely to have CT abnormalities than those with lower abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, observational registry of ED patients with abdominal pain, performed in an academic, suburban ED with an annual census of 110,000. Presence of clinically significant CT abnormalities (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction) was recorded along with clinical variables including laboratory values, vital signs, reported location of pain, location of tenderness on examination, and physician pretest probability.

- **Results**: A convenience sample of 1154 patients was enrolled. Of all patients, 273 cases (24%) had abnormal CT results, including appendicitis (n = 95), diverticulitis (n = 133), and bowel obstruction (n = 49). Right upper quadrant pain was negatively associated with abnormal CT (p = 0.02). Clinician gestalt was highly specific, but lacked sensitivity for the diagnosis of appendicitis, diverticulitis, and obstruction. Twenty-four percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis had no right lower quadrant pain or tenderness.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^112YGc9M]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The key strength of our study is the use of a globally-reaching, uniformly collected dataset. The general population sampling was done with different quotas, allowing for demographically balanced and population-representative samples with regard to age, gender, and education level. The initial epidemiology questionnaire study was collaboratively designed by a team of international DGBI experts, generating a very rich set of information focused on the evaluation of all DGBI diagnoses using the latest diagnostic Rome IV criteria. All questionnaires were translated using a uniform translation method with cultural adaptations and linguistic validations. Quality checks were included in the online survey and the subsequent data processing to ensure that inconsistent and non-attentive responders could be eliminated from the analyses.

Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. The first limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data. It has been demonstrated that the severity of symptoms patients with DGBI experience varies over time and that they can potentially shift between DGBI diagnoses depending on their symptom profile. In addition, despite identifying and excluding subjects with common doctor-diagnosed organic GI diseases — such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer anywhere in the GI tract, peptic ulcer, and diverticulitis — from DGBI diagnoses, we could potentially have missed less common organic GI conditions that could explain the symptom profile. Furthermore, since the survey was conducted anonymously, we could not invite subjects for further investigation after the initial survey completion, which limited our ability to delve deeper into ambiguous cases.

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^1167sZGz]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that a substantial proportion of the worldwide population experiences frequent meal-related abdominal pain. Identifying these individuals in the general population is important to assess the magnitude of this problem. However, recognizing them in clinical practice could also be significant. This recognition could allow clinicians to propose a management strategy that focuses more on meal-related issues, potentially involving the help of trained dieticians. To improve the management of these subjects, more studies investigating meal-related gastrointestinal symptoms (beyond abdominal pain) are needed. These investigations will help us to understand the complete symptom profile of this specific subgroup and enhance our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

### A paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus input to ventral of lateral septal nucleus controls chronic visceral pain [^113HvYZP]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic visceral pain with complex etiology and difficult treatment. Accumulated evidence has confirmed that the sensitization of the central nervous system plays an important role in the development of visceral pain, whereas the exact mechanisms of action of the neural pathways remain largely unknown. In this study, a distinct neural circuit was identified from the paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) to the ventral of lateral septal (LSV) region. This circuit was responsible for regulating visceral pain.

- **Neural pathway specifics**: In particular, the data indicated that the PVH CaMKIIα-positive neurons' inputs to the LSV CaMKIIα-positive neurons were only activated by colorectal distention rather than somatic stimulations. The PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ projection pathway was further confirmed by experiments containing a viral tracer. Optogenetic inhibition of PVH CaMKIIα+ inputs to LSV CaMKIIα-positive neurons suppressed visceral pain, whereas selective activation of the PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ projection evoked visceral pain.

These findings suggest the critical role of the PVH-LSV CaMKIIα+ circuit in regulating visceral pain.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: Why, how, and when [^112HwQWX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choosing a central neuromodulator for treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be based on the pharmacological properties of the different groups and the predominant symptoms of each patient, as well as considering potential side effects.

- **Selection criteria**: The activity of central neuromodulators on abdominal pain, intestinal motility, anxiety, and depression should guide the selection process. It is critical to align the choice of treatment with the specific needs and symptomatology of the patient.

- **Side effects consideration**: Evaluate the potential side effects associated with each central neuromodulator to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks for the patient. This careful assessment can help tailor an effective and safe treatment regimen.

### Basic and clinical aspects of visceral sensation: Transmission in the CNS [^115BEZES]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Pain and discomfort are the leading causes for consultative visits to gastroenterologists. Acute pain should be considered a symptom of an underlying disease, thereby serving a physiologically important function. However, many patients experience chronic pain in the absence of potentially harmful stimuli or disorders, turning pain into the primary problem rather than a symptom. Vagal and spinal afferents both contribute to the sensory component of the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that they convey different elements of the complex sensory experience. Spinal afferents play a key role in the discriminatory dimension, while vagal input primarily affects the strong emotional and autonomic reactions to noxious visceral stimuli. Drugs, surgical, and non-pharmacological treatments can target these pathways and provide therapeutic options for patients with chronic visceral pain syndromes.

### Studies of the symptom abdominal pain — a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MiJLT]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision-making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases, and the chance of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.

- **Aim**: We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on the prevalence, aetiology, or prognosis of abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. We included all types of study designs except for qualitative studies. Studies focused solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies. Mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients, the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common aetiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2–18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6–13.2%), urological causes (5.3%), and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%), or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.

- **Conclusion**: There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^1138ALj2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The algorithm for the symptomatic management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) is designed for use by physicians. FACP refers to the sudden occurrence of mild-to-moderate, undulating, and recurring cramping pain in any part of the abdomen. This pain can last from seconds to minutes or up to a few hours and occurs in the absence of any "red flag" signs or symptoms of structural organic disease. It also shows no strong association with defecation, which might otherwise indicate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Generally, FACP does not significantly interfere with daily activities. FACP indicates functional abdominal cramping pain; IBS is irritable bowel syndrome; SSRI is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA is tricyclic antidepressant.

Given the prevalence of self-care among patients experiencing FACP, we suggest adapting this algorithm for pharmacists and patients. This adaptation aims to support improved self-management of FACP, raise awareness of "red flag" signs or symptoms that necessitate referral to or consultation with an appropriate physician, and highlight alternative approaches that patients might not intuitively consider [figures 3 and 4]. These algorithms could form the basis of the education needed for pharmacists and patients to facilitate the recognition and effective self-treatment of FACP.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: A randomized controlled trial [^117LWK2G]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The study concluded that local analgesic lidocaine and central analgesic sufentanil showed negative efficacy in the short-term observation. No adverse events were found in the two groups, which indicates that the opioid receptor blocker sufentanil does not worsen the symptoms of patients with CAPS after receiving colonoscopy under general anesthesia in a short-term observation. Furthermore, peripheral and central analgesic intervention by lidocaine and sufentanil were ineffective. This may suggest the potential dominant role of continuous central mediation and mental therapy in the management of CAPS.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation to the emergency department. It is vital that physicians understand and are familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology, thereby encouraging early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, and most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis, with no evidence of peritonism on examination, can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy.

This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116wdgrL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common cause for emergency admission. While some patients have serious abdominal pathology, a significant group of those patients have no specific cause for the pain. This study was conducted to identify those who have non-specific abdominal pain and can be either admitted short term for observation or reassured and discharged for outpatient management.

- **Patients and methods**: A prospective documentation of clinical and laboratory data was obtained on a consecutive cohort of 286 patients admitted to a surgical unit over a nine-month period with symptoms of abdominal pain regarded as severe enough for full assessment in the casualty department and admission to a surgical ward. The patients were followed until a definitive diagnosis was made, or their condition and abdominal pain improved, allowing for discharge. The study took place in a small peripheral general hospital serving a population of 120,000 people in a rural area in New Zealand.

- **Results**: There were 286 admissions to the emergency department. Logistic regression multivariate statistical analysis showed that guarding, raised white cell count, tachycardia, and vomiting were the only variables associated with significant pathology.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with no vomiting, no guarding, normal pulse rates, and normal white cell counts are unlikely to have significant pathology requiring further active intervention, either medical or surgical.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture is equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow for clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy.

- **Rationale for laparoscopy**: The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have similar outcomes to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Abdominal migraine, another cause of abdominal pain in adults [^1174yu3S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Abdominal migraine is a diagnostically challenging childhood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, which has not been clearly demonstrated to occur in adults.

- **Methods**: We used two sets of consensus criteria for the diagnosis of abdominal migraine in children to evaluate adults suspected of having this condition in both our own patient population and in the medical literature. Two patients in our clinic and eleven patients from the medical literature composed our initial study cohort. They were analyzed using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd Edition, and the American College of Gastroenterology Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for abdominal migraine in children.

- **Results**: Ten of these patients met the inclusion criteria for definite or probable abdominal migraine and comprised our final study cohort. The ten patients from this adult cohort shared common demographic and clinical characteristics with children suffering from abdominal migraine, including a familial history of migraine in 90% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings demonstrate that abdominal migraine occurs and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain in adults, especially if there is a family history of migraine headaches.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, prioritizing life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Stress and visceral pain: Focusing on irritable bowel syndrome [^1138N53w]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Recent advances in brain science have shown that the brain function encoding emotion depends on interoceptive signals such as visceral pain. Visceral pain arose early in our evolutionary history. Bottom-up processing from gut-to-brain and top-down autonomic/neuroendocrine mechanisms in brain-to-gut signaling constitute a circuit. Brain imaging techniques have enabled us to depict the visceral pain pathway as well as the related emotional circuit.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by chronic abdominal pain or abdominal discomfort associated with bowel dysfunction. It is also thought to be a disorder of the brain-gut link associated with an exaggerated response to stress.

- **Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)**: A major mediator of the stress response in the brain-gut axis, CRH is an obvious candidate in the pathophysiology of IBS. Indeed, administration of CRH has been shown to aggravate the visceral sensorimotor response in IBS patients, and the administration of peptidergic CRH antagonists seems to alleviate IBS pathophysiology.

- **Serotonin (5-HT)**: Another likely candidate associated with brain-gut function in IBS, as 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT4 agonists, and antidepressants were demonstrated to regulate 5-HT neurotransmission in IBS patients.

Autonomic nervous system function, the neuroimmune axis, and the brain-gut-microbiota axis show specific profiles in IBS patients. Further studies on stress and visceral pain neuropathways in IBS patients are warranted.

### A vagus nerve dominant tetra-synaptic ascending pathway for gastric pain processing [^116uWM8J]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gastric pain is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal symptom with a complex etiology. Functional dyspepsia, gastric ulcers, gastric cancer, and gastroparesis are associated with painful sensations in the stomach. Patients with gastric pain have impaired food intake, leading to weight loss and low quality of life. Traditionally, it has been suggested that the occurrence of gastric pain is associated with abnormal gastric dynamics, visceral hypersensitivity, and psychosomatic factors, yet the specific pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is a lack of specific therapies in the clinic.

In recent years, research on visceral pain has made significant strides. However, studies on gastric pain predominantly focus on the peripheral nervous system, with limited investigation into central nervous system mechanisms. There is a pressing clinical need for the development of novel, specific therapeutic approaches targeting gastric pain. Early studies have provided preliminary mappings of brain nuclei anatomically connected to the stomach. However, which nuclei can respond to gastric pain stimuli and how they form neural circuits to transmit gastric pain signals remain unclear.

### Quantitative somatosensory testing of the abdomen: Establishing initial reference values across developmental age and biological sex [^112CML84]. Pain (2024). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common symptom of several debilitating conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and endometriosis, and it affects individuals throughout their lifespan. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) reference values exist for many body sites but not the abdomen. Using a QST battery adapted from the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain, we collected QST data on the upper and lower abdomen in 181 pain-free participants, ages 12 to 50 years, to establish reference values by age and biological sex.

The normative values are presented as medians for each QST measure by sex (male, n = 63; female, n = 118) and across three age categories:

- **Adolescents**: 12–19 years, n = 48.
- **Young adults**: 20–30 years, n = 87.
- **Adults**: 31–50 years, n = 46.

Evaluating the sensory functioning of the abdomen and characterizing ranges of QST measures is an essential first step in understanding and monitoring the clinical course of sensory abnormalities in patients with underlying diseases affecting the abdomen and pelvis. Evaluating the impact of age and development on sensory functioning is necessary, given age-related changes in pain perception and modulation.

### What activates visceral afferents [^114J9PV8]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Vagal and spinal afferents represent the information superhighways that convey sensory information from the gut to the central nervous system. These afferents are sensitive to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Vagal afferents terminate in the muscle layers and in the mucosa. Muscle afferents are activated at physiological levels of distension and during peristalsis. In contrast, spinal afferents encode supraphysiological levels of intestinal pressure.

Vagal and spinal afferents also express a wide range of membrane receptors to a variety of chemical mediators generated from both within and outside the gut wall. Some of these receptors are part of a modality-specific transduction pathway involved in sensory signalling from the gut lumen to vagal afferent endings in the mucosa. Others, which are activated by substances derived from multiple cellular sources during ischaemia, injury, or inflammation, act in a synergistic way to cause acute or chronic sensitisation of the afferent nerves to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie hypersensitivity may have implications for the pharmaceutical approach to the treatment of functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome.

### Abdominal pain and the neurotrophic system in ulcerative colitis [^115VGHXV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

We undertook a study to test the hypothesis that inflammation alters peripheral sensory mechanisms, thereby contributing to chronic abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis (UC).

- **Methods**: Patients with UC and healthy individuals rated abdominal pain using a visual analog scale and completed surveys describing anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score) and gastrointestinal symptoms (Rome III questionnaire). Patient age, sex, and severity of inflammation were determined. Rectal biopsies were processed using immunohistochemical techniques to assess nerve fiber density and real-time PCR to determine transcript expression of neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, artemin, neurturin), ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1), and inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17).

- **Results**: A total of 77 patients with UC (27 female, 50 male) and 21 controls (10 female, 11 male) were enrolled. Patients with UC with pain had significantly higher depression scores than controls and patients with UC without pain (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between any of the inflammatory markers and pain scores. Visual analog scale pain scores significantly correlated with younger age, higher depression scores, increased expression of neurturin, and decreased expression of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 in the mucosa. Mucosal nerve fiber density did not correlate with any measures of inflammation or pain.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^117JGrYW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). High credibility.

Emergency department providers have become skilled at triaging patients with abdominal pain that requires surgical interventions. Abdominal pain mimics, which are medical conditions that cause the sensation of abdominal pain without any abdominal abnormality, continue to puzzle even the best physicians.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116oZzjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment result in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions, increasing diagnostic accuracy in these patients. However, this approach is expensive, with significant resource use and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations and averts delays in operative management. Morino et al. assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that compared with clinical observation, early laparoscopy did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported a higher number of diagnoses and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group.

In another study, patients who showed no evidence of guarding, had normal temperature, and normal white cell count were observed — a practice proven to reduce the rate of negative appendicectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain (25–35% of all patients), and only a quarter of those patients require surgical intervention. Clinical scores developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful but can only be used in conjunction with clinical judgment. If there is any suspicion of serious pathology, the patient should undergo diagnostic laparoscopy.

The study shows that likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with a normal white cell count, no history of vomiting, and absent signs of significant pathology.

### Visceral versus somatic pain: an educational review of anatomy and clinical implications [^115brwkA]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Somatic and visceral nociceptive signals travel via different pathways to reach the spinal cord. Additionally, signals regulating visceral blood flow and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) motility travel via efferent sympathetic nerves. To offer optimal pain relief and increase GIT motility and blood flow, we should interfere with all these pathways, including the afferent nerves that travel with the sympathetic trunks, the somatic fibers that innervate the abdominal wall and part of the parietal peritoneum, and the sympathetic efferent fibers.

All somatic and visceral afferent neural and sympathetic efferent pathways are effectively blocked by appropriately placed segmental thoracic epidural blocks (TEBs). In contrast, well-placed truncal fascial plane blocks do not consistently block the afferent visceral neural pathways nor the sympathetic efferent nerves. It is generally accepted that countering the effects of the stress response on the GIT would be beneficial; therefore, most enhanced recovery after surgery protocols involve TEB. However, the TEB failure rate can be high, enticing practitioners to resort to truncal fascial plane blocks.

In this educational article, we discuss the differences between visceral and somatic pain, their management, and the clinical implications of these differences.

### Analgesia in patients with acute abdominal pain [^1113AvxK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

For decades, analgesia for patients with acute abdominal pain was withheld until a definitive diagnosis was established, due to fears of masking symptoms, altering physical findings, or ultimately delaying the diagnosis and treatment of a surgical condition. This non-evidence-based approach has been challenged by recent studies demonstrating that the use of analgesia in the initial evaluation of patients with acute abdominal pain leads to significant pain reduction without affecting diagnostic accuracy. Early administration of analgesia can greatly reduce a patient's pain and does not interfere with a diagnosis, which may even be facilitated due to the severity of physical symptoms being reduced.

- **Objectives**: To determine if the currently available evidence supports the use of opioid analgesia in the management of patients with acute abdominal pain and to assess changes in patient comfort while awaiting a definitive diagnosis and final treatment decisions.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to 2006), using a randomized controlled trial filter for the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. Trials were also identified by "related articles". The searches were not limited by language or publication status.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that include adult patients with acute abdominal pain, without gender restriction, comparing any opioid analgesia regime to no analgesia administered prior to intervention.

### Putative therapeutic targets in the treatment of visceral hyperalgesia [^115hhanw]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

The management of abdominal pain remains a major challenge for clinicians despite an explosion of knowledge regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of sensory neural circuits. Initial progress was made in the field of somatic pain, providing broad hypotheses that could be tested in the field of visceral pain. Major advances in understanding the basic mechanisms underlying visceral pain originated in the urinary tract and have been applied to the gut. However, this increased understanding of enteric sensory physiology has yet to generate new effective treatments for abdominal pain. This review addresses novel insights into peripheral mechanisms underlying visceral hyperalgesia and their applicability to developing novel therapeutic approaches for treating chronic abdominal pain.

### Rare, overlooked, or underappreciated causes of recurrent abdominal pain: A primer for gastroenterologists [^1119movR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common reason for repeated visits to outpatient clinics and emergency departments, reflecting a substantial unmet need for timely and accurate diagnosis. A lack of awareness of some of the rarer causes of recurrent abdominal pain may impede diagnosis and delay effective management. This article identifies some of the key rare but diagnosable causes that are frequently missed by gastroenterologists and provides expert recommendations to support recognition, diagnosis, and management with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.

### The influence of voltage-gated sodium channels on human gastrointestinal nociception [^1145ewAs]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a frequent and persistent problem in the most common gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Pain adversely impacts quality of life, incurs significant healthcare expenditures, and remains a challenging issue to manage, with few safe therapeutic options currently available. It is imperative that new methods are developed for identifying and treating this symptom. A variety of peripherally active neuroendocrine signaling elements have the capability to influence gastrointestinal pain perception. A large and growing body of evidence suggests that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play a critical role in the development and modulation of nociceptive signaling associated with the gut. Several VGSC isoforms demonstrate significant promise as potential targets for improved diagnosis and treatment of gut-based disorders associated with hyper- and hyposensitivity to abdominal pain.

In this article, we critically review key investigations that have evaluated the potential role VGSCs play in visceral nociception and discuss recent advances related to this topic. Specifically, we discuss the following:

- **Structure and basic function of VGSCs**: What is known about the structure and basic function of VGSCs.
- **Role in gut nociception**: The role each VGSC plays in gut nociception, particularly as it relates to human physiology.
- **Potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses**: Potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses of VGSCs to manage disorders associated with chronic abdominal pain.

### A vagus nerve dominant tetra-synaptic ascending pathway for gastric pain processing [^116xFdM3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Vagal and spinal afferents are the two major primary afferents that convey sensory information with different natures from the upper gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system. It has been commonly assumed that vagal afferents predominantly convey physiological information, while spinal afferents process nociception. Existing electrophysiological evidence reveals that vagal afferents respond to gastric distension (GD) in the noxious range (up to 60 mmHg); however, there is no conclusive evidence so far to show that vagal afferents include nociceptors that initiate pain due to the lack of high-threshold mechanosensitive afferent fibers (putative nociceptors).

Despite the lack of evidence as a nociceptor, a considerable body of evidence indicates vagal afferents as pain modulators. For example, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy enhances visceromotor responses to colorectal distension, a region beyond the innervation of vagal afferents. Sensitization of vagal afferents causes changes in the amygdala, resulting in the suppression of nociceptive signals conveyed by gastric spinal afferents via the descending pain modulatory pathway. In addition, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces different forms of somatic or visceral pain, although some other studies report no effect or dual effect.

The nucleus tractus solitaries (NTS) is a principal nucleus that receives afferent projections from the vagus nerve and is responsible for relaying information from various organs within the body. Studies have reported that noxious GD induces significantly more c-Fos expression in the NTS.

### Abdominophrenic dyssynergia: A narrative review [^114i9cWW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic bloating and abdominal distension are common and highly bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms. Although the differential diagnoses for bloating and distension are broad, these symptoms are frequently associated with disorders of gut-brain interaction. Functional abdominal bloating may be a result of visceral hypersensitivity, whereas abdominal distension seems to be a somatic behavioral response associated with abdominophrenic dyssynergia. This condition features diaphragmatic contraction and abdominal wall relaxation. We review the available literature regarding abdominophrenic dyssynergia and comment on its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and avenues to address in the near future.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^116kjn2X]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

- **Changes in abdominal pain after colonoscopy in the S + L group (NRS and VRS methods)**: Intra-group analysis of abdominal pain before and after colonoscopy was conducted in the S + L group. There were no significant differences observed (NRS: p = 0.819 and VRS: p = 0.95).

- **Changes in abdominal pain after colonoscopy in the S group (NRS and VRS methods)**: Intra-group analysis of abdominal pain before and after colonoscopy was conducted in the S group. There were no significant differences noted (NRS: p = 0.97 and VRS: p = 0.96).

- **Small colonic polyps**: Small colonic polyps do not cause abdominal pain. Therefore, patients in this study who were detected with polyps (no more than five, < 0.5 cm in diameter) during colonoscopy were not excluded. After colonoscopy under general anesthesia, 18 patients in the two groups were found to have a single small colon polyp, and 14 patients had multiple small colon polyps (< 5 in number).

### Does pain modality play a role in the interruptive function of acute visceral compared with somatic pain [^112oLCcu]. Pain (2022). Low credibility.

Pain constitutes a highly salient warning signal that draws attention to potentially threatening situations, especially potential tissue damage, thus promoting fear and protective behavior. As defined by its interruptive function, pain frequently interferes with ongoing cognitive processes by capturing and redirecting attentional resources. This "interruptive function of pain" has been indicated for acute experimental and clinical pain as well as for chronic pain, demonstrably affecting working memory, visual processing, and attentional switching.

Top–down factors, such as the expectation of pain-related impairment or fear of pain, as well as bottom–up factors, like the affected body site, likely determine the extent of pain–cognition interference. For example, experimental pain stimuli applied to the hand versus the face elicited different levels of pain-related fear and differentially interfered with visual encoding and memory performance. However, all of these studies used exteroceptive rather than interoceptive experimental models of acute pain.

With a prevalence of up to 25%, intermittent interoceptive abdominal pain constitutes one of the most common pain conditions and is a key symptom of chronic visceral pain conditions. Interoceptive visceral pain differs from exteroceptive somatic pain with respect to various aspects. Both pain modalities share common brain representations but importantly also show genuine processing differences, which presumably shape differential responding at the behavioral level. Visceral stimuli, for instance, are perceived differently.

### Targeting epigenetic mechanisms for chronic visceral pain: A valid approach for the development of novel therapeutics [^113rQx3A]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic visceral pain is persistent pain emanating from thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal origin that is poorly localized with regard to the specific organ affected. The prevalence can range up to 25% in the adult population as chronic visceral pain is a common feature of many visceral disorders, which may or may not be accompanied by distinct structural or histological abnormalities within the visceral organs. Mounting evidence suggests that changes in epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the top-down or bottom-up sensitization of pain pathways and the development of chronic pain. Epigenetic changes can lead to long-term alterations in gene expression profiles of neurons and consequently alter functionality of peripheral neurons, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brain neurons. However, epigenetic modifications are dynamic, and thus, detrimental changes may be reversible. Hence, external factors and therapeutic interventions may be capable of modulating the epigenome and restoring normal gene expression for extended periods of time.

- **Purpose**: The goal of this review is to highlight the latest discoveries made toward understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in the development or maintenance of chronic visceral pain. Furthermore, this review will provide evidence supporting that targeting these epigenetic mechanisms may represent a novel approach to treat chronic visceral pain.

### Spinal cord stimulation for visceral pain: Present approaches and future strategies [^116Gj1Da]. Pain Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The introduction of successful neuromodulation strategies for managing chronic visceral pain lags behind what is now the treatment of choice in refractory chronic back and extremity pain for many providers in the United States and Europe. Changes in public policy and monetary support to identify nonopioid treatments for chronic pain have sparked interest in alternative options. In this review, we discuss the scope of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for visceral pain, its limitations, and the potential role for new intradural devices of the type that we are developing in our laboratories, which may be able to overcome existing challenges.

- **Methods**: A review of the available literature relevant to this topic was performed, with particular focus on the pertinent neuroanatomy and uses of spinal cord stimulation systems in the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and chronic pelvic pain.

- **Results**: At the time of writing, there have been multiple off-label reports testing SCS for refractory gastrointestinal and genitourinary conditions. Though some findings have been favorable for these organs and systems, there is insufficient evidence to make this practice routine. The unique configuration and layout of the pelvic pain pathways may not be ideally treated using traditional SCS implantation techniques, and intradural stimulation may be a viable alternative.

- **Conclusions**: Despite the prevalence of visceral pain, the application of neuromodulation therapies, a standard approach for other painful conditions, has received far too little attention.

### Centrally targeted pharmacotherapy for chronic abdominal pain [^114rK7oQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain in the context of functional gastrointestinal disorders departs from the more traditional approach to treating gastrointestinal symptoms. This condition involves a dysregulation of brain-gut modulation of afferent signaling; therefore, treatments directed toward the gut are not usually sufficient to achieve a clinical response. Instead, the methods of treatment depend on re-establishing central pain regulation.

- **Purpose**: A conceptual model of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors is used to explain how a situation of chronic pain develops. It provides evidence for central neuron degeneration as relevant to this chain of events. The rationale for centrally targeted medications, particularly antidepressants, is discussed with regard to effects independent of their role in treating psychiatric disorders, focusing on the downregulation of afferent pain signals and their potential role in neuron proliferation. Finally, the text outlines guiding examples of which drug to use and treatment combinations involving multiple drugs, including augmentation treatment, and presents some brief clinical cases of centrally targeted pharmacotherapy.

### Gastrointestinal pain [^114UY3kK]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) pain, a form of visceral pain, is common in disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and pancreatitis. Identifying the cause of GI pain often represents a diagnostic challenge, as the clinical presentation is frequently blurred by concomitant autonomic and somatic symptoms. Further complicating matters, GI pain can be nociceptive, neuropathic, or associated with cancer, with multiple etiologies often coexisting in an individual patient.

Mechanisms of GI pain are complex and involve both peripheral and central sensitization, as well as the involvement of the autonomic nervous system, which contributes to the symptoms that frequently accompany pain. Treatment of GI pain depends on the precise type of pain and the primary disorder in the patient. It may include pharmacological therapy, cognitive behavioral therapies, invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic procedures, and lifestyle alterations. Due to significant differences between organ involvement, disease mechanisms, and individual factors, treatment must always be personalized. Some data suggest that phenotyping and subsequent individual management of GI pain might be viable options in the future.

### Chronic visceral pain: New peripheral mechanistic insights and resulting treatments [^111axdUo]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic visceral pain is one of the most common reasons for patients with gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or disorders of brain-gut interaction, to seek medical attention. It represents a substantial burden to patients and is associated with anxiety, depression, reductions in quality of life, and impaired social functioning, as well as increased direct and indirect health care costs to society. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and treatment of chronic visceral pain is difficult, in part because our understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic basis is incomplete.

In this review, we highlight recent advances in peripheral pain signaling and specific physiologic and pathophysiologic preclinical mechanisms that result in the sensitization of peripheral pain pathways. We focus on preclinical mechanisms that have been translated into treatment approaches and summarize the evidence base for directing treatment toward these mechanisms of chronic visceral pain derived from clinical trials. The effective management of chronic visceral pain remains of critical importance for the quality of life of sufferers. A deeper understanding of peripheral pain mechanisms is necessary and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic interventions.

### Role of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the gastrointestinal symptoms of migraine-clinical considerations: A narrative review [^1119boc8]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Abdominal migraine is usually recognized in childhood and is characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe midline abdominal pain, associated with vasomotor symptoms, nausea, and vomiting, without headache [e1, e5]. It is most commonly observed in children between the ages of 5 and 9 years and is rarely seen in adults. For approximately two-thirds of children, abdominal migraine resolves by their late teenage years, and 50%–70% of these individuals go on to develop migraine headaches [e6]. Episodes of abdominal pain last between 2 and 72 hours, separated by symptom-free periods [e1].

### Abdominal migraine [^113ii7eH]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal migraine (AM) is a syndrome usually recognized in childhood, characterized by episodic attacks of severe abdominal pain, vasomotor symptoms, nausea, and vomiting. It is a poorly understood disorder largely due to a limited recognition of this condition by the medical community. However, the publication of AM diagnostic guidelines by the International Headache Society a decade ago and its inclusion in the Rome Classification of functional gastrointestinal disorders have helped legitimize this disorder and facilitate research.

- **Overview**: AM is relatively common, affecting up to 4% of the pediatric population. While AM is not believed to continue into adulthood for the majority of children, it has the propensity to develop into probable migraine and recurring abdominal pain in adulthood. The pathophysiology of this condition remains unclear; as a result, treatment is suboptimal, with avoidance of triggers and prophylactic treatment currently recommended when an episode begins.

- **Conclusion**: The recognition of AM by the International Headache Society and the Rome Foundation should help facilitate future research into the pathophysiology of this debilitating condition. Consequently, better treatments for AM should emerge. Randomized controlled trials should be a priority.

### Visceral and somatic sensory function in functional dyspepsia [^112u2hNN]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Visceral hypersensitivity is one of the proposed underlying mechanisms in functional dyspepsia (FD). It is not clear whether visceral hypersensitivity in FD is a manifestation of a central sensitization also encompassing somatic sensitization. Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV(1)) pathways are involved in gastric mechanosensory physiology, and the TRPV(1) receptor agonist, capsaicin, has been used as a chemical stimulant.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, randomized study, we evaluated both visceral and somatic sensory function in 34 FD patients and 42 healthy controls using quantitative sensory testing. Visceral pain sensitivity was assessed using a validated gastric pain model with oral capsaicin capsule titration, and somatic pain sensitivity was determined by foot heat and hand electric stimulation.

- **Key results**: The median capsaicin dose required to attain moderate pain was 0.5 mg in FD and 1 mg in controls (P = 0.03). At these doses, mean pain intensities on a 0–100 visual analog scale were greater for FD than controls [56.9 (95% confidence intervals, 52.2–61.5) vs. 45.1 (41.6–48.6), respectively] (P = 0.005). Overall, mean somatic sensory and pain thresholds were similar in FD and control groups, but in a subgroup of FD, pain hypersensitivity was seen on the hand and on the foot at different stimulation thresholds.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: A majority of patients with FD have visceral chemo-hypersensitivity involving TRPV(1) pathways. A substantial subgroup also has somatic hypersensitivity as evidence of central sensitization.

### Meckel diverticulum presenting as abdominal pain and subsequent bowel perforation [^1123nYgU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom with a broad array of potential etiologies. Meckel diverticulum (MD), the most common congenital gastrointestinal malformation, classically presents with painless gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it can also lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, manifesting as abdominal pain.

- **Case report**: A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Abdominal ultrasound findings were consistent with ileitis and ileocolic intussusception, but no such intussusception was seen during fluoroscopic air enema. The patient was admitted for serial abdominal examinations and subsequently developed an acute abdomen. Emergent laparotomy revealed a perforated MD. Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis were performed, and no complications developed.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: The presence of an MD can lead to diverticulitis, intussusception, or obstruction, putting the patient at risk of bowel perforation. As such, it is important to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain. In cases where sonographic findings are ambiguous or transient, additional observation or alternative imaging, such as computed tomography, should be strongly considered.

### Gut-focused hypnotherapy for functional gastrointestinal disorders: Evidence-base, practical aspects, and the Manchester Protocol [^114Ws7ZP]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS) is a recently redefined, relatively rare but severe functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). It is characterized by chronic continuous abdominal pain minimally related to physiological events such as eating, defecation, and menses, resulting in a loss of day-to-day functioning. The mechanism of pain in these disorders is poorly understood, but it is postulated to be due to central sensitization. CAPS is a challenging condition to treat, with patients often presenting repeatedly with significant psychological comorbidity, multiple negative investigations, and substantial socioeconomic costs, including healthcare utilization and the burden of loss of working days due to illness.

Patients with CAPS frequently exhibit consequences of fear avoidance and characteristics such as pain catastrophizing, hypervigilance, attentional bias, and psychological inflexibility. These factors make a compelling case for treating CAPS with gut-focused hypnotherapy. Although specific evidence for hypnotherapy in CAPS is lacking in adult literature, it has been shown to be effective in children.

### Evaluation of the short-term efficacy of local analgesic (lidocaine) and opioid analgesic (sufentanil) on patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^1155KKVz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS) is characterized by severe abdominal pain persisting for more than six months. CAPS can impair function across several life domains. It is less common than other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), with a prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 2.1%. Females are 1.5 to 2 times more susceptible to CAPS than males, with the peak occurrence in the fourth decade of life. CAPS is a complex heterogeneous condition resulting from physical stimuli and cognitive and emotional factors. Drawing from other FGIDs, such as disorders of gut-brain interaction, peripheral stimuli, and structural changes in the responsible brain functional regions are related to CAPS. However, unlike irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), intestinal features are largely disconnected in CAPS. Cognitive and emotional features play a more dominant role in the pain experience.

Given the severity and chronicity of pain symptoms in CAPS, structural changes in the relevant functional regions of the brain are more likely. If psychological factors amplify the experience of pain, this rationale supports psychological interventions for managing CAPS. Present clinical trials are limited, possibly due to the low incidence of CAPS, uncertain efficacy of treatments, and unclear mechanisms of CAPS. These limitations are not adequate to explain CAPS by structural or psychological factors.

Previous studies have found that 300 mg intrarectal lidocaine jelly could improve abdominal pain symptoms.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1136EALE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

There were 286 patients over the three-month period of the study, with 201 (70%) being female. The median age was 37 years.

- **Causes of abdominal pain**: The causes of abdominal pain are as follows: non-specific abdominal pain was the diagnosis in 98 patients (34% of total), with 72 (73%) of these being female. The non-specific nature of the pain was determined by clinical resolution of the symptoms or diagnostic laparoscopy. None of the patients with non-specific pain had guarding or vomiting, and only five had a raised white cell count. A non-surgical cause was observed in 47 patients.

- **Univariate analysis**: This analysis showed that important factors predicting acute surgical pathology include guarding (p < 0.0001), raised WBC (p < 0.0001), tachycardia (pulse rate greater than 100 per minute) (p < 0.0001), temperature (p < 0.0001), rigors (p = 0.0008), lack of appetite (p < 0.0001), and vomiting (p < 0.0001).

- **Multivariate analysis**: Conducted using logistic regression, this analysis indicated that the only significant predicting factors for an acute surgical diagnosis are heart rate (p = 0.048), guarding (p = 0.0009), WBC (p = 0.016), and vomiting (p = 0.008).

### Global prevalence and burden of meal-related abdominal pain [^116DSZUU]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) report meal intake to be associated with symptoms. DGBI patients with meal-related symptoms may have more severe symptoms overall and worse health outcomes, but this subgroup has not been well characterized. We aimed to describe the global prevalence of meal-related abdominal pain and characterize this subgroup.

- **Methods**: The data analyzed originated from the Internet survey component of the population-based Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study, completed in 26 countries (n = 54,127). Adult subjects were asked whether they had abdominal pain and how often this was meal-related. Respondents were categorized into "no", "occasional", and "frequent" meal-related abdominal pain groups based on 0%, 10–40%, and ≥ 50% of the pain episodes being meal-related, respectively. DGBI diagnoses, frequency of other GI symptoms, psychological distress, non-GI somatic symptoms, quality of life, and healthcare utilization were compared between groups. Mixed linear and ordinal regression was used to assess independent associations between psychological distress, non-GI somatic symptoms, quality of life, other GI symptoms, and meal-related abdominal pain.

- **Results**: Overall, 51.9% of the respondents reported abdominal pain in the last 3 months, and 11.0% belonged to the group with frequent meal-related abdominal pain, which included more females and younger subjects. DGBI diagnoses were more common in subjects with frequent meal-related abdominal pain, and the frequency of several GI symptoms was associated with having more frequent meal-related abdominal pain.

### The abdominal wall: An overlooked source of pain [^111WSypB]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

When abdominal pain is chronic and unremitting, with minimal or no relationship to eating or bowel function but often a relationship to posture (i.e. lying, sitting, standing), the abdominal wall should be suspected as the source of pain. Frequently, a localized, tender trigger point can be identified, although the pain may radiate over a diffuse area of the abdomen. If tenderness is unchanged or increased when abdominal muscles are tensed (positive Carnett's sign), the abdominal wall is the likely origin of pain.

Most commonly, abdominal wall pain is related to cutaneous nerve root irritation or myofascial irritation. The pain can also result from structural conditions, such as localized endometriosis or rectus sheath hematoma, or from incisional or other abdominal wall hernias. If hernia or structural disease is excluded, injection of a local anesthetic with or without a corticosteroid into the pain trigger point can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

### Characterization of abdominal pain during methylnaltrexone treatment of opioid-induced constipation in advanced illness: A post hoc analysis of two clinical trials [^116rSSft]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Methylnaltrexone is a selective peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that decreases the constipating effects of opioids without affecting centrally mediated analgesia. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies of methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness, abdominal pain was the most common adverse event (AE) reported.

- **Objectives**: This analysis sought to further characterize the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities-defined abdominal pain AEs experienced in these studies.

- **Methods**: A post hoc analysis of verbatim descriptions was used to further assess AEs characterized as abdominal pain in both trials. Descriptive summary statistics were used to assess the severity of abdominal pain, effect of abdominal pain on global pain scores, and other characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of baseline characteristics with abdominal pain.

- **Results**: Most verbatim descriptions of abdominal pain referred to "abdominal cramps" or "cramping". Abdominal pain AEs were mostly mild to moderate in severity and did not affect patients' global evaluation of pain. The incidence of abdominal pain AEs in methylnaltrexone-treated patients was greatest after the first dose and decreased with subsequent doses. No association between abdominal pain AEs and most baseline patient characteristics was noted.

- **Conclusion**: Abdominal pain AEs in methylnaltrexone-treated patients in clinical trials are usually described as "cramps" or "cramping", and are mostly mild to moderate in severity.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: Case report [^112rN9eN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most emergency physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Visceral pain readouts in experimental medicine [^111xoFJH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Visceral pain is studied at the level of the primary afferent fiber, spinal cord, subcortical, and cortical levels electrophysiologically and using brain imaging, which provides an objective measure of excitation at each level. However, correlation of these with the actual perception of pain in conscious animal models has been problematic, leading to reliance on indirect measures in most preclinical research. The main method is electromyographic recording of abdominal muscle contractions in response to colorectal distension (CRD), which may reflect reflexes set up at several levels of the aforementioned pathway. Several experimental treatments for visceral pain have failed in clinical trials, possibly due to the inability to translate preclinical observations on CRD responses in animals to the perception of spontaneous events in patients. Therefore, more objective outcomes are needed.

In this NGM issue, Hultin et al. demonstrate the feasibility of routine recordings of cortical evoked electrical potentials (CEP) using implanted cranial electrodes in response to graded CRD in rats. CEP comprised three temporal components with latencies of approximately 20–50 ms, 90–180 ms, and 300 ms, which were reproducible and graded in intensity and latency with distension pressure. From this basic study, it is evident that colorectal evoked potentials can be recorded reliably in awake rats and may serve as an objective marker for centrally projecting visceral sensory signals in rodents. It remains to be seen how these responses are affected by drugs under development for the clinical management of visceral pain.

### Novel nervous system mechanisms in visceral pain [^112RpiEG]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Visceral hypersensitivity is an important factor underlying abdominal pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and can result from aberrant signaling from the gut to the brain or vice versa. Over the last two decades, research has identified several selective, intertwining pathways that underlie IBS-related visceral nociception, including specific receptors on afferent and efferent nerve fibers such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, opioid, and cannabinoid receptors. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Gil et al. demonstrate that in an animal model with reduced descending inhibitory control, the sympathetic nervous system outflow is enhanced, contributing to visceral and somatic hypersensitivity. They also provide evidence that interfering with the activation of adrenergic receptors on sensory nerves can be an interesting new strategy to treat visceral pain in IBS. This mini-review places these findings in a broader perspective by providing an overview of promising novel mechanisms to alter the nervous control of visceral pain by interfering with afferent or efferent neuronal signaling.

### Pain without nociception [^113RSo43]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

We describe a young woman with complete cervical spinal cord transection who developed significant abdominal pain triggered by gastric distension and deep abdominal palpation. Based on the nature of her spinal cord injury, her brain-gut axis was limited to vagal pathways. Studies in mammalian models of human visceral sensation consistently showed that the subdiaphragmatic vagus contains a homogeneous population of afferents activated by low-intensity stimuli. These stimuli are generally believed to be important in regulating autonomic function and perhaps contributing to visceral sensory experiences triggered by such low-intensity stimuli (e.g. fullness, nausea), but not pain, although many fibers encode stimuli well into the noxious range.

In contrast, spinal afferent pathways include fibers with high-activation thresholds that are thought to represent specialized nociceptors. This illustrative case argues against an exclusive role of specialized nociceptive pathways in visceral pain, but supports a concept of intensity coding where the composite of vagal and spinal input contributes to conscious perception and pain.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^111pku6q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Visceral pain is a common feature of many gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is a major cause of healthcare seeking, disability, and reduction in health-related quality of life. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) acts as a bidirectional, hierarchically controlled brain-body nexus that integrates the external environment with the internal milieu. It has been postulated to play a critical role in the genesis and modulation of visceral pain through its multiple interactions with the nociceptive system at the level of the periphery, spinal cord, brainstem, and forebrain. Dysfunction of the ANS has been variably described in both IBD and IBS.

The main neural substrate of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is the vagus nerve, which contains both afferent and efferent pathways. In humans, the vagus nerve innervates the entirety of the GI tract except for the distal third of the colon. The efferent vagus nerve is increasingly considered to play a critical role in the neuro-endocrine-immune axis within the gut through what is termed the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Thus, the non-invasive measurement of vagal tone in humans is likely to remain high on the contemporary GI research agenda.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Algorithms to aid the recognition and management of FACP

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, pain with cramping characteristics, which is generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin.

For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed in order to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination are paramount. This article discusses some of these diagnoses, including can't-miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.
