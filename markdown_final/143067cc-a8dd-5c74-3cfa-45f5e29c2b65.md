## Question

29 yo F with a history of severe depression and migraines (on daily sumatriptan and recently started fluoxetine 20 mg) presents for surgical abortion under conscious sedation. Anesthesia plans IV fentanyl pre-procedure for analgesia and offers ondansetron 4 mg IV for nausea prophylaxis. Is it safe to administer ondansetron and fentanyl together in this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to administer ondansetron and fentanyl together in a 29-year-old woman with severe depression and migraines who is taking daily sumatriptan and recently started fluoxetine 20 mg, for a surgical abortion under conscious sedation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and interaction risks, especially serotonin syndrome. Then, I should verify what the FDA labels say about ondansetron and fentanyl in combination with serotonergic drugs. Next, I will review clinical evidence and case reports to gauge real-world risk. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk modifiers and procedural context. Finally, I will outline a risk-mitigation plan and a practical recommendation, including alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic concern: ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist and fentanyl is an opioid with serotonergic activity, and both have been implicated in serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents, so the combination can theoretically increase serotonin syndrome risk in a patient already on fluoxetine and sumatriptan, which are serotonergic as well [^115YaC37] [^1119xGoS] [^115uDRBQ].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory signal strength. Multiple FDA labels explicitly warn that serotonin syndrome has been reported with ondansetron, particularly when used with serotonergic drugs including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, and opioids such as fentanyl, and some cases have been fatal, which means this is not a theoretical concern but a recognized adverse drug reaction with postmarketing reports [^115YaC37] [^116ZZvG6] [^112zpfeg].

> I should review the clinical evidence next. Case reports describe serotonin syndrome with fentanyl in patients on SSRIs, including procedural sedation scenarios, and with ondansetron in serotonergic combinations, reinforcing that the risk is real albeit uncommon; importantly, many reported cases occurred in peri-anesthesia settings, which matches this patient's planned conscious sedation context [^114XGqLN] [^113qWLQy] [^115YaC37].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk. I need to check modifiers: the patient is on fluoxetine and sumatriptan, both serotonergic, and is about to receive fentanyl and ondansetron, so she has at least four serotonergic exposures concurrently; this polypharmacy increases risk, though the absolute incidence remains low and is difficult to quantify from available data, and the clinical severity spans from mild to life-threatening, which mandates caution rather than automatic avoidance [^111L3b7q] [^112DWrrz].

> Next, I should review the procedural context. Conscious sedation for surgical abortion typically uses fentanyl with or without a benzodiazepine, and ondansetron 4 mg IV is a standard antiemetic for PONV prophylaxis; Society of Family Planning guidance supports fentanyl-based regimens and routine monitoring, but does not specifically address ondansetron–fentanyl–SSRI interactions, so I need to ensure we apply general anesthesia safety principles and serotonin syndrome vigilance in this setting [^116LnRTa] [^1138wJXc] [^114m2yuA].

> I will now examine risk-mitigation steps. Let me think about monitoring and thresholds: pre-procedure medication reconciliation, baseline vitals, and a plan to observe for mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities during and after the procedure are essential; given the polypharmacy, I should have a low threshold to suspect serotonin syndrome and be prepared to discontinue offending agents and provide supportive care, including benzodiazepines for agitation and hyperthermia management if needed [^111L3b7q] [^112DWrrz].

> But wait, what if we can reduce risk without sacrificing antiemesis. I should consider alternatives: metoclopramide 10 mg IV is an effective antiemetic for PONV and is not a 5-HT3 antagonist, so it avoids adding another serotonergic agent; droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV is also effective for PONV and does not carry the same serotonergic interaction risk, though it has QT considerations and may cause sedation, so I need to weigh those trade-offs and follow facility protocols [^115B6Aig] [^1138wJXc] [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the original plan. Given the patient's baseline serotonergic load and the peri-anesthesia setting where serotonin syndrome has been repeatedly reported with ondansetron plus serotonergic opioids, the safest, evidence-aligned approach is to avoid ondansetron in this specific combination and use a non–5-HT3 antiemetic such as metoclopramide or droperidol, while still employing standard fentanyl-based sedation with appropriate monitoring and post-procedure observation until return to baseline [^115YaC37] [^116LnRTa] [^113ZFDnN].

> Final recommendation: No, it is not considered safe to administer ondansetron and fentanyl together in this patient because of the meaningful risk of serotonin syndrome from cumulative serotonergic effects of fluoxetine, sumatriptan, fentanyl, and ondansetron. Use metoclopramide 10 mg IV or droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV for nausea prophylaxis instead, ensure continuous monitoring during sedation, and observe post-procedure until baseline mental status and vitals are stable, with a low threshold to evaluate for serotonin syndrome if symptoms emerge [^115YaC37] [^115B6Aig] [^113ZFDnN].

---

It is **not safe** to administer ondansetron and fentanyl together in this patient because both drugs increase serotonin syndrome risk, especially with fluoxetine and sumatriptan on board [^115YaC37] [^1119xGoS]. If antiemesis is needed, use a non-serotonergic alternative such as metoclopramide or droperidol, and monitor closely for serotonin syndrome if combined serotonergic therapy is unavoidable [^115B6Aig] [^1138wJXc].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interaction risks

### Serotonin syndrome risk

- **Ondansetron**: A 5-HT3 antagonist; serotonin syndrome has been reported, particularly with serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, opioids) [^115YaC37] [^113HbhMC].
- **Fentanyl**: An opioid with serotonergic activity; serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, and 5-HT3 antagonists [^1119xGoS] [^114XGqLN].
- **Fluoxetine and sumatriptan**: Both increase serotonin; combined use with ondansetron and fentanyl further elevates serotonin syndrome risk [^115uDRBQ] [^112Dp99C].

---

### Clinical evidence and case reports

Multiple reports describe serotonin syndrome with ondansetron plus serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs and opioids, with **some cases fatal** [^115YaC37] [^112zpfeg]. Fentanyl has also precipitated serotonin syndrome in patients on SSRIs or other serotonergic agents, including during procedural sedation [^114XGqLN] [^113qWLQy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **avoiding combinations** of serotonergic drugs when possible and recommend close monitoring if unavoidable. For PONV prophylaxis, consider non-serotonergic antiemetics (e.g. metoclopramide, droperidol) in patients on multiple serotonergic agents [^115B6Aig] [^1138wJXc].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

- **Age and gender**: Young women may have higher serotonin syndrome risk with serotonergic combinations.
- **Comorbidities**: Depression and migraine are common in serotonin syndrome cases.
- **Medication history**: Chronic sumatriptan and recent fluoxetine increase baseline risk; adding ondansetron and fentanyl compounds it [^112Dp99C].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

If ondansetron and fentanyl are used together, **strict monitoring is essential**:

- **Pre-procedure**: Document baseline vitals, mental status, and neuromuscular exam.
- **Intra-procedure**: Monitor for agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, tremor, rigidity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and autonomic instability.
- **Post-procedure**: Continue observation for several hours; serotonin syndrome can be delayed.
- **Emergency management**: Discontinue offending agents, provide supportive care, and consider benzodiazepines, cyproheptadine, or antipsychotics for severe cases [^111L3b7q].

---

## Alternative antiemetic strategies

Given the risk, **consider non-serotonergic antiemetics**:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine antagonist | - Effective for PONV <br/> - Extrapyramidal effects possible |
| Droperidol | Butyrophenone | - Effective for PONV <br/> - QT prolongation risk; monitor ECG in high-risk patients [^116sJpNJ] |
| Dexamethasone | Glucocorticoid | - Effective for PONV <br/> - Hyperglycemia risk in diabetics |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's serotonergic regimen, **avoid ondansetron with fentanyl** because of the high serotonin syndrome risk. Use a non-serotonergic antiemetic (e.g. metoclopramide or droperidol) and monitor closely if combined serotonergic therapy is unavoidable [^115B6Aig] [^111Jy6wh].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events.

If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.

Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation).

Information for Patients

See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients.

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs.

Laboratory Tests

No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan.

Drug Interactions

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome:

Cases of life‑threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS).

Ergot-Containing Drugs

Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors

MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests.

### Serotonin syndrome [^113SFbxr]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Serotonin syndrome is an under-reported and under-recognised condition that occurs on administration of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors alone, or in combination with other medication known to increase levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine. This case report demonstrates signs and symptoms associated with their overdose and illustrates the importance of recognition of this syndrome to instigate appropriate treatment for the patient.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS).

Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse:

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron tablets alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron tablets and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron tablets and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron tablets is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron tablets in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron tablets are not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride [^111BFkMa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ondansetron hydrochloride IV (also known as Zofran):
- **Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm**: use extreme caution in patients with hypersensitivity to selective 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists.
- **Mask symptoms of ileus, gastric distension**: use caution in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or after abdominal surgery.
- **Myocardial infarction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive HF, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications. Obtain ECG monitoring. Avoid using ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as ondansetron has been associated with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially in patients with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, such as SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, MAOIs, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue.

5. Warnings and Precautions

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 QT Prolongation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2)].

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

Pharmacokinetics

The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmaxof 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmaxfollowing a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmaxis similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the tmaxis slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmaxafter 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose).

A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the Cmaxand AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state.

Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg.

The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan.

In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^113EsUSN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition — supportive and abortive treatment approaches in cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) include intravenous ondansetron 0.3–0.4 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 4–6h (up to 20 mg) with alternatives including granisetron; sedative options are diphenhydramine 1.0–1.25 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6h or lorazepam 0.05–0.1 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6h, and chlorpromazine 0.5–1.0 mg·kg−1·dose−1 every 6h plus diphenhydramine; for analgesia, ketorolac 0.4–1.0 mg·kg−1 intravenously every 6h (max dose 30 mg, max daily 120 mg) with alternatives of intravenous morphine or fentanyl; abortive antimigraine therapy includes sumatriptan 20 mg intranasally at episode onset; symptom-specific measures include epigastric pain control with H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), hypertension with short-acting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, restriction of free water intake for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), and recovery feeding ad libitum when the child declares the episode is over.

### Serotonin syndrome risks when combining SSRI / SNRI drugs and triptans: is the FDA's alert warranted? [^115j6oTK]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

In 2006 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert, based on 27 case reports gathered over a 5-year span, regarding serotonin syndrome resulting from concurrent use of either a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with a triptan. These diagnoses have been subsequently challenged as not meeting validated criteria for serotonin syndrome, in part because the FDA has yet to publicly disseminate important case report data. As a result of the FDA's alert, some clinicians are reluctant or refuse to provide these drugs concomitantly to patients. We believe that withholding these medications due to fears of serotonin syndrome is difficult to justify. In contrast to the small number of case reports, research shows that approximately 700,000 patients annually take SSRIs or SNRIs with triptans and that this drug combination has been effectively used by millions of individuals over the past decade. We encourage healthcare professionals to familiarize themselves with data on serotonin syndrome and to administer SSRIs/SNRIs with triptans when clinically appropriate.

### Droperidol use in the emergency department: a clinical review [^114e9ymx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Droperidol is a butyrophenone, with antiemetic, sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. Although droperidol was once widely used in both emergency and perioperative settings, use of the medication declined rapidly after a 2001 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) boxed warning called the medication's safety into question.

Objective

The purpose of this clinical review was to provide evidence-based answers to questions about droperidol's safety and to examine its efficacy in its various clinical indications.

Discussion

Droperidol is an effective sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antiemetic medication. As a sedative, when compared with haloperidol, droperidol has faster onset, as well as greater efficacy, in patients experiencing acute psychosis, with no increase in adverse events. As an antiemetic, droperidol has been found to have equal or greater efficacy in reducing nausea and vomiting than ondansetron and metoclopramide, with similar adverse effects and the added effect of reducing the need for rescue analgesia in these patients. As an analgesic, droperidol is effective for migraines and has opioid-sparing effects when used to treat abdominal pain. Droperidol is a particularly useful adjunct in patients who are opioid-tolerant, whose pain is often difficulty to manage adequately.

Conclusions

Droperidol seems to be effective and safe, despite the boxed warning issued by the FDA. Droperidol is a powerful antiemetic, sedative, anxiolytic, antimigraine, and adjuvant to opioid analgesia and does not require routine screening with electrocardiography when used in low doses in otherwise healthy patients before administration in the emergency department.

### Serotonin syndrome precipitated by fentanyl during procedural sedation [^114XGqLN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Fentanyl is frequently used for analgesia during emergency procedures. We present the cases of 2 patients who developed agitation and delirium after intravenous fentanyl administration. These patients were chronically taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Both developed neuromuscular examinations consistent with serotonin syndrome, a diagnosis that must be established on the basis of clinical criteria. Although they required aggressive supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, both patients made a full recovery. Use of fentanyl for procedural sedation may precipitate serotonin syndrome in patients taking SSRIs or other serotonergic drugs.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause hypersensitivity reactions, some as severe as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

QT Prolongation

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias such as QT prolongation. Instruct patients to tell their healthcare provider right away if they perceive a change in their heart rate, if they feel lightheaded, or if they have a syncopal episode [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Drug Interactions

Instruct the patient to report the use of all medications, especially apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. Concomitant use of apomorphine and ondansetron may cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.
Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of ondansetron and another serotonergic agent such as medications to treat depression and migraines. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if the following symptoms occur: changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms with or without gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Ondansetron tablets (ondansetron) [^112zpfeg]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron tablets alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron tablets and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron tablets and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron tablets is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Myocardial Ischemia

Myocardial ischemia has been reported in patients treated with ondansetron. In some cases, predominantly during intravenous administration, the symptoms appeared immediately after administration but resolved with prompt treatment. Coronary artery spasm appears to be the most common underlying cause. Therefore, monitor or advise patients for signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia after oral administration of ondansetron tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

Safety and side effects

We find the triptans to be well tolerated overall. The reported incidence of minor adverse effects does not differ markedly between the triptans, but depends on speed of onset of action; people taking subcutaneous sumatriptan report more adverse effects than those taking oral sumatriptan. The triptans with a longer half-life and slower onset of action, such as naratriptan and frovatriptan, have fewer side effects. The adverse effects of the oral triptans are similar, although dizziness and sedation occur more with rizatriptan and zolmitriptan than with sumatriptan and naratriptan.

There are cardiovascular safety concerns associated with triptan use due to the presence of 5HT 1B receptors on vascular smooth muscle. We avoid triptans in people with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease. However, in clinical trials, cardiovascular complications were fewer than one per million exposed, and a recent systematic review of cardiovascular safety data identified no strong cardiovascular safety issues. Triptan sensations such as burning or tingling in the chest or limbs are relatively common (7%), but clinicians can reassure patients that this is not associated with cardiac ischaemia.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified the potential for developing a serotonin syndrome when taking triptans together with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, on further evaluation only 10 of the original 36 cases identified were actually serotonin syndrome and it was concluded that triptan use did not need to be restricted in patients on SSRIs or SNRIs. We use triptans in these patients where indicated but counsel patients to be aware of the features of serotonin syndrome (agitation, nausea, palpitation and sweating). Triptans should not be co-prescribed with ergotamine (within 24 h) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (within 2 weeks).

### The analgesic efficacy of tramadol is impaired by concurrent administration of ondansetron [^113LSyza]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Tramadol has weak opioid properties, and an analgesic effect that is mediated mainly by inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) and facilitation of 5-HT release (1,2) at the spinal cord. Because 5-HT3 receptors play a key role in pain transmission at the spinal level (3), the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron may decrease the efficacy of tramadol, as suggested in an abstract by Maroof et al. In that study, a small dose of 1 mg/kg tramadol was administered along with ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg or placebo, 15 min before the induction of anesthesia. Early postoperative pain scored differed significantly between the test groups. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the tramadol requirement by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) may be increased when ondansetron is administered for antiemetic prophylaxis.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse fetal outcomes?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of cohort studies of 456 963 pregnancies in 3 countries, treatment with ondansetron was not significantly associated with increased risk of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or major congenital malformations compared with other antiemetics.

Meaning

These findings suggest that ondansetron use during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes compared with the use of other antiemetics.

Patient 2

The second patient is a 36 year-old white woman with a 19-year history of migraine without aura. She reported an average of 11 MMDs with pain of moderate to severe intensity. Her treatment history involved subcutaneous sumatriptan, intranasal zolmitriptan, and oral tablets of rizatriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, and almotriptan, all of which were suboptimal (e.g. relief took too long, did not last, was inconsistent). She also had a 6-year history of treatment with an implanted occipital nerve stimulator (ONS). At enrollment, her migraine treatments included oral sumatriptan 100 mg, IM ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg, IM diphenhydramine 100 mg, oral methadone 80 mg, oral ondansetron 8 mg, oral zonisamide 250 mg, and ONS. Before enrollment, she stopped using methadone, a prohibited medication for the trial.

During a 30-day run-in to the long-term safety trial, the patient experienced 22 attacks of moderate to severe pain intensity. On entry into the treatment phase, she received 30 tablets of rimegepant 75 mg and was instructed to take rimegepant 75 mg up to once per calendar day, as needed, for the acute treatment of migraine attacks of any pain intensity. In the first 30 days of treatment, she used 16 doses of rimegepant; in the second 30 days, she used 11 doses of rimegepant and stopped ondansetron, ketorolac, and diphenhydramine. Because of high headache frequency, she was subsequently started on a monthly dose of erenumab 140 mg. Over the first 30 days after starting erenumab, she experienced 9 attacks, all of which were treated successfully with rimegepant. While using rimegepant alone or together with erenumab, she experienced no adverse events.

Serotonin syndrome — mechanisms, precipitating combinations, and clinical presentation are described, noting receptor biology and triggers. Seven families of serotonin receptors have been identified, with serotonin syndrome resulting from excess CNS serotonin, primarily caused by overstimulation of serotonin2A receptors. Excessive serotonin activity may result from increased release, production, inhibited reuptake, decreased metabolism via monoamine oxidase inhibition, direct receptor stimulation, and increased postsynaptic receptor responsivity. A single dose of a single proserotonergic agent may precipitate serotonin syndrome; however, many cases occur after exposure to 2 or more drugs that increase the serotonin activity, with reports involving SSRIs and fentanyl (given during procedural sedation), erythromycin, and St John's wort (an over-the-counter herbal supplement), and cases have also occurred during withdrawal from a serotonergic agent. The clinical triad of the serotonin syndrome consists of mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Serotonergic Drugs

Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs. Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms occur, discontinue ondansetron tablets and initiate supportive treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes

Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron tablets is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Tramadol

Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small trials indicate that when used together, ondansetron tablets may increase patient-controlled administration of tramadol. Monitor patients to ensure adequate pain control when ondansetron is administered with tramadol.

7.4 Chemotherapy

Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase systemic concentrations of high-dose methotrexate.

7.5 Alfentanil and Atracurium

Ondansetron tablets do not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.

### Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^114eRJXv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Rectal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of rectal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using rectally administered sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Three studies (866 participants) compared rectally administered sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses. For the majority of efficacy outcomes, sumatriptan surpassed placebo. For sumatriptan 12.5 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 5.2 and 3.2 for headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 12.5 mg dose, and there were no significant differences between the two doses for any of the outcomes analysed. The NNTs for sumatriptan 25 mg versus placebo were 4.2, 3.2, and 2.4 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at one hour, and headache relief at two hours, respectively. Relief of functional disability was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, with NNTs of 8.0 and 4.0 for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than with placebo, but there were insufficient data to perform any analyses. Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to one study comparing sumatriptan 25 mg with ergotamine tartrate 2 mg + caffeine 100 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited amounts of data, sumatriptan 25 mg, administered rectally, is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks, with participants in these studies experiencing a significant reduction in headache pain and functional disability within two hours of treatment. The lack of data on relief of headache-associated symptoms or incidence of adverse events limits any conclusions that can be drawn.

### Sumatriptan plus naproxen for the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults [^115qdxf5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on 'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan plus naproxen, administered together as separate tablets or taken as a fixed-dose combination tablet, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via The Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO) to 28 October 2015, MEDLINE (via Ovid) from 1946 to 28 October 2015, and EMBASE (via Ovid) from 1974 to 28 October 2015, and two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using sumatriptan plus naproxen to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

For this update we identified one new study (43 participants), but it did not contribute any data for analysis. The review included 13 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity. Twelve studies contributed data for analyses: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. We judged only one small study to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated; it did not contribute to any analyses. Overall, the combination was better than placebo for the primary outcomes of pain-free and headache relief at two hours. The NNT for pain-free at two hours was 3.1 (95% confidence interval 2.9 to 3.5) when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 (4.3 to 5.7) when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (high quality evidence). Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result. Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose. Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than with sumatriptan (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The conclusions of this review were not changed. Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone were not large. More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild. Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

### Granisetron hydrochloride (granisol) [^115x94yo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions].

### Early intervention in migraine with sumatriptan tablets 50 mg versus 100 mg: a pooled analysis of data from six clinical trials [^114KeZvM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical trials evaluating sumatriptan in the treatment of moderate or severe migraine pain, the 50- and 100-mg doses have been comparably effective and well tolerated.

Objective

To assess the dose-efficacy relationship of sumatriptan tablets given early for mild pain, data from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-intervention studies of sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg (5 of which have been published) were pooled for analysis. These constitute all the studies conducted to date of sumatriptan tablets prospectively given early for mild pain.

Methods

The primary efficacy end point in all the studies was the proportion of patients reporting a pain-free result (ie, mild, moderate, or severe pain reduced to none) 2 hours postdose. Other efficacy end points included the proportion of patients who were migraine free (ie, no pain and no associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia) 2 hours postdose; the proportion reporting worsening of pain (ie, moderate or severe pain) 2 hours postdose; and the proportion with a sustained pain-free result (ie, pain free from 2–24 hours postdose with no use of a second dose of study medication or of rescue medication). Tolerability was assessed by evaluating the incidence of individual adverse events. The investigators assessed each adverse event's relationship to study medication.

Results

The number of patients in the intent-to-treat population was 2297 (771 sumatriptan 50 mg, 759 sumatriptan 100 mg, 767 placebo). Patients' mean age ranged from 39.4 to 39.8 years across groups, and most patients were female (90%-92%) and white (89%-90%). A pain-free result 2 hours post dose was reported by significantly more patients who took either dose of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo and by significantly more patients who took the 100-mg dose compared with the 50-mg dose (50 mg, 49%; 100 mg, 58%; placebo, 24%; P < 0.001, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). A similar pattern was observed for migraine-free results 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 42%; 100 mg, 47%; placebo, 20%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), worsening of pain 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 26%; 100 mg, 21%; placebo, 46%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), and sustained pain-free results from 2 through 24 hours postdose (50 mg, 30%; 100 mg, 35%; placebo, 12%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). Both doses of sumatriptan were well tolerated, and no dose-related trends in the incidence of individual drug-related adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

In this analysis of pooled data from 6 clinical trials, sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg administered early in a migraine attack while the pain was mild were well tolerated and significantly more effective than placebo. The 100-mg dose of sumatriptan was significantly more effective than the 50-mg dose.

### Nalbuphine hci [^113wB8HG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see WARNINGS].

Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients].

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

MAOI (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid) interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [see Drug Interactions] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma [see Warnings]).

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115B6Aig]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — Guideline 5 treatment after failed or absent prophylaxis states that when PONV prophylaxis has failed, patients should receive antiemetic treatment from a different pharmacological class, and administering a repeated dose from the same class within 6 hours does not confer additional benefit; if more than 6 hours has elapsed, a second dose of a 5‑HT3 receptor antagonist or butyrophenone may be considered if no other alternatives are available. In patients without PONV prophylaxis, 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron and ramosetron remain first‑line, with recommended rescue regimens including ondansetron at 4 mg administered orally or IV, ramosetron 0.3 mg IV, granisetron 0.1 mg, tropisetron 0.5 mg, and promethazine 6.25 mg IV; in an RCT, ondansetron 4 mg and haloperidol 1 mg had largely comparable responses but haloperidol produced significantly more sedation. Additional options include the NK1 receptor antagonist vestipitant 4–36 mg (noninferior to ondansetron in patients who failed prophylaxis), amisulpride 5–10 mg, and droperidol 0.625 mg IV; propofol 20 mg has been used as rescue in the postanesthesia care unit, but its effect is likely brief and should be used with caution. Patients receiving rescue antiemetics should also be evaluated for reversible causes such as excessive opioids, mechanical bowel obstruction, or blood in the pharynx.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^115tkvp3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Ramosetron — second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV): The most effective adult dose and route of administration for PONV prevention and treatment is 0.3 mg intravenous (IV). For PONV prevention, ramosetron 0.3 mg was more effective than ondansetron 4 mg (evidence A1), and when added to a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid infusion, ramosetron 0.3 mg was more effective than placebo, dexamethasone 10 mg, or palonosetron 0.075 mg. For PONV treatment, ramosetron 0.3 mg has similar effectiveness as ondansetron 4 mg. Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, muscle pain, sedation, constipation, and diarrhea.

Medication abortion — pain management between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks is addressed with the following guidance: The World Health Organization recommends routinely offering pain medication for medication abortion at any gestational duration; for pain management for medication abortion at or ≥ 12 weeks of gestation, they suggest consideration of methods for pain control in addition to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, including antiemetics and epidural anesthesia, where available, and where available, other pain management techniques — including moderate sedation, nitrous oxide, intravenous opiates, or patient-controlled analgesia — should be considered. Post-abortion, patients may experience discomfort and in most cases over-the-counter medications or topical management for vaginal and vulvar swelling should be sufficient to provide pain relief; a multimodal, step-wise approach using a combination of agents with different mechanisms of action is recommended to individualize pain control, and if opioids are required, a short course of low-dose opioids can be considered; however, severe pain following medication abortion is unusual and should prompt an evaluation for potential complications.

Drug Interactions

Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see WARNINGS].

Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients].

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids… [^115UsGuX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations.

This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. Opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain; however, they carry considerable potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long-term benefits of prescription opioid treatment for chronic pain, and long-term prescription opioid use was found to be associated with increased risk for overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks. In 2016, these warnings were added to the labels for immediate-release opioids. In addition to the potential risks to patients, prescribed opioids have the potential for diversion and nonmedical use among persons to whom they were not prescribed, and many insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies have enacted similar policies.

At least 17 states have passed laws requiring or recommending the coprescription of naloxone in the presence of overdose risk factors, such as high dosages of opioids or concomitant opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines. These actions are not consistent with the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline and have contributed to patient harm, including untreated and undertreated pain, serious withdrawal symptoms, worsening pain outcomes, psychological distress, overdose, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Rationale Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation (.

### Sumatriptan (all routes of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults-overview of cochrane reviews [^113jf5g6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. It is available for administration by four different routes: oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal.

Objectives

To summarise evidence from four Cochrane intervention reviews on the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults by four routes of administration (oral, subcutaneous, intranasal, and rectal) compared with both placebo and active comparators.

Methods

The included reviews were written by the authors of this overview; no additional searching was carried out. All included reviews were conducted according to a standard protocol and reported a standard set of outcomes. From each individual review we extracted results for pain relief at different levels, and adverse events. No additional statistical comparison was undertaken as part of the overview. We focused on the most important findings for doses and routes licensed in North America or Europe (oral 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; subcutaneous 4 mg, 6 mg; intranasal 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg; rectal 25 mg).

Main Results

Included reviews provided data for 18 different dose and route of administration combinations in 52,236 participants. Data for the primary outcomes sought were generally well reported, and involved adequate numbers of participants to give confidence in the results, except for the rectal route of administration, where numbers were low. Subcutaneous administration was the most effective, with pain reduced from moderate or severe to none by two hours in almost 6 in 10 people (59%) taking 6 mg sumatriptan, compared with approximately 1 in 7 (15%) taking placebo; the number needed to treat (NNT) was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 2.4) with 2522 participants in the analysis. The most commonly used doses of oral, rectal, and intranasal sumatriptan also provided clinically useful pain relief, with the oral 50 mg dose providing complete relief of pain in almost 3 in 10 people (28%) compared with about 1 in 10 (11%) after placebo (NNT 6.1 (5.5 to 6.9) in 6447 participants). Subcutaneous administration provided more rapid pain relief than the other routes. Taking medication early, when pain was mild, was more effective than waiting until the pain was moderate or severe. The most effective dose of sumatriptan for each route of administration for the outcome of headache relief (pain reduced from moderate or severe to none or mild) at two hours was oral 100 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.2 to 3.7) in 7811 participants), subcutaneous 6 mg (NNT 2.1 (2.0 to 2.2) in 2738 participants), intranasal 20 mg (NNT 3.5 (3.1 to 4.1) in 2020 participants), and rectal 25 mg (NNT 2.4 (1.9 to 3.4) in 240 participants). Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate severity, of short duration, and more common with subcutaneously administered sumatriptan and higher doses of oral and intranasal sumatriptan than with other dose and route combinations.

Authors' Conclusions

Sumatriptan is an effective abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, but is associated with increased adverse events relative to placebo. The route of administration influences efficacy, particularly within the first hour after administration. Subcutaneous sumatriptan shows the greatest efficacy in terms of pain relief, but at the expense of relatively high levels of adverse events, and with a high financial cost compared with other routes. Information about the relative efficacy of the different routes of administration for different outcomes should help to inform decisions about the suitability of sumatriptan as a migraine treatment, as well as about the most appropriate way to administer the treatment for individual patients.

### The safety of triptans in the treatment of patients with migraine [^112vgDXz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The introduction of the triptans (5-hydroxytryptophan [5-HT] (1B/1D) agonists) in the past decade has brought migraine-specific pain relief to those suffering from migraine. These drugs activate the serotonin receptors 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) on cerebral vessels. Concerns about their safety, particularly in patients with vascular risk factors, have been raised because triptans also activate the 5-HT(1B) receptors on coronary arteries. Although triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, they are safer than many other medications used to treat patients with migraine, including the nonspecific serotonin-agonist ergot preparations.

### Sumatriptan (subcutaneous route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^111Bw523]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Subcutaneous administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using subcutaneous sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies (9365 participants) compared subcutaneous sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 6 mg dose. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 6 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 2.9, 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1 for pain-free at one and two hours, and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively, and 6.1 for sustained pain-free at 24 hours. Results for the 4 mg and 8 mg doses were similar to the 6 mg dose, with 6 mg significantly better than 4 mg only for pain-free at one hour, and 8 mg significantly better than 6 mg only for headache relief at one hour. There was no evidence of increased migraine relief if a second dose of sumatriptan 6 mg was given after an inadequate response to the first. Relief of headache-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than placebo. Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide, and dihydroergotamine, but there were insufficient data for any pooled analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Subcutaneous sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, quickly relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

The serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening adverse drug reaction resulting from excess serotonergic agonism due to interactions between multiple drugs, poisoning, or less commonly due to therapeutic action of a single drug. The central triad of features in serotonin syndrome are altered mental state, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities in the context of a patient with new/altered serotonergic therapy, although not all these features are consistently present in all patients. The severity of serotonin syndrome can be assessed clinically based on the number and severity of features. Severe serotonin syndrome warrants more careful management on a high-dependency unit. In case of temperature exceeding 38.5°C, urgent cooling measures and sedation should be employed, progressing to rapid sequence intubation and paralysis if cooling measures are ineffective.

### Granisetron hydrochloride (granisetron) [^116BzxHK]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.4 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of granisetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue granisetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if granisetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

3 MNK-812 Background
- Oxycodone immediate release with abuse- deterrence for the intranasal and intravenous routes – Indication: Pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate – Doses: 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg
- Efficacy and safety established by demonstration of bioequivalence to Roxicodone – Therefore, efficacy and safety studies were not conducted or required www. fda. gov. recovered with manual manipulation and extraction and syringed in 10–15 minutes www. fda. gov. product via intravenous route of administration.
- The existing data, although limited, suggest that intravenous injection of extracts of MNK-812 did not result in clear evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy, unlike the published nonclinical study that tested excipients present in the reformulated Opana ER.
- However, there are limitations to existing data.

- FDA cannot rule out the possibility that adverse effects could occur with more frequent and/or prolonged administration of manipulated MNK-812 for IV use. www. fda. gov. 26 Postmarketing Experience with Opana ER Reformulation Unanticipated outcomes with the introduction of an abuse- deterrent opioid formulation to the market:

- Adverse events resulting from manipulation of the formulation for use by the unintended IV route of administration – Anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy. acute kidney injury, retinal damage, cardiac involvement
- Data also support a shift from intranasal route of abuse to the more dangerous intravenous route of abuse – Increase in outbreaks of HIV and Hepatitis C in drug users who were sharing manipulated reformulated Opana ER www. fda. gov. with syringeable material from two different Category 1 conditions and sacrificed on Day 4.

– IV administrations resulted in oxycodone-related clinical signs – 50% increase in spleen weight on treatment – Increased incidence of minimal mixed cell infiltrates eye, minimal to slight mixed cell infiltrates lung, spleen congestion – No clear evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy or acute kidney injury under the conditions tested www. fda. gov. 34 Key Points
- Other FDA-approved opioids also contain PEO – To date, these products do not appear to carry same risk for TMA as reformulated Opana ER
- Three published reports of TMA with IV OxyContin from overseas. 35 Overall Assessment
- In terms of TMA risk, the risk of the PEO in various AD-opioid drug products cannot be simply extrapolated across the class based on reformulated Opana ER.
- Injecting any manipulated oral drug can result in significant toxicity.

- FDA cannot rule out the possibility that adverse effects could occur with more frequent and/or prolonged administration of manipulated MNK-812 for IV use. However, if the PEO in this product is able to be extracted into an IV syringe and injected, we would expect similar results at noted with reformulated Opana ER.
- This product, if approved, would likely have similar warnings in labeling regarding risk of IV injection of manipulated drug products as other opioids. www. fda. gov. deterrent claim.
- Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double dummy, 4-period crossover study utilizing 38 recreational opioid users.
- This presentation will briefly examine the evidence for MNK-812 tablets having a potential intranasal abuse-deterrent effect via an aversive mechanism
