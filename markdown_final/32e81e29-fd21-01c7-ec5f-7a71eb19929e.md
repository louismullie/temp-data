## Question

Rapid shallow breathing index

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), including its definition, historical threshold, measurement conditions, diagnostic performance, limitations, guideline positions, and practical application with alternatives and a bottom-line recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the classic threshold. Then, I should verify the optimal measurement conditions and how ventilator support alters RSBI. Next, I will appraise diagnostic performance and why it performs as it does. After that, I need to check contemporary guideline positions and whether RSBI is still required. Then, I will examine practical application, including ventilator-displayed RSBI and the role of change-in-RSBI during SBTs. Finally, I will consider alternatives like diaphragmatic ultrasound and composite indices, and close with a concise, clinically actionable bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the basics: RSBI is the ratio of respiratory rate to tidal volume (RR/VT) measured during spontaneous breathing, typically over about 1 minute, and the traditional threshold for predicting extubation success is ≤ 105 breaths/min/L, which traces back to Yang and Tobin's original work and remains the conventional cut point in many protocols [^116dejsP].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement conditions because this is where misinterpretation often occurs: RSBI should be measured during unassisted breathing to reflect post-extubation physiology. Pressure support or CPAP lowers RSBI by reducing effort, which can falsely suggest readiness, whereas T-piece or zero-PEEP CPAP better approximates extubation conditions and yields higher, more discriminative RSBI values [^112UCqf2] [^1133ygPy] [^114QAbKo].

> I should double-check the diagnostic performance before drawing conclusions: pooled data show moderate sensitivity around 0.83 and poor specificity around 0.58 for RSBI < 105, with a diagnostic odds ratio near 6, indicating that a low RSBI modestly increases the likelihood of successful extubation but a high RSBI is not sufficiently specific to rule in failure; this performance is consistent across subgroups and explains why RSBI should not be used in isolation [^114nqeBh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning RSBI entirely; I need to check guideline positions: the 2024 AARC clinical practice guideline concludes that calculation of RSBI is not needed to determine readiness for an SBT, recommending a simple screen for reversal of the cause of respiratory failure, adequate oxygenation, hemodynamic stability, and ability to initiate inspiratory effort, with SBTs conducted with or without pressure support and standardized morning assessments when feasible [^114WNP7s] [^112C3vba] [^1141VBjr].

> Let me consider practical measurement nuances, because bedside technique matters: ventilator-displayed RSBI is convenient but consistently overestimates values compared with Wright spirometer, and accuracy improves when averaging multiple ventilator readings over 0–60 seconds. Still, even averaged ventilator RSBI remains higher than spirometry, so clinicians should interpret ventilator RSBI with caution and, when possible, align measurement conditions with unassisted breathing [^113jdeey] [^111tfE7i] [^117E1PGJ].

> Next, I should review dynamic use of RSBI during SBTs, because a single static value may miss evolving distress: changes in RSBI during a 2-hour T-piece trial, particularly a rise greater than about 20% from baseline, predict extubation failure better than the initial value alone, and similar principles apply to shorter windows, reinforcing the value of trend assessment rather than a single snapshot [^113GWnyq].

> But wait, what if diaphragmatic dysfunction is the driver of failure; I need to check whether ultrasound-modified RSBI helps: substituting tidal volume with diaphragmatic excursion (DE-RSBI, RR/DE) or thickening fraction (DTF-RSBI, RR/DTF) yields significantly better discrimination than traditional RSBI, with AUROCs often in the 0.81–0.89 range, and DTF around 30% is a commonly cited threshold associated with successful weaning, though operator training and standardization are essential for reproducibility [^116gacYh] [^116T7Jf7] [^113PHjgW].

> I will now examine composite indices and other physiologic markers, because no single parameter is perfect: integrative indices like CORE and IWI, and markers such as the percent change in RSBI, airway occlusion pressure (P0.1), and even heart-rate variability models, have shown promising discrimination in selected cohorts, but they require additional measurements and validation; nonetheless, they illustrate that combining load, strength, gas exchange, and cardiorespiratory response improves prediction beyond RSBI alone [^111oL89a] [^112W6uUt] [^1148CDrt] [^115ZoC9X].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure it aligns with evidence and guidelines: RSBI remains a simple, widely available tool with moderate sensitivity and poor specificity. It can be used as a permissive gatekeeper in intermediate-risk patients or as a trend monitor during SBTs, but it should not be the sole determinant of extubation readiness, and clinicians should prioritize guideline-based readiness screening, diaphragmatic ultrasound when available, and careful SBT monitoring to balance the risks of premature extubation against prolonged ventilation [^114nqeBh] [^114WNP7s] [^116dejsP].

---

The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is a **simple, bedside measure** of respiratory pattern (respiratory rate divided by tidal volume) used to predict weaning success from mechanical ventilation. A value **≤ 105 breaths/min/L** is commonly used to indicate readiness for a spontaneous breathing trial, but the test has moderate sensitivity and poor specificity, so it should not be used alone [^114nqeBh]. RSBI is best interpreted alongside clinical assessment and other parameters, and its accuracy can be improved by using standardized measurement conditions (e.g. T-piece or CPAP without pressure support) [^112UCqf2] and by trending values during the trial [^113GWnyq]. Alternative indices such as diaphragmatic ultrasound or integrative scores may outperform RSBI in select patients, but RSBI remains widely used due to its simplicity and availability [^113SfP74] [^112W6uUt].

---

## Definition and calculation

RSBI is calculated as the **ratio of respiratory rate (RR) to tidal volume (VT)** during spontaneous breathing, typically over 1 minute:

- **Formula**: RSBI = RR (breaths/min) / VT (L)
- **Units**: breaths per minute per liter (breaths/min/L)
- **Standard threshold**: ≤ 105 breaths/min/L suggests readiness for weaning [^111fadLK]

---

## Clinical significance

RSBI reflects the balance between respiratory drive and load; higher values indicate rapid, shallow breathing that may signal **respiratory muscle fatigue or increased work of breathing** [^111kMDRL]. It is most often used to predict the likelihood of successful extubation after a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [^111fadLK].

---

## Evidence supporting RSBI

The original study by Yang and Tobin found that an RSBI ≤ 105 breaths/min/L predicted extubation success with **sensitivity 97% and specificity 64%** [^114zCXaD]. Subsequent meta-analyses confirm moderate sensitivity (~83%) and poor specificity (~58%), indicating RSBI is better at ruling out readiness than confirming it [^114nqeBh].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Specificity**: Poor specificity leads to false positives; patients with RSBI ≤ 105 may still fail extubation [^114nqeBh].
- **Measurement conditions**: Pressure support, CPAP, or different ventilator modes can alter RSBI values, reducing reliability [^112UCqf2] [^1133ygPy].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, COPD, and anxiety can affect RSBI independently of weaning readiness [^notfound].
- **Single measurement**: Static RSBI may miss dynamic changes during SBT; trending RSBI during the trial improves predictive value [^113GWnyq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines suggest RSBI should not be used alone to decide readiness for SBT; instead, it should be integrated with **clinical assessment and other parameters** (e.g. oxygenation, hemodynamics, cough strength) [^114WNP7s]. Standardized measurement conditions (e.g. T-piece or CPAP without pressure support) are recommended to improve consistency [^112UCqf2].

---

## Alternative and complementary indices

- **Diaphragmatic ultrasound**: DE-RSBI (RR/diaphragmatic excursion) and DTF-RSBI (RR/thickening fraction) outperform traditional RSBI in some studies [^116gacYh] [^116T7Jf7].
- **Integrative indices**: CORE and IWI combine multiple parameters and may improve prediction accuracy [^111oL89a] [^112W6uUt].
- **Neural drive markers**: EAdi and neuro-ventilatory efficiency are promising but require specialized equipment [^112X6MgF] [^1124g6vW].

---

## Practical clinical application

- **Measurement**: Obtain RSBI after a short period of unassisted breathing (T-piece or CPAP 0–5 cm H2O) without pressure support [^112UCqf2].
- **Interpretation**: Use RSBI ≤ 105 as a permissive, not absolute, threshold; integrate with clinical judgment and other parameters [^111fadLK].
- **Trending**: Monitor RSBI during the SBT; a rising RSBI (> 20% from baseline) predicts failure even if initial values are low [^113GWnyq].

---

## Conclusion

RSBI is a **useful, widely available tool** for predicting weaning success, but its moderate sensitivity and poor specificity limit standalone use. Best practice is to integrate RSBI with clinical assessment, standardize measurement conditions, and consider alternative indices when appropriate.

### The usefulness of the rapid shallow breathing index in predicting successful extubation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nqeBh]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians use several measures to ascertain whether individual patients will tolerate liberation from mechanical ventilation, including the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI).

Research Question

Given varied use of different thresholds, patient populations, and measurement characteristics, how well does RSBI predict successful extubation?

Study Design and Methods

We searched six databases from inception through September 2019 and selected studies reporting the accuracy of RSBI in the prediction of successful extubation. We extracted study data and assessed quality independently and in duplicate.

Results

We included 48 studies involving RSBI measurements of 10,946 patients. Pooled sensitivity for RSBI of < 105 in predicting extubation success was moderate (0.83 [95% CI, 0.78–0.87], moderate certainty), whereas specificity was poor (0.58 [95% CI, 0.49–0.66], moderate certainty) with diagnostic ORs (DORs) of 5.91 (95% CI, 4.09–8.52). RSBI thresholds of < 80 or 80 to 105 yielded similar sensitivity, specificity, and DOR. These findings were consistent across multiple subgroup analyses reflecting different patient characteristics and operational differences in RSBI measurement.

Interpretation

As a stand-alone test, the RSBI has moderate sensitivity and poor specificity for predicting extubation success. Future research should evaluate its role as a permissive criterion to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for patients who are at intermediate pretest probability of passing an SBT.

### The rapid shallow breathing index as a predictor of failure of noninvasive ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure [^111VVbbF]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may reduce the need for intubation in acute respiratory failure (ARF). However, there is no standard method to predict success or failure with NIV. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is a validated tool for predicting readiness for extubation. We evaluated the ability of the RSBI to predict failure of NIV and mortality in ARF.

Methods

Prospective, observational trial of patients with ARF treated with NIV. NIV was initiated at the discretion of the clinicians, and an RSBI was recorded on the initial level of support (designated as assisted RSBI [aRSBI]). Patients were categorized by initial aRSBI value as either high (aRSBI > 105) or low (aRSBI ≤ 105). The primary end point was need for intubation, and the secondary end point was in-hospital mortality. Patients in the low and high aRSBI groups were compared using univariate analysis, followed by multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between aRSBI groups and outcome.

Results

A total of 101 patients were included. The majority of patients had an inspiratory pressure of 5–10 cm H(2)O in addition to an expiratory pressure of 5–8 cm H(2)O. Of 83 patients with an aRSBI ≤ 105, 26 (31%) required intubation, compared to 10/18 (55%) with an aRSBI > 105 (multivariate odds ratio 3.70, 95% CI 1.14–11.99, P = 0.03). When comparing mortality, 7/83 patients (8.4%) with an aRSBI ≤ 105 died, compared to 6/18 (33%) patients in the group with an aRSBI > 105 (multivariate odds ratio 4.51, 95% CI 1.19–17.11, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

An aRSBI of > 105 is associated with need for intubation and increased in-hospital mortality. Whether patients with an elevated aRSBI could also have benefitted from an increase in NIV settings remains unclear. Validation of this concept in a larger patient population is warranted.

### Variation in the rapid shallow breathing index associated with common measurement techniques and conditions [^117H9Nwn]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The rapid-shallow-breathing index (RSBI) is widely used to evaluate mechanically ventilated patients for weaning and extubation, but it is determined in different clinical centers in a variety of ways, under conditions that are not always comparable. We hypothesized that the value of RSBI may be significantly influenced by common variations in measurement conditions and technique.

Methods

Sixty patients eligible for a weaning evaluation after ≥ 72 hours of mechanical ventilation were studied over 15 months in a medical intensive care unit. RSBI was measured while the patients were on 2 different levels of ventilator support: 5 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus T-piece. RSBI was also calculated in 2 different ways: using the values of minute ventilation and respiratory rate provided by the digital output of the ventilator, versus values obtained manually with a Wright spirometer. Finally, RSBI was measured at 2 different times of the day.

Results

RSBI was significantly less when measured on 5 cm H2O CPAP, compared to T-piece: the medians and interquartile ranges were 71 (52–88) breaths/min/L versus 90 (59–137) breaths/min/L, respectively (P < .001). There were no significant differences in the value of RSBI obtained using ventilator-derived versus manual measures of the breathing pattern. RSBI was also not significantly different in the morning versus evening measurements.

Conclusions

RSBI can be significantly affected by the level of ventilator support, but is relatively unaffected by both the technique used to determine the breathing pattern and the time of day at which it is measured.

### Determining the best threshold of rapid shallow breathing index in a therapist-implemented patient-specific weaning protocol [^116JSjzn]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For weaning patients from prolonged mechanical ventilation, we previously designed a respiratory-therapist-implemented weaning protocol that decreased median weaning time from 29 days to 17 days. An acceleration step at the start of the protocol allowed patients with a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) of ≤ 80 to advance directly to spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs).

Methods

We prospectively evaluated whether calibrating the RSBI threshold allowed more patients to safely accelerate to the 1-hour SBT in the protocol, and whether that correlated with weaning duration and outcome. If the patient passed the clinical stability screening, the respiratory therapist calculated the RSBI and then attempted a 1-hour SBT. If the pre-SBT RSBI was > 80, the SBT was attended by an investigator, with continuous electrocardiography and pulse oximetry. This SBT was followed by continued weaning efforts, as dictated by the weaning protocol. The data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves and univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

One hundred ninety-one patients (with a wide range of RSBIs [10 to 1,248]) underwent 1-hour SBT, of whom 26 failed weaning and 165 succeeded. RSBI correlated with 1-hour SBT outcome; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.844. Plotting the sensitivity and specificity together against RSBI allowed calibration of the RSBI threshold to the desired level of false positives and false negatives. Accuracy was maximized (81.7%) at an RSBI of 97. Tolerance of a 1-hour SBT, using the new RSBI threshold, correlated with duration of weaning and weaning outcome.

Conclusions

The conservative RSBI threshold of ≤ 80 can be raised for patients weaned with our respiratory-therapist-implemented weaning protocol. The optimal RSBI threshold was 97, where accuracy was maximal. RSBI was a good predictor of 1-hour SBT tolerance in this cohort of tracheotomized patients weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation.

### Validation of rapid shallow breathing index displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique in patients with readiness for weaning [^113vgY2i]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure; however, prolonged mechanical ventilation significantly increases healthcare utilization and cost, and is associated with poor outcomes. Many studies reported that delayed discontinuation of mechanical ventilation increased the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, diaphragm myotrauma, and other complications. Moreover, patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation have increased intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and hospital mortality.

Liberation or weaning from mechanical ventilation is an important process that can account for 40–60% of the total duration of mechanical ventilation, and determination of the appropriate time to initiate weaning can be a challenge. Assessment of readiness to wean is an important step before performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and patient readiness should be evaluated as soon as possible after the patient recovers from acute respiratory failure. Several parameters have been proposed for predicting the weaning outcome. Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), defined as the ratio of breathing frequency to average tidal volume in 1 min (breaths/min/L), has been shown to be one of the most accurate predictors of weaning outcome. A cut-off value greater than 105 breaths/min/L has been used to predict weaning trial failure. RSBI measurement using a Wright spirometer is a gold standard method; however, it requires a special instrument that might not be available at the bedside.

Many modern ICU ventilators measure and display the RSBI value; however, the value displayed on the ventilator may vary breath by breath according to the algorithm used for calculating the RSBI. In addition, ventilator settings, such as pressure augmentation, positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and a bias flow may also affect ventilator measurement of the RSBI. Data specific to the accuracy and reliability of the RSBI value displayed by the ventilator (RSBI vent) compared with standard measurement of RSBI using a Wright spirometer (RSBI standard) are limited. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the average value of RSBI vent at different time points and RSBI standard, and to assess the accuracy and reliability of these two RSBI measurement techniques. We hypothesized that using the average value of RSBI vent among different time points would increase the evaluated performance parameters compared to RSBI standard.

### Validation of rapid shallow breathing index displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique in patients with readiness for weaning [^113jdeey]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the most commonly used parameter for predicting weaning outcome. Measurement of RSBI by Wright spirometer (RSBI standard) is the standard method in routine clinical practice. Data specific to the accuracy and reliability of the RSBI value displayed by the ventilator (RSBI vent) are scarce. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the association between the average value of RSBI vent at different time points and RSBI standard, and to assess the accuracy and reliability of these two RSBI measurement techniques.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included mechanically ventilated patients who were ready to wean. At the beginning of spontaneous breathing trial using the flow-by method, RSBI was measured by two different techniques at the same time, including: (1) Wright spirometer (breathing frequency/average tidal volume in 1 min) (RSBI standard), and (2) the values displayed on the ventilator at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s (RSBI vent).

Results

Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The RSBI vent value was significantly higher than the RSBI standard value for every comparison. According to Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the average value of RSBI from 5 time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s) showed the best correlation with the standard technique (r = 0.76 [P < 0.001], and ICC = 0.79 [95% CI 0.61–0.88], respectively). Bland-Altman plot also showed the best agreement between RSBI standard and the RSBI vent value averaged among 5 time points (mean difference - 17.1 breaths/min/L).

Conclusions

We found that the ventilator significantly overestimates the RSBI value compared to the standard technique by Wright spirometer. The average RSBI vent value among 5 time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s) was found to best correlate with RSBI standard.

### Validation of rapid shallow breathing index displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique in patients with readiness for weaning [^111TpQ8o]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite our finding that the RSBI value measured and displayed by the ventilator was consistently significantly higher than the RSBI value measured by the standard technique by Wright spirometer, we also found that adding more values of RSBI at different time points improved the accuracy of RSBI displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique. The measurement of RSBI from the two techniques in our study was performed simultaneously with same ventilator settings by the same examiner. These factors should improve the reliability and accuracy of our results compared to previous studies that made non-simultaneous comparisons and used different ventilator settings. Using the RSBI value measured and displayed by the ventilator is more convenient than the standard technique because it does not require a special instrument, and it can be performed without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator; however, using only a single ventilator-generated RSBI value may lead to an insufficiently accurate prediction of weaning outcome. We found that using the average of 5 ventilator-generated RSBI values during 0–60 s (0, 0–15, 0–30, 0–45, and 0–60 s) improves the correlation between RSBI vent and gold standard RSBI standard. In addition, continuous monitoring (longer than 1 min) of RSBI using the value displayed by the ventilator may be more appropriate than using Wright spirometer in patient who is at risk for SBT failure (i.e. RSBI value between 90 and 110 breaths/min/L) because disconnecting the patient from the ventilator is needed.

Strength and limitations

The strength of this study is that this is the first study to compare these two RSBI measurement techniques simultaneously in patients deemed ready to wean from ventilatory support. However, our study has some mentionable limitations. First, this is a single center study. Second, only one brand of ventilator was used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of RSBI vent compared to the standard technique, so our findings may not be generalizable to other ventilator brands. Third, all measurements were done by the same examiner then the lack of interobserver comparison would limit the translatability into clinical practice. Last, we used a flow-by method during the measurement of RSBI. Using this method, the ventilator may deliver a small amount of pressure support, which means that the RSBI value might be lower than unassisted breathing.

Conclusions

We found that the ventilator significantly overestimates the RSBI value compared to the standard technique by Wright spirometer. The average RSBI vent value among 5 time points (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 s) was found to best correlate with RSBI standard.

### Validation of rapid shallow breathing index displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique in patients with readiness for weaning [^117E1PGJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study showed that the ventilator significantly overestimated the RSBI value compared to the standard technique of RSBI measurement by Wright spirometer. However, using the average value of RSBI vent from multiple different time points improved the accuracy of the RSBI vent measurement. The average RSBI vent value among 5 RSBI values (0, 0–15, 0–30, 0–45, and 0–60 s) measured during 0–60 s demonstrated the best correlation and agreement with RSBI standard.

Weaning from mechanical ventilation is an important process in critically ill patients after they recover from acute respiratory failure. Assessment of readiness to wean is the first step, and several parameters have been used to assess pulmonary function and to predict weaning outcome, such as breathing frequency, minute ventilation, maximum inspiratory pressure, and RSBI. RSBI, which is the ratio of breathing frequency divided by average tidal volume in one minute, is the most commonly used parameter in routine clinical practice, and a cut-off value below 105 breaths/min/L can predict the likelihood of weaning success.

Measurement of RSBI by Wright spirometer is a gold standard technique; however, it requires a special instrument that might not be available at the bedside. In addition, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator for a few minutes is required, and this may be harmful due to loss of PEEP effect and risk of contamination of the breathing tube and circuit. Measurement of RSBI using the value displayed by the ventilator during unassisted breathing such as flow-by method may be used to avoid the limitations of measuring RSBI by Wright spirometer. Furthermore, recent weaning guideline recommends using low pressure augmentation instead of T-piece or continuous positive airway pressure mode during SBT then continuing pressure delivery with low pressure augmentation SBT after evaluating RSBI using the ventilator display would be preferred because disconnecting the patient from the ventilator is unnecessary.

### Rapid shallow breathing index as a predictor for intubation and mortality in acute respiratory failure [^111px6kF]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is one of the most important therapeutic tools in patients with acute respiratory failure. However, in case of incorrect patient selection it can delay necessary intubation and is associated with complications and even mortality. Patient selection, therefore, plays a key role in therapeutic success. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) in predicting the failure of NIV.

Methods

This prospective observational study was conducted in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hospital. Adults presenting to the ED with acute respiratory failure were included in the study. The success of RSBI values measured initially (RSBI 1) and at 30 min (RSBI 2) and the difference between these 2 values (Δ RSBI) in predicting subjects' intubation requirement and survival was tested using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

Two hundred sixty-seven subjects were included in the study. RSBI 1, RSBI 2, and Δ RSBI values differed significantly between the intubated and non-intubated subjects. According to the multivariate model, RSBI 1 and RSBI 2 > 105, Δ RSBI < 19, heart rate > 100 beats/min, and S pO2 < 92% were significantly associated with intubation requirement. RSBI 1, RSBI 2, and Δ RSBI values also differed significantly between subjects with a fatal course and surviving individuals. According to the multivariate model, RSBI 2 > 105, Δ RSBI < 19, heart rate > 100, and increasing age were associated with in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

RSBI can be a successful marker in predicting the failure of NIV and predicting in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the ED with acute respiratory failure.

### Diaphragmatic ultrasonography-based rapid shallow breathing index for predicting weaning outcome during a pressure support ventilation spontaneous breathing trial [^112mstxs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation (MV) is used to sustain respiratory function in patients with acute respiratory failure. When the cause of acute respiratory failure improves, MV should be discontinued as soon as possible. Both early and delayed weaning are associated with increased mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and economic cost. Therefore, determining the optimum time to wean mechanically ventilated patients is of paramount importance to improve these patients' outcomes in the ICU. Nevertheless, deciding when to wean patients from MV can be challenging for intensivists.

Currently, many indices and parameters have been developed to assess a patient's ability to breathe spontaneously. Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), which is calculated by dividing respiratory rate (RR) by tidal volume (VT), is the most commonly measured index to predict weaning outcome. During a weaning attempt, RSBI measures the balance between the mechanical load on the inspiratory muscles and the inspiratory muscles' ability to respond to this load. Nonetheless, its low specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) can still lead to errors in weaning assessment.

The diaphragm is the principal respiratory muscle and plays a crucial role in generating VT in healthy subjects. From previous studies, diaphragmatic dysfunction (DD) is a common occurrence and has likely been underestimated in critically ill patients. Thus, evaluating diaphragmatic function before any weaning attempt seems essential. Diaphragmatic ultrasonography has been recently proposed as a simple, non-invasive bedside method to assess the functional status of the diaphragm. There are two proposed diaphragmatic ultrasonography predictors: diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF). Interestingly, in a prospective observational study, Spadaro et al. substituted VT with DE in the RSBI, calculating a new parameter, the diaphragmatic-RSBI (D-RSBI, RR/DE), and compared the ability of traditional RSBI and D-RSBI to predict weaning failure during a T-piece spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The results demonstrated that D-RSBI was more accurate than traditional RSBI in predicting the weaning outcome. However, according to our experience, DE is affected by many factors, from the patient's breathing status to the weaning mode, as well as intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressures. DTF is influenced by active contraction, and DTF performs better than DE when evaluating the diaphragmatic function.

### Evolution of pattern of breathing during a spontaneous breathing trial predicts successful extubation [^113GWnyq]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rapid shallow breathing may occur at any time during spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), questioning the utility of a single determination of the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). We hypothesize that change in RSBI during SBT may more accurately predict successful extubation than a single determination.

Methods

Prospective observational study. Seventy-two subjects were extubated. At 24 h, 63/72 remained extubated (Extubation Success), and 9 were re-intubated (Extubation Failure). Respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT) and RSBI were measured every 30 min during 2-h T-piece SBT. Change in respiratory parameters was assessed as percent change from baseline.

Results

Initial RSBI was similar in Extubation Success and Extubation Failure groups (77.0 ± 4.8, 77.0 ± 4.8, p = ns). Nevertheless, RSBI tended to remain unchanged or decreased in the Extubation Success group; in contrast RSBI tended to increase in the Extubation Failure group because of either increased RR and/or decreased VT (p < 0.001 for mean percent change RSBI over time), indicating worsening of the respiratory pattern. Quantitatively, only 7/63 subjects of the Extubation Success group demonstrated increased RSBI ≥ 20% at any time during the SBT. In contrast, in the Extubation Failure group, RSBI increased in all subjects during the SBT, and eight of nine subjects demonstrated an increase greater than 20%. Thus, with a 2-h SBT the optimal threshold was a 20% increase (sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 89%). Similar results were obtained at 30 min (threshold = 5% increase). Percent change of RSBI predicted successful extubation even when initial values were ≥ 105.

Conclusion

Percent change of RSBI during an SBT is a better predictor of successful extubation than a single determination of RSBI.

### Validation of rapid shallow breathing index displayed by the ventilator compared to the standard technique in patients with readiness for weaning [^112MWTVR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Forty-seven mechanically ventilated subjects were enrolled. The median [interquartile range] age of subjects was 68.0 [60.0–75.0] years, 57.4% of them were female, and APACHE II score was 18.0 [17.0–20.0]. Pneumonia was the leading cause of hospital admission (44.7%) followed by congestive heart failure (19.1%) and extrapulmonary sepsis (17.0%). Other baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^111fadLK]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — PICO 1 (rapid shallow breathing index [RSBI] to predict SBT success) describes that RSBI calculates the ratio of breathing frequency to tidal volume during a short (< 5 min) period without mechanical ventilatory support, and a cutoff of ≤ 105 was reported to more accurately predict liberation success than other indices. Background findings note lower probability of successful extubation when f > 38 breaths/min and RSBI > 100 breaths/min/L, and that 51% of critical care physicians in 2018 reported not using RSBI. In a randomized trial with subjects (n = 304), one group required RSBI < 105 breaths/min/L before SBT and including RSBI prolonged time on the ventilator by, on average, an additional day. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 48 studies including 10,946 subjects reported that an RSBI of < 105 has moderate sensitivity (0.83 [95% CI 0.78–0.87], moderate certainty) and poor specificity (0.58 [95% CI 0.49–0.66]) for predicting extubation success; an RSBI < 80 had a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75–0.90, low certainty) and a specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.53–0.70, low certainty). The analyses displayed significant heterogeneity, subgroup analyses found no significant effects of measurement technique or timing relative to SBT, and the authors concluded that as a stand‑alone test RSBI has moderate sensitivity and poor specificity for predicting extubation success.

### Propofol infusion is associated with a higher rapid shallow breathing index in patients preparing to wean from mechanical ventilation [^1111j4q6]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether propofol affects spontaneous breathing patterns in critically ill patients recovering from respiratory failure during initial attempts at liberation from mechanical ventilation.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Patients

Ten critically ill patients in the medical intensive care unit of a 300-bed community teaching hospital.

Measurements

Demographic and physiologic variables, including respiratory frequency and minute volume, were recorded while patients breathed on continuous positive airway pressure (of 5 cm H(2)O) during and 20–30 min after cessation of propofol infusion. The ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (rapid shallow breathing index or RSBI) was computed for both sets of measurements and values measured during and after propofol infusion were compared.

Results

The mean (± SEM) age was 54.0 ± 5.2 years and the mean (± SEM) APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score was 18.4 ± 2.0. During propofol infusion, patients breathed with a significantly lower tidal volume (0.245 vs 0.342 L, p = 0.006), higher RSBI (155.6 vs 114.8 breaths/min/L, p = 0.004), and tended to breathe more rapidly (34.3 vs 31.7 breaths/min, p = 0.18) than at 20–30 min after stopping propofol infusion. Three of 10 patients had RSBIs that were unfavorable (> 105 breaths/min/L) for weaning while on propofol but that became favorable (< 105 breaths/min/L) 20–30 min following cessation of propofol. The weight-adjusted dose of propofol was not correlated with the changes in any of the variables.

Conclusions

Propofol causes changes in breathing pattern that could lead a caregiver to erroneously conclude that a patient is not ready to begin spontaneous breathing trials. Since this effect has also been noted following benzodiazepine infusion, the clinician should consider the patient's "sedation history" when using RSBI to guide weaning decisions.

### Effect of pressure support ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure on the rapid shallow breathing index in intensive care unit patients [^112UCqf2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) values under various ventilatory support settings prior to extubation.

Design and Setting

Prospective study in the intensive care unit at a university hospital.

Patients

Thirty six patients ready for extubation.

Interventions

Patients were enrolled when receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV) of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FIO2 of 40% (PS). Subsequently each patient received a trial of PSV of 0 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FIO2 of 40% (CPAP), a trial of PSV of 0 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FIO2 of 21% (CPAP-R/A), and a 1-minute spontaneously breathing room air trial off the ventilator (T-piece). Trials were carried out in random order.

Measurements and Results

Respiratory frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT) were measured during PS, CPAP, CPAP-R/A, and T-piece in all patients. RSBI (f/VT) was determined for each patient under all experimental conditions, and the average RSBI was compared during PS, CPAP, CPAP-R/A, and T-piece. RSBI was significantly smaller during PS (46 ± 8 bpm/l), CPAP (63 ± 13 bpm/l) and CPAP-R/A (67 ± 14 bpm/l) vs. T-piece (100 ± 23 bpm/l). There was no significant difference in RSBI between CPAP and CPAP-R/A. RSBI during CPAP and CPAP-R/A were significantly smaller than RSBI during T-piece. In all patients RSBI values were less than 105 bpm/l during PS, CPAP, and CPAP-R/A. However, during T-piece the RSBI increased to greater than 105bpm/l in 13 of 36 patients.

Conclusions

In the same patient the use of PSV and/or PEEP as low as 5 cmH2O can influence the RSBI. In contrast, changes in FIO2 may have no effect on the RSBI.

### Can diaphragmatic ultrasonography performed during the T-tube trial predict weaning failure? The role of diaphragmatic rapid shallow breathing index [^116gacYh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), which is the ratio between respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (VT), is one of the most widely used indices to predict weaning outcome. Whereas the diaphragm plays a fundamental role in generating VT, in the case of diaphragmatic dysfunction the inspiratory accessory muscles may contribute. If this occurs during a weaning trial, delayed weaning failure is likely since the accessory muscles are more fatigable than the diaphragm. Hence, we hypothesised that the traditional RSBI could be implemented by substituting VT with the ultrasonographic evaluation of diaphragmatic displacement (DD). We named the new index the diaphragmatic-RSBI (D-RSBI). The aim of this study was to compare the ability of the traditional RSBI and D-RSBI to predict weaning failure in ready-to-wean patients.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational study. During a T-tube spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) we simultaneously evaluated right hemidiaphragm displacement (i.e. DD) by using M-mode ultrasonography as well as the RSBI. Outcome of the weaning attempt, length of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and hospital mortality were recorded. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-RSBI and RSBI.

Results

We enrolled 51 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h who were ready to perform a SBT. Most of the patients, 34 (66%), were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. When considering the 17 patients that failed the weaning attempt, 11 (64%) had to be reconnected to the ventilator during the SBT, three (18%) had to be re-intubated within 48 h of extubation, and three (18%) required non-invasive ventilation support within 48 h of extubation. The areas under the ROC curves for D-RSBI and RSBI were 0.89 and 0.72, respectively (P = 0.006).

Conclusions

D-RSBI (RR/DD) was more accurate than traditional RSBI (RR/VT) in predicting the weaning outcome.

Trial Registration

Our clinical trial was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02696018). ClinicalTrials.gov processed our record on 25 February 2016.

Intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated moderate to strong significant agreement between the average value of RSBI vent at different time points and RSBI standard (Table 3), and the average value of RSBI vent from 0–60 s had highest agreement with RSBI standard (ICC = 0.79, 95% CI 0.61–0.88; p < 0.001).

The mean difference between RSBI standard and the average value of RSBI vent at different time points is shown in Table 4. The average value of RSBI vent from 0–60 s demonstrated the best agreement with RSBI standard (mean difference between RSBI standard and RSBI vent from 0 to 60 s = −17.1 breaths/min/L, with a lower limit of − 76.6 breaths/min/L, and an upper limit of 42.4 breaths/min/L) (Fig. 3).

### Can diaphragmatic ultrasonography performed during the T-tube trial predict weaning failure? The role of diaphragmatic rapid shallow breathing index [^111Yan9r]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that DD, when combined with RR in an index that we named D-RSBI (RR/DD), is more accurate than the traditional RSBI (RR/VT) in predicting the weaning outcome. A cut-off of 1.3 is associated with the best sensitivity and specificity. Our results confirm the importance of rapid and shallow breathing as a global index of weaning-induced patient distress. Future studies on larger patient populations are required to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the D-RSBI for clinical prediction of weaning outcome.

### Diaphragmatic ultrasonography-based rapid shallow breathing index for predicting weaning outcome during a pressure support ventilation spontaneous breathing trial [^116T7Jf7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimum timing to wean is crucial to avoid negative outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), a widely used weaning index, has limitations in predicting weaning outcomes. By replacing the tidal volume of the RSBI with diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) assessed by ultrasonography, we calculated two weaning indices, the diaphragmatic excursion rapid shallow breathing index (DE-RSBI, respiratory rate [RR]/DE) and the diaphragm thickening fraction rapid shallow breathing index (DTF-RSBI, RR/DTF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive values of DTF-RSBI, DE-RSBI and traditional RSBI in weaning failure.

Methods

This prospective observational study included patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) for > 48 h and who were readied for weaning. During a pressure support ventilation (PSV) spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), right hemidiaphragmatic excursion and DTF were measured by bedside ultrasonography as well as RSBI. Weaning failure was defined as: (1) failing the SBT and (2) SBT success but inability to maintain spontaneous breathing for more than 48 h without noninvasive or invasive ventilation. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used for analyzing the diagnostic accuracy of RSBI, DE-RSBI, and DTF-RSBI.

Results

Of the 110 patients studied, 37 patients (33.6%) failed weaning. The area under the ROC (AUROC) curves for RSBI, DE-RSBI, and DTF-RSBI for predicting failed weaning were 0.639, 0.813, and 0.859, respectively. The AUROC curves for DE-RSBI and DTF-RSBI were significantly higher than for RSBI (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). The best cut-off values for predicting failed weaning were RSBI > 51.2 breaths/min/L, DE-RSBI > 1.38 breaths/min/mm, and DTF-RSBI > 78.1 breaths/min/%.

Conclusions

In this study, two weaning indices determined by bedside ultrasonography, the DE-RSBI (RR/DE) and DTF-RSBI (RR/DTF), were shown to be more accurate than the traditional RSBI (RR/VT) in predicting weaning outcome during a PSV SBT.

### Modified rapid shallow breathing index adjusted with anthropometric parameters increases predictive power for extubation failure compared with the unmodified index in postcardiac surgery patients [^113ZANLV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the best predictors of successful extubation after cardiac surgery, by modifying the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) based on patients' anthropometric parameters.

Design

Single-center prospective observational study.

Setting

Two general intensive care units at a single research institute.

Participants

Patients who had undergone uncomplicated cardiac surgery.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The following parameters were investigated in conjunction with modification of the RSBI: Actual body weight (ABW), predicted body weight, ideal body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body surface area. Using the first set of patient data, RSBI threshold and modified RSBI for extubation failure were determined (threshold value; RSBI: 77 breaths/min (bpm)/L, RSBI adjusted with ABW: 5.0 bpm×kg/mL, RSBI adjusted with BMI: 2.0 bpm×BMI/mL). These threshold values for RSBI and RSBI adjusted with ABW or BMI were validated using the second set of patient data. Sensitivity values for RSBI, RSBI modified with ABW, and RSBI modified with BMI were 91%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. The corresponding specificity values were 89%, 92%, and 93%, and the corresponding receiver operator characteristic values were 0.951, 0.977, and 0.980, respectively.

Conclusions

Modified RSBI adjusted based on ABW or BMI has greater predictive power than conventional RSBI.

### Respiratory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an expert opinion [^111ty3Ak]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In all cases in which noninvasive support is used, patients should be monitored closely, as deterioration can occur abruptly. Positive responses are usually evident soon after initiation. If there is no substantial improvement in gas exchange and respiratory rate within a few hours, invasive mechanical ventilation should be started without delay. Failure to recognize a lack of improvement during noninvasive support may result in further respiratory deterioration and/or cardiac arrest, often with devastating consequences. Moreover, noninvasive support in patients with a high respiratory drive may encourage excessive transpulmonary pressure swings, increasing the risk of patient-self-inflicted lung injury. A rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) > 105 breaths/min/L may be associated with need for intubation in patients receiving NIV. Monitored tidal volumes persistently > 9.5 ml/kg predicted body weight (PBW) suggest the need for intubation. Delayed intubation is associated with increased mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure, but premature intubation in patients in whom noninvasive respiratory support is adequate exposes the patient to potentially unnecessary risks associated with invasive mechanical ventilation.

PaO 2 should be maintained within a normal range (e.g. between 70 and 90 mmHg) or SaO 2 between 92 and 97%

Rationale and literature findings

Hypoxemia and hyperoxia can both be deleterious but clinicians tend to be more tolerant of hyperoxia. Hypoxemia represents a cardiovascular and hemodynamic stress and may limit oxygen delivery to the tissues, except in patients who are accustomed to hypoxemia as a result of chronic disease or residence at high altitude. Long-term deleterious effects of hypoxemia, such as neuropsychological impairment, have also been suggested, but confirmatory research is needed. Hyperoxia may increase lung inflammation, can adversely affect the microcirculation and is associated with increased mortality rates in certain categories of patients. One certainty is that there is no known benefit to be achieved from hyperoxia and clinicians should target saturation values in the normal range.

Low tidal volume ventilation, about 6 ml/kg based on predicted body weight, along with an airway plateau pressure ≤ 30 cmH 2 O should be targeted in most patients with ARDS

### Can diaphragmatic ultrasonography performed during the T-tube trial predict weaning failure? The role of diaphragmatic rapid shallow breathing index [^111kMDRL]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study provides evidence that the substitution of VT with DD in the calculation of RSBI could represent an important alternate to conventional weaning predictors in a mixed population of ICU patients. Weaning indices are relevant from a clinical perspective. Indeed, patients should be extubated as soon as they are able to sustain the load of breathing to avoid ventilator-associated diaphragmatic dysfunction, infections, and increased length of ICU and hospital stay; on the other hand, re-intubation leads to a worse patient outcome, though the link between failing an extubation and poor hospital outcomes is associative in nature and not known to be causal. Interestingly, patients failing the weaning attempt exhibited higher length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality (Table 2). An ideal predictive index should reflect all pathophysiological pathways that may lead to weaning failure, including excessive mechanical workload imposed on the respiratory muscles, impaired diaphragmatic function, weaning-induced cardiac failure, and a reduced ability to keep the airways opened and to clear secretions. Most of these pathways lead to rapid shallow breathing, which explains the rationale of taking into account the ratio between RR and VT in the study by Yang and Tobin. Rather surprisingly, in our patients who failed the weaning attempt, the RSBI was much lower (63 (range, 37–90) breaths/min/L) than the threshold value of 105 to predict weaning failure described in the original paper by Yang and Tobin. However, several other studies have reported a wide range of predictive values for RSBI, which may reflect differences in methodology, classification of outcomes, and patient populations. The relationship between inspiratory muscle fatigue and RSBI has been previously questioned. Tobin et al. showed that patients develop rapid and shallow breathing almost immediately with the beginning of weaning, well before muscular fatigue could develop. Hence, they speculated that the RSBI reflects more the instauration of a compensatory mechanism to avoid respiratory muscle fatigue then fatigue itself. Thus, it is likely the rapid shallow breathing expresses the balance between mechanical load posed on the inspiratory muscles and the inspiratory muscles ability to face it. By substituting VT with DD in the calculation of RSBI we proposed a new index (the D-RSBI) that was independently associated with weaning failure and whose diagnostic accuracy was superior to the one of RSBI and other weaning predictors (DD and MIP). We speculate that the D-RSBI was more accurate because DD reflects more closely the diaphragmatic function as compared to VT. In fact, in the presence of diaphragm dysfunction, the diaphragm movement is depressed and the accessory muscles assume a greater role in generating VT. In these circumstances, the VT is less linked to diaphragm function than DD, which reflects the ability of the diaphragm to generate inspiratory volume and, hence, the true diaphragmatic contribution to VT.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on the rapid shallow breathing index in patients following cardiac surgery [^114QAbKo]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) under different ventilatory support settings prior to extubation trials.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Cardiac surgery unit at a university hospital.

Patients

A total of 33 coronary artery bypass grafting patients ready for extubation.

Interventions

Enrolled patients received a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trial of 5 cm H(2)O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) of 40% (condition 1), a CPAP trial of 5 cmH(2)O and FIO(2) of 21% (condition 2), and a 1-min spontaneously breathing room air trial without ventilatory support (condition 3). These trials were applied in random order.

Measurements and Main Results

Average values of respiratory frequency and tidal volume were measured under the three experimental conditions in all patients immediately prior to extubation. The RSBIs were determined for each patient under each condition; the average RSBIs under conditions 1, 2, and 3 were compared for significance. The average RSBIs (± SD) were significantly smaller under condition 1 (34 ± 13) and condition 2 (36 ± 14) compared to condition 3 (71 ± 24). There was no significant difference in RSBI between conditions 1 and 2.

Conclusions

The administration of 5 cm H(2)O of CPAP can influence the determination of the RSBI. In contrast, changes in FIO(2) have no effect on RSBI determination. We speculate that using the RSBI during CPAP may mislead the clinician into premature discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Consequently, different threshold values for the RSBI should be derived for different ventilatory support levels.

Predictive value of RSBI, DE, DTF, DE-RSBI and DTF-RSBI for weaning failure

A ROC curve was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the weaning parameters in predicting weaning failure from MV (Fig. 5). The AUROCs for RSBI, DE, DTF, DE-RSBI, and DTF-RSBI were 0.639 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.522–0.756, P = 0.018), 0.771 (0.664–0.877, P < 0.001), 0.868 (0.792–0.944, P < 0.001), 0.813 (95% CI 0.716–0.91, P < 0.001), and 0.859 (95% CI 0.78–0.939, P < 0.001), respectively. The best cut-off values for predicting weaning failure were RSBI > 51.2 breaths/min/L, DE < 13.5 mm, DTF < 30.09%, DE-RSBI > 1.38 breaths/min/mm, and DTF-RSBI > 78.1 breaths/min/% (Table 3). It is worth noting that the AUROCs for DE-RSBI and DTF-RSBI were higher than for RSBI (P = 0.004, P < 0.001, respectively), but there was no statistical difference between DE-RSBI and DTF-RSBI (P = 0.348).

### Predicting success in weaning from mechanical ventilation [^116FY1PB]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

We identified 65 observational studies of weaning predictors that had been reported in 70 publications. After grouping predictors with similar names but different thresholds, the following predictors met our relevance criteria: heterogeneous populations, 51; COPD patients, 21; and cardiovascular ICU patients, 45. Many variables were of no use in predicting the results of weaning. Moreover, few variables had been studied in > 50 patients or had results presented to generate estimates of predictive power. For stepwise reductions in mechanical support, the most promising predictors were a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) < 65 breaths/min/L (measured using the ventilator settings that were in effect at the time that the prediction was made) and a pressure time product < 275 cm H2O/L/s. The pooled likelihood ratios (LRs) were 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.28) for a respiratory rate [RR] of < 38 breaths/min and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.06 to 1.71) for an RR of > 38 breaths/min, which indicate that an RR of < 38 breaths/min leaves the probability of successful weaning virtually unchanged but that a value of > 38 breaths/min leads to a small reduction in the probability of success in weaning the level of mechanical support. For trials of unassisted breathing, the most promising weaning predictors include the following: RR; RSBI; a product of RSBI and occlusion pressure < 450 cm H2O breaths/min/L; maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) < 20 cm H2O; and a knowledge-based system for adjusting pressure support. Pooled results for the power of a positive test result for both RR and RSBI were limited (highest LR, 2.23), while the power of a negative test result was substantial (ie, LR, 0.09 to 0.23). Summary data suggest a similar predictive power for RR and RSBI. In the prediction of successful extubation, an RR of < 38 breaths/min (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 47%), an RSBI < 100 or 105 breaths/min/L (sensitivity, 65 to 96%; specificity, 0 to 73%), PImax, and APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II scores that are obtained at hospital admission appear to be the most promising. After pooling, two variables appeared to have some value. An RR of > 38 breaths/min and an RSBI of > 100 breaths/min/L appear to reduce the probability of successful extubation, and PImax < 0.3, for which the pooled LR is 2.23 (95% CI, 1.15 to 4.34), appears to marginally increase the likelihood of successful extubation. Judging by areas under the receiver operator curve for all variables, none of these variables demonstrate more than modest accuracy in predicting weaning outcome. Why do most of these tests perform so poorly? The likely explanation is that clinicians have already considered the results when they choose patients for trials of weaning.

### A new integrative weaning index of discontinuation from mechanical ventilation [^112W6uUt]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

To date, no weaning predictive index has proven to be ideal. According to the Sixth International Consensus Conference on Intensive Care Medicine, patients who meet the following satisfactory criteria should be considered ready for weaning: frequency to tidal volume ratio (f/Vt) less than 105 breaths/min/L, respiratory rate (f) of 35 breaths/min or less, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) of -20 or less to -25 cmH 2 O, tidal volume (Vt) more than 5 mL/kg, vital capacity more than 10 mL/kg, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) above 90% with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) of 0.4 or less (or partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2)/FiO 2 ratio of 150 mmHg or above). After the assessment of these indexes regarding readiness for weaning, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should follow as a diagnostic test to determine the likelihood of successful extubation.

Weaning decisions based only on expert clinical judgment are not always correct. Premature discontinuation places severe stress on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, while unnecessary delays can lead to diaphragmatic atrophy that can worsen its force generation and, as a consequence, the MIP. Several predictors of weaning are therefore used to aid decision-making.

On reviewing the evidence base for ventilator weaning, none of the predictors of weaning demonstrate more than modest accuracy in predicting the weaning outcome. In the McMaster review and guidelines, 66 predictors of weaning were reviewed and analyzed. Only eight, including the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) or the f/Vt ratio, presented significant likelihood ratios to predict the weaning outcome. The f/Vt ratio was evaluated by at least 22 studies, and can be considered the most used predictor of weaning.

The daily screening of the respiratory function followed by SBTs in selected patients can reduce the time of mechanical ventilation and the cost of intensive care, besides being associated with fewer complications. As many factors can be responsible for weaning failure, we hypothesized that a weaning index that integrates significant physiological weaning parameters could be a better index predictor than the traditional ones.

The objective of this study is to test the predictive performance of a new integrative weaning index (IWI). We evaluated two groups of patients. In the first one (training set), the threshold values for each weaning parameter were selected. In the second group, we tested the predictive performance of the selected values in a prospective-validation data set of patients.

Univariate analysis showed that the most relevant determinants of weaning failure were sepsis (as reasons for initiating mechanical ventilation) (Table 1), D-RSBI, MIP, and time of MV before the weaning attempt (Table 2). The multivariate analysis showed that D-RSBI was the only predictor independently associated with weaning failure (odds ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–1.53) (Table 4).

### Diaphragmatic ultrasonography-based rapid shallow breathing index for predicting weaning outcome during a pressure support ventilation spontaneous breathing trial [^115TyEdn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

According to our results, during a PSV SBT, with DE and DTF measured by ultrasonography and replacing VT in the RSBI to calculate the two indices, DE-RSBI (RR/DE) and DTF-RSBI (RR/DTF), shown to me more accurate than the traditional RSBI (RR/VT) in predicting the weaning outcome. Point-of-care ultrasonography to assess diaphragmatic function had excellent reproducibility. To the best of our knowledge, the DTF-RSBI is first proposed and used to predict the weaning outcome, however, large prospective studies are required to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the index.

### Effort to breathe with various spontaneous breathing trial techniques. A physiologic meta-analysis [^1133ygPy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) are designed to simulate conditions after extubation, and it is essential to understand the physiologic impact of different methods.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and pooled measures reflecting patient respiratory effort among studies comparing SBT methods in a meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched Medline, Excerpta Medica Database, and Web of Science from inception to January 2016 to identify randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials reporting physiologic measurements of respiratory effort (pressure-time product) or work of breathing during at least two SBT techniques. Secondary outcomes included the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), and effort measured before and after extubation. The quality of physiologic measurement and research design was appraised for each study. Outcomes were analyzed using ratio of means.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 4,138 citations, 16 studies (n = 239) were included. Compared with T-piece, pressure support ventilation significantly reduced work by 30% (ratio of means [RoM], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57–0.86), effort by 30% (RoM, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60–0.82), and RSBI by 20% (RoM, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75–0.86). Continuous positive airway pressure had significantly lower pressure-time product by 18% (RoM, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.999) compared with T-piece, and reduced RSBI by 16% (RoM, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95). Studies comparing SBTs with the postextubation period demonstrated that pressure support induced significantly lower effort and RSBI; T-piece reduced effort, but not the work, compared with postextubation. Work, effort, and RSBI measured while intubated on the ventilator with continuous positive airway pressure of 0 cm H 2 O were no different than extubation.

Conclusions

Pressure support reduces respiratory effort compared with T-piece. Continuous positive airway pressure of 0 cm H 2 O and T-piece more accurately reflect the physiologic conditions after extubation.

ROC AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value; NRI, net reclassification improvement; RSBI, rapid shallow breathing index; WAVE, weaning and variability evaluation.

We further characterized the WAVE score by assessing its training-set performances (1) in the whole population stratified in quartiles, and (2) in association with RSBI and clinical impression of perceived extubation risk, using a decision threshold of 0.5 on the WAVE score. The risk of failure was defined as the number of patients who failed divided by the total number of patients in a given group. The fold increase in risk is the risk divided by the average risk of failure of the dataset (approximately 12%). The training set performances on the entire dataset (that is no data left in the test set) stratified in quartiles are shown in Figure 3, where we see that for higher WAVE scores there is a corresponding higher risk of failing extubation. Similarly using a binary cutoff, we found a fold increase in risk for WAVE score above 0.5 of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.16, 2.02). In Figure 4, we observed that the higher the RSBI, or the clinician-perceived risk of failure, the stronger the ability of the model to identify extubation failure. In particular, the fold increase in risk for WAVE score above 0.5 moved from 1.5 (CI: 1.05, 2.04) for patients with RSBI < 105 to 3.00 (CI: 1.21, 5.24) for patients with RSBI > 105. Similarly, the risk increased from 1.21 (CI: 0.77, 1.78) for patients with a low/average perceived risk of failure to 3.54 (CI: 1.88, 5.38) for those having a high perceived risk of failure. We performed the same comparison on the ROC AUCs. The ROC AUC of the WAVE score on the entire dataset was 0.72. For the subgroups we achieved instead (in order): 0.67 for patients with low/average perceived risk of failure, 0.69 for those with low RSBI, 0.82 for patients with high perceived risk of failure, 0.87 for those with high RSBI (P < 0.01 and P = 0.09, respectively).

### Risk factors for extubation failure in patients following a successful spontaneous breathing trial [^114pjbzx]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the factors associated with reintubation in patients who had successfully passed a spontaneous breathing trial.

Methods

We used logistic regression and recursive partitioning analyses of prospectively collected clinical data from adults admitted to ICUs of 37 hospitals in eight countries, who had undergone invasive mechanical ventilation for > 48 h and were deemed ready for extubation.

Results

Extubation failure occurred in 121 of the 900 patients (13.4%). The logistic regression analysis identified the following associations with reintubation: rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) [odds ratio (OR), 1.009 per unit; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.003 to 1.015]; positive fluid balance (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.53); and pneumonia as the reason for initiating mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.84). The recursive partitioning analysis allowed the separation of patients into different risk groups for extubation failure: (1) RSBI of > 57 breaths/L/min and positive fluid balance (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.8); (2) RSBI of < 57 breaths/L/min and pneumonia as reason for mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6); (3) RSBI of > 57 breaths/L/min and negative fluid balance (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.5); and (4) RSBI of < 57 breaths/L/min (OR, 1 [reference value]).

Conclusions

Among routinely measured clinical variables, RSBI, positive fluid balance 24 h prior to extubation, and pneumonia at the initiation of ventilation were the best predictors of extubation failure. However, the combined predictive ability of these variables was weak.

### Mechanical power normalized to dynamic lung compliance as a predictor of weaning and prognosis in mechanically ventilated patients: a retrospective cohort study [^111VqBMy]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definitions and outcomes

Weaning readiness was defined as the clinical determination that a patient was stable enough to attempt transition from invasive mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing. This included adequate respiratory mechanics (tidal volume, respiratory rate), sufficient oxygenation, hemodynamic stability, and absence of major contraindications such as severe metabolic acidosis or uncontrolled infection.

All patients underwent a SBT using a T-tube for 30–120 min, depending on tolerance. SBT failure was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: (1) rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) > 105; (2) respiratory rate < 8 or > 35 breaths/minute; (3) spontaneous tidal volume < 4 ml/kg; (4) heart rate > 140 beats/minute or a change > 20% accompanied by new-onset arrhythmia; and (5) arterial oxygen saturation < 90%. SBT success was defined as completion of the trial without meeting any of the above failure criteria.

Weaning success was defined as SBT success followed by extubation, with no requirement for reintubation or initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) within 48 h after extubation. Weaning failure was defined as the need for reintubation or initiation of NIV within 48 h after extubation due to signs of respiratory insufficiency, including increased work of breathing, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, or hemodynamic instability.

Extubation criteria required SBT success and the ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation without mechanical support. Reintubation criteria were based on clinical judgment according to the above failure definition. NIV after extubation was used for patients at high risk of post-extubation respiratory failure or for those who failed the initial SBT but were considered likely to recover with short-term support. These patients were reassessed for weaning readiness thereafter. Following SBT failure, patients were returned to conventional ventilator settings, with individualized adjustments (e.g. increased pressure support or PEEP) according to respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, and overall clinical status.

Primary outcomes were weaning success and failure, whereas secondary outcomes included the duration of IMV, length of stay in the ICU, and overall duration of hospitalization. Patients were retrospectively categorized into the weaning success or failure group based on these outcomes as documented in electronic medical records. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to stratify patients based on the interval between initial SBT and extubation. The intervals were defined as ≤ 1 day, ≤ 3 days (1–3 days), ≤ 7 days (3–7 days), and > 7 days, with detailed distribution shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

### The diaphragmatic electrical activity during spontaneous breathing trial in patients with mechanical ventilation: physiological description and potential clinical utility [^1124g6vW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In intensive care units (ICUs), timely weaning from mechanical ventilation is crucial for patients recovering from respiratory failure. Delayed or premature liberation from mechanical ventilation has been associated with increased mortality rates and prolonged ICU stays. The weaning processes, particularly spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) in the ICU are typically guided by clinical signs and experience. Despite adequate evaluation, 20–30% of patients experience unexpected mechanical ventilation liberation failure.

Over the years, several parameters have been developed to assess weaning readiness from mechanical ventilation and predict weaning failure, however, their efficacy were unsatisfactory. As the most commonly reported parameter, the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is calculated as the ratio of respiratory rate (RR) to tidal volume (VT). An RSBI value exceeding 105 min/L is indicative of breathing exhaustion. Nonetheless, RSBI has shown only moderate sensitivity and poor specificity in clinical practice. Diaphragm ultrasound is a non-invasive and feasible method for evaluating respiratory muscle function and the cause of weaning failure. However, its limited a sensitivity and positive predictive value hinder its effectiveness as monitoring indicator during SBTs. Given that the success of weaning is contingent upon the equilibrium among respiratory system load, respiratory muscle strength, and respiratory drive, there remains an ongoing requirement for a reliable, accurate, and pragmatic approach to forecast weaning outcomes.

Patients experiencing weaning failure might have respiratory load or weak respiratory muscles, leading to an increase in neural respiratory drive as a compensatory mechanism. Therefore, elevated neural drive during the SBT might be an interesting surrogate predictor for weaning failure. The electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) had been utilized to reflect and quantify neural respiratory drive. Previous studies suggested that changes in EAdi could predict SBT failure earlier than conventional parameters. However, the precise usefulness of early changes in EAdi parameters during SBTs is still uncertain.

This study aimed to describe the physiological behavior of SBT by EAdi-based parameters and evaluate the predictive value of EAdi-based parameters for weaning failure. We evaluated neuro-ventilatory efficiency, a surrogate for the ability to convert nerve drive into inspiratory tidal volume; neuro-excursion efficiency, a surrogate for the conversion of nerve impulses into muscle movements; and neuro-discharge per min, a surrogate for the total neural drive discharge per unit time.

### Spontaneous breathing patterns during maximum extracorporeal CORemoval in subjects with early severe ARDS [^113bPRAS]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching patients affected by early severe ARDS and undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from controlled ventilation to spontaneous breathing can be either beneficial or harmful, depending on how effectively the breathing pattern is controlled with ECMO. Identifying the factors associated with ineffective control of spontaneous breathing with ECMO may advance our pathophysiologic understanding of this syndrome.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study in subjects with severe ARDS who were on ECMO support ≤ 7 d. Subjects were switched to minimal sedation and pressure-support ventilation while extracorporeal CO 2 removal was increased to approximate the subject's total CO 2 production ([Formula: see text]). We calculated the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) as breathing frequency divided by tidal volume. We explored the correlation between certain characteristics recorded during pretest controlled ventilation and the development of apnea (ie, expiratory pause lasting > 10 s; n = 3), normal breathing pattern (ie, apnea to RSBI ≤ 105 breaths/min/L; n = 6), and rapid shallow breathing (RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L; n = 6) that occurred during the test study.

Results

The ratio of extracorporeal CO 2 removal to the subjects' [Formula: see text] was > 90% in all 15 subjects, and arterial blood gases remained within normal ranges. Baseline pretest Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, total [Formula: see text] and ventilatory ratio increased steadily, whereas [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] was higher in subjects with apnea compared to intermediate RSBI ≤ 105 breaths/min/L and elevated RSBI > 105 breaths/min/L. In subjects with rapid shallow breathing, baseline lung weight measured with quantitative computed tomography scored higher, as well.

Conclusions

In early severe ARDS, the factors associated with rapid shallow breathing despite maximum extracorporeal CO 2 extraction include less efficient CO 2 and O 2 exchange by the natural lung, higher severity of organ failure, and greater magnitude of lung edema.

### A 30-minute spontaneous breathing trial misses many children who Go on to fail a 120-minute spontaneous breathing trial [^116wcmwi]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal length of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) in children is unknown.

Research Questions

What are the most common reasons for SBT failure in children, and when do they occur? Can clinical parameters at the 30-min mark of a 120-min SBT predict outcome?

Study Design and Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial in pediatric ARDS, in which 2-h SBTs are conducted daily. SBT failure is based on objective criteria, including esophageal manometry for effort of breathing, categorized as passage, early failure (≤ 30 min), or late failure (30–120 min). Spirometry was used to calculate respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (Vt), and rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), in addition to pulse oximetry and capnography. Predictive models evaluated parameters at 30 min against SBT outcome, using receiver operating characteristic plots and area under the curve.

Results

We included 100 children and 305 SBTs, with 42% of SBTs being successful, 32% failing within 30 min, and 25% failing between 30 and 120 min. Of the patients passing SBTs at 30 min, 40% went on to fail by 120 min. High respiratory effort (esophageal manometry) was present in > 80% of failed SBTs. At the 30-min mark, there were no clear thresholds for RR, Vt, RSBI, Fio 2, oxygen saturation, or capnography that could reliably predict SBT outcome. Multivariable modeling identified RR (P < .001) and RSBI > 7 (P = 0.034) at 30 min, pre-SBT inspiratory pressure level (P = 0.009), and pre-SBT retractions (P = 0.042) as predictors for SBT failure, but this model performed poorly in an independent validation set with the receiver operating characteristic plot crossing the reference line (area under the curve, 0.67).

Interpretation

A 30-min SBT may be too short in children recovering from pediatric ARDS because many go on to fail between 30 and 120 min. Reassuring values of Vt, RR, and gas exchange at 30 min do not reliably predict SBT passage at 2 h, likely because they do not capture the effort of breathing.

### Diaphragmatic ultrasonography-based rapid shallow breathing index for predicting weaning outcome during a pressure support ventilation spontaneous breathing trial [^114zCXaD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that two weaning indices determined by bedside ultrasonography and RSBI, DE-RSBI (RR/DE) and DTF-RSBI (RR/DTF), are more accurate than the traditional RSBI (RR/VT) in predicting the weaning outcome during a PSV SBT.

The pathophysiology of weaning failure is complex, and it includes dysfunctional respiratory centers, respiratory muscle dysfunction, respiratory muscles overload, weaning-induced cardiovascular dysfunction, or a reduced ability to clear secretions. An ideal predictive index should consider as many as pathophysiological pathways that may contribute to weaning failure. Various weaning indices have been investigated to identify an optimal weaning window, but no index has proven to be ideal. Among these indices, the RSBI, described as the ratio of RR to VT, has gained wide use owing to its simple technique. RSBI is a global index of weaning-induced patient distress, most commonly resulting from physiopathological mechanisms leading to breathing rapidly (high RR) and shallowly (low VT). Yang and Tobin, in their original prospective cohort study, found that an RSBI of < 105 breaths/min/L as a threshold for predicting extubation success with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 97%, 64%, 78%, and 95%, respectively. However, lower predictive values have been reported in other studies. The AUROC value for RSBI in our study was lower (0.639) compared with Yang and Tobin's result (0.89). We speculate that this difference might be related to the RSBI measurement technique. In Yang and Tobin's study, RSBI was measured by Wright spirometer and disconnected the patients from the ventilator. While, the value displayed by the ventilator during unassisted breathing (pressure support of 0 cmH 2 O and PEEP of 0 cmH 2 O) in our study. A recent study compared two RSBI measurement techniques (measured by the ventilator and Wright spirometer) in patients with readiness for weaning, the authors found that the ventilator significantly overestimates the RSBI value compared to the standard technique by Wright spirometer.

Common Modalities Used During Spontaneous Breathing Trials

CPAP = continuous positive airway pressure; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure.

Once a modality is chosen and the SBT has begun, the CICU clinician should monitor for parameters of SBT failure as well as assess for potential predictors of extubation success. While no single parameter should be used in isolation; a combination of several objective and subjective criteria has commonly been used to identify SBT failure (Table 3). In addition to vital signs and clinical assessment, there are a variety of physiologic measures that have been used as predictors of successful extubation with the most cited factor being the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI). First described in 1991, the RSBI was defined as the ratio of respiratory rate to tidal volume measured over 1 minute with spontaneous breaths using a T-piece. An extubation was considered more likely to be successful if the RSBI was < 105 breaths/min/L. Although a sensitive test (83%), the specificity is poor (58%), and while useful, it should not be the sole predictor used to evaluate extubation success/candidacy. In fact, when used as the primary decision tool, it has been shown to prolong intubation without reducing mortality or risk of extubation failure. There are numerous other physiologic measures, but their poor predictive value often limits their clinical usefulness and are not recommended by the current guidelines. In addition, there are numerous multicomponent indices (eg, CORE index, integrative weaning index, etc), which can be accurate predictors of extubation success but are cumbersome to measure.

### A decision-tree model for predicting extubation outcome in elderly patients after a successful spontaneous breathing trial [^1148CDrt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The commonly used single tests, based on a 1-time measurement of a physiologic variable, are often poorly predictive of tracheal extubation outcome because they examine only a single aspect of physiological function that affects the extubation outcome. We hypothesized that the construction of a decision-tree model, which includes multiple variables and considers the changes of these variables, may more accurately predict successful extubation.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study. From 2007 to 2008, 113 elderly patients in the medical intensive care unit on ventilation for > 48 hours were enrolled. All patients underwent a 60-minute spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H(2)O; automatic tube compensation, 100%]. Patients tolerating the trial were extubated immediately. The mouth occlusion pressure (P(0.1)), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI,) and their combination (P(0.1) × RSBI) were recorded at the first, 30th, and 60th minute of the SBT. The changes in RSBI, which were determined at the 30th and 60th minute of the SBT (ΔRSBI30, ΔRSBI60), were assessed as the ratio (of RSBI30 or RSBI60) to RSBI at the first minute of the SBT.

Results

Twenty-two patients (19.5%) failed the SBT and were not included in the analysis, and 91 tolerated the trial and were extubated. At 48 hours, 73 (80.2%) remained extubated (successful extubation), and 18 (19.8%) required reintubation (extubation failure). Although theΔRSBI(30) was significantly higher in the extubation failure patients (118% ± 34%) than that in the successful extubation patients (93% ± 35%, P = 0.01), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that this index, with the threshold of < 98%, presented poor performance in predicting successful extubation with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of only 0.76. The classification and regression-tree analysis selected 3 variables (P(0.1) × RSBI(30), RSBI(1), ΔRSBI(30)) and began with P(0.1) × RSBI(30). For patients with P(0.1) × RSBI-(30) > 474 cmH(2)O*breaths/min/L, ΔRSBI(30) > 98% defined a group including all failure patients but no success patients, whereas ΔRSBI(30) ≤ 98% included all success patients with no failure patients. For patients with P(0.1) × RSBI(30) ≤ 474 cm H(2)O*breaths/min/L, the combination of both a P(0.1) × RSBI(30) > 328 cm H(2)O*breaths/min/L and RSBI(1) > 112 breaths/min/L also defined a group including all success patients but no failure patients. Indeed, the diagnostic accuracy (DA) of the tree model, which was 89.1% with only the P(0.1) × RSBI(30) included, increased to 94.5% when both the P(0.1) × RSBI(30) and ▵RSBI(30) were included. The final tree model with the inclusion of all 3 discriminators could capture the successful extubation with diagnostic accuracy of 96.7%, AUC of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 0.98).

Conclusion

If the current tree model is confirmed by a prospective study with a larger sample size, it would be useful in guiding physicians making extubation decisions in elderly medical intensive care unit patients.

### Preliminary evaluation of a new index to predict the outcome of a spontaneous breathing trial [^111oL89a]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The available predictors of spontaneous-breathing-trial (SBT) success/failure lack accuracy. We devised a new index, the CORE index (compliance, oxygenation, respiration, and effort).

Objective

To compare the CORE index to the CROP index (compliance, rate, oxygenation, and pressure), airway-occlusion pressure 0.1 s after the start of inspiratory flow (P(0.1)), and rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) for predicting SBT success/failure in a critical care environment.

Methods

With 47 mechanically ventilated patients recovering from respiratory failure, of various causes, we prospectively examined the SBT success/failure prediction accuracy and calculated receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of CORE, CROP, P(0.1), and RSBI.

Results

The specificities were CORE 0.95, P(0.1) 0.70, CROP 0.70, and RSBI 0.65. The sensitivities were CORE 1.00, CROP 1.00, P(0.1) 0.93, and RSBI 0.89. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were CORE 1.00 (95% CI 0.92–1.00), CROP 0.91 (95% CI 0.79–0.97), P(0.1) 0.81 (95% CI 0.67–0.91), and RSBI 0.77 (95% CI 0.62–0.88). The positive likelihood ratios were CORE 20.0, CROP 3.3, P(0.1) 3.1, and RSBI 2.5. The negative likelihood ratios were CORE 0.0, CROP 0.0, P(0.1) 0.1, and RSBI 0.2.

Conclusions

The CORE index was the most accurate predictor of SBT success/failure.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^114WNP7s]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

Adult mechanical ventilation — RSBI and SBT readiness — We suggest that an RSBI is not needed to determine readiness for an SBT (conditional; moderate certainty). Evidence states there is not strong support for the use of RSBI to predict readiness for an SBT, and a simple screen is likely sufficient to identify readiness for an SBT: evidence for some reversal of the underlying cause for respiratory failure, adequate oxygenation, hemodynamic stability, and the capability to initiate an inspiratory effort. For monitoring during an ongoing SBT, criteria should include assessment (especially changes) of the respiratory pattern, hemodynamics, gas exchange, and patient comfort. Clarifying scope, successful completion of an SBT does not necessarily lead to extubation and the RSBI is intended to predict liberation rather than extubation. Future directions note interest in noninvasive imaging techniques, such as diaphragmatic ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography, as predictors of ventilator liberation.

### Mechanical power density, spontaneous breathing indexes, and weaning readiness following prolonged mechanical ventilation [^114HKFuw]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence suggests that mechanical power (MP) normalized to dynamic compliance, which equals power density, may help identify prolonged ventilated patients at risk for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure. This study compared MP density with traditional spontaneous breathing indexes to predict a patient's capacity to sustain a short trial of unassisted breathing.

Methods

A prospective observational study on 186 prolonged ventilated, tracheotomized patients. We analyzed the first 30-min SBT upon weaning center admission, comparing MP density with spontaneous breathing indexes (e.g., predicted body weight normalized tidal volume (VT/PBW), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), and the integrative weaning index (IWI)) regarding SBT failure prediction, with diagnostic accuracy expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

Results

SBT failure occurred in 51 out of 186 patients (27%), who demonstrated significantly lower dynamic compliance (median 29 mL/cmH 2 O [IQR 26–37] vs. 39 mL/cmH 2 O [33–45]) and higher MP density (5837 cmH 2 O 2 /min [4512–7758] vs. 2922 cmH 2 O 2 /min [2001–4094]) before SBT, as well as lower spontaneous VT/PBW (5.7 mL∗kg -1 [5.0–6.7] vs. 6.6 mL∗kg -1 [5.9–7.8]), higher RSBI (73 min -1 ∗L -1 [57–100] vs. 59 min -1 ∗L -1 [45–76]), and lower IWI (40 L 2 /cmH 2 O∗%∗min∗10–3 [27–50] vs. 63 L 2 /cmH 2 O∗%∗min∗10–3 [46–91]) after 5 min of unassisted breathing. MP density was more accurate at predicting SBT failures (AUROC 0.86 [95%CI 0.80–0.91]) than VT/PBW (0.58 [0.50–0.65]), RSBI (0.54 [0.47–0.61]), or IWI (0.66 [0.58–0.73])).

Conclusions

MP density as a readiness criterion was more accurate at predicting weaning trial failures in prolonged ventilated, tracheotomized patients than traditional indexes assessed during unassisted breathing.

### Oxygen consumption, effort, and weaning in the mechanically ventilated patient in the intensive care unit: the extubate study: a protocol for an observational study [^115kbDpn]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is often performed to determine whether the patient can be extubated with a minimal risk of failure. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is an important parameter used in an SBT. However, weaning failure rates are between 15 and 20%. Because of the high incidence of extubation failure a search for a better parameter is warranted. The aim of this study is to investigate whether oxygen consumption, pressure-time product, work of breathing and pressure swings predict weaning failure.

Methods

This is a single-center, prospective observational study conducted at the Leiden University Medical Center. Adult patients undergoing an SBT as per the ruling protocol in the LUMC will be included. Measurements of oxygen consumption, pressure-time product, work of breathing and pressure swings will be continuously recorded during 10 min prior, during and 10 min after the SBT. Data collection will not interfere with clinical decision making. The primary outcome is the ability of these parameters to predict extubation success or failure.

Discussion

Patient enrollment started in January 2024 and inclusions are expected to be complete in January 2026. Patient's risk and burden are minimal. We hypothesize that patients who fail extubation will have higher absolute baseline efforts but will not have the potential to increase those efforts when subjected to an SBT.

Trial Registration

The study is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT06391424, submitted on 2024-04-30.

### Diaphragmatic ultrasonography-based rapid shallow breathing index for predicting weaning outcome during a pressure support ventilation spontaneous breathing trial [^115HKFbn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the recent study, Fossat et al. proposed a new composite index named the rapid shallow diaphragmatic index (RSDI) (RSBI/DE). During a 30-min SBT with minimal PSV (pressure support of 6 cm H 2 O and end-expiratory pressure of 0 cm H 2 O), the diaphragmatic ultrasonography was performed and the RSDI, RSBI was calculated at the 5th and the 25th minute of the SBT. They found that the RSBI, other indices that incorporate the ultrasound mobility of the diaphragm into the calculation of the RSBI, the DE, and the DTF failed to predict the extubation or weaning success. The findings of the study are inconsistent with those of previous studies, including the present study. Possible reasons for these differences may be explained as follows. First, Fossat et al. only analysed the patients who successfully passed SBT. Patients with SBT failure possibly due to DD were not included in the analysis. This may underestimate the value of diaphragm ultrasonography in predicting weaning outcomes. Second, in the study by Fossat et al. 25% of patients received prophylactic noninvasive ventilation after extubation. These patients were considered as weaning failures in our study. Prophylactic noninvasive ventilation may mask the postextubation respiratory failure caused by DD.

As ultrasonography is an operator-dependent method, minimizing intra-observer and inter-observer variation is very important. In our study, the ICC was evaluated to assess the intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility of DE and DTF measurements. Consistent with previous studies, we also found excellent reproducibility for DE and DTF measurements. In the present study, certain measures were used to decrease intra-observer and inter-observer variation. First, ultrasonography was performed by a well-trained point-of-care ultrasonography intensivist (JS) who had received more than 40 h of hands-on training in diaphragm ultrasonography and who had operating experience on more than 100 patients. Second, the patients' posture was standardized. Third, the cursor for DE measurements in M-mode was kept as strictly perpendicular as possible regarding the middle or posterior part of the diaphragm, and for DT, a higher-resolution linear probe was used when necessary. Finally, every measurement was performed three times and then averaged.

### The relationship between trans-diaphragmatic pressure and… [^112bRGhK]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview Protocol The patients will enter a Spontaneous Breathing Trial for sixty minutes. During the S. B. T. the desirable measurements will be made: transdiaphragmatic pressure, diaphragm thickening, Tdi, pi, Tdi, ee, TFdi, Di, e, Maximal Inspiratory Pressure, Rapid Shallow Breathing Index.
- Performance of a MIP maneuver.
- Measurement of the same parameters during an S. B. T. with an airway of reduced diameter.
- Performance of lung ultrasound for B-lines estimation at the end of SBT, MIP and the resistive breathing)
- If the S. B. T. is successful according to the R. S. B. I. the patient will be disconnected from the mechanical ventilation. Tension Time Diaphragm Index Ttdi is used as an index of diaphragmatic exhaustion.

Measurements above 0, 15 are indicative of the diaphragmatic incapability to maintain spontaneous breathing for more than 45 minutes, whence the naming of Ttdi critical Ttdi = x. Rapid Shallow Breathing Index Rapid Shallow Breathing Index is a method used for predicting the weaning outcome. It is measured during spontaneous breathing and equates to the ratio of respiratory rate per minute to the tidal volume expressed in liters. R. S. B. I. = RR/Vt. It has been shown that an R. S. B. I. values below 105 breaths/min/L can predict a successful weaning. Maximal Inspiratory Pressure Maximal Inspiratory Pressure is used as a predictive factor of the weaning outcome. It is measured with a manometer placed in a fully occluded airway, while the patient tries to breathe through it for 20 seconds. The highest pressure value is named M. I. P. It has been shown that values below -25 cmH2O are indicative of a positive weaning outcome.

Pressure-Time Product of the Esophageal pressure PTPes was calculated as the area enclosed within the Pes trace, the superimposed recoil of the chest wall and onset and end of inspiratory flow. The chest wall recoil pressure was calculated as 4% of predicted vital capacity. Diaphragm Ultrasound.

### The diaphragmatic electrical activity during spontaneous breathing trial in patients with mechanical ventilation: physiological description and potential clinical utility [^113XZyD6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study protocol

All patients underwent daily screening to determine their readiness for SBT. SBT were conducted according to the recommendations from the International Consensus Conference on weaning: (1) resolving the primary cause of mechanical ventilation; (2) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) ≥ 200 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 4–5 cmH 2 O; (3) Pressure support (PS) level with 10 cmH 2 O for at least 24 h with stable respiration; (4) arterial pH > 7.32; (5) rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) < 105 (min·L) −1 and respiratory rate (RR) < 30 breaths/min; (6) stable hemodynamics (heart rate ≤ 110 bpm, mean artery pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, norepinephrine ≤ 0.1 µg/kg/min). When initiating the SBT, the PS was reduced from 10 cmH 2 O to 0 cmH 2 O, while the PEEP was maintained at 4-5cmH 2 O. The SBT was to be performed for 120 min and patients were reconnected to mechanical ventilation if any of the following events occurred: (1) breathing frequency > 35 breaths/min or < 6 breaths/min; (2) blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) < 90% with unchanged FiO 2; (3) new cardiac arrhythmia, heart rate or mean artery pressure increasing > 10%; (4) agitation, diaphoresis or complaints of dyspnea. After evaluating the patients' airway protection, airway secretions, cough strength, and level of consciousness, two experienced ICU doctors determined whether to extubate patients who had successfully completed the SBT and reconnected to mechanical ventilation for at least 1 h after the SBT. Weaning failure was defined as SBT failure, reintubation, or the use of noninvasive ventilation within 48 h of extubation due to labored breathing.

### Diaphragm electromyographic activity as a predictor of weaning failure [^115qQfDY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare breathing pattern descriptors and diaphragm electromyographic activity (EAdi)-derived indices obtained from a neurally adjusted ventilatory assist catheter during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in patients successfully and unsuccessfully separated from the ventilator and to assess their performance as a potential marker to discriminate these two categories of patients.

Methods

Fifty-seven ready-to-wean patients were included in a prospective observational study. During a 30-min SBT (pressure support 7 cmH(2)O, zero end expiratory pressure), tidal volume (V (T)) and respiratory rate (RR) were obtained from the flow signal at baseline and at 3, 10, 20 and 30 min during the SBT. EAdi-derived indices were simultaneously computed: maximum of the EAdi (EAdi(max)), area under the inspiratory curve of EAdi (EAdi(AUC)), the difference between EAdi(max) and EAdi(min) (∆EAdi), EAdi(max)/V (T), EAdi(AUC)/V (T) and ∆EAdi/V (T). Patients, successfully (success group; n = 35) and unsuccessfully (failure group; n = 22) separated from the ventilator were compared.

Results

At baseline, the breathing pattern was similar in the two groups, whereas EAdi(max) and EAdi(AUC) were significantly lower in the success group (p < 0.05). In the failure group, RR and RR/V (T) increased significantly during the trial, V (T) decreased, whereas EAdi(max) and EAdi(AUC) did not change. At 3 min, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic-curve of RR/V (T) and the EAdi-derived indices to predict weaning outcome were 0.83 for the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), 0.84 for EAdi(max)/V (T), 0.80 for EAdi(AUC)/V (T) (0.80) and 0.82 for ∆EAdi/V (T). The coefficient of variation for V (T) decreased in the failure group while that for EAdi(max) remained unchanged.

Conclusions

EAdi-derived indices provide reliable and early predictors of weaning outcome. However, the performance of these indices is not better than the RR/V (T).

### Smart care ™ versus respiratory physiotherapy-driven manual weaning for critically ill adult patients: a randomized controlled trial [^115t4v2q]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis showed that weaning with SmartCare™ (Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) significantly decreases weaning time in critically ill patients. SmartCare™ is a unique automated weaning system that measures selected respiratory variables, adapts ventilator output to individual patient needs by operationalizing predetermined algorithms and automatically conducting spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) when predetermined thresholds are met.

ICU weaning protocols driven by respiratory therapists and/or physiotherapists can also be effective in shortening weaning duration. In the adult ICU of Albert Einstein Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil, there is a weaning protocol that consists of a daily assessment for the possibility of an SBT. The ICU SBT is performed in pressure support ventilation (PSV), which allows for better patient monitoring, a greater control of inspired oxygen fraction (FO 2) and the maintenance of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The SBT is performed as soon as the daily assessment indicates that a weaning trial is feasible. If the SBT is successful, the patient is extubated. Otherwise, patients return to the previous ventilation mode and another daily assessment of readiness for weaning is performed the next day (24-hour interval). If it succeeds, another SBT is attempted.

We hypothesized that the weaning strategy with SmartCare™ ventilatory mode would be as effective as our respiratory physiotherapy–driven weaning protocol in the ICU patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare SmartCare™ ventilatory mode with our validated respiratory physiotherapy–driven weaning protocol in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. We sought to evaluate the following:
Primary outcome: duration of weaning or weaning time (from randomization to extubation)
Secondary outcomes: Rate of extubation failure (the need to return to invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of extubation) Mechanical ventilation duration or mechanical ventilation time (from intubation to extubation) Physiologic measurements: respiratory rate (f), tidal volume (VT), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI; calculated as frequency of breaths [respiratory rate] divided by tidal volume in liters [f/VT {L}]), forced vital capacity (FVC), level of PSV, PEEP, FO 2, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO 2) and airway occlusion pressure at 0.1 second (P 0.1) at the beginning of weaning and before extubation

### The ratio of respiratory rate to diaphragm thickening fraction for predicting extubation success [^111ruH5T]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Predicting liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) has long been a crucial clinical issue. Extubation failure was associated with an increased risk of death and an extended ICU stay. Currently, parameters such as the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), vital capacity (VC), and maximal inspiratory pressure (PI MAX) are routinely used to predict extubation failure from MV. However, the results of these parameters in predicting weaning outcomes vary across studies.

The ratio of respiratory rate to tidal volume (RR/VT), known as the RSBI, is one of the most widely used predictors of weaning outcomes. However, some previous studies showed that RSBI is not a reliable predictor of extubation success. These results may be because RSBI does not specifically measure diaphragmatic function. The diaphragm is the main respiratory muscle. It has been demonstrated that MV accelerates diaphragmatic atrophy. Diaphragm dysfunction (DD) is common in critically ill patients especially in patients with respiratory failure who require MV. Furthermore, DD is related to weaning failure. Therefore, parameters that do not directly measure diaphragmatic function might be poor predictors of extubation outcomes.

Assessment of diaphragmatic function by the twitch magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation or measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure with esophageal balloons is costly and invasive. Bedside ultrasound is increasingly performed in a critical care setting and may be of great utility for this purpose because it is non-invasive, widely available, and allows real-time evaluation of diaphragmatic movement. To determine diaphragmatic function, ultrasound can be used to obtain diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF), diaphragmatic excursion (DE), and time to peak inspiratory amplitude (TPIA) during contraction.

Spadaro et al. revealed that replacing VT with DE in the RSBI, named D-RSBI (RR/DE), had better diagnostic accuracy for predicting weaning outcomes than traditional RSBI. The RSBI reflects the function of all inspiratory muscles and accessory muscles. In case of diaphragmatic dysfunction, the other inspiratory and accessory muscles will serve to preserve tidal volume (VT), which is used to calculate RSBI. However, those groups of muscles can only temporarily replace the diaphragm function because the accessory muscles are weaker and more fatigable than the diaphragm. These muscles will not be able to sustain adequate ventilation. Thus, we hypothesized that modifying RSBI by replacing VT with a diaphragmatic ultrasound parameter would provide a superior predictor to predict extubation outcome more than the conventional parameter or diaphragmatic parameter alone.

Predictive accuracy of diaphragm indices for weaning outcome

The ROC curves for RSBI, LUS, DE and DTF are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

Weaning outcome was not accurately predicted by the RSBI area under the curve [AUC] = 0.680, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.581–0.767), p < 0.9). The AUCs of LUS 0.764 (CI 0.671–0.842) and DE 0.831 (CI 0.690–0.856) were higher than that of RSBI, but neither independently predicted outcome (both p < 0.9). The DTF AUC was 0.881 (CI 0.790–956), which was significantly greater than those of the other measures.

The best cut-off values for predicting weaning success were DTF ≥ 30%, DE ≥ 1.3 cm, LUS ≤ 11, and RSBI ≤ 102. It is worth noting that the specificity of DTF in predicting weaning outcome was higher (at 84%) than that of RBSI (53%), that of LUS (55%), and that of DE (62%), while the sensitivity at 94% was higher than that of RBSI (85%), that of LUS (71%), and that of DE (65%).

By logistic regression, we examined the potential worth of combining these variables in predicting weaning outcome. The combination of DTF ≥ 30%, DE ≥ 1.3 cm, LUS ≤ 11, and RSBI ≤ 102 showed the highest AUC (0.919), with a sensitivity of 96.0% and a specificity of 89% (Table 4, Fig. 2).

### The PROMIZING trial enrollment algorithm for early identification of patients ready for unassisted breathing [^1176Naav]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Step 2 — Pressure support ventilation tolerance trial

Patients meeting all enrollment criteria were immediately placed on PSV, if they were not already. The PSV tolerance trial (PSVTT) consisted in a pressure of 5–20 cmH 2 O (the total pressure did not exceed 30 cmH 2 O) for at least 30 min. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (F i O 2) settings were similar to that before the PSVTT. If patients were unable to tolerate the PSV because of respiratory distress or clinical instability (see Additional file 3: Table E3), they were immediately returned to the prior ventilation mode. A new PSVTT was attempted at least once daily until patients passed the trial.

Step 3 – General weaning criteria

Patients who passed the PSVTT were immediately evaluated for general weaning criteria including (i) a peripheral oxygen saturation (S p O 2) ≥ 90% on F i O 2 ≤ 40% and a PEEP ≤ 8 cmH 2 O, (ii) an arterial pH ≥ 7.32, and (iii) vasopressor requirement ≤ 0.1 µg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalents. Patients who did not meet these three weaning criteria were randomized in the PROMIZING study (Not ready for weaning group). Patients who met these three criteria proceeded directly to a ZERO CPAP tolerance trial to assess their rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and capacity to undergo an SBT.

Step 4 – Zero CPAP tolerance trial

Patients were monitored during a two minute CPAP tolerance trial on their ventilator using a pressure level of 0 cmH 2 O. We assessed the RSBI (as the ratio of respiratory rate to tidal volume, RR/V t). Patients who failed this ZERO CPAP tolerance trial due to either a RR/V t ratio > 100, or respiratory distress or clinical instability (see Additional file 4: Table E4) were randomized into the PROMIZING trial (ZERO CPAP tolerance failure group). Patients with a RR/V t ratio ≤ 100 breaths/min/L and S p O 2 ≥ 90% proceeded directly to a SBT.

### Impact of pressure support ventilation duration after a spontaneous breathing trial on reintubation rates in critically ill subjects: a retrospective study [^115xfK5B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Standardized weaning process and group classification

Following the hospital's established weaning protocol implemented in 2021 (Supplementary Material 1), all subjects underwent standardized weaning using PSV method for SBT. Daily weaning readiness was assessed using criteria including resolution of acute disease phase, adequate oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 > 200 mmHg with PEEP ≤ 5 cmH2O), hemodynamic stability, adequate mental status, and cough strength. The SBT was conducted using low-level pressure support (PS 5–8 cmH2O with PEEP 5 cmH2O), with initial durations of 30, 60, or 120 min.

After successful completion of SBT, subjects in SP and LP groups continued to receive individualized intermediate levels of pressure support ventilation, with support levels higher than during SBT but lower than pre-weaning levels (typically ranging from 8 to 12 cmH₂O with PEEP maintained at 5 cmH₂O). The pressure support levels were adjusted based on work of breathing parameters including rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and respiratory rate, to ensure patients maintained stable respiratory patterns while allowing for adequate spontaneous breathing. Clinicians adjusted pressure support levels in real-time according to the patient's work of breathing, aiming to achieve a balance between maintaining adequate ventilation and preventing respiratory muscle fatigue. Patients requiring controlled ventilation after a successful SBT were excluded from the study, as this typically indicates clinical deterioration or significant patient-ventilator asynchrony.

While variation in SBT duration introduces some heterogeneity, this practice reflects our institutional protocol based on clinical risk stratification, where longer durations were used for patients with previous extubation failure, prolonged ventilation (> 7 days), or uncertain clinical stability. To account for this potential confounder, we included SBT duration as a variable in our analysis. For successful SBT completion, a cuff leak test was performed, and extubation decisions were made jointly by physicians and respiratory therapists. Subjects were divided into three groups based on PSV duration after SBT: Direct Extubation (DE, ≤ 30 min), Short-term PSV (SP, 30 min–3 h), and Long-term PSV (LP, 3–12 h) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).

### Diaphragmatic ultrasound and its relationship to breathing effort and load: a prospective observational study [^115FZBxA]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison between weaning outcomes

Tfdi was similar between weaning success and failure both in tidal and resistive breathing (p = 0.336) and (p = 0.545), respectively (Fig. 3 A). Patients who succeeded in weaning had higher Dex both in tidal and resistive breathing [1.28 (0.94–1.93) cm vs 0.83 (0.51–1.26) cm, p = 0.02], [1.7 (1.36–2.19) cm vs 1.01 (0.58–1.51) cm, p = 0.017] respectively (Fig. 3 B). (Table 2).

### Point-of-care ultrasonography and liberation from mechanical ventilation [^113SfP74]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Safe liberation from mechanical ventilation remains a challenge for the critical care physician. Undue prolongation of mechanical ventilation or extubation failure followed by re-intubation is associated with negative outcome. Recent clinical practice guidelines suggest using pressure augmentation during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), which would result in more successful SBTs and higher extubation rates. However, despite pressure augmentation, the extubation success rate was only 75.4%, reflecting the significant limitation of the SBT to predict extubation success. Moreover, other predictors of weaning success like the Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI), respiratory system compliance and MIP lack significant predictive value. The guidelines also suggest extubation to preventive non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for patients at high risk for extubation failure despite a successful SBT, which again reflects the limitations of the SBT. High-risk patients were defined variably in different studies, further complicating the task of identifying the vulnerable group of patients who would potentially fail extubation.

A significant proportion of patients would pass a SBT and would achieve extubation success irrespective of the technique used for the SBT and without the institution of post-extubation NIV. The challenge for clinicians is to identify the group of patients who would fail extubation after a successful SBT, to potentially optimize the patient before extubation and to identify those patients who would benefit from preventive NIV following extubation.

Change in lung aeration during a SBT can be quantified at the bedside using the validated lung ultrasound score. The scores calculated before and at the end of a SBT can help to detect the extent of aeration loss, which correlates with extubation failure. This can potentially identify the patients who would benefit from preventive NIV following extubation. Similarly, the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction and an increase in LV filling pressure during a SBT can predict extubation failure.

Bedside ultrasonography can evaluate diaphragmatic performance in the form of diaphragmatic excursion during inspiration and thickening of the diaphragmatic muscle during inspiration at the zone of apposition. Diaphragmatic dysfunction, as diagnosed by bedside ultrasonography, has been shown to correlate with longer weaning time and higher possibility of extubation failure. Ultrasonographic indices may be equivalent to or better than the RSBI to predict extubation failure.

Larger prospective studies need to be conducted to validate and strengthen the existing evidence regarding the use of point-of-care ultrasonography to facilitate safe liberation from mechanical ventilation. Combining the bedside ultrasonography of the lung, the heart and the diaphragm with clinical indices like the RSBI may help to derive a composite index with higher predictive capability.

### Ventilation distribution during spontaneous breathing trials predicts liberation from mechanical ventilation: the VISION study [^11258nCL]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Demographic data, comorbidities, indication for intubation, severity of illness (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II) and Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) were collected on admission. MV settings and the following variables were obtained throughout the study: rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), airway occlusion at 100 ms (P0.1) and airway pressure negative swing during an end expiratory occlusion maneuver (ΔP occ), blood pressure and heart rate. Following the completion of the SBT, outcomes were collected over 7-day, including time of extubation, of re-intubation, escalation in ventilatory support and tracheostomy, ICU length of stay and mortality.

MV liberation outcome (success or failure) was defined at 7 days after extubation as proposed. We defined rapid liberation success pragmatically as passing an SBT followed by a successful extubation the same or next day. All other situations were considered as early liberation failure and classified in four subgroups: 1) extubation followed by escalation to non-invasive ventilatory support (secondary requirement for high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as rescue therapy for post extubation occurrence of respiratory distress), 2) reintubation within 7 days, 3) SBT followed by clinical decision of tracheostomy and 4) not being extubated the same or next day after enrolment SBT.

### Electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) as a monitoring parameter in difficult weaning from respirator: a pilot study [^112X6MgF]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Successful weaning from respiratory support is a matter of major importance in critically ill patients recovering from acute respiratory failure. The assessment of lung function before discontinuation of ventilator support is essential to predict the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously without mechanical assistance. Weaning readiness has been the subject of research over the past years, and numerous parameters have been proposed as predictors of weaning success, indicating the lack of a reliable solution. An easy-to-obtain and therefore widely accepted parameter is the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), which is the ratio of respiratory rate and tidal volume (RR/VT).

Electromyography of the diaphragm has been used to describe the patients' functional status and neuromuscular coupling in numerous studies and has been shown to provide a real-time, breath-by-breath measure of neural respiratory drive. With the clinical introduction of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) as a ventilator mode, the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) gives the clinician a monitoring parameter of diaphragmatic function. The electromyogram of the crural diaphragm is recorded by a set of electrodes incorporated into a special nasogastric tube (EAdi catheter). The filtered and amplified signal is displayed on the ventilator's control panel. Experimental studies have shown its value in measuring diaphragmatic function, as the amplitude of the signal correlates with the patients' respiratory drive. Clinical studies and results from animal experiments confirmed the physiological concepts. Although primarily intended to control the ventilator, the EAdi allows monitoring of the respiratory drive in relation to tidal volume. The tidal volume (VT) during unassisted spontaneous breathing is proportional to the electrical activity of the diaphragm and reflects the neural output of the central respiratory regulation in healthy dogs.

### Association between respiratory-related cortical activation and weaning from mechanical ventilation: a physiological study [^112Wk6sb]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to extubate is challenging in ICUs. Delaying extubation exposes patients to undue prolongation of mechanical ventilation and the ensuing complications whereas extubation failure requiring reintubation is associated with increased risk of mortality. In mechanically ventilated patients, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is recommended before extubation in order to mimic physiological condition after extubation. Judging SBT outcome may be difficult, as demonstrated by discrepancies in clinicians' assessments and high incidences of SBT failure, which occurs in 18 to 30% of cases. Since many factors can be responsible for the failure of an attempt to wean a patient from mechanical ventilation, predicting the success or failure of a SBT remains challenging even for an experienced physician. Predictive indexes have been proposed to identify the earliest time that a patient can resume spontaneous breathing and to identify patients in whom SBT is likely to fail, so that cardiorespiratory distress can be avoided (10). Numerous indexes have been developed, such as the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) or airway occlusion pressure (P0.1)

No study has actually assessed the role of cerebral respiratory drive in SBT outcome. Up until now, critical care physicians had access only to clinical bedside parameters (respiratory rate, minute ventilation, signs of respiratory distress) which are indirect markers, and not direct measures, of the central control of respiration. Monitoring respiratory-related cortical activation could become a tool for continuous assessment of respiratory discomfort in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, aided by the automation of EEG signal analysis, which is currently under development.

The brainstem coordinates automatic rest ventilation. However, in case of increased inspiratory load, the cerebral motor cortex engages, facilitating the response of phrenic motoneurons to central commands via a corticospinal pathway. In this case, respiratory-related cortical activation can be assessed by measuring pre-inspiratory potentials (PIP) on electroencephalogram recordings before each inspiration. We hypothesized that strong respiratory-cortical activation may be associated with markedly increased inspiratory efforts during SBT failure. The main objective of this study was to determine whether respiratory-related cortical activation assessed by measuring PIP amplitude during a SBT, could be differently activated according to the success or failure of the SBT.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^1141VBjr]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite prior publications of clinical practice guidelines related to ventilator liberation, some questions remain unanswered. Many of these questions relate to the details of bedside implementation. We, therefore, formed a guidelines committee of individuals with experience and knowledge of ventilator liberation as well as a medical librarian. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, we make the following recommendations: (1) We suggest that calculation of a rapid shallow breathing index is not needed to determine readiness for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) (conditional recommendation; moderate certainty); (2) We suggest that SBTs can be conducted with or without pressure support ventilation (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty); (3) We suggest a standardized approach to assessment and, if appropriate, completion of an SBT before noon each day (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); and (4) We suggest that F IO2 should not be increased during an SBT (conditional recommendation, very low certainty). These recommendations are intended to assist bedside clinicians to liberate adult critically ill patients more rapidly from mechanical ventilation.

### Indicators for ventilator use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^111C9Bku]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is being used up to continuously by patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Invasive and noninvasive tests are used to assess ventilatory function but there are few reports relating them to extent of ventilator dependence for which simple and cost effective parameters are needed.

Objective

To investigate the relative efficacy of noninvasive lung function parameters for determining extent of need for ventilator use.

Materials and Methods

83 DMD patients were divided into three groups: no ventilator use (asymptomatic) (n = 26) [Group 1], nocturnal ventilator use (symptomatic) (n = 20) [Group 2], and full-time ventilator dependence (n = 37) [Group 3]. Tidal volume (TV), vital capacity (VC), respiratory rate (RR), inspiratory time (Ti), respiratory cycle time (Ttot), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI [RR/TV]), breathing intolerance index (BITI), ventilator requirement index (VRI) and a new parameter RR/VC were monitored and compared. Data were analyzed with receiver-operating-characteristic curves (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.

Results

In group 2 and 3, patients used NIV for 3.3 ± 2.1 and 11.2 ± 4.7 years, respectively. By ROC comparison, RR/VC (RR/VC ≥ 0.024 [AUC, 0.921] and ≥ 0.071 [AUC, 0.935]), RR/TV (RR/TV ≥ 0.024 [AUC, 0.905] and ≥ 0.153 [AUC, 0.905]), and VC (VC ≤ 770 mL [AUC, 0.896] and ≤ 370 mL [AUC, 0.898]) represented to introduce nocturnal and continuous ventilator use, respectively. TV/VC, BITI, and VRI were either less sensitive or less specific.

Conclusions

Lung function parameters including RR/VC, RR/TV, and VC are useful and inexpensive in predicting the extent of need for ventilator use. Overall, RR/VC is the most appropriate predictor for determining extent of need for ventilator use.

### Flow index: a novel, non-invasive, continuous, quantitative method to evaluate patient inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation [^1163xdKV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Flow Index is a novel quantitative, continuous, non-invasive evaluation of the concavity of the inspiratory flow profile. Our study show that the Flow Index is associated with patient inspiratory effort during PSV and that it gives additional information when compared to the variables traditionally used for inspiratory effort evaluation during pressure support ventilation (i.e. V T, RR and RSBI). Additional research is needed to evaluate the potential impact of assessing the Flow Index on patient-ventilator interaction and weaning from mechanical ventilation.

### Predictive value analysis of diaphragmatic ultrasound evaluation for mechanical ventilation outcomes in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115268oi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diaphragmatic ultrasound indicators and LUS

During the ultrasound evaluation, two sets of measurements were recorded for exhalation time (Ti), DE, end-inspiratory diaphragm thickness (DTei), end-expiratory diaphragm thickness (DTee), and diaphragm displacement (DD). Additionally, the E-T index and the fraction of diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) were calculated.

The DE detection method involved displaying DE using M-mode ultrasound, performing three measurements, and calculating the average. DE was determined by subtracting the distance from the end-expiratory diaphragm to the baseline from the distance from the end-inspiratory diaphragm to the baseline. The E-T index was calculated as DE multiplied by Ti.

For DTF measurement, a linear array probe was placed perpendicular to the chest wall at the 8th intercostal space. The thickness of the diaphragm was measured at the end of exhalation and the end of expiration using B-mode and M-mode imaging. DTF was calculated with the formula: DTF = ((DTei - DTee)/DTee) x 100%, based on continuous measurements to obtain the average value. In normal individuals, the thickening index (DTF) ranges from 28 to 96%, whereas in those with diaphragmatic paralysis, it ranges from − 35 to 5%.

For both patient groups, tidal volume (VT) and spontaneous breathing rate (RR) were monitored using a ventilator. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) and the diaphragmatic Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (D-RSBI) were calculated as RSBI = RR/VT and D-RSBI = RR/DD, respectively.

The Lung Ultrasound Score (LUS) was determined as follows: A lung sliding sign with A lines or fewer than two individual B lines indicated a normal ventilation zone (N) and was scored as 0 points. Multiple typical B-lines signifying moderate reduced lung ventilation (B1 line) scored 1 point. Numerous fused B-lines indicating severe reduction in lung ventilation (B2 line) scored 2 points. Lung consolidation areas, characterized by tissue images with typical bronchial inflation signs, were scored as 3 points (C). The maximum possible score was 36 points, with higher scores correlating with increased severity of the disease.

Table 4 shows the correlation coefficients between diaphragmatic and conventional parameters. The TPIA dia was significantly correlated with TV and inversely correlated with the RSBI (Fig. 4). There were moderate correlations between TPIA dia and VC, diaphragmatic inspiratory excursion and RSBI, and diaphragmatic inspiratory excursion and TV. The RSBI was inversely related to all diaphragmatic ultrasound parameters. For example, the lower the RSBI, the longer the TPIA dia. There was no correlation between PI MAX and any diaphragmatic ultrasound parameters.

### Comparison of spontaneous breathing trials in clinical practice and current clinical practice guidelines [^113KWryx]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: The literature suggests there is variability in the clinical practice of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). Evidence-based literature and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been published over time to address various aspects of SBT implementation. It can take many years for evidence-based recommendations to be adopted into clinical practice. The American Association for Respiratory Care recently published a CPG addressing 4 aspects of SBT implementation. Methods: This study evaluated how the clinical practice of SBTs compares to the recommendations of the CPG. An online survey was developed to assess how hospitals with SBT protocols perform different components of SBTs. Descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis. Results: A total of 26 representatives from different health care institutions in the United States met the criteria for data analysis; 61.5% of reported protocols use rapid shallow breathing index, which is not in alignment with the current recommendation; 77% reported the use of pressure support (PS); 11.5% specified the use of a T-piece, and 11% specified the option of either PS or T-piece during the SBT. The responses were 100% in alignment with the current recommendation of performing a SBT with or without support; 73.1% aligned with having a standardized approach to performing SBTs by specifying when the SBT will be initiated; 65.4% perform an SBT during the day, though it was not specified if it occurs before noon each day; 53.8% allow for an increase in F IO2 during an SBT, which is not in alignment with the current recommendations. Conclusions: The reported hospitals' protocols demonstrated moderate alignment with the 4 CPG recommendations. Identifying current discrepancies between clinical practice and CPGs will allow for the assessment of the adoption of recommendations into clinical practice over time. Further assessment could be performed to determine if there is an impact on patient outcomes.

### Does taking endurance into account improve the prediction of weaning outcome in mechanically ventilated children? [^113Psoqr]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Weaning (or discontinuation) from mechanical ventilation is definitive cessation of mechanical ventilation and differs from extubation, which is removal of the endotracheal tube. Determining the optimal time at which to discontinue mechanical ventilation must not be based simply on clinical impression because weaning depends on multiple factors: central drive and peripheral nerves; mechanical respiratory loads, ventilatory muscle properties and gas exchange properties; and cardiac tolerance and peripheral oxygen demands. Premature weaning places the patient at risk for reintubation and airway trauma, whereas delayed weaning exposes them to risk for nosocomial infection and increases hospitalization costs. Indeed, 'the complexity of the decision to extubate provides a strong rationale for developing accurate predictors of extubation outcome'.

Extensive efforts have been made to identify predictors of successful weaning in adults as well as in children. The following indices were proposed by the Collective Task Force of the American College of Chest Physicians (TF) as the most promising weaning predictors: spontaneous respiratory rate, paediatric rapid shallow breathing (RSB), RSB occlusion pressure (ROP) and maximal inspiratory pressure during an occlusion test (Pi max). Although none of these predictors appears to be sufficiently sensitive or specific in predicting weaning success, paediatric studies have used integrated indices, including respiratory drive, respiratory load, muscle strength and quality of gas exchange.

Fatigue (for example, diminution of endurance) of the inspiratory muscles is defined as reduction in capacity to develop force and/or velocity of a muscle, which results from muscle activity under load and is reversible with rest. The two reference techniques for assessing endurance (for example, detecting fatigue) are analysis of the change in the electromyographic power spectrum and in the force response of muscles to electrical stimulation. Another approach uses the tension-time index (TTI) of the diaphragm, calculated from the mean transdiaphragmatic pressure, which correlates well with reference techniques. However, because determination of transdiaphragmatic pressure is invasive, noninvasive TTI estimated from the measurement of mouth occlusion pressure (P 0.1) and from the integral of the airway pressure curve over time during spontaneous ventilation were used as predictors of weaning success. Finally, Jabour and coworkers evaluated ventilatory endurance using a modified TTI, namely the pressure-time index (PTI), which was calculated from peak airway pressure during mechanical ventilation.

Lower diaphragm NMC was associated with lower diaphragm thickening fraction on the final day of the study (Fig. 5, p = 0.012). Lower diaphragm NMC was also associated with a higher rapid shallow breathing index during spontaneous breathing trials (Fig. 5, p = 0.013).

### Predictors of weaning failure in ventilated intensive care patients: a systematic evidence map [^115TP7aj]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator weaning is of great importance for intensive care patients in order to avoid complications caused by prolonged ventilation. However, not all patients succeed in weaning immediately. Their spontaneous breathing may be insufficient, resulting in extubation failure and the subsequent need for reintubation. To identify patients at high risk for weaning failure, a variety of potential predictors has already been examined in individual studies and meta-analyses over the last decades. However, an overview of all the predictors investigated is missing.

Aim

To provide an overview of empirically investigated predictors for weaning failure.

Methods

A systematic evidence map was developed. To this end, we conducted a systematic search in the Medline, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases in December 2023 and added a citation search and a manual search in June 2024. Studies on predictors for weaning failure in adults ventilated in the intensive care unit were included. Studies on children, outpatients, non-invasive ventilation, or explanatory factors of weaning failure were excluded. Two reviewers performed the screening and data extraction independently. Data synthesis followed an inductive approach in which the predictors were thematically analyzed, sorted, and clustered.

Results

Of the 1388 records obtained, 140 studies were included in the analysis. The 112 prospective and 28 retrospective studies investigated a total of 145 predictors. These were assigned to the four central clusters 'Imaging procedures' (n = 22), 'Physiological parameters' (n = 61), 'Scores and indices' (n = 53), and 'Machine learning models' (n = 9). The most frequently investigated predictors are the rapid shallow breathing index, the diaphragm thickening fraction, the respiratory rate, the P/F ratio, and the diaphragm excursion.

Conclusion

Predictors for weaning failure are widely researched. To date, 145 predictors have been investigated with varying intensity in 140 studies that are in line with the current weaning definition. It is no longer just individual predictors that are investigated, but more comprehensive assessments, indices and machine learning models in the last decade. Future research should be conducted in line with international weaning definitions and further investigate poorly researched predictors. Registration, Protocol: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.

### Prediction of ventilation weaning outcome: children are not little adults [^1124Fe93]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Prediction of ventilation weaning outcome in children is important, as unsuccessful extubation increases both morbidity and mortality. Adult weaning criteria are poor predictors of weaning outcome in children for several possible reasons: the length of mechanical ventilation is generally much shorter, and the weaning failure rate is lower in children (thus larger patient numbers are required); integrated weaning indices, such as the rapid shallow breathing index, do not account for normal developmental changes in respiratory function; and the heterogeneity of mechanically ventilated children is greater than in adults. The challenge remains to find universal weaning outcome predictors in children.

### Improvement in the prediction of ventilator weaning outcomes by an artificial neural network in a medical ICU [^113WzY3u]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Twenty-five to 40% of patients pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) but fail to wean from mechanical ventilation. There is no single appropriate and convenient predictor or method that can help clinicians to accurately predict weaning outcomes. This study designed an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting successful extubation in mechanically ventilated patients.

Methods

Ready-to-wean subjects (N = 121) hospitalized in medical ICUs were recruited and randomly divided into training (n = 76) and test (n = 45) sets. Eight variables consisting of age, reasons for intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, mean inspiratory and expiratory times, mean breathing frequency, and mean expiratory tidal volume in a 30-min SBT (pressure support ventilation of 5 cm H2O and PEEP of 5 cm H2O) were selected as the ANN input variables. The prediction performance of the ANN model was compared with the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), maximum inspiratory pressure, RSBI at 1 min (RSBI1) and 30 min (RSBI30) in an SBT, and absolute percentage change in RSBI from 1 to 30 min in an SBT (ΔRSBI30) using a confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in the test set of the ANN model was 0.83 (95% CI 0.69–0.92, P < .001), which is better than any one of the following predictors: 0.66 (95% CI 0.50–0.80, P = 0.04) for RSBI, 0.52 (95% CI 0.37–0.67, P = 0.86) for maximum inspiratory pressure, 0.53 (95% CI 0.37–0.68, P = 0.79) for RSBI1, 0.60 (95% CI 0.44–0.74, P = 0.34) for RSBI30, and 0.51 (95% CI 0.36–0.66, P = 0.91) for ΔRSBI30. Predicting successful extubation based on the ANN model of the test set had a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 73%, and an accuracy rate of 80%, with an optimal threshold of ≥ 0.5 selected from the training set.

Conclusions

The ANN model improved the accuracy of predicting successful extubation. By applying it clinically, clinicians can select the earliest appropriate weaning time.

### Electrical impedance tomography as a monitoring tool during weaning from mechanical ventilation: an observational study during the spontaneous breathing trial [^112oMdmD]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation is associated with poor clinical outcome. Therefore, choosing the right moment for weaning and extubation is essential. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising innovative lung monitoring technique, but its role in supporting weaning decisions is yet uncertain. We aimed to evaluate physiological trends during a T-piece spontaneous breathing trail (SBT) as measured with EIT and the relation between EIT parameters and SBT success or failure.

Methods

This is an observational study in which twenty-four adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation performed an SBT. EIT monitoring was performed around the SBT. Multiple EIT parameters including the end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI), delta Tidal Impedance (ΔZ), Global Inhomogeneity index (GI), Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI EIT), Respiratory Rate (RR EIT) and Minute Ventilation (MV EIT) were computed on a breath-by-breath basis from stable tidal breathing periods.

Results

EELI values dropped after the start of the SBT (p < 0.001) and did not recover to baseline after restarting mechanical ventilation. The ΔZ dropped (p < 0.001) but restored to baseline within seconds after restarting mechanical ventilation. Five patients failed the SBT, the GI (p = 0.01) and transcutaneous CO 2 (p < 0.001) values significantly increased during the SBT in patients who failed the SBT compared to patients with a successful SBT.

Conclusion

EIT has the potential to assess changes in ventilation distribution and quantify the inhomogeneity of the lungs during the SBT. High lung inhomogeneity was found during SBT failure. Insight into physiological trends for the individual patient can be obtained with EIT during weaning from mechanical ventilation, but its role in predicting weaning failure requires further study.

### Peripheral perfusion index as a predictor of reintubation in critically ill surgical patients [^111aZQAh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Eighty-nine patients were screened for eligibility, six patients were excluded for not fulfilling of the inclusion criteria, 21 patients failed during the SBT, and 62 patients were extubated. The number of patients needing reintubation was 12/62 (19%) with a median (quartiles) time to reintubation of 5 (4, 24) h from the extubation (Fig. 1). The causes of reintubation included respiratory failure (10/12 [83%]), hemodynamic instability (1/12 [8%]), and disturbed conscious level (1/12 [8%])

Patients in the reintubation group had higher heart rate and respiratory rate, and lower SpO 2, and PPI than those in the successful weaning group after extubation (Fig. 2). The multivariate analysis (including hemodynamic, respiratory data and PPI at 1 h postextubation) showed that low PPI and high respiratory rate were the independent predictors for reintubation (Table 2).

### Lung function accurately predicts hypercapnia in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114ybcsx]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), implementation of mechanical ventilation depends on sleep investigation and measurement of CO2 tension. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine which noninvasive lung function parameter best predicts nocturnal hypercapnia and diurnal hypercapnia in these patients.

Methods

According to transcutaneous CO2 (TcCO2) measurement, 114 DMD patients were classified into three groups: nocturnal hypercapnia (n = 38) [group N], diurnal hypercapnia (n = 39), despite nocturnal ventilation (group D), and 24-h normocapnia and spontaneous breathing (n = 37) [group S] as control. TcCO2 tension and lung function variables included vital capacity (VC) and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and breathing pattern variables included tidal volume (Vt) and respiratory rate (RR), measured at the time of group inclusion. The rapid and shallow breathing index (RSBI [RR/Vt]) and Vt/VC ratio were calculated. Areas under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were calculated for those parameters.

Results

Compared to group S, lung function was significantly worse in group N and group D. VC, RR, and RSBI distinguished group S from group N by ROC comparison. Cut-off values of VC ≤ 680 mL (ROC, 0.968), MIP ≤ 22 cm H2O (ROC, 0.928), and Vt/VC > 0.33 (ROC, 0.923) accurately discriminated group D from group N, but RSBI, RR, and Vt did not.

Conclusions

Lung function is useful to predict nocturnal hypercapnia in patients with DMD. Moreover, VC < 680 mL is very sensitive to predict daytime hypercapnia.

### Control of respiratory drive by extracorporeal COremoval in acute exacerbation of COPD breathing on non-invasive NAVA [^116V75HU]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

Data were collected and analyzed off-line as previously described. Mean values for peak Edi, peak airway inspiratory pressure (PIP), and expiratory tidal volume (Vt), breathing frequency, and minute ventilation were calculated for the whole period of each condition. Neuro-ventilatory efficiency (NVE) was calculated by dividing Vt by Edi as described before. Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) was calculated by dividing breathing frequency by tidal volume.

Continuous variables are reported as mean (± standard deviation). One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, unpaired t test, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed as appropriate. Further details on data analysis are given in the online data supplement.

### Electrical impedance tomography for predicting failure of spontaneous breathing trials in patients with prolonged weaning [^113vZYug]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The GI describes spatial heterogeneity within the lung, as could be shown in our study. During the T-piece trial, RR was slightly increased and — most probably — V T decreased. At least, the TIV is decreased by about 30%. Moreover, the GI was analyzed for predicting impending clinical impairment of patients in consequence of an SBT. It was found out that in patients with an initial GI > 41.5, an SBT should not be performed. By doing so, 87.5% of all SBT failures might be avoided. Although the respective specificity is just 60.9%, this procedure can be applied as a screening method and to support clinical decision making.

From a clinical point of view, a prediction of SBT failure in this particular patient group of prolonged weaning seems meaningful to avoid significant drawbacks. Interestingly, functional parameters of gas exchange or respiratory pattern were not different, as shown in Table 3. This finding may underline the relevance of EIT as a monitoring tool in SBTs, being more accurate than functional parameters of gas exchange.

TIV and ΔEELI are meaningful parameters to monitor success and impending failure, respectively, of the SBT because no ventilator data are available during this period. It could clearly be shown that TIV was reduced during the period of spontaneous breathing as a sign of enhanced respiratory fatigue with a consecutively reduced V T. At the same time, EELI was decreased, which might be associated with de-recruitment phenomena that were completely regressive after the SBT.

There is one specific limitation of our study. Within this observation, we examined one patient group that followed a standardized weaning protocol on the T-piece with a scheduled return to PSV. Although our patients showed a tendency toward respiratory fatigue (increase rapid shallow breathing), and although EIT showed significant results, the effects could have been more distinctive if "successful" patients had remained on the T-piece for longer periods. With EIT-derived measures such as the ΔEELI, the TIV, or the RSBI EIT, criteria for termination or extension could be defined to guide individual weaning procedures.

### The PROMIZING trial enrollment algorithm for early identification of patients ready for unassisted breathing [^11178hQW]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, our algorithm defined and separated the different phases of the MV process (i.e. acute, recovery, weaning and liberation phases), and proposed criteria for identifying patients in each phase (see Additional file 6: Fig. E1). In this way, the diagnosis of a possible liberation from MV could be assessed over a few hours. Currently, there is no consensus in the definition of the different phases, often leading to confusion. Using our algorithm, the acute phase corresponded to a non-controlled underlying disease, when patients may need full ventilator support (i.e. ACV). The recovery phase began with the switch to PSV (or proportional ventilation mode), allowing the patient to share the work of breathing. Moving to the weaning phase required meeting the general weaning criteria including a 2-min CPAP trial to assess the RSBI (conducted on zero PEEP) followed by a SBT if the ZERO CPAP tolerance trial was successful. Recently, Burns et al. showed a large heterogeneity of SBT techniques across the world. Our protocol proposed to perform an 30–120 min SBT on T-piece or CPAP at zero PEEP on the ventilator rather than a PSV using low level of pressure support in order to better simulate the physiologic conditions after extubation. Because usual criteria of successful SBT were subjective and depended on the clinician's interpretation, we provided easy to use criteria to define failure of each PSV, CPAP and T-piece trials.

Several limitations of this study need to be discussed. We did not record data regarding the cumulative dose and duration of sedative drugs received or the patient's fluid balance, which may influence the weaning process. Moreover, our algorithm did not include additional physiologic measurements, such as the airway occlusion pressure (P 0.1). Finally, in spite of broad and easy-to-assess enrollment criteria (especially concerning oxygenation: P a O 2 ≥ 60 mmHg on F i O 2 ≤ 60% and PEEP ≤ 15 cmH 2 O), the delay between intubation and the enrollment remained long (around 6 days). This finding may also represent an opportunity for improvement as patients could be enrolled earlier in the acute phase. Because a criterion to enroll patients in PROMIZING was an expected need of ventilation of at least 24 h, it is unlikely that clinicians would have conducted a weaning trial independent from the study screening protocol on the same day, suggesting that application of the screening algorithm assisted in identifying patients ready for weaning earlier than the clinicians suspected.

### Application of heart-rate variability in patients undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation [^114wnsxE]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Patients

During the study period, 135 patients were screened; 32 patients were excluded for various reasons (Figure 1). Two patients who had to resume ventilatory support within 30 minutes of SBT were also excluded from the analysis because HRV measurements could not be well conducted. Of the 101 analyzed patients, 77 (76%) and 24 (24%) patients had successful and failed SBT, respectively. The demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, comorbidities, causes of acute respiratory failure, and duration of mechanical ventilation before SBT were similar between patients with successful and those with failed SBT (Table 1). Patients experiencing failure of SBT were more likely to be placed on β 2 agonists and anticholinergics. Before SBT, no significant differences were found between the groups regarding weaning parameters, oxygenation, status and ventilator settings (Table 2).

### Predictive value analysis of diaphragmatic ultrasound evaluation for mechanical ventilation outcomes in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115vT2qy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations often necessitate mechanical ventilation. Weaning from ventilation poses challenges, especially due to diaphragmatic dysfunction. We evaluated the predictive value of diaphragmatic ultrasound for mechanical ventilation outcomes in COPD patients during acute exacerbations.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 200 patients experiencing acute COPD exacerbations between June 2020 and September 2023. We identified these patients using the ICD-10 codes for COPD (J44.x) and acute exacerbations from our electronic medical record system. Patients underwent diaphragmatic ultrasound assessments and were then grouped based on weaning success or failure. The study investigated parameters such as the E-T index, diaphragmatic displacement (DD), and diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF), correlating them with weaning outcomes. Correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were employed to ascertain predictive values.

Results

The E-T index, DD, and DTF were significantly higher in the success group, indicating these parameters as predictors of successful weaning. The E-T index (rho = -0.254, P < 0.001), DD (rho = -0.269, P < 0.001), and DTF (rho = -0.201, P = 0.004) negatively correlated with weaning failure. Conversely, the diaphragmatic Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (D-RSBI) positively correlated with failure (rho = 0.179, P = 0.011). Higher LUS scores predicted weaning failure (P = 0.029). Combined analysis of ultrasound indicators demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905, highlighting the model's predictive utility. Additional correlations showed that higher PaCO₂ before weaning was linked with lower DD, suggesting an association between impaired diaphragmatic mechanics and elevated CO₂ levels.

Conclusion

Diaphragmatic ultrasound was a valuable tool for assessing readiness for mechanical ventilation weaning in COPD exacerbations, enhancing the precision of clinical decisions. Our findings also suggest that a threshold E-T index of ∼1.915 and DTF of ∼42.475% may have clinical relevance in identifying successful weaners.

### Diaphragmatic ultrasound and its relationship to breathing effort and load: a prospective observational study [^1168dqFC]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present investigation, RSBI in weaning success patients, increased under IRL but it remained within normal limits (< 110 breaths/min/L), unlike in weaning failure patients. It is of note that some patients who failed weaning presented RSBI values below 110 breaths/min/L during spontaneous breathing, but RSBI increased significantly (p = 0.016) with the application of IRL. These findings may suggest that patients who are successfully weaned may have greater respiratory reserve, allowing them to tolerate resistive loading without a significant change in their breathing pattern.

To our knowledge, most studies evaluating the relationship between diaphragmatic ultrasound and breathing effort have been conducted in subjects under positive-pressure ventilation, which can confound diaphragmatic ultrasound measurements and alter their relationship with breathing effort. Additionally, diaphragmatic ultrasound exhibits high interpatient variability, and its correlation with breathing effort has been inconsistent across studies. To address these limitations, we conducted our study during an unassisted spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to eliminate the confounding effects of positive-pressure ventilation on diaphragm mechanics. To mitigate interpatient variability and focus on the intrapatient relationship between diaphragmatic ultrasound measurements and breathing effort, we employed repeated measures correlation, a statistical method designed to assess within-patient associations. Furthermore, the effect of an IRL on breathing mechanics has been studied mainly on healthy subjects. The application of such protocol in critical care patients may be challenging in terms of patient cooperation and clinical stability which are required for valid measurements. Moreover, the idea of applying a restive load during weaning might be perceived by physicians as a challenge which may induce respiratory muscle fatigue. Our rationale was that an IRL for a brief time (1 min) even though it may increase the breathing effort, it may be similar -if not less in magnitude- with a MIP maneuver of 30 s duration and may simulate a clinical scenario of increased resistive load to the respiratory system.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^112mcFQ4]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Preoxygenation in severe hypoxemia during rapid sequence intubation (RSI) — heterogeneous evidence signals potential benefit of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for desaturation prevention. None of the published studies directly evaluated FPS rate as an outcome, and there was significant heterogeneity in how success was reported. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the patient population that was included in the studies and in the severity of hypoxemia, making a global assessment difficult. The strongest evidence suggests that, in patients with the most severe hypoxemia that needs to be escalated to a noninvasive support modality for preoxygenation, NIPPV appears to decrease the incidence of critical desaturation during RSI.
