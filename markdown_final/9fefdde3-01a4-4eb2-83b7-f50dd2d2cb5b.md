## Question

Do coarsened interstitial lung markings and rales on physical examination indicate tuberculosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether coarsened interstitial lung markings on chest X-ray and rales on auscultation suggest pulmonary tuberculosis and how these should be interpreted within a diagnostic approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what these descriptors mean clinically and radiographically. Then, I should verify their association, if any, with TB phenotypes and contagiousness. Next, I will review guideline-backed diagnostic algorithms and imaging patterns that are more specific for TB. After that, I need to assess differential diagnoses and pretest probability modifiers that shift interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic approach, including when to isolate and what tests to order, grounding each step in high-credibility sources.

> Let me first confirm the terms. Coarsened interstitial lung markings on radiography generally reflect a reticular or reticulonodular pattern from thickening of the pulmonary interstitium; this is a descriptive — not diagnostic — label that often correlates with interstitial lung processes rather than granulomatous infection, while rales (crackles), particularly "Velcro-type" late-inspiratory crackles, are classically linked to fibrotic interstitial lung disease rather than TB per se [^1142Dzgf].

> Next, I should review whether rales correlate with TB contagiousness. Wait, let me verify the admission-screening data. High-credibility evidence shows that abnormal auscultation findings can raise suspicion of smear-positive, potentially contagious TB at presentation, warranting isolation pending microbiologic results; however, these findings are nonspecific and should be integrated with symptoms and imaging rather than used in isolation [^1149QsUq] [^113yrucQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about coarsened interstitial markings implying TB. I will now examine characteristic imaging features of pulmonary TB. Typical post-primary TB findings include upper-lobe–predominant infiltrates and cavitation, with CT "tree-in-bud" sign reflecting endobronchial spread; miliary TB produces innumerable 1–3 mm nodules but is a distinct pattern, whereas generic interstitial coarsening is not a classic TB signature, so I should be cautious about overattribution to TB based on that descriptor alone [^1149QsUq] [^115F7Apt].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could diffuse interstitial coarsening still be TB in disguise? Let me reconsider and double-check differentials. Interstitial coarsening and rales are highly nonspecific and commonly arise from fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, heart failure with interstitial edema, and atypical pneumonias; "Velcro-type" crackles in particular track with fibrotic ILD features on HRCT rather than TB, so I need to avoid anchoring bias toward TB unless other TB-concordant elements are present [^1142Dzgf].

> I need to check how screening tools perform in TB and whether a generic interstitial pattern helps. Chest radiography is sensitive as a screening tool for "any abnormality", but it lacks specificity; specificity improves when radiographs are classified as "suggestive of TB" based on typical patterns such as cavities or nodules, and coarsened interstitial markings are not counted among those "suggestive" patterns, reinforcing their nonspecificity in TB screening algorithms [^113kZ1tH] [^1168K54B].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic pathway recommended by guidelines. For symptomatic individuals at risk for TB, guidelines advise CXR when feasible and Xpert MTB/RIF as the preferred initial microbiologic test over smear where available; sputum induction is preferred if sputum is not readily obtained, with bronchoscopy reserved for specific indications such as nondiagnostic induced sputum or suspected miliary TB when no other site is accessible [^1147nurL] [^115pTAzg] [^116D1p1i] [^116udEm9].

> But wait, what if cough is absent? I should verify the prevalence of subclinical TB. A substantial fraction of bacteriologically confirmed TB identified in community surveys lacks persistent cough, so relying on symptoms alone can miss disease; in that context, an abnormal CXR can be the initial flag, although its nonspecificity mandates confirmatory microbiologic testing before labeling TB [^116BH3a4] [^113kZ1tH].

> Next, I should review setting-specific modifiers that sway interpretation. In populations with high burdens of silicosis or post-TB lung disease, CXR specificity for TB plummets, increasing false positives and unnecessary referrals; computer-aided CXR tools can assist triage but also show reduced specificity in those with prior TB changes, reminding me to lean on microbiology for confirmation in complex lungs [^112r1Zgh] [^112DL6Ga].

> I should confirm how radiography guides risk even when initial TB workup is negative. Among exposed but initially TB-free contacts, baseline abnormal CXR confers a markedly higher short-term risk of incident TB, especially in younger persons with fewer confounders, suggesting that the severity and pattern of radiographic abnormalities can inform follow-up intensity even when they are not diagnostic by themselves [^114G7F3W].

> Hold on, I should verify the synthesis before concluding. Coarsened interstitial lung markings and rales are not specific indicators of TB; rales can raise suspicion for contagious TB in the right clinical context, but neither finding should be used to confirm TB without supportive imaging features such as cavitation or tree-in-bud and, ultimately, microbiologic evidence by Xpert or culture, given the limited specificity of generic CXR abnormalities and the broad differential for interstitial patterns and crackles [^1149QsUq] [^113kZ1tH] [^1147nurL] [^1142Dzgf].

> Recommended clinical approach: Let me lay this out clearly and double-check each step. First, assess symptoms and epidemiologic risks and obtain a CXR when feasible; if the film shows TB-suggestive features or clinical suspicion remains, obtain Xpert MTB/RIF with sputum induction if needed and consider isolation while results are pending when contagious TB is plausible based on combined clinical, auscultatory, and imaging cues; if the CXR is nondiagnostic yet suspicion persists, proceed to CT for better characterization; simultaneously, evaluate alternative causes of interstitial changes such as ILD and heart failure, especially when "Velcro-type" crackles are present; finally, base TB diagnosis on microbiologic confirmation whenever possible to avoid misclassification driven by nonspecific radiographic descriptors [^114w9XTg] [^1147nurL] [^115atxPC] [^116D1p1i] [^1149QsUq].

No, coarsened interstitial lung markings and rales are **not specific for tuberculosis** [^1168K54B]; they are nonspecific findings that can occur in many pulmonary conditions, including TB [^1149QsUq], but also interstitial lung disease [^1142Dzgf], pneumonia, heart failure, and other infections. In TB, **more specific radiographic features** include upper lobe infiltrates [^114dF3N7], cavitation [^1138qPDk], and miliary nodules [^115F7Apt], while rales are nonspecific and may be absent or present in many lung diseases [^1142Dzgf]. Definitive TB diagnosis requires **microbiologic confirmation** (sputum smear, culture, or NAAT) [^1147nurL] and clinical correlation [^116udEm9]; these findings alone should prompt further evaluation but are not diagnostic [^114iqCuP].

## Radiographic features of pulmonary tuberculosis

Pulmonary tuberculosis has characteristic imaging findings [^114w9XTg]; however, coarsened interstitial markings are **not among the most specific or diagnostic findings**. The following features are **more commonly associated with TB**:

- **Upper lobe infiltrates**: Heterogeneous, poorly circumscribed opacities, often with cavitation, typically located in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes [^1138qPDk] [^114dF3N7].

- **Cavitation**: Common in post-primary TB [^114dF3N7], with cavities ranging from 10–30% of cases, often associated with bronchogenic dissemination [^1138qPDk].

- **Miliary nodules**: Numerous small (1–3 mm), uniformly distributed nodules throughout both lungs, characteristic of miliary TB [^115F7Apt].

- **Pleural effusion**: More common in primary TB, often associated with lymphadenopathy.

Coarsened interstitial markings, while occasionally present, are **nonspecific** and occur in many other pulmonary conditions, including interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^1174iaAc].

---

## Clinical significance of rales on physical examination

Rales (crackles) are **nonspecific** [^1142Dzgf] auscultatory findings reflecting fluid or fibrosis within the alveoli or interstitium. They are **commonly associated** with multiple pulmonary conditions, including:

- **Interstitial lung disease**: "Velcro-type" crackles are strongly associated with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (FILD) [^1142Dzgf] and specific radiologic features such as reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis.

- **Pneumonia**: Rales are frequently observed in bacterial and viral pneumonias, including atypical pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae [^111UBk1C].

- **Heart failure**: Pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure often presents with rales due to fluid accumulation in the alveoli.

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Chronic bronchitis and emphysema may present with rales due to chronic inflammation and mucus production.

In tuberculosis, rales are **nonspecific** and may be present or absent depending on disease stage and severity; they are not diagnostic [^1147nurL].

---

## Diagnostic approach to suspected tuberculosis

Given their nonspecificity, a **comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential** [^116udEm9] to confirm or exclude tuberculosis. The following steps are recommended:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history and physical examination, focusing on TB risk factors, symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss), and epidemiological context.

- **Chest radiography (CXR)**: Initial imaging modality [^114w9XTg] to identify characteristic TB findings (cavitation, upper lobe infiltrates, miliary nodules).

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Recommended if CXR is nondiagnostic [^115atxPC] or to further characterize lesions suggestive of TB.

- **Microbiological confirmation**: Sputum smear microscopy, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as Xpert MTB/RIF [^1147nurL] are essential for definitive diagnosis [^112kwjD1].

- **Bronchoscopy**: Considered if sputum samples are negative or unobtainable [^114YTuvt], particularly in suspected miliary TB [^116udEm9].

---

## Differential diagnosis of coarsened interstitial markings and rales

Given their nonspecificity, the **differential diagnosis includes** [^115dXSrh]:

| **Condition** | **Radiographic findings** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Tuberculosis | Cavitation, upper lobe infiltrates, miliary nodules | Cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss |
| Interstitial lung disease | Reticulation, honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis | Progressive dyspnea, dry cough, "Velcro" crackles |
| Pneumonia | Consolidation, interstitial infiltrates | Fever, productive cough, rales |
| Heart failure | Pulmonary edema, interstitial markings | Dyspnea, orthopnea, rales |
| COPD | Hyperinflation, bronchial wall thickening | Chronic cough, sputum production, wheezing, rales |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Coarsened interstitial lung markings and rales are **nonspecific**; while they may occur in tuberculosis, they are **not diagnostic** [^1147nurL]. These findings should prompt further evaluation — including chest radiography [^114w9XTg], CT imaging [^115atxPC], and microbiological confirmation [^112kwjD1] — to establish a definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis or an alternative pulmonary condition.

Our study provides valuable information about TB contagiosity. Haemoptysis, cough, weight loss, and abnormal auscultation findings can raise suspicion of contagious TB (AFB+), as well as cavitary lesions in CXR and CT, and a tree-in-bud sign in CT. These findings in the admission setting should prompt initial isolation of the patient.

CXR has a similar accuracy in detecting abnormal findings, while CT is more PTB-specific.

### "Velcro-type" crackles predict specific radiologic features of fibrotic interstitial lung disease [^1142Dzgf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

"Velcro-type" crackles on chest auscultation are considered a typical acoustic finding of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (FILD); however, whether they play a role in the early detection of these disorders remains unknown. This study investigated how "Velcro-type" crackles correlate with the presence of distinct patterns of FILD and individual radiologic features of pulmonary fibrosis on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

- **Methods**: Lung sounds were digitally recorded from subjects immediately prior to undergoing clinically indicated chest HRCT. Audio files were independently assessed by two chest physicians, and both full-volume and single HRCT sections corresponding to the recording sites were extracted. The relationships between audible "Velcro-type" crackles, radiologic HRCT patterns, and individual features of pulmonary fibrosis were investigated using multivariate regression models.

- **Results**: A total of 148 subjects were enrolled. Bilateral "Velcro-type" crackles predicted the presence of FILD at HRCT (OR 13.46, 95% CI 5.85–30.96, p < 0.001), most strongly predicting the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern (OR 19.8, 95% CI 5.28–74.25, p < 0.001). The extent of isolated reticulation (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.62–2.57, p < 0.001), honeycombing (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.24–2.83, p < 0.01), ground glass opacities (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29–2.32, p < 0.001), and traction bronchiectasis (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03–2.32, p < 0.05) were all independently associated with the presence of "Velcro-type" crackles.

- **Conclusions**: "Velcro-type" crackles predict the presence of FILD and directly correlate with the related radiologic patterns.

### Non-metastatic causes of multiple pulmonary nodules [^1138qPDk]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a major health problem in developing countries with inadequate public health facilities. In TB, the lung is most frequently affected. The clinical and radiological manifestations of pulmonary TB depend on whether the infection is primary or post-primary. Patients with either primary or post-primary TB are often asymptomatic. Those who are symptomatic exhibit constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. Additionally, progressive primary TB can affect immunocompromised patients. The characteristic histopathological feature of tissues infected with M. tuberculosis is necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, which comprises clusters of epithelioid histiocytes surrounding a central necrotic area. Within the granuloma, variable numbers of multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes may be present.

Radiological features vary with the type of infection. In primary TB, the initial focus can appear anywhere in the lung, manifesting as a millimetric focus or as a patchy lobar consolidation with no specific appearance. Cavitation is uncommon in primary TB. Post-primary TB often presents as heterogeneous, poorly circumscribed, and often cavitating opacities. Cavity size may reach up to several centimeters (10–30%). Lesions typically occur in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes and the superior segments of the lower lobes. Bronchogenic dissemination, a complication of tuberculous cavitation, usually presents as numerous ill-defined nodules.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^113kZ1tH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This review addresses tuberculosis screening among HIV-negative people and people with unknown HIV status (a proportion of whom may be HIV-infected). The risk of developing tuberculosis disease among the 38 million people living with HIV was 18 (range 15 to 21) times higher than in the rest of the global population [WHO 2020]. In resource-limited settings, tuberculosis disease is a common and often undiagnosed cause of death [Gupta 2015]. The sensitivity of sputum smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF is lower in HIV-infected individuals with presumed tuberculosis [Getahun 2007; Horne 2019]. Therefore, people living with HIV should be regularly and systematically screened for tuberculosis disease according to a clinical algorithm at each visit to a healthcare facility [WHO 2018].

In addition, people living with HIV who are unlikely to have active tuberculosis should be offered preventive treatment, regardless of their antiretroviral therapy (ART) status. Screening algorithms for people living with HIV have been defined based on other systematic reviews [Getahun 2011; Hamada 2018]. The recommended algorithm to rule out tuberculosis disease used to be the Four Symptom Screen, meaning the absence of any of the four symptoms: cough, fever, weight loss, or night sweats and, if available, absence of abnormal radiographic findings [Getahun 2011; WHO 2018].

The latest WHO guidelines recommend the Four Symptom Screen, C-reactive protein, chest X-ray (CXR), and molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests, depending on the kind of sub-population and availability of resources [WHO 2021].

Any CXR abnormality

Twenty-three studies contributed to this index test, of which all but three were conducted in the general population (see Figure 14). In total, 4,532 participants contributed to the estimation of sensitivity, which ranged between 70% and 100%. The most extreme values were in studies with smaller sample sizes and wider 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Specificity ranged from 71% to 99%, with contributions from 1,034,525 participants.

- **Summary of sensitivity and specificity**: The summary sensitivity was 94.7% (95% CI 92.2% to 96.4%; very low-certainty evidence due to a very serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency). The summary specificity was 89.1% (95% CI 85.6% to 91.8%; low-certainty evidence because of serious inconsistency and serious imprecision; see Figure 15 and Table 4). Specificity of the index test definition, including abnormalities in other visible organs, was 85.1% (95% CI 78.3% to 90.1%, n = 8). Specificity for pulmonary abnormalities only was 90.8% (95% CI 87.0% to 93.5%, n = 15). Note that the two definitions were not compared in the same studies. This index test definition was not a statistically significant modifier of specificity (P = 0.096; see Figure 15). Sensitivity did not differ between index test definitions (94.5% and 95.6%, respectively).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in relation to respiratory specimen collection, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering flexible bronchoscopic sampling in adult patients with suspected miliary tuberculosis. This applies when no alternative lesions are accessible for sampling, and if the induced sputum is AFB smear microscopy negative or a respiratory sample cannot be obtained via induced sputum.

### Official American Thoracic Society/infectious Diseases Society of America/centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical practice guidelines: Diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1138JD5d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

- **Methods**: A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### Imaging recommendations and algorithms for pediatric tuberculosis: Part 1-thoracic tuberculosis [^116EPJ1F]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health problem and is the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, behind the novel coronavirus disease 2019. Children are among the most vulnerable groups affected by TB, and imaging manifestations differ in children compared to adults. TB primarily involves the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Clinical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and various medical imaging tools are combined to establish the diagnosis.

Even though chest radiography is the accepted initial radiological imaging modality for evaluating children with TB, this paper, the first of two parts, aims to discuss the advantages and limitations of various medical imaging modalities. It also provides recommendations on which is most appropriate for the initial diagnosis and assessment of possible complications of pulmonary TB in children. Practical, evidence-based imaging algorithms are also presented.

### The performance of computer-aided detection digital chest X-ray reading technologies for triage of active tuberculosis among persons with a history of previous tuberculosis [^112ABSob]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Early tuberculosis (TB) case detection and treatment are global priorities to achieve the End TB strategy goals. To facilitate early TB case detection, highly sensitive, easy-to-use, and affordable TB screening and triage tools should be widely accessible to the most high-risk groups and in high-prevalence settings. Chest X-ray (CXR) presents an opportunity for high-throughput screening and triaging of patients and has higher sensitivity and specificity than symptom-based screening. There is widespread use of CXR in well-resourced settings. However, its scale-up in high-TB-burden, resource-constrained settings has been limited by a lack of staff with sufficient training to interpret CXRs.

Advances in digital radiography and computer-aided detection (CAD) for reading CXRs now make it easier to rapidly and reliably interpret CXRs; CAD has similar or higher performance to human readers. Additionally, digital CXR (dCXR) CAD has been demonstrated to be scalable and sustainable in high-burden settings.

World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for systematic screening for TB disease now recommend CAD as an alternative to human readers. Computer-aided detection uses lung shape and texture analysis to determine the likelihood of TB. CXRs are assigned a numerical score ranging from 1 to 100 (or 0–1), with higher scores representing a greater likelihood of TB-associated abnormalities. When CAD systems are used for screening/triage, it is recommended that the user sets a threshold — a dichotomous score for classifying cases.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115pTAzg]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically in relation to indications for testing, the ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining Xpert MTB/RIF testing, where available, instead of sputum microscopy. This is advised for patients with a cough and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis who are at high risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Such risks include a prior history of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, contacts with drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, and/or residing in countries with high drug-resistant tuberculosis prevalence. Additionally, obtain sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing, and a chest X-ray when feasible and where resources allow.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in all patients aged 5 years and older meeting the following criteria:

- **Likely to be infected**: With Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- **Risk of disease progression**: Low or intermediate.
- **Testing warranted**: It has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted.

### Maintaining sharp focus on a grainy film: Miliary pattern in an elderly woman with acute respiratory failure [^113Dhyst]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

An elderly woman with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, reportedly diagnosed and treated 30 years prior to presentation, was found unresponsive at home. Chest imaging revealed innumerable pulmonary nodules, worrisome for an infectious process, specifically tuberculosis. The patient deteriorated rapidly, and in accordance with her wishes, aggressive interventions were withheld. She died within 48 hours from respiratory failure. A limited chest autopsy was performed, revealing the cause of death as lymphangitic spread of cancer from a primary lung adenocarcinoma.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^1168K54B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

CXR index tests were the most sensitive screening tools. The summary sensitivity for any CXR abnormality (23 studies) was 94.7% (95% CI 92.2% to 96.4%; very low-certainty evidence) and was 84.8% (95% CI 76.7% to 90.4%; low-certainty evidence) for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis (19 studies). The specificity was 89.1% (95% CI 85.6% to 91.8%; low-certainty evidence) and 95.6% (95% CI 92.6% to 97.4%; high-certainty evidence), respectively. The presence of heterogeneity reduced the certainty of evidence more significantly for sensitivity than for specificity and could be partly explained by regional variation. In studies conducted in the African WHO region, sensitivity was lower compared to other regions combined, although specificity remained consistent. This variation is likely due to differences in regional distributions of modifying factors such as the prevalence of smoking, age distribution, tuberculosis prevalence among study populations, and possibly the availability of medical specialists to interpret CXRs.

Parallel combinations of CXR and symptom questions (25 studies) showed heterogeneous definitions but similar sensitivities and specificities (informal comparison; certainty of evidence not assessed). The addition of cough symptoms lasting ≥ 2 weeks, whether to any (pulmonary) CXR abnormality or to tuberculosis suggestive CXR abnormalities, resulted in a similar summary sensitivity and specificity: 99.2% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.8%) and 84.9% (95% CI 81.2% to 88.1%) (n = 15).

Our summary estimates of sensitivity for all index tests should be interpreted with great caution. As shown in our sensitivity analyses, it may have limitations in certain contexts.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^116W38HC]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Establishing the presence of symptoms or signs of TB is a trade-off between sensitivity (identifying as many individuals with potential TB) and specificity (avoiding overdiagnosing this dimension), as highlighted by the complementary use of CXR in TB prevalence surveys. Widely used screening tools, such as the presence of a cough or the WHO 4-symptom screen, are known to omit certain symptoms or signs that people may report if asked. Even when present, a symptom or sign may not be reported by the individual, highlighting the difference between subclinical and asymptomatic states. The optimal approach to assessing TB symptoms or signs will also depend on the setting (research, screening programme, clinical care) and goal in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Key research priorities were identified during discussions and further developed during topic-specific workshops. Priority areas include diagnosis, interventions for treatment and prevention, defining the individual (morbidity and mortality) and population (transmission and incidence) benefits of intervening during subclinical and non-infectious clinical TB states, and challenges for programmatic implementation. Such research efforts will help with the further operationalisation of the disease dimensions (macroscopic pathology, infectiousness, and symptoms or signs), including establishing diagnostic thresholds. Where possible, this also involves quantifying the non-linearity (how quickly individuals move in and out of disease states) as well as enabling broader consultations.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^1171jz2u]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality for thousands of years. Despite the availability of a vaccine for over 100 years and drugs for over 75 years, TB remains the leading cause of death globally from an infectious disease. TB has a complex natural history and pathogenesis which is still incompletely understood. A minority of people exposed and considered infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) progress to disease. The incubation period is variable, with highly heterogeneous disease presentation and progression pathways. Faced with this complexity, a simplifying framework has value in helping to guide and communicate the public health approach, management, and scientific investigation of TB. Periodically, the nature of the framework inevitably must evolve, reflecting new scientific understanding, tools for diagnosis and intervention, and public health priorities.

The development of curative antibiotic treatment from the late 1940s resulted in a radical change in the approach to managing TB and led to a shift in approach to disease classification. Prior to this period, TB was recognized as a dynamic process, with prognostic stratification by disease extent on chest X-ray (CXR) and the precise classification of disease state (arrested, quiescent, active, etc). This approach was abandoned and, in its place, a simple binary paradigm of latent infection and active disease emerged. The diagnosis of disease increasingly focused on microbiological confirmation as a prerequisite for receiving curative treatment. Infection was…

### Diagnostic accuracy of an integrated respiratory guideline in identifying patients with respiratory symptoms requiring screening for pulmonary tuberculosis: a cross-sectional study [^116mqvRG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Symptoms predictive of tuberculosis were assessed in this study. The most common symptoms in patients proven to have TB were cough (100%), difficult breathing (70%), new sputum production (63%), loss of weight (50%), and night sweats (50%).

- **Predictive symptoms**: Three clinical features independently predicted the diagnosis of TB, which were, in decreasing order: pleuritic chest pain, weight loss, and night sweats. The presence of all three increased the likelihood of TB by 17 times compared to when none were present.

- **Diagnostic features**: Features associated with the diagnosis of suspected TB by the respiratory physicians included haemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, previous TB, pleuritic chest pain, absence of difficulty breathing, and absence of wheeze. The presence of all seven increased the likelihood of the respiratory physicians diagnosing TB by 594-fold.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^114mnVks]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and estimation of risk in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) remains a major clinical and global health challenge. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection reflects a continuum between LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI is the most common form of Mtb infection, affecting one-quarter of the world's population and killing approximately 2,000,000 people every year. Immunocompetent individuals with LTBI have a 5–10% risk of developing active TB during their lifetime, most commonly within the first two years after exposure. Treatment of LTBI is effective in reducing the risk of developing subsequent active TB disease, but identifying patients most at risk of developing active TB and ensuring successful LTBI treatment remain significant challenges.

Available laboratory tests for the detection of LTBI have serious diagnostic limitations, including a poor predictive value (< 5%) for identifying subjects with LTBI who will actually develop active TB. Tuberculin skin testing and IFN-γ release assays can detect cell-mediated immune reactivity in Mtb infection. However, none of these tests can differentiate LTBI from active TB, nor can they distinguish between those who achieve subsequent bacterial clearance and/or effective infection containment and others who have silent and persistent infection at high risk to develop TB. Therefore, improvements in TB diagnostics are urgently needed not only to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of Mtb infection detection but also to more accurately determine the risk of progression or reactivation into active disease.

### Accuracy of chest X-ray screening of silica-exposed miners for tuberculosis [^112r1Zgh]. Occupational Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends systematic chest X-ray (CXR) screening for tuberculosis (TB) in silica-exposed workers. However, evidence on the accuracy of CXR screening in such populations is lacking.

- **Aims**: To measure the accuracy of CXR screening for active TB in silica-exposed miners in a population with a high prevalence of silicosis, post-TB lung disease, and HIV.

- **Methods**: A secondary analysis of data from a miner screening programme in Lesotho was undertaken. We measured the performance of CXR (in participants with and without cough) for 'abnormalities suggestive of TB' against Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). The sample size was 2,572 and positive Xpert prevalence was 3%.

- **Results**: CXR alone had high sensitivity (0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–0.99), but low specificity (0.41, 95% CI 0.39–0.42). Requiring cough and a positive CXR increased specificity (0.79, 95% CI 0.77–0.81), resulting in reduced sensitivity (0.41, 95% CI 0.30–0.52). There was no difference in CXR accuracy by HIV status. However, specificity was markedly reduced in the presence of silicosis (from 0.70, 95% CI 0.68–0.72, to 0.03, 95% CI 0.02–0.04) or past TB history (from 0.59, 95% CI 0.56–0.62, to 0.27, 95% CI 0.25–0.29). Throughout, positive predictive value remained very low (5%) and negative predictive value very high (99%).

- **Conclusions**: CXR screening accurately identifies TB-negative CXRs in this population, but post-TB lung disease and silicosis would result in a high proportion of Xpert-negative referrals and an increased risk of unnecessary empirical treatment.

### Prevalence of subclinical pulmonary tuberculosis in adults in community settings: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^116BH3a4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical pulmonary tuberculosis, which presents without recognizable symptoms, is frequently detected in community screenings; however, the disease category is poorly clinically defined. We explored the prevalence of subclinical pulmonary tuberculosis according to different case definitions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis of nationally representative surveys. These surveys were conducted in countries with high incidence of tuberculosis between 2007 and 2020 and reported the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis based on chest x-ray and symptom screening in participants aged 15 years and older. Screening and diagnostic criteria were standardized across the surveys, and tuberculosis was defined by positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis sputum culture. We estimated proportions of subclinical tuberculosis for three case definitions: no persistent cough (i.e. duration ≥ 2 weeks), no cough at all, and no symptoms (i.e. absence of cough, fever, chest pain, night sweats, and weight loss), both unadjusted and adjusted for false-negative chest x-rays and uninterpretable culture results.

- **Findings**: We identified 34 surveys, of which 31 were eligible. Individual participant data were obtained and included for 12 surveys (620,682 participants) across eight countries in Africa and four in Asia. Data on 602,863 participants were analyzed, of whom 1,944 had tuberculosis. The unadjusted proportion of subclinical tuberculosis was 59.1% (n = 1,149/1,944; 95% CI 55.8–62.3) for no persistent cough and 39.8% (773/1,944; 36.6–43.0) for no cough of any duration.

### Identification of post-tuberculosis lung function impairment early during the course of treatment [^112EegVE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and an important contributory factor to chronic lung disease. TB-associated permanent lung damage manifests with varying levels of respiratory disability long after TB has been successfully treated, which is a condition known as post-TB lung disease (PTLD). This study assessed whether lung function impairment associated with PTLD occurs early during TB treatment.

Using a cross-sectional design, we enrolled newly diagnosed adult TB patients aged ≥ 18 years who had received anti-TB medication for ≥ 2 months from a large treatment center in northern Nigeria. We used spirometry and the Global Lung Initiative 2012 reference equations for African Americans to assess and characterize lung function for enrolled participants (N = 94). The median age (range) of participants was 34 (18–72) years. Approximately 5.3% (n = 5) of participants exhibited features of abnormal lung function, 4.2% (n = 4) showed features of obstructive lung abnormality, and 1.1% (n = 1) showed restrictive lung abnormality. Compared with historical patients recruited ≥ 6 months after TB treatment in the same center, our participants had significantly lower forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity values. Our findings suggest an opportunity for early intervention for primary and secondary prevention of PTLD to reduce the impact of severe respiratory impairment.

### Imaging recommendations and algorithms for pediatric tuberculosis: part 2-extrathoracic tuberculosis [^113yiVuX]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment in recent years, tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern. Children are among the most vulnerable groups affected by this disease. Although TB primarily involves the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes, it can affect virtually any organ system of the body. Along with clinical history combined with physical examination and laboratory tests, various medical imaging tools help establish the diagnosis. Medical imaging tests are also helpful for follow-up during therapy, to assess complications, and to exclude other underlying pathologies.

This article aims to discuss the utility, strengths, and limitations of medical imaging tools in the evaluation of suspected extrathoracic TB in the pediatric population. Imaging recommendations for the diagnosis will be presented, along with practical and evidence-based imaging algorithms, to serve as a guide for both radiologists and clinicians.

### Clinical and imaging factors that can predict contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis [^1159anxP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Knowledge on predicting pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) contagiosity in the hospital admission setting is limited. The objective was to assess clinical and radiological criteria to predict PTB contagiosity.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of 7 clinical, 4 chest X-ray (CXR), and 5 computed tomography (CT) signs in 299 PTB patients admitted to an urban tertiary hospital from 2008 to 2016. If the acid-fast bacilli stain was positive (AFB+) on admission, the case was considered high contagiosity.

- **Results**: The best predictors for high PTB contagiosity (AFB+) were haemoptysis (OR 4.33), cough (3.00), weight loss (2.96), cavitation in CT (2.75), cavitation in CXR (2.55), tree-in-bud sign in CT (2.12), German residency of the patient (1.89), and abnormal auscultation findings (1.83). A previous TB infection statistically reduced the risk of contagiosity (0.40). Radiographic infiltrates, miliary picture, and pleural effusion were not helpful in predicting high or low contagiosity. 34% of all patients were clinically asymptomatic (20% of the highly contagious group, 50% of the low contagious group).

- **Conclusion**: Haemoptysis, cough, and weight loss, as well as cavitation and tree-in-bud sign in CXR/CT, can be helpful to predict PTB contagiosity and improve PTB management.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^113xSjTB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

We had fewer concerns about the applicability of the included studies to the review question compared to concerns about bias. The applicability of the definition of the target condition was a possible concern in 15% (CXR) to 30% (symptoms) of studies. The target condition of tuberculosis screening in this review was bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis, for which we allowed as a reference standard any author‐defined combination of mycobacterial culture (on solid or liquid medium), sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF, or other NAATs, but also required some evidence of active tuberculosis disease, like symptoms, CXR abnormalities, or bacteriological confirmation on repeated sputum samples.

Inclusion of cases defined on clinical grounds only implied an applicability concern, as well as inclusion of cases on the basis of a single positive sputum culture at one point in time without any symptom or CXR abnormality. As an illustration of the latter: in one study from which data for different case definitions could be extracted, of 14 cases as defined by the study, only seven cases met the case definition that was applicable to the review.

A few studies applied more stringent clinical and microbiological follow‐up procedures for individuals with one positive culture result, which may better reflect the tuberculosis disease spectrum and the clinical reality in which diagnosing tuberculosis disease with certainty can be challenging.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111Ld5UW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is an important infectious cause of morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide. In 2019, there were an estimated 10 million new cases of tuberculosis disease, with 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths among HIV‐negative people and an additional 208,000 deaths among people living with HIV infection (WHO 2020). An estimated one‐quarter of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the microorganism that causes tuberculosis.

In humans, M. tuberculosis infection typically affects the lungs, though it can affect other sites, and spreads by airborne transmission. Patients with infectious tuberculosis spread bacilli, most commonly through coughing. After initial infection, approximately 5% to 10% of infected people develop tuberculosis disease, also called active tuberculosis. Between 90% to 95% of infected people develop a tuberculosis infection, which may reactivate at a later stage, especially in the presence of conditions that affect immunity, including HIV infection, undernutrition, and old age.

It can take months to years for people to develop symptomatic and bacteriologically detectable tuberculosis. Tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease are increasingly seen as two ends of a continuous spectrum. In between these are early disease states that may be described as incipient tuberculosis and subclinical tuberculosis. In the absence of diagnosis and treatment, people with tuberculosis disease may be infectious for prolon.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering a tuberculin skin test rather than an IGRA in healthy pediatric individuals under 5 years old if it has been determined that diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117TAnNC]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically related to the indications for testing, the ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a chest X-ray (CXR) where resources allow. This is particularly recommended for patients with a cough, with or without fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, and/or weight loss, who are at risk of pulmonary tuberculosis in high tuberculosis prevalence countries.

### Official American Thoracic Society/infectious diseases society of America/centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: Diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1177QJon]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

- **Methods**: A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### Clinical characteristics of active tuberculosis diagnosed after starting treatment for latent tuberculosis infection [^112FUU3u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Although rare, subclinical tuberculosis disease can be missed during evaluations for latent tuberculosis infection and can manifest with symptoms during latent tuberculosis treatment. Among over 8000 patients treated for latent tuberculosis, we found no evidence of acquired drug resistance, underscoring the safety of rifampin monotherapy for latent tuberculosis.

### Chest radiograph screening for detecting subclinical tuberculosis in asymptomatic household contacts, Peru [^114G7F3W]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we found that among persons over 15 years of age who were exposed to TB at home, those who were initially deemed TB-free but had an abnormal baseline chest radiograph had a 15-fold higher risk for incident TB developing during 12 months of follow-up than did persons with an unremarkable radiograph. This finding was more pronounced in household contacts with no TB history and in younger participants, who were less likely to have residual abnormalities on radiograph from past TB or other comorbidities. Our findings remained unaltered in multivariate models when we further adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, as well as history of comorbidity. Among young persons with abnormal radiographs who were initially deemed TB-free at baseline, incident TB developed in 50% during follow-up. The severity grade of radiograph abnormalities was a strong indicator of an early-state TB trajectory in young persons.

Although numerous investigators have examined the use of chest radiography in screening for clinically apparent TB, few have evaluated whether abnormal radiographs could help identify early TB. The idea of using chest radiograph examination for incipient pulmonary TB was first proposed by Dr. Francis Williams, the father of chest radiology in the United States, in 1899. Chest radiography for mass screening and active case-finding for pulmonary TB was recommended by the New York City Health Department in the United States as early as the 1920s–1930s and was widely implemented in industrialized countries in the 1940s–1960s, contributing to the success.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111XhvVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for the early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease, which can reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission, while improving equity in access to care. Questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have historically been the most widely available tools to screen for tuberculosis disease. Their accuracy is critical for the design of tuberculosis screening programs and determines, in combination with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, the yield of a screening program and the burden on individuals and the health service.

- **Objectives**: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools. These tools aim to detect bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are eligible for systematic screening. Additionally, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially in relation to regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms and consulted experts for unpublished reports for the period from 1992 to 2018. The search date was 10 December 2018, and this search was repeated on 2 July 2021.

### XpertMTB/RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance [^114Pn31H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Before a specimen is tested with Xpert, patients presumed to have extrapulmonary TB would have undergone a health examination, including history, physical examination, and possibly a chest radiograph. The presentation of extrapulmonary TB varies depending on the body site affected, and it may imitate other diseases such as cancer, bacterial, and fungal infections. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary TB are often non‐specific and may include fever, night sweats, fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss (as seen in pulmonary TB) or specific complaints related to the involved site (e.g. headache for TB meningitis, back pain for TB of the spine). The clinical presentation of extrapulmonary disease may be acute but is more often subacute (falling between acute and chronic) or chronic, meaning that patients may have symptoms for days to months before they seek care.

- **Signs and symptoms**: The signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary TB are detailed in Table 6, which is included in this review. A clinician should take a careful history, noting any history of TB exposure, prior TB disease, and medical conditions that increase the risk for TB disease (e.g. HIV, diabetes mellitus, low body weight). Compared to HIV‐negative individuals, HIV‐positive individuals have higher rates of extrapulmonary TB or mycobacteremia (TB bloodstream infection). For HIV‐positive patients with signs or symptoms of extrapulmonary TB, specimens should be taken from the suspected sites of involvement to increase the likelihood of TB diagnosis. In general, children and adults with extrapulmonary TB present in a similar way. However, the text continues with further details on clinical presentation.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114cSrbV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Investigations of heterogeneity revealed several statistically significant modifiers of sensitivity and specificity at both study-level and participant-level characteristics. For both chest X-ray (CXR) index tests, sensitivity was lower in studies conducted in the African region compared to other regions, although specificity was not affected by geographic location. In studies with lower tuberculosis prevalence, the sensitivity of both CXR index tests decreased while specificity increased. Notably, this sensitivity reduction was statistically significant for any CXR abnormality, and the specificity increase was significant only for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis.

Further breakdown showed that sensitivity of any CXR abnormality diminished in studies with a lower smoking prevalence and in populations with a younger average age; however, specificity did not vary. Although sensitivity for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis was also lower in studies with lower smoking prevalence, this was not statistically significant. The categorical variables demonstrated significant overlap, particularly in the "any CXR abnormality" group, where studies from outside Africa had higher median or mean age (P = 0.04) and smoking prevalence (P = 0.005) compared to African studies. Additionally, the median or mean age, tuberculosis prevalence, and smoking were correlated (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, P = 0.05 respectively). Among the CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis group, there is evidence that higher age and smoking prevalence categories are interrelated.

### Impact of age and radiographic presentation on the presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^114BiLwr]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We compared the delay in presumptive diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) between elderly and younger patients. The study examined the yield of diagnosis and whether this yield is influenced by radiographic presentation, even when PTB was suspected. The time from first complaints to first consideration of PTB was termed the suspicion interval (SI), and the time from first consideration to diagnosis was termed the recognition interval (RI). Presumptive diagnosis was defined as positive staining for acid-fast bacilli or the presence of granulomatous lesions in pulmonary specimens.

In both elderly and younger patients, the mean SI was 111.1 days and 87.8 days, respectively (P = NS), and the mean RI was 5.9 days and 8.3 days, respectively (P = NS). The mean RI was longer for uncharacteristic compared to characteristic radiographic findings in both elderly (8.2 days vs. 4.6 days; P = 0.007) and younger patients (10.6 days vs. 3.9 days; P = 0.0001). A diagnosis was obtained in 89 out of 113 elderly (79%) and in 109 out of 138 younger (79%) patients (P = NS). Additionally, a diagnosis was achieved in 59 out of 80 (73%) patients with uncharacteristic findings and in 139 out of 170 (82%) patients with characteristic findings (P = NS).

In patients with characteristic findings, sputum contributed to 66% of diagnosis, whereas it was only 31% in patients with uncharacteristic findings (P < 0.005). In elderly patients with uncharacteristic radiographic findings, diagnosis was obtained from sputum in 41% of cases and from other specimens in 35% (P = NS); in the younger group, diagnosis was obtained from sputum in 23% and from other specimens in 48% (P < 0.05). In conclusion, there was no significant difference in SI and RI between elderly patients as compared to younger patients.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^116Jg2Yp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms, or symptom combinations, or both; chest X-ray (CXR); and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in people considered eligible for tuberculosis screening who are HIV-negative or whose HIV status is unknown, this study was conducted.

- **Secondary objectives**: To investigate heterogeneity, as far as data allow, in relation to:
	- **Background epidemiology**: Prevalence of tuberculosis and of HIV among the study population
	- **Risk groups targeted**: For example, migrants, occupational groups, prisoners, or the general population
	- **Reference standard**: Culture, Xpert MTB/RIF, sputum smear microscopy
	- **Screen test definition**
	- **Representativeness of the study design and study population** for intended screening practice
	- **Demographic characteristics of study participants**: Age, sex
	- **Geographic area and economic region**

We did not intend to make a formal comparison of the accuracy of screening tests as part of this review. As part of a WHO tuberculosis screening guideline development and update, diagnostic algorithms composed of screening and diagnostic methods were compared in decision models (van't Hoog 2014a), and an update of this modelling study will be part of the updated screening guidelines (WHO 2021a).

### Subclinical tuberculosis disease-a review and analysis of prevalence surveys to inform definitions, burden, associations, and screening methodology [^112zwa9X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis disease (TB) remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in the world. Not all individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB will present with or be aware of (clinical) symptoms. When presenting to TB services, this asymptomatic yet infectious group is usually missed since access to care mostly relies on positive symptom screening to initiate the TB diagnostic pathway. Individuals with so-called subclinical TB could therefore continue to contribute to transmission, hindering global TB care and prevention efforts.

While the importance of the subclinical TB subpopulation is recognized, a clear definition has not been agreed upon. Both "asymptomatic" and "bacteriologically confirmed" are inherently ambiguous. The extent and duration of symptoms used for screening will change the proportion of cases that have a positive symptom screening. Similarly, the extent of bacteriological examination, such as the number of samples or the technique used, will alter the proportion that will be bacteriologically confirmed.

To enable progress, we propose to define asymptomatic and bacteriologically confirmed TB as determined by TB prevalence surveys. These are population-based surveys that investigate representative samples of the population to estimate the national prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed adult pulmonary TB. Through X-ray and symptom screening, individuals become eligible for sputum investigation with Xpert and/or culture. While some variation remains, prevalence surveys can provide comparable measurements for the majority.

### Simple tuberculosis screening tool using signs, symptoms, and risk factors to reduce the missed opportunity in the older population [^112U1cLb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The control of TB in the elderly remains a major challenge due to limitations in the existing tools for diagnosing and treating latent TB infection and clinically active disease. There is growing concern about how to increase TB case detection, especially among older adults in low and middle-income countries. Sputum smear microscopy remains the mainstay of diagnosis. However, the difficulty in collecting quality sputum and the atypical or lack of classical TB symptoms in the elderly have led to TB cases being left undetected through the healthcare system. These represent missed opportunities for earlier TB diagnosis, leading to delayed treatment initiation and the continued spread of MTB in the community.

Several studies have developed a TB sign and symptoms screening tool (TB-SS screening test) using indicators such as cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, chest pain, fever, night sweats, and shortness of breath. The TB-SS screening test serves as the first step for TB case finding, with those who screen positive recommended to undergo a chest X-ray (CXR) and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum examinations. Using signs and symptoms as an independent screening tool remains a global challenge due to its relatively low accuracy. However, it can still be valuable when used in a specific target population.

The study aims to develop a simple TB screening tool that can be used in a resource-poor setting using a simple checklist questionnaire. This tool is different from previous ones as it utilizes a dual decision rule consisting of selected indicators.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114iqCuP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In the guidelines on tuberculosis screening developed by WHO and partners, systematic screening for tuberculosis disease is defined as "the systematic identification of people with presumed tuberculosis disease, in a predetermined target group, using tests, examinations, or other procedures which can be applied rapidly" (WHO 2013). Screening tests sort out apparently well people who probably have a disease from people who probably do not and are not intended to be diagnostic. People with positive or suspicious findings must be referred for diagnosis and necessary treatment. Screening is offered systematically to predetermined groups, and not only in response to a specific request or complaint by an individual seeking care. While it often refers to screening outside of health facilities, it can be offered to those who seek health care (with or without signs and symptoms compatible with tuberculosis) and those who do not. The two main goals of systematic screening for tuberculosis disease are better health outcomes for people with tuberculosis, through earlier detection and treatment, and more effective reduction of tuberculosis transmission and incidence through shortening the average duration of tuberculosis infectiousness.

This review focused on symptom and chest radiography (CXR) screening. For symptom screening, individuals are questioned about the presence of one or more symptoms considered suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis, which are respiratory symptoms.

### Clinical and imaging factors that can predict contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis [^113yrucQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Preventing aerogenous transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a clinical setting requires significant logistical, personal, and financial resources to ensure the isolation of the patient until a diagnosis is made. Over-protection may lead to a waste of resources, while insufficient protection endangers fellow patients and hospital personnel. If there is no suspicion of TB on admission, it takes an average of 3.3 days for a patient to be isolated, during which time 41 members of hospital staff may be exposed to the patient.

Fast and reliable identification, isolation of individuals under evaluation, and initiation of treatment are crucial for preventing TB transmission. Patients with potentially transmittable PTB must be isolated until they are deemed non-contagious, ideally confirmed by negative microbiological parameters. The decision to isolate should be made during the initial contact with an admitting physician, whether in the admissions department, walk-in clinic, emergency department, or a doctor's office. At this point, only epidemiological, clinical, radiological features, and medical history are available, as microbiological (sputum) assays are still being processed.

While the staining and microscopy of sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) can be completed within hours, the entire process may take days depending on the facility's microbiological laboratory logistics. TB cultures require weeks to complete. Currently, there is no reliable point-of-care test for TB, and PCR testing usually necessitates additional time, posing challenges in promptly addressing the transmission risk.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111ApEth]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

**Results of the search**: The electronic database search identified 9,473 titles and abstracts. Through expert consultation, we identified 31 reports on national tuberculosis prevalence surveys as eligible for inclusion (of which eight were already captured in the search of the electronic databases). We identified 957 potentially relevant articles through reference checking. After removing duplicates, we assessed 10,415 titles and abstracts and identified 430 (4%) for full-text review. In the full-text assessment, 364 articles were excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion were that the study design did not allow evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test, usually because one screening method was used (often symptoms) and only screen positives were further evaluated by a reference standard. In 175 (48%) publications, the data required to construct a diagnostic two-by-two table were not or were insufficiently reported. In total, 66 publications and reports provided data on 59 studies. Two publications provided data on multiple studies (Claassens 2017a; Morishita 2017a), either in different geographic areas or different populations.

### Clinical and radiological features of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs): a pictorial review [^1174iaAc]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging findings on a chest X-ray are not specific. A reticular pattern and bronchiectasis, involving predominantly the lower lobes and costophrenic angles, are generally recognized. Unfortunately, imaging findings could be misdiagnosed in the early stage of the disease.

Typical HRCT features are represented by a reticular pattern, traction bronchiectasis, and a honeycombing appearance. These imaging findings are predominantly located in the subpleural regions and lower lobes.

- **HRCT findings**: The most important imaging feature on HRCT is the honeycombing, which consists of a cluster of cystic air spaces, usually with a diameter of 3–10 mm, although they may reach 2.5 cm in size. A UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) pattern is characterized by:
	- Basal and subpleural predominance.
	- Reticular pattern, with associated traction bronchiectasis.
	- Honeycombing appearance.
	- Absence of features listed as inconsistent with the UIP pattern.

Typical imaging features of UIP are clearly recognizable due to the presence of honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, and a reticular pattern. Lesions are typically located along subpleural regions.

### Clinical and radiographic correlates of primary and reactivation tuberculosis: A molecular epidemiology study [^114dF3N7]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

The traditional teaching that pulmonary tuberculosis, characterized by lymphadenopathy, effusions, and lower or mid lung zone infiltrates on chest radiography, represents "primary" disease from recently acquired infection, whereas upper lobe infiltrates and cavities represent secondary or reactivation disease acquired in the more distant past, is not based on well-established clinical evidence. Furthermore, it is not known whether the atypical radiograph common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis is due to a preponderance of primary progressive disease or altered immunity.

- **Objective**: To analyze the relationship between recently acquired and remotely acquired pulmonary tuberculosis, clinical and demographic variables, and radiographic features by using molecular fingerprinting and conventional epidemiology.

- **Design, setting, and population**: A retrospective, hospital-based series of 456 patients treated at a New York City medical center between 1990 and 1999. Eligible patients had to have had at least one positive respiratory culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and available radiographic data.

- **Main outcome measures**: Radiographic appearance as measured by the presence or absence of six features: upper lobe infiltrate, cavitary lesion, adenopathy, effusions, lower or mid lung zone infiltrate, and miliary pattern. Radiographs were considered typical if they had an upper lobe infiltrate or cavity, whether or not other features were present. Atypical radiographs were those that had adenopathy, effusion, or mid to lower lung zone infiltrates.

### Tuberculosis [^117C646x]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is currently the world's leading cause of infectious mortality. Imaging plays an important role in the management of this disease. The complex immune response of the human body to Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in a wide array of clinical manifestations, making clinical and radiological diagnosis challenging. 18F-FDG-PET/CT is very sensitive in the early detection of TB in most parts of the body; however, the lack of specificity is a major limitation.

18F-FDG-PET/CT images the whole body and provides a pre-therapeutic metabolic map of the infection, enabling clinicians to accurately assess the burden of disease. It enables the most appropriate site of biopsy to be selected, stages the infection, and detects disease in previously unknown sites. 18F-FDG-PET/CT has recently been shown to be able to identify a subset of patients with latent TB infection who have subclinical disease. Lung inflammation as detected by 18F-FDG-PET/CT has shown promising signs that it may be a useful predictor of progression from latent to active infection.

A number of studies have identified imaging features that might improve the specificity of 18F-FDG-PET/CT at some sites of extrapulmonary TB. Other PET tracers have also been investigated for their use in TB, with some promising results. The potential role and future perspectives of PET/CT in imaging TB is considered. Literature abounds on the very important role of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in assessing therapy response in TB. The use of 18F-FDG for monitoring response to treatment is addressed in a separate review.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^116hDVRj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for the early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease. It aims to reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission while improving equity in access to care. Historically, questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have been the most widely available tools for screening tuberculosis disease. The accuracy of these tools is critical for the design of tuberculosis screening programs. It determines, in combination with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, the yield of a screening program and the burden on individuals and the health service.

The objective of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools. These tools are used to detect bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are considered eligible for systematic screening for tuberculosis disease. Additionally, the study aimed to investigate sources of heterogeneity, especially concerning regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

The search methods involved reviewing the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases using pre-specified search terms. Experts were also consulted for unpublished reports, covering the period from 1992 to 2018. The initial search date was 10 December 2018, and it was repeated on 2 July 2021.

Studies were eligible if participants were screened for tuberculosis disease using these specified criteria and methods.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^117DXpvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Chest radiography and symptom questions were studied in parallel. Twenty-five studies contributed to the index test that combines chest X-ray (CXR) and symptom questions in parallel. This index test is diverse in its definition. Almost half of the studies reported on CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis, another portion on pulmonary abnormalities, and two on any CXR abnormality. These were combined with questions on cough, mostly cough ≥ 2 weeks, while a few studies used cough ≥ 3 weeks or any cough.

Some studies used a combination of symptoms or a score based on different symptom questions. Table 11 shows each study with available data for the accuracy of the 'parallel CXR and symptom index test' alongside the accuracy of CXR in the same study, as an informal comparison, reflecting very low certainty evidence. Generally, adding symptoms in parallel to CXR screening might increase sensitivity and reduce specificity. For the addition of cough ≥ 2 weeks to any (pulmonary) CXR abnormality (n = 9), the median increase in sensitivity and decrease in specificity was 1.6% (range -9.4% to +11%) and -3.2% (range -0.3% to -6.2%), respectively.

However, this varied between studies in this subgroup and overlapped with studies applying other symptom and CXR definitions. We meta-analysed these parallel index tests separately for subgroups with more homogeneous definitions of CXR classification and symptom questions applied but then combined them into one overall estimate, as the summary sensitivity and specificity of the subgroups were very similar to each other.

### Tuberculosis revisited: classic imaging findings in childhood [^113okHFW]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of infectious disease in the chest and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In this review, we have described and illustrated the classic findings of childhood TB in each of the systems. Identifying the classic radiological features of pediatric TB is important for the individual management of patients and for a deeper understanding of the disease process. Repeat imaging provides valuable information on disease progression and resolution. Diagnosis of TB in pediatric patients in certain systems remains a clinical challenge given its vague presentation and lack of pathognomonic features. A high index of clinical suspicion and early recognition of classic imaging features are key to prompt diagnosis, initiation of treatment, and prevention of long-term morbidity.

### 'If not TB, what could it be?' Chest x-ray findings from the 2016 Kenya tuberculosis prevalence survey [^115dXSrh]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

Materials and methods - **Study design**: We conducted a secondary retrospective analysis on cross-sectional study data using individual-level participant chest x-ray (CXR) data from adult community members who took part in the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey. The study was in two parts: an initial pilot study (n = 484) to refine tools and estimate the full sample size required for precision and the main study (n = 1140). The main aim was to estimate prevalence and uncertainty for CXR-identified non-TB disease pathology within this population.

- **Study population**: The prevalence survey, reported elsewhere, was a population-based cross-sectional study conducted in 2015–2016. The aim was to determine the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among adults (≥ 15 years) and to assess health-seeking behavior. The survey used the WHO-recommended screening strategy comprising a symptom questionnaire and CXR. There were 63,050 enrolled participants; 62,484 (99%) underwent CXR screening. The survey identified 305 TB cases, with a weighted national prevalence of 558 (95% CI 455 to 662) per 100,000 adult population.

### Chest imaging in paediatric pulmonary TB [^112j9QkT]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. The diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children is often challenging as children present with non-specific clinical symptoms, have difficulties providing specimens, and have a low bacillary load. Radiological imaging supports a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children, can assess response to treatment, and evaluate complications of TB. However, radiological signs on plain radiographs are often non-specific, and inter-observer variability in the interpretation contributes to the difficulties in radiological interpretation and diagnosis. The goal of this review is to discuss the advantages and features of cross-sectional imaging such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing pulmonary TB (PTB) and its complications in children.

### The performance of computer-aided detection digital chest X-ray reading technologies for triage of active tuberculosis among persons with a history of previous tuberculosis [^112DL6Ga]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Digital chest X-ray (dCXR) computer-aided detection (CAD) technology uses lung shape and texture analysis to determine the probability of tuberculosis (TB). However, many patients with previously treated TB have sequelae, which also distort lung shape and texture. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of two CAD systems for the triage of active TB in patients with previously treated TB.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a cross-sectional active TB case-finding study. Participants ≥ 15 years old, with ≥ 1 TB symptom and complete data on the history of previous TB, dCXR, and TB microbiological reference (Xpert MTB/RIF) were included. The dCXRs were evaluated using CAD4TB (v.7.0) and qXR (v.3.0). We determined the diagnostic accuracy of both systems, overall and stratified by history of TB, using a single threshold for each system that achieved 90% sensitivity and maximized specificity in the overall population.

- **Results**: Of 1884 participants, 452 (24.0%) had a history of previous TB. The prevalence of microbiologically confirmed TB among those with and without a history of previous TB was 12.4% and 16.9%, respectively. Using CAD4TB, sensitivity and specificity were 89.3% (95% CI: 78.1–96.0%) and 24.0% (19.9–28.5%), and 90.5% (86.1–93.3%) and 60.3% (57.4–63.0%) among those with and without previous TB, respectively. Using qXR, sensitivity and specificity were 94.6% (95% CI: 85.1–98.9%) and 22.2% (18.2–26.6%), and 89.7% (85.1–93.2%) and 61.8% (58.9–64.5%) among those with and without previous TB, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The performance of CAD systems as diagnostic tools for triaging active TB can offer varying sensitivity and specificity depending on the system and the history of prior TB treatment.

### It is time to focus on asymptomatic tuberculosis [^114KB1AL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Respiratory exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can result in a spectrum of immunological and clinical outcomes. At one extreme is "Mtb resistance", a proposed state in which the innate immune system kills and clears organisms at the lung's mucosal surface, staving off infection and eventual disease. At the other extreme is "full-blown" tuberculosis (TB), symptomatic pneumonia that features systemic inflammation and expectoration of sputum that contains live Mtb, with classic signs of lung damage on chest X-ray. In between these two extremes is a gradient of states ranging from latent Mtb infection to subclinical disease. TB control strategies largely focus on the identification and treatment of people with full-blown TB disease and provide scant guidance on how to identify and manage the spectrum of more "subtle" disease.

Subclinical TB disease is inherently difficult to identify and research, resulting in key gaps in our understanding of its features and implications for personal and public health. It may be entirely asymptomatic or may feature very subtle symptoms that are not reported by patients during classic TB symptom screening. It may feature negative or paucibacillary sputum and minimal or atypical radiological changes on chest X-ray. Our ability to map this part of the spectrum of TB disease reliably to clinical signs, symptoms, and diagnostic tests is further complicated in endemic settings where Mtb exposures are difficult to pinpoint and may occur repeatedly. Courses of anti-TB therapy and immunosuppressing comorbidities such as human immunodeficiency could further influence these outcomes.

### Chlamydia pneumonia mimicking miliary tuberculosis [^111UBk1C]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of subacute, afebrile pneumonia with onset from 1 to 3 months of age. On physical examination, crepitant inspiratory rales are commonly heard. Infiltration is usually bilateral and interstitial; reticulonodular pattern and atelectasis have also been described, which distinguish the disease from miliary tuberculosis. We report an infant who had a disseminated miliary pattern in the chest radiograph and computed tomographic scan of the thorax that was diagnosed as Chlamydia pneumonia through serologic investigations.

We emphasize that Chlamydia trachomatis can cause a miliary reticulonodular pattern in radiological examinations of infants admitted with respiratory symptoms. We suggest that pneumonia due to C. trachomatis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants examined because of a diffuse miliary pattern.

### Mimics in chest disease: Interstitial opacities [^115F7Apt]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Nodular — random

- **Classic entity**: Miliary tuberculosis is a typical example of randomly distributed micronodules throughout both lungs, ranging from 1 to 3 mm. The micronodules are of uniform diameter and evenly distributed within the lungs. It may be impossible to distinguish infectious from neoplastic causes of miliary disease on imaging; however, miliary tuberculosis may more commonly be accompanied by lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion.

Mimics

The most commonly encountered mimics of a nodular pattern with random distribution are miliary metastatic disease, as well as other miliary infections such as miliary candidiasis. Miliary metastatic disease presents with randomly distributed nodules which, unlike miliary tuberculosis, may have a variable size (up to 1 cm), uniform or not. They are usually located in the outer third of the lung, have lower zone predominance, and meet the criterion of "too many nodules to count".

Nodular — centrilobular with tree-in-bud pattern

The tree-in-bud pattern represents centrilobular branching structures that resemble a budding tree.
