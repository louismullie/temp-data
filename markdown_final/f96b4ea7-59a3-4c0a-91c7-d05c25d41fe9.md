## Question

How does hypothyroidism contribute to hyperprolactinemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hypothyroidism contributes to hyperprolactinemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis and where TRH fits. Then, I should verify what happens to TRH when thyroid hormone is low. Next, I will examine TRH's direct effects on lactotrophs and prolactin secretion. After that, I need to check for structural pituitary changes that could amplify prolactin output. I will then review clinical evidence linking hypothyroidism to hyperprolactinemia and its reversibility with levothyroxine. Finally, I should consider clinical implications for diagnosis and management, including when to image and how to interpret prolactin levels in this context.

> Let me first confirm the baseline physiology. Prolactin is secreted by anterior pituitary lactotrophs and is under tonic hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition via D2 receptors, while thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates both TSH and prolactin release; this dual action of TRH is a key pivot for the mechanism we're discussing.

> Now, I need to check what changes in primary hypothyroidism. When circulating thyroid hormone (T4/T3) falls, negative feedback to the hypothalamus diminishes, which increases TRH synthesis and pulsatile release. This is a compensatory attempt to drive TSH, but it also removes dopaminergic restraint on TRH neurons and increases TRH's stimulatory input to the pituitary, thereby directly stimulating lactotrophs to release prolactin [^117QrGDx].

> Wait, let me verify the direct lactotroph effect. TRH binds to thyrotrophs and lactotrophs, so elevated TRH in hypothyroidism increases prolactin synthesis and secretion. Clinically, this manifests as hyperprolactinemia that is typically proportional to the degree of hypothyroidism and reverses with thyroid hormone replacement, underscoring causality rather than mere association [^113kKVTw] [^114aFZCn].

> Hold on, I should also consider structural pituitary changes. In longstanding, severe primary hypothyroidism, TRH-driven thyrotroph hyperplasia can enlarge the pituitary and, in some cases, the lactotroph compartment as well, further augmenting prolactin output. Importantly, this pituitary enlargement regresses with levothyroxine therapy, which helps distinguish it from a true adenoma on imaging [^1174zm6s] [^114YaLjM].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence. Multiple guidelines and reviews list hypothyroidism as a recognized cause of hyperprolactinemia and recommend screening thyroid function in any patient with elevated prolactin. Case series and reports document marked prolactin elevations in overt and even subclinical hypothyroidism that normalize after levothyroxine, reinforcing the mechanistic model and the reversibility of the biochemical abnormality [^114MfskW] [^1139MDqZ] [^117Ey6k2].

> But wait, what if the prolactin is very high — does that still fit with hypothyroidism? I should double-check the magnitude. While severe hyperprolactinemia (> 100–200 ng/mL) is more typical of prolactinomas, hypothyroidism can occasionally produce marked elevations, especially in long-standing disease; thus, a very high prolactin does not exclude hypothyroidism, but it should prompt careful exclusion of a prolactinoma using clinical context, assay technique, and imaging if indicated [^117Ey6k2] [^116UCq8y].

> I will now examine the clinical implications for diagnosis. In any patient with nonphysiologic hyperprolactinemia, I need to ensure thyroid function is assessed early because correcting hypothyroidism may normalize prolactin and obviate unnecessary dopamine agonist therapy or pituitary imaging; this is explicitly recommended by endocrine guidelines and echoed in primary care and urologic guidance for men with hyperprolactinemia of unclear etiology [^114MfskW] [^116UbaLc] [^1158ahkE].

> Let me think about management next. If hypothyroidism is confirmed, levothyroxine replacement is first-line. Prolactin typically declines within weeks to months as TRH drive abates, and pituitary size, if enlarged, should regress on follow-up imaging, which helps confirm the diagnosis retrospectively and avoids mislabeling a physiologic hyperplasia as a tumor [^1174zm6s] [^114YaLjM].

> Hmm, wait a minute — should I image the pituitary routinely in hypothyroidism with hyperprolactinemia? I should confirm the threshold. Imaging is not mandated solely for mild prolactin elevation in untreated hypothyroidism; however, if prolactin remains significantly elevated after biochemical euthyroidism, or if there are red flags (mass effect symptoms, very high prolactin, or discordant findings), then pituitary MRI is appropriate to exclude a coexisting prolactinoma or stalk effect, aligning with guideline-based diagnostic algorithms [^1158ahkE] [^116UCq8y].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal chain is explicit: primary hypothyroidism lowers thyroid hormone feedback, increases hypothalamic TRH, TRH directly stimulates lactotrophs, and in more severe or chronic cases may promote pituitary hyperplasia that further augments prolactin. The resulting hyperprolactinemia is typically reversible with levothyroxine, which is why guidelines prioritize thyroid evaluation and treatment before committing to long-term dopamine agonists or invasive workups [^113kKVTw] [^114MfskW] [^1174zm6s].

---

Hypothyroidism causes hyperprolactinemia by **increasing TRH**, which stimulates prolactin secretion [^117QrGDx], and by **reducing dopamine**, which normally inhibits prolactin [^113kKVTw]. Prolactin levels typically normalize within weeks to months after starting levothyroxine [^114aFZCn], confirming the causal link [^1139MDqZ]. Clinically, this presents with galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility, and **thyroid function should always be checked** in hyperprolactinemia to avoid unnecessary imaging or dopamine agonists [^114MfskW] [^116qL9dC].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation

- **TRH elevation**: Hypothyroidism reduces thyroid hormone feedback, increasing hypothalamic TRH, which stimulates pituitary lactotrophs to secrete prolactin [^115ppZH9].
- **Direct lactotroph effect**: TRH directly stimulates prolactin synthesis and release, causing hyperprolactinemia [^115ppZH9].

---

### Reduced dopaminergic inhibition

Dopamine normally inhibits prolactin via D2 receptors; **hypothyroidism may reduce dopamine tone**, decreasing inhibition and increasing prolactin [^113kKVTw] [^116S1dNQ].

---

### Pituitary hyperplasia

Chronic hypothyroidism can cause **pituitary thyrotroph hyperplasia**, which may coexist with lactotroph hyperplasia and further elevate prolactin [^117C44QB] [^1174zm6s].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

- **Normalization with therapy**: Prolactin levels normalize after levothyroxine, confirming causality [^114aFZCn] [^1139MDqZ].
- **Case reports**: Marked hyperprolactinemia in subclinical hypothyroidism resolves with levothyroxine [^117Ey6k2].
- **Guidelines**: Hyperprolactinemia workups should exclude hypothyroidism before imaging or dopamine agonists [^114MfskW] [^116qL9dC].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Hyperprolactinemia from hypothyroidism presents with:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Galactorrhea | Milk production outside pregnancy/lactation [^1158ahkE] |
| Amenorrhea | Menstrual irregularities, secondary amenorrhea [^116qfhfw] |
| Infertility | Due to impaired ovulation [^111D3oew] |
| Hypogonadism | Low sex steroids, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction [^113kKVTw] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Thyroid function tests**: TSH and free T4 to confirm hypothyroidism [^116HLXFb].
- **Prolactin measurement**: Single morning sample, repeat if elevated, and exclude physiologic causes [^117FVok7].
- **Macroprolactin**: Consider if asymptomatic or discordant [^112jNhUb].
- **Pituitary imaging**: MRI only if prolactin remains elevated after euthyroidism or if mass effect is suspected [^115J2ePQ] [^116UCq8y].

---

## Management

Levothyroxine is **first-line** to correct hypothyroidism and normalize prolactin [^114aFZCn]; **dopamine agonists** are reserved for persistent hyperprolactinemia after euthyroidism or when a prolactinoma is confirmed [^11499abz].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; prolactin normalizes in weeks to months after levothyroxine, and symptoms resolve with thyroid hormone replacement [^114aFZCn] [^1139MDqZ].

---

Hypothyroidism causes hyperprolactinemia via **TRH-driven prolactin secretion** and reduced dopamine inhibition; prolactin normalizes with levothyroxine, so thyroid function should be assessed early in hyperprolactinemia [^114MfskW].

Materials and methods

Patient selection and inclusion/exclusion criteria

This study was conducted as a prospective cross-sectional study at the Department of Internal Medicine and the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine, between December 2023 and June 2024. The minimum sample size was determined to be 70 individuals using the G*Power 3.1.9.7 software, with parameters set at α = 0.15, 1-β = 0.85, and effect size d = 0.5. The power of the study was calculated as 0.8524293.

Patients who were 18 years of age or older, non-smokers, had elevated prolactin levels for the first time due to any etiology, and had not received any treatment prior to this, were included in the study.

The exclusion criteria for the patients were: being under 18 years of age, having a chronic disease (such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease), smoking, being pregnant or in the lactation period, having previously received any treatment after being diagnosed with elevated prolactin levels, having a chronic disease associated with elevated prolactin (such as chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, primary hypothyroidism), and refusing to participate in the study.

The control group inclusion criteria were defined as healthy individuals aged 18 years and over, without any known diseases, not using any regular medication or smoking, and not pregnant or in the lactation period. A total of 39 patients and 39 controls meeting these criteria were evaluated within the scope of the study.

### Diagnosis and treatment of luteal phase deficiency: a committee opinion [^111D3oew]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Conditions that alter the luteal phase — disruptions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility and related medical conditions — have been associated with LPD, and evaluation of underlying causes is advised when LPD is present. Pathologic conditions that disrupt normal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and LH pulsatility can hypothetically lead to LPD, and examples include hypothalamic amenorrhea, eating disorders, excessive exercise, significant weight loss, stress, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, aging, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, ovarian stimulation alone, and assisted reproductive technology use. Thyroid and prolactin disorders may disrupt GnRH secretion, with hypothyroidism increasing thyrotropin-releasing hormone leading to hyperprolactinemia, and hyperprolactinemia inhibiting GnRH secretion directly via prolactin receptors or indirectly via hypothalamic dopamine and opioid peptides. Additional associated conditions include renal transplantation, increased beta-endorphin levels, and lactation. Obesity has been linked to reduced fertility and increased pregnancy loss, with observed reduction in LH pulse amplitude and decreased luteal phase pregnanediol glucuronide excretion; whether this contributes to lower fecundity is unknown. Advanced reproductive age has been associated with decreased progesterone production and deficiencies in luteal progesterone and estradiol metabolites, whereas isolated diminished ovarian reserve has not been associated with LPD after age adjustment. Because these conditions can impair follicular development and corpus luteum function and alter luteal sex steroid secretion, an evaluation of the underlying medical causes should be initiated in any woman with clinical evidence of LPD.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113UB9pj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

1.1.2 Evidence

Evidence to support screening for hypopituitarism in patients with an incidentaloma also comes from small observational studies. In combined data in micro- and macroincidentalomas, hypopituitarism was present in seven of 66 and 19 of 46 patients. Deficits of gonadotropins (not associated with hyperprolactinemia) were detected in up to 30% of patients, of the ACTH/cortisol axis in up to 18%, thyroid axis in up to 28%, and GH axis in up to 8%.

Different approaches can be taken to the initial evaluation of the patient for hypopituitarism. Some Task Force members recommend a minimal screening with the measurement of free T 4, morning cortisol, and testosterone levels, whereas others recommend that the initial evaluation should also include the measurement of TSH, LH, and FSH and IGF-I. A broad initial approach to this testing is favored by some to avoid the repeated blood sampling that would be needed to confirm a central origin of target organ deficiencies should they be detected. Low gonadotropin levels in postmenopausal women provide evidence of hypopituitarism and in men exclude primary hypogonadism when testosterone levels are low. Similarly, normal or low TSH levels help distinguish a pituitary etiology of hypothyroidism when the free T 4 is low. Gonadal function can be assessed in premenopausal women by history and examination. If baseline testing suggests hypopituitarism, further stimulation tests of the pituitary-adrenal or GH-IGF-I axis should be performed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to serum prolactin levels, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to perform serial dilution of serum samples to eliminate an artifact that can occur with some immunoradiometric assays leading to a falsely low prolactin value ("hook effect") in patients with a discrepancy between a very large pituitary tumor and a mildly elevated prolactin level.

### Rare case of meningococcal sepsis-induced testicular failure, primary hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism: is there a link? [^114j5Whp]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Severe illness can lead to multiple transient endocrinopathies. In adult patients, neuroendocrine alterations include sick euthyroid syndrome, an increase in corticosteroid levels, increase in prolactin levels, decreased insulin growth factor 1 levels and hypogonadism. We report the case of a 24-year-old man with meningococcal sepsis with multiple end-organ complications who developed persistent non-autoimmune hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and primary hypogonadism all requiring hormone replacement. While adrenal insufficiency as part of the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is well described, reports of primary hypothyroidism and persistent primary hypogonadism in severe illness are exceedingly rare. Multiple combined endocrinopathies as in this case have not been reported previously. This case highlights the necessity of screening for endocrine abnormalities in severe illness and the need for treatment if persistent. It also raises a novel concept of meningococcal sepsis causing multiple endocrinopathies possibly via disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related ischaemic damage.

### Prolactin dysregulation in women with subclinical hypothyroidism: effect of levothyroxine replacement therapy [^114aFZCn]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effect of levothyroxine treatment on serum prolactin (PRL) levels in women with subclinical hypothyroidism. Sixty-six women (mean age, 58.5 ± 1.3 years) with confirmed subclinical hypothyroidism (mean thyrotropin [TSH], 11.7 ± 0.8 mIU/L) were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine or placebo for 48 weeks. Based on blinded TSH monitoring, physiologic levothyroxine replacement (85.5 ± 4.3 microg/d; TSH, 3.1 ± 0.3 mIU/L) was ascertained throughout the study. PRL levels were measured before and after administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) at baseline, after 24 and 48 weeks. Sixty-three of the 66 women completed the study. At baseline, basal PRL levels were elevated in 19% of the patients. None of the patients reported menstrual disturbances, infertility, or galactorrhea. In the levothyroxine group (n = 31) basal and peak PRL levels were significantly reduced after 24 and 48 weeks (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001). Mean changes in PRL levels differed significantly between the two treatment groups after 24 weeks (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01). The treatment effect was more pronounced in patients with PRL and TSH levels above the median at baseline (i.e. PRL > 16 ng/mL; TSH > 11 mIU/L). Based on this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study we demonstrate that in subclinical hypothyroidism PRL regulation is altered with elevated basal and stimulated PRL levels, and that physiologic levothyroxine treatment restores PRL concentrations.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^111Dc6vr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that prolactin also plays an essential role in metabolism and regulation of the immune system and macroprolactin has been described as the major immune reactive prolactin species in the serum of several subjects before and during pregnancy. The relationship with anti-PRL autoantibodies and autoimmune disorders has been investigated in some studies due to the structure of macroprolactin. Although some case reports have shown interaction between macroprolactinemia and autoimmune thyroid disorders, other studies examining a large number of patients revealed no specific association. It has been shown that only a minority of patients with SLE had higher frequencies of macroprolactinemia. The association of prolactin and macroprolactin with thyroid hormones and thyroid autoantibodies during pregnancy has not been studied before.

In the present study, we aimed to assess the contribution of macroprolactin to high serum prolactin levels and the association of prolactin (PRL) and macroprolactin (macroPRL) levels with thyroid status and thyroid autoimmunity during pregnancy.

Overall, when a patient presents with hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea, it can have several etiologies. If the etiology is MS, there is no need for specific treatment of hyperprolactinemia, as treating the MS relapse will normalize prolactin levels.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^112LVGWQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

In the present study, due to the complex relationship between thyroid and prolactin metabolism, we tried to examine patients by dividing them into three groups in terms of thyroid status. The second aim of our study was to evaluate prolactin homogeneity in different thyroid disorders during pregnancy. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study which investigated this relationship. Contrary to our expectations, macroprolactin levels did not increase during pregnancy and there were only two patients with macroprolactinemia. All of the remaining patients showed homogeneity in terms of prolactin size. We preferred to use percentage of monoPRL recovery for the other patients to define homogeneity instead of macroprolactinemia for two reasons. Firstly because of the insufficient number of patients with macroprolactinemia and the secondly due to the fact that the definition of macroprolactinemia is already based on percentage of recovered prolactin after PEG precipitation. Nevertheless, there was a small amount of data that can be considered significant. These findings were as follows, a slightly significant positive correlation between TSH and PRL, and a negative correlation between FT4 and PRL. Although there is a known close relationship between thyroid and prolactin metabolism, it was not so clear in the present study. However, the number of marked hypothyroid and hyperthyroid patients was inconsiderable in our study and most of our patients were euthyroid. This can explain why we found serum prolactin levels similar and not enough to confirm our hypothesis.

The other potential issue is the relationship of prolactin with autoimmune processes. It was shown that prolactin has the potential to stimulate the immune system and can also be produced in extra pituitary sites. A large number of autoantibodies are increased in patients with hyperprolactinemia without overt clinical autoimmune disease. These antibodies include antipituitary, antithyroid peroxidase, antithyroglobulin, anti gastric parietal cells, antimicrosomal, and anticardiolipin antibodies. In addition, there is an intriguing relationship between macroprolactin and some collagen tissue disorders such as SLE. It is proposed that there is a correlation between disease activity and macroprolactinemia. Initially we investigated this relationship in different thyroid hormone status. We could not find any relationship between thyroid antibodies with either PRL or monoPRL %. Regardless of thyroid status, according to the presence of TPOAb alone, the negative tendency continued. It is well known that antibodies may be high in healthy individuals without apparent thyroid disease. Presence of high number of patients with positive thyroid antibody, 81(58%) in all groups, can be a reason for statistical uncertainty.

### Genome-wide analyses identify 25 infertility loci and relationships with reproductive traits across the allele frequency spectrum [^1127FV3A]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

The strong genetic correlation of 71% between idiopathic infertility and endometriosis may indicate that some proportion of idiopathic cases are due to underdiagnosis of endometriosis, whose early treatment may prevent future infertility. Our subtype-specific analyses highlight the value in dissecting heterogeneous causes of infertility. For example, PCOS is a heritable cause of up to 80% of anovulatory infertility cases that may be treated through induced ovulation. However, only three of eight loci for anovulatory infertility colocalize with known PCOS signals, the genetic correlation between these traits is only 40% and the majority (88%) of causal variants for anovulatory infertility are not shared with PCOS. These results suggest that other hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian disorders, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia and so on) and ovarian insufficiency may also contribute significantly to the genetic etiology of anovulatory infertility, and require treatments different from those for PCOS-associated infertility. Weight loss for overweight patients is often recommended as beneficial for fertility, but we did not find substantial genetic correlation between obesity and infertility. Our findings add genetic support to evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating limited fertility benefits from short-term weight loss in overweight and obese women. Instead, we observed bidirectional causal relationships between abdominal obesity and anovulatory infertility, suggesting physiological feedback mechanisms whose complex interplay requires deeper study.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^113CKY5d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Bacground

To assess the contribution of macroprolactin to high serum prolactin levels and their association with thyroid status and thyroid autoimmunity during pregnancy.

Methods

138 pregnant women who suspected of having thyroid dysfunction were studied and divided into three groups according to the thyroid status; group 1; euthyroidism (n 40), group 2; hypothyroidism (n 54), and group 3; hyperthyroid (n 44). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method was used for detection of macroprolactin. A percentage recovery of 40% or less is considered as macroprolactinemia. If macroprolactin was negative, the percentage of monomeric prolactin recovery (monoPRL %) after PEG precipitation was used for comparison between the groups.

Results

Macroprolactinemia was found in two patients (1.4%) one from hypothyroid and other from euthyroid group. Basal prolactin levels in these patients were 400 and 403 ng/mL respectively. Referring to all patients, there was no correlation between PRL, macroPRL or monoPRL % with thyroid hormone status and also with the serum levels of thyroid antibodies (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between the serum levels of PRL with TSH (p = 0.014 and r = 0.219), while a negative correlation was found with FT4 (p = 0.011 and r = -0.227).

Conclusions

Despite the fact that serum prolactin levels were found to be high during pregnancy, the contribution of macroprolactin was found to be insignificant in our study. Unlike other auto immune diseases, we could not find any relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and PRL, macroPRL or monoPRL %. These results confirmed that measured prolactin was quite homogeneous during pregnancy.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Ht8xw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) — targeted history for organic causes and comorbidities: In patients with suspected FHA, it is imperative to elicit a history of galactorrhea, severe or persistent headache, nausea, vomiting, or changes in vision, thirst, or urination (both volume and frequency), suggesting the possibility of a prolactinoma or other pituitary or intracranial tumor, and clinicians should also obtain a history of symptoms suggesting thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism), symptoms suggesting androgen excess and PCOs, or those consistent with other chronic health conditions; in patients with primary amenorrhea, anosmia or hyposmia can indicate Kallmann syndrome, and anxiety, depression, and chronic diseases may also be associated with amenorrhea.

### Coexistence of TSH-secreting adenoma and primary hypothyroidism: a case report and review of literature [^117G8WGw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

N N Ghannam et al. suggested that primary hypothyroidism could induce to the proliferation of thyroid-stimulating cells and leads to the formation of TSHoma. M F Langlois et al. reported a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis and TSHoma, the conclusion whether the tumor was secondary to primary hypothyroidism could not be drawn yet. In this case, the diffuse destruction of the thyroid gland was observed on ultrasound, and cranial MRI showed that there was large pituitary adenoma of patient with 2 cm in diameter, and the sequential order of the tumor and primary hypothyroidism was difficult to confirm. Patients with hypothyroidism could present with skin changes. Our patient developed hair loss and coarse skin several years before surgery, but no pigmentation was shown.

In addition, prolactin was slightly elevated in this patient. In 30% of all TSHoma, the tumor could co-secrete TSH and other hermones, such as growth hormone and prolactin. The co-secretion of different kinds of hormone may be induced by the expression of common transcription factors by anterior pituitary cells. For the patient in the current study, the elevated level of prolactin may also be caused by pituitary stalk effect. Moreover, thyrotropin- releasing hormone elevation may be caused by the negative feedback mechanism, which could act on pituitary prolactin cells and result in a mild elevation of prolactin.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperprolactinemia, more specifically with respect to patients with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider offering estrogen or testosterone in patients with long-term hypogonadism (hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass) related to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia.

### Coexistent primary empty sella syndrome and hyperprolactinemia… [^115AENvv]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The series involved 11 women with concurrent hyperprolactinemia and primary empty sella syndrome. Eight had amenorrhea and six had galactorrhea. All 11 patients had intact hypothalamic-pituitary function, except for having elevated prolactin levels that ranged from 33 to 498 ng/mL. One patient had primary hypothyroidism. Radiologic investigations included sellar polytomography in eight cases, computed tomography of the head in eight cases, bilateral carotid angiography in six cases, and pneumoencephalography in three cases. Of eight patients undergoing transsphenoidal exploratory surgery, one had a pituitary microadenoma and an empty sella while seven had only an empty sella with a flattened pituitary gland. Conventional histologic methods and immunocytologic studies of the pituitary gland showed no abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is unknown.

It should be recognized that hyperprolactinemia, with or without galactorrhea-amenorrhea, may occur in association with an empty sella in the absence of an associated pituitary tumor.

### The interrelationships between thyroid dysfunction and hypogonadism in men and boys [^1139B4XK]. Thyroid (2004). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormone deficiency affects all tissues of the body, including multiple endocrine changes that alter growth hormone, corticotrophin, glucocorticoids, and gonadal function. Primary hypothyroidism is associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is reversible with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In male children follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is elevated and associated with testicular enlargement without virilization. Men with primary hypothyroidism have subnormal responses of luteinizing hormone (LH) to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) administration and normal response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Free testosterone concentrations are reduced in men with primary hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone replacement normalizes free testosterone concentrations. In men with primary hypothyroidism, prolactin is not consistently elevated (except in men and children with longstanding severe primary hypothyroidism), but prolactin declines following thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thyroid hormone is known to affect sex hormone-binding hormonal globulin (SHBG) concentrations. Men with hyperthyroidism have elevated concentrations of testosterone and SHBG. Thyroid hormone therapy in normal men may also duplicate this elevation. In addition estradiol elevations are observed in men with hyperthyroidism, and gynecomastia is common in them as well. In contrast to patients with primary hypothyroidism, men with hyperthyroidism exhibit hyperresponsiveness of LH to GnRH administration and subnormal responses to hCG. Radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) of men treated for thyroid cancer produces a dose-dependent impairment of spermatogenesis and elevation of FSH up to approximately 2 years. Permanent testicular germ cell damage may occur in men treated with high doses of RAI. RAI commonly increases serum concentrations of FSH and LH while reducing inhibin B levels without affecting serum concentrations of testosterone. Thus, radioiodine therapy transiently impairs both germinal and Leydig cell function that usually recover by 18 months posttherapy.

Prolactinomas — initial evaluation: Hyperprolactinemia may be physiological, medication related, laboratory artifact, or due to an underlying pathophysiologic cause, so the initial evaluation should include a comprehensive medication history, a thorough evaluation for secondary causes including primary hypothyroidism, and assessment for clinical features such as hypogonadism and galactorrhea; unless a secondary cause is definitively established, further investigation is indicated to evaluate the etiology.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^116UCq8y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

The diagnostic workup for hyperprolactinemia is shown in Fig. 2. As reported in Table 1, a number of physiologic (pregnancy, breastfeeding, stress, exercise, food intake, and sleep) and pathologic conditions (chronic kidney and liver failure, primary hypothyroidism, compression of the pituitary stalk by a non–PRL-secreting pituitary tumor or different parasellar mass, and granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus), as well as several drugs (mainly antidepressants, dopamine receptor blockers, dopamine synthesis inhibitors, oral contraceptives, gastrointestinal medications, neuroleptics, and antipsychotics) can induce symptomatic hyperprolactinemia. Before a correct diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, such conditions must be investigated and excluded. Attention should be paid to medical history, concomitant medications, and biochemical assessment. This is particularly true in the case of modest PRL elevations, which only occasionally may mask the presence of a prolactinoma, as in clinical case 2. To ascertain the diagnosis of a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor, a single measurement of serum PRL without excessive venipuncture stress is strongly recommended. Breast examination in patients with galactorrhea should not be performed immediately before PRL assessment because any nipple stimulation might result in PRL increase. A level above the upper limit of normal (25 μg/L in women, 20 μg/L in men) raises diagnostic suspicion. Conversely, dynamic testing of PRL secretion based on the administration of TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone does not find clinical application currently. In uncertain conditions, sampling can be repeated after overnight fasting on a different day in 2 to 3 samples in time course at 15- to 20-minute intervals to minimize the effect of PRL pulsatile secretion. PRL levels > 250 μg/L generally confirm the diagnosis of prolactinoma, albeit PRL increase over 200 μg/L can be also seen in case of non–PRL-secreting tumor mass, such as nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. In presence of a serum PRL level > 500 μg/L, the diagnosis of macroprolactinoma can be ruled in. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia (see previous section) have been excluded, a radiological confirmation with pituitary imaging, mainly based on gadolinium-enhanced MRI is required. Over the past 20 years, pituitary MRI has progressively replaced computed tomography with IV contrast enhancement because the latter is less effective than MRI in visualizing small tumors on the one hand and in shaping the extension of large or giant tumors on the other. Nowadays, a pituitary computed tomography scan is recommended only when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, such as in patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillators; internal pacing wires; clips for cerebral, carotid, or aortic aneurysm; cochlear implants; any implant held in by magnet; Swan-Ganz catheter; and pregnancy. In the latter circumstance, the use of pituitary MRI is not recommended except in the case of clinical confirmation of tumor growth suggested by sudden impairment in the visual field, and MRI should be performed without gadolinium after the second trimester of pregnancy. In those patients with macroadenomas impinging the optic chiasm, a visual field examination is recommended, whereas visual testing is not mandatory for patients with microadenomas.

### Medical causes and consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A context for psychiatrists [^111Zyoaj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article.

### Approach to the patient: a case with an unusual cause of hypopituitarism [^115cwMjY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypopituitarism, which refers to insufficiency of one or more hormones of the pituitary, can be due to myriad causes. The clinical and radiological spectrum of the condition is heterogeneous, based on the patient's age, gender, clinical setting, and/or other past medical history. Hypopituitarism includes central hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Both hypo- and hyperprolactinemia can be associated with hypopituitarism, with low prolactin signifying more extensive pituitary damage. Posterior pituitary insufficiency (arginine vasopressin deficiency) occurs either in isolation or with anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. Clinical symptomatology of hypopituitarism is usually nonspecific and insidious in onset and progression. Overall, the most common cause of hypopituitarism is a pituitary adenoma and/or its management (surgery, radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of these). However, it is this subset of patients which is more likely to be identified and managed in a timely manner, possibly alleviating the premature mortality associated with hypopituitarism. What is more challenging is the recognition of hypopituitarism in less common settings, which may be either due to direct involvement of the pituitary (infection, traumatic brain injury, or infiltrative causes) or indirectly as a consequence of the primary process (thalassemia, vasculotoxic snakebite, subarachnoid hemorrhage). These entities are often under-recognized, and increased awareness can help in greater recognition of the burden. Further, pituitary insufficiency in most of these settings is dynamic and may progress, or rarely, show recovery of function. This renders complexity to the problem, but makes it even more imperative to suspect, screen, and appropriately manage patients with less common causes of hypopituitarism.

### Kisspeptin treatment restores ovarian function in rats with hypothyroidism [^112VGWdC]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Hypothyroidism causes ovarian dysfunction and infertility in women, in addition to being associated with hyperprolactinemia and reduced hypothalamic expression of kisspeptin (Kp). However, it remains unknown whether and how Kp is able to reverse the ovarian dysfunction caused by hypothyroidism. Methods: Hypothyroidism was induced in adult female Wistar rats using 6-propyl-2-thiouracil for 3 months. In the last month, half of the animals received Kp10. Blood samples were collected for dosage of free thyroxine, thyrotropin (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), progesterone (P 4), and estradiol (E 2), and uteruses and ovaries were collected for histomorphometry. Body and ovarian weight and the number of corpora lutea were also evaluated. Half of the brains were evaluated by immunohistochemistry to Kp, and the other half had the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus (ARC) and preoptic area microdissected for gene evaluation of Kiss1, Nkb, Pdyn, and Gnrh1. The pituitary gland and corpora lutea were also dissected for gene evaluation. Results: Hypothyroidism kept the animals predominantly acyclic and promoted a reduction in ovarian weight, number of corpora lutea, endometrial thickness, number of endometrial glands, and plasma LH, in addition to increasing the luteal messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Star and Cyp11a1 and reducing 20αHsd. An increase in plasma PRL and P 4 levels was also caused by hypothyroidism. Kp immunoreactivity and Kiss1 and Nkb mRNA levels in the ARC and Kiss1 in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of hypothalamus were reduced in hypothyroid rats. Hypothyroid animals had lower pituitary gene expression of Gnrhr, Lhb, Prl, and Drd2, and an increase in Tshb. The treatment with Kp10 restored estrous cyclicality, plasma LH, ovarian and uterine morphology, and Cyp11a1, 3βHsd, and 20αHsd mRNA levels in the corpora lutea. Kp10 treatment did not alter gene expression for Kiss1 or Nkb in the ARC of hypothyroid rats. Nevertheless, Kp10 increased Lhb mRNA levels and reduced Tshb in the pituitary compared with the hypothyroid group. Conclusions: The present findings characterize the inhibitory effects of hypothyroidism on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in female rats and demonstrate that Kp10 is able to reverse the ovarian dysfunction caused by hypothyroidism, regardless of hyperprolactinemia.

### Pituitary imaging is indicated for the evaluation of hyperprolactinemia [^1123MniR]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the signs and symptoms associated with hyperprolactinemia and establish guidelines for a minimal serum PRL level for which pituitary imaging is indicated.

Design

Retrospective study.

Setting

Reproductive endocrinology clinic in a university hospital.

Patient(S)

One hundred four consecutive patients with hyperprolactinemia, mean age 30 ± 6.5 (range 19–44) years.

Intervention(S)

Classification of clinical symptoms, serum hormone measurements, and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Incidence of presenting symptoms, serum PRL levels, and pituitary tumor size.

Result(S)

Median (range) PRL value was 82.6 ng/mL (25–1,342). Reported symptoms from most to least common were infertility (48%), headaches (39%), oligoamenorrhea (29%), galactorrhea (24%), and visual changes (13%). Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 2 of 104 (1.9%) patients. Of 86 patients who had pituitary imaging, 23 (26%) had normal findings and 63 (74%) had pituitary tumor; of these, 47 (55% of total imaged) had microadenomas and 16 (19% of total imaged) had macroadenomas. There was a statistically significant association between the tumor size and the PRL level. However, 11% of the patients with microadenomas had PRL levels > 200 ng/mL, and 44% of the patients with macroadenomas had PRL levels between 25 and 200 ng/mL.

Conclusion(S)

The most common symptoms in the population studied were infertility and headaches. Coexisting thyroid disease was an uncommon finding. Most patients had a pituitary tumor on MRI. Although tumor size correlated with the serum PRL level, some macroadenomas were detected in women with only moderately elevated PRL values. On the basis of these findings, pituitary imaging should be obtained to identify pituitary tumors in all patients with persistently elevated PRL levels.

### Hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas [^112htS1h]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Any process interfering with dopamine synthesis, its transport to the pituitary gland, or its action at the level of lactotroph dopamine receptors can cause hyperprolactinemia. As described in this article, considering the complexity of prolactin regulation, many factors could cause hyperprolactinemia, and hyperprolactinemia can have clinical effects not only on the reproductive axis. Once any drug effects are excluded, prolactinomas are the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia. The most frequent symptom is hypogonadism in both genders. Medical and surgical therapies generally have excellent results, and most prolactinomas are well controlled or even cured in some cases.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1174zm6s]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism — Common manifestations include dry skin, cold sensitivity, fatigue, muscle cramps, voice changes, and constipation, while severe disease may present with carpal tunnel syndrome, sleep apnea, pituitary hyperplasia with or without hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea, and hyponatremia within several weeks of profound hypothyroidism. Rating scales have been used but have low sensitivity and specificity; the degree of hypothyroidism correlates with ankle reflex relaxation time. Return to a euthyroid state is supported by normalization of resting heart rate, serum cholesterol, anxiety level, sleep pattern, and menstrual cycle abnormalities including menorrhagia, as well as normalization of elevated serum creatine kinase or other muscle or hepatic enzymes following treatment.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^112D2ETH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

It has been shown that there is a strong association between thyroid and prolactin secretion physiologically. Many critical and period-specific changes occur during pregnancy in thyroid and prolactin metabolism. Due to the structural similarity, elevated hCG may increase the synthesis of thyroid hormones and cause TSH suppression. Thus PRL response to TRH may be blunted in hyperthyroid conditions. In contrast, elevated TRH can increase levels of TSH and PRL in patients with hypothyroidism. Autoimmune thyroid disorders are common in women of reproductive age and subclinical hypothyroidism related to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common thyroid disorder. If the classic reference range (0.4–4.0 μIU/L) of TSH is used in the first trimester of pregnancy, subclinical cases of hypothyroidism may be missed. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis (GTT) or hCG-mediated transient TSH suppression and Graves Disease (GD) are the most common types of hyperthyroid disease in pregnant women. GTT is generally asymptomatic with mild biochemical hyperthyroidism and may be exacerbated by hyperemesis, while GD is a real thyrotoxic disease and mostly requires anti-thyroid treatment. Both hypo and hyperthyroidism were reported to be associated with poor pregnancy outcome. These outcomes include spontaneous abortions, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, preeclampsia, heart failure, and neurodevelopment deficits in the children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115PYP6B]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced hyperprolactinemia — management recommendations state: we suggest that clinicians not treat patients with asymptomatic medication-induced hyperprolactinemia (2|⊕⊕○○), and we suggest the use of estrogen or testosterone in patients with long-term hypogonadism (hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass) related to medication-induced hyperprolactinemia (2|⊕⊕○○). No treatment is necessary in the asymptomatic patient, and if the drug cannot be discontinued or substituted and the patient has hypogonadal symptoms or low bone mass, estrogen or testosterone therapy should be considered; we suggest that the first step in treatment is to stop the drug if this is clinically feasible, substitute a drug with a similar action that does not cause hyperprolactinemia if stopping is not possible, and if this is not feasible we suggest considering the cautious administration of a dopamine agonist in consultation with the patient's physician (2|⊕⊕○○); some studies suggest that dopamine agonist therapy will normalize prolactin levels in only up to 75% of such patients but may lead to exacerbation of the underlying psychosis. In recommending against the use of dopamine agonists, we are placing a low value on avoiding the adverse consequences of hyperprolactinemia due to medications that cannot be replaced or discontinued, a low value on foregoing the potential benefits of dopamine agonists, and a high value on avoiding adverse effects of such therapy, including psychosis exacerbation.

### Hormonal causes of male sexual dysfunctions and their management (hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, GH disorders, and DHEA) [^116rwHLq]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Besides hypogonadism, other endocrine disorders have been associated with male sexual dysfunction (MSD).

Aim

To review the role of the pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), thyroid hormones, and adrenal androgens in MSD.

Methods

A systematic search of published evidence was performed using Medline (1969 to September 2011). Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of Evidence (March 2009) was applied when possible.

Main Outcome Measures

The most important evidence regarding the role played by PRL, GH, thyroid, and adrenal hormone was reviewed and discussed.

Results

Only severe hyperprolactinemia (> 35 ng/mL or 735 mU/L), often related to a pituitary tumor, has a negative impact on sexual function, impairing sexual desire, testosterone production, and, through the latter, erectile function due to a dual effect: mass effect and PRL-induced suppression on gonadotropin secretion. The latter is PRL-level dependent. Emerging evidence indicates that hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of premature ejaculation and might also be associated with erectile dysfunction (ED), whereas hypothyroidism mainly affects sexual desire and impairs the ejaculatory reflex. However, the real incidence of thyroid dysfunction in subjects with sexual problems needs to be evaluated. Prevalence of ED and decreased libido increase in acromegalic patients; however, it is still a matter of debate whether GH excess (acromegaly) may create effects due to a direct overproduction of GH/insulin-like growth factor 1 or because of the pituitary mass effects on gonadotropic cells, resulting in hypogonadism. Finally, although dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate have been implicated in a broad range of biological derangements, controlled trials have shown that DHEA administration is not useful for improving male sexual function.

Conclusions

While the association between hyperprolactinemia and hypoactive sexual desire is well defined, more studies are needed to completely understand the role of other hormones in regulating male sexual functioning.

### Hyperthyroidism and hyperprolactinemia: is there any association? [^114RArUW]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the serum prolactin level in hyperthyroid and normal control females. Hyperthyroidism is a common disease. Although a direct association has been demonstrated between hypothyroidism and increased prolactin levels, this association has not been established for hyperthyroidism.

Methods

Cross-sectional study in cases and control groups. Control subjects were chosen from those participating in the Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk Factors study. To select the cases, all women referred to the laboratories of Kerman with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤ 0.5 mIU/L who met the inclusion criteria were entered in the study. A total of 231 women aged 15 to 50 years were enrolled. The case group included 71 hyperthyroid women, and the control group included 160 women with normal thyroid function matched by age.

Results

The mean (SD) serum level of prolactin was 16.56 (0.97) ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.41 ng/mL to 15.71 ng/mL) in the controls and 23.07 (1.49) ng/mL (95% CI, 22.7 ng/mL to 23.4 ng/mL) in the case subjects. Hyperprolactinemia was more common in the hyperthyroid group (16.5 [0.97] ng/mL versus 23.07 [1.49] ng/mL; P < .001). The prolactin level decreased with age. Hyperthyroidism and estradiol increased the prolactin level. After adjusting for age and estradiol, hyperthyroidism increased the serum prolactin level (P < .001).

Conclusion

The results of this study revealed that hyperprolactinemia is more frequent in hyperthyroid females. Serum prolactin level can be increased in hyperthyroidism.

### Prolactin-secreting adenomas: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^113kKVTw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperprolactinemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperprolactinemia is defined as a sustained elevation of serum prolactin above normal levels, typically > 25 ng/mL in nonpregnant women and > 20 ng/mL in men. It may occur physiologically (pregnancy, stress), pharmacologically (dopamine antagonists), or pathologically (pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, CKD).
- **Pathophysiology**: Prolactin secretion is normally inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine acting on D2 receptors in lactotrophs. Loss of this inhibition, whether from drugs, lesions, or stalk compression, results in excess prolactin release. Estrogens and thyrotropin-releasing hormone enhance secretion. Chronically high prolactin suppresses GnRH, reducing LH and FSH, which causes hypogonadism, infertility, and sexual dysfunction.
- **Epidemiology**: Hyperprolactinemia is one of the most common endocrine disorders. It affects about 15–20% of women evaluated for infertility. Drug-induced causes are most frequent, followed by prolactinomas, hypothyroidism, and renal disease. Prolactinomas account for 30–40% of pituitary tumors, with microadenomas more common in women and macroadenomas in men.
- **Risk factors**: Major risk factors include use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, and antiemetics. Physiological triggers include pregnancy, lactation, nipple stimulation, and stress. Pathologic causes include pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney or liver disease, chest wall injury, and epilepsy. Genetic syndromes such as MEN1 and familial isolated pituitary adenoma also increase risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course depends on etiology. Physiologic and drug-induced forms are often mild and reversible, whereas adenomas produce persistent elevations. Women present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, or low libido. Men present with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility, or rarely gynecomastia. Large tumors may cause headache, visual loss, or hypopituitarism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis is excellent when the cause is identified and treated. Drug- or disease-related hyperprolactinemia resolves after withdrawal or correction of the underlying condition. Dopamine agonists such as cabergoline normalize prolactin in 70–90% of prolactinoma cases and restore fertility in most women. Surgery is reserved for resistant or compressive tumors. Untreated cases may lead to chronic hypogonadism, infertility, and bone loss.

Medications, most commonly dopamine antagonists (but also anti-psychotics, anti-emetics, proton pump inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, opiates, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may cause hyperprolactinemia, and chronic medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, renal failure, and cirrhosis are associated with hyperprolactinemia as well; patients should be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation if the etiology for hyperprolactinemia cannot be established, and an evaluation for a prolactinoma is imperative because these benign tumors can be effectively managed using medications such as bromocriptine or cabergoline.

We suggest that clinicians not treat patients with asymptomatic medication-induced hyperprolactinemia, and we suggest use of estrogen or testosterone for long-term hypogonadism related to medication-induced hyperprolactinemia. We suggest that the first step is to stop the drug if feasible; if not, substitute a similar agent that does not cause hyperprolactinemia, and if this is not feasible, consider cautious administration of a dopamine agonist in consultation with the patient's physician.

### Hyperprolactinaemia in hypothyroidism: clinical significance and impact of TSH normalization [^115J2ePQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Menstrual irregularities in hypothyroidism have been reported to occur less frequently than previously described. We therefore studied the influence of serum PRL in patients with newly diagnosed subclinical and overt hypothyroidism and in hyperprolactinaemic patients treated with T4 to distinguish the impact of hypothyroidism from that of confounding drugs on hyperprolactinaemia and menstrual irregularities.

Patients and Methods

PRL was determined in 1003 consecutive hypothyroid patients (TSH > 4.0 mU/l) at referral, and after TSH normalization in 84 (8%) initially hyperprolactinaemic (female, > 480 mU/l; male, > 432 mU/l) subjects. Medical history (psychotropic drugs and oestrogens) and menstrual patterns were assessed at referral and after 8 ± 5 (mean ± SD) months of T4 therapy. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was offered to patients with persistently elevated PRL.

Results

Menstrual disturbancies (oligomenorrhoea/secondary amenorrhoea, O/A) were not more common (P = NS) in hyper- than in normoprolactinaemic women (26% and 16%, respectively). We observed no galactorrhoea and no correlation between PRL and TSH or O/A except in pregnant or lactating women (N = 11). Oestrogens or antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) did not cause hyperprolactinaemia but antipsychotic drugs did. PRL decreased with T4 therapy (P < 0.01) in patients not using confounding drugs (from 720 ± 288 to 360 ± 192 mU/l) but menstrual irregularities persisted. PRL remained unchanged in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. PRL was also unchanged in patients with pituitary abnormalities (seven micro-, one macroadenoma).

Conclusions

Hyperprolactinaemia was not an important feature in patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. Neuroleptic drugs may cause persisting hyperprolactinaemia after TSH normalization. In addition, menstrual disturbancies do not relate to hyperprolactinaemia in hypothyroidism.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology disease state clinical review: clinical relevance of macroprolactin in the absence or presence of true hyperprolactinemia [^116skS26]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current literature regarding the prevalence of macroprolactin (macroPRL) in hyperprolactinemic patients and determine recommendations for testing.

Methods

An electronic United States National Library of Medicine PubMed search (through October, 2014) was conducted for search term "macroprolactin". Only English-language articles were considered.

Results

MacroPRL is an under-recognized cause of elevated prolactin (PRL) and is present in approximately 4% to 40% of hyperprolactinemic patients depending on the referral population. Clinical findings which could be due to hyperprolactinemia are the impetus for testing for PRL. Because of this there is significant overlap in the clinical presentation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and those with macroPRL, differentiation cannot always be made on the basis of symptoms. A lack of recognition of the presence of macroPRL can lead to unnecessary laboratory investigations, imaging, and pharmacologic or surgical treatment.

Conclusion

Until there is a commercially available PRL assay that is not subject to interference by macroPRL, clinicians should consider the possibility of macroPRL, especially if the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and/or response to therapy reveal inconsistencies.

### The impact of metformin on plasma prolactin levels in antipsychotics-treated men with hyperprolactinemia and early-onset androgenic alopecia [^111fqqaq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Recent years provided evidence that the anterior lobe of the pituitary glands is an important target for metformin action. The drug reduced elevated levels of various pituitary hormones: follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin if their baseline levels were elevated. These pituitary effects of metformin may be explained by the absence of the blood‐brain barrier in this structure, leading to accumulation of significant amounts of metformin in the pituitary tissue. Consequently, the strength of pituitary effects was found to correlate with the daily dose of metformin, and this impact was observed predominantly in subjects receiving high‐dose metformin treatment. Among different causes of prolactin excess, the prolactin‐lowering effect of metformin was best documented for hyperprolactinemia induced by antipsychotic drugs. It is also worth mentioning that metformin was reported to potentiate the reduction in prolactin levels induced by dopaminergic agents, and that the drug did not affect prolactin levels in case of hyperprolactinemia secondary to excess of high‐molecular‐weight complexes of prolactin and immunoglobulins (macroprolactin). Because the strength of metformin action is determined by baseline prolactin levels, individuals with severe hyperprolactinemia may benefit to a greater degree from metformin treatment than those with mildly or moderately elevated prolactin concentration.

The decrease in prolactin levels in response to metformin treatment may be of clinical significance in individuals with iatrogenic prolactin excess. Dopamine agonists, considered the gold standard in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, can diminish the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs and have the potential to exacerbate psychosis. Hence, they are less commonly used in subjects with antipsychotic‐induced hyperprolactinemia than in prolactin excess of other origin. Moreover, both schizophrenia and antipsychotic agents seem to predispose to type 2 diabetes, and to other conditions associated with insulin resistance. This means that many subjects on antipsychotic therapy may require antidiabetic agents, and metformin may be the drug of choice for most of them.

Unfortunately, metformin‐induced reduction in prolactin level was found to be significant only in females but not in males, suggesting the modulatory effect of sex hormones. In line with this explanation, the impact of metformin on lactotroph secretory function was more pronounced in hormonal contraception users and postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy, but absent in women with androgen excess secondary to polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: mechanisms, consequences and management [^117M7uzy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect in people receiving antipsychotics. The propensity to cause hyperprolactinaemia differs markedly between antipsychotics as a result of differential dopamine D(2) receptor-binding affinity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Sexual dysfunction is common and under-recognized in people with severe mental illness and is in part caused by hyperprolactinaemia. There are a number of long-term consequences of hyperprolactinaemia, including osteoporosis. Regular monitoring before and during treatment will help identify those developing antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia. The treatment includes dose reduction and change in antipsychotic. Where this is not possible because of the risk of relapse of the mental illness, sex steroid replacement may be helpful in improving symptoms secondary to hypogonadism and reducing the risk of osteoporosis. Tertiary prevention of complications should also be considered.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^114C1X9w]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although hyperprolactinemia is known to occur in patients with cirrhosis, it is most often asymptomatic. We suggest that this paradox might be due to the preponderance of male patients included in such studies. It is well known that the physiologic action of prolactin is potentiated by the presence of high levels of estrogen and progesterone. Therefore, for a given degree of hyperprolactinemia, a female subject is more likely to develop symptoms such as galactorrhea than a male patient. In particular, endocrine manifestations of Wilson's disease remain poorly understood. Gonadal dysfunction can produce amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea and recurrent abortions in females, although true infertility is rare. Similarly, there have been case reports of hypoparathyroidism, possibly secondary to copper deposition within the parathyroid glands.

It is pertinent to note that there is no clear relationship between the severity of liver disease and the degree of hyperprolactinemia. As shown in our case, as a direct consequence of this discrepancy, hyperprolactinemia can manifest well before other more classical complications of cirrhosis, such as variceal bleeding and ascites, appear. This is especially important in the context of patients with a potentially treatable cause of cirrhosis, such as Wilson's disease, where the rapid and timely institution of appropriate therapy can significantly alter the natural history of the disease.

In conclusion, unexplained hyperprolactinemia can be a marker for underlying systemic disease, and therefore warrants careful investigation before being labeled as idiopathic.

### Disorders of prolactin secretion [^11499abz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are a common cause of reproductive/sexual dysfunction. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia have been excluded with a careful history and physical examination, routine chemistries, and an assay for TSH, MR imaging, or CT will delineate the size and extent of the tumor. Medical therapy is the initial treatment of choice. When infertility is the primary indication for treatment, bromocriptine use has an extensive safety record and is preferred. For other indications, cabergoline seems to be more efficacious and better tolerated. Transsphenoidal surgery remains an option, especially for patients with microadenomas, when medical therapy is ineffective.

### Pituitary enlargement in patients with primary hypothyroidism [^114YaLjM]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assesses the frequency and degree of pituitary hyperplasia in patients with primary hypothyroidism, the association of pituitary enlargement with disease severity, and the response to treatment.

Methods

Between April 2002 and August 2004 at the National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics in Amman, Jordan, 53 patients (49 female and 4 male subjects) with primary hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) levels of ≥ 50 microIU/mL were encountered. Initial and follow-up investigations included thyroid function tests, serum prolactin levels, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary. Visual field examination was requested for all patients with pituitary enlargement (and adequately completed in 24).

Results

Pituitary enlargement on MRI was found in 37 of the 53 patients (70%), with 31 of the 37 patients (84%) having TSH levels of ≥ 100 microIU/mL. After thyroxine treatment, 85% of the patients with pituitary enlargement who underwent a follow-up MRI showed a decrease in size of the gland. About half of the patients were referred to our facility with the diagnosis of hypothyroidism; presenting features in the rest of the patients included galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, learning disability, short stature, precocious puberty, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, headaches, visual field defects, and dry ichthyotic skin.

Conclusion

The association between pituitary gland enlargement and primary hypothyroidism should be kept in mind when pituitary hyperplasia is detected on MRI, before unwarranted and drastic interventions are initiated.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^116qfhfw]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Causes of amenorrhea — prevalence and principal etiologies — The prevalence of amenorrhea not due to pregnancy, lactation, or menopause is approximately 3%–4%. Normal menstrual function requires four components (hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovaries, and genital outflow tract), and most cases are accounted for by six conditions: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and anatomic abnormalities. In specialized referral centers, approximately 5–20 patients per year were seen with primary amenorrhea annually. Amenorrhea may also occur with sexual ambiguity or virilization, and sexual ambiguity or virilization should be evaluated as separate disorders.

### Evaluation and management of galactorrhea [^112bYoxA]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea is commonly caused by hyperprolactinemia, especially when it is associated with amenorrhea. Hyperprolactinemia is most often induced by medication or associated with pituitary adenomas or other sellar or suprasellar lesions. Less common causes of galactorrhea include hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, and nipple stimulation. After pathologic nipple discharge is ruled out, patients with galactorrhea should be evaluated by measurement of their prolactin level. Those with hyperprolactinemia should have pregnancy ruled out, and thyroid and renal function assessed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging should be performed if no other cause of hyperprolactinemia is found. Patients with prolactinomas are usually treated with dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline); surgery or radiation therapy is rarely required. Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with a medication from a similar class with lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. Normoprolactinemic patients with idiopathic, nonbothersome galactorrhea can be reassured and do not need treatment; however, those with bothersome galactorrhea usually respond to a short course of a low-dose dopamine agonist.

Thyrotroph Regulation

Basophilic thyrotrophs constitute approximately 5% of the pituitary cell population, located mainly in the antero-medial portion of the gland. Hypothalamic TRH induces TSH production, visible as granular deposits. TRH also induces PRL secretion, likely explaining the hyperprolactinemia typically observed with hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones, dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids suppress TSH by overriding central TRH induction, while thyrotroph proliferation and TSH secretion are both unrestrained when negative feedback suppression by low thyroid hormone is removed.

Transcription of genes encoding the α and β TSH subunits is induced by TRH and suppressed by dopamine. Hypothalamic TRH neurons centrally regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis setpoint by regulating pituitary TSH release. Hypothalamic TRH synthesis is, in turn, regulated primarily by thyroid hormones. Neuronal groups mediating other physiologic stimuli include adrenergic medullary input, which mediates stimulatory effects of cold exposure on the TRH neuron. TRH neurons also receive projections from 2 leptin-responsive neuronal populations that regulate energy homeostasis. POMC neurons, which promote weight loss, activate TRH neurons, while NPY/agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons, which promote weight gain, inhibit TRH neurons. Fasting reduces TRH expression, which is mediated by suppression of POMC and stimulation of NPY/AGRP. Postnatal thyrotroph expansion is blocked in mice with disrupted Trh, illustrating the trophic effects of TRH on thyrotrophs.

Nonhormonal Cells

The pituitary contains a mixed population of nonhormonal supporting cells scattered throughout the gland as well as cells involved in autoimmune mechanisms. These include folliculostellate cells, primitive undifferentiated null cells, and immune lymphocytes and macrophages, all of which may express intrapituitary cytokines that regulate pituitary function and contribute to tumorigenesis.

### Clinical and diagnostic characteristics of hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence [^116dchXd]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, which is a rare endocrine disorder encountered in pediatric patient care. Epidemiological and clinical information about hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence is limited. Clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia are very heterogeneous. In girls, disturbances in menstrual function and galactorrhea may be seen, whereas in boys, headache, visual disturbances, delayed pubertal development and hypogonadism are often present. Owing to the ease of ordering a serum prolactin measurement, an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to the management of this endocrine disorder is required. Before a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, drug use, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and parasellar tumors should be excluded. The main objectives of treatment are normalization of prolactin level, adenoma shrinkage, and recovery from clinical signs related to hyperprolactinemia. In patients with microadenoma, invasive or non-invasive macroadenoma, and even in patients with visual field defects, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to medical treatment or who have persistent neurological signs. Radiotherapy should be considered as a supportive treatment for patients in whom surgery fails or medical response is not achieved.

### The effects of pituitary and thyroid disorders on haemostasis: potential clinical implications [^115uyJ9q]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Disturbances of coagulation and fibrinolysis are usually multifactorial and growing evidence suggests that endocrinopathies modulate the haemostatic balance. The thrombotic alterations in endocrine disorders range from mild laboratory clotting abnormalities with little clinical significance to serious thrombotic and bleeding disorders directly related to hormonal disturbances. This literature review focuses on presenting the current data on the effects of thyroid and pituitary disorders on various parameters of the haemostatic system. With the exception of overt hypothyroidism which appears to cause a bleeding tendency, the rest of the endocrinopathies discussed in this review (subclinical hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, endogenous hypercortisolaemia, growth hormone deficiency, acromegaly, prolactinoma/hyperprolactinaemia and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) are associated with a hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic state, increasing the overall cardiovascular risk and thromboembolic potential in these patients. In most studies, the haemostatic abnormalities seen in endocrine disorders are usually reversible with successful treatment of the underlying condition and biochemical disease remission. High-quality studies on larger patient cohorts are needed to produce robust evidence on the effects of endocrine disorders and their therapeutic interventions on coagulation and fibrinolysis, as well as on the long-term mortality and morbidity outcomes in association with endocrine-related haemostatic imbalance. Given the rarity of some of the endocrine disorders, multicentre studies are required to achieve this target.

### Hypopituitarism [^115aEe7e]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is the partial or complete insufficiency of anterior pituitary hormone secretion and may result from pituitary or hypothalamic disease. The reported incidence (12–42 new cases per million per year) and prevalence (300–455 per million) is probably underestimated if its occurrence after brain injuries (30–70% of cases) is considered. Clinical manifestations depend on the extent of hormone deficiency and may be non specific, such as fatigue, hypotension, cold intolerance, or more indicative such as growth retardation or impotence and infertility in GH and gonadotropin deficiency, respectively. A number of inflammatory, granulomatous or neoplastic diseases as well as traumatic or radiation injuries involving the hypothalamic-pituitary region can lead to hypopituitarism. Several genetic defects are possible causes of syndromic and non syndromic isolated/multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. Unexplained gonadal dysfunctions, developmental craniofacial abnormalities, newly discovered empty sella and previous pregnancy-associated hemorrhage or blood pressure changes may be associated with defective anterior pituitary function. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism relies on the measurement of basal and stimulated secretion of anterior pituitary hormones and of the hormones secreted by pituitary target glands. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. Genetic testing, when indicated, may be diagnostic. Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare disease. The biochemical diagnosis is suggested by low serum FT4 levels and inappropriately normal or low basal TSH levels that do not rise normally after TRH. L-thyroxine is the treatment of choice. Before starting replacement therapy, concomitant corticotropin deficiency should be excluded in order to avoid acute adrenal insufficiency. Prolactin deficiency is also very rare and generally occurs after global failure of pituitary function. Prolactin deficiency prevents lactation. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males is characterized by low testosterone with low or normal LH and FSH serum concentrations and impaired spermatogenesis. Hyperprolactinemia as well as low sex hormone binding globulin concentrations enter the differential diagnosis. Irregular menses and amenorrhea with low serum estradiol concentration (< 100 pmol/l) and normal or low gonadotropin concentrations are the typical features of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in females. In post menopausal women, failure to detect high serum gonadotropin values is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. In males, replacement therapy with oral or injectable testosterone results in wide fluctuations of serum hormone levels. More recently developed transdermal testosterone preparations allow stable physiological serum testosterone levels. Pulsatile GnRH administration can be used to stimulate spermatogenesis in men and ovulation in women with GnRH deficiency and normal gonadotropin secretion. Gonadotropin administration is indicated in cases of gonadotropin deficiency or GnRH resistance but is also an option, in alternative to pulsatile GnRH, for patients with defective GnRH secretion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112RNDFn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia.

Participants

The Task Force consisted of Endocrine Society-appointed experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society, The European Society of Endocrinology, and The Pituitary Society reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

Conclusions

Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated prolactin levels. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of hyperprolactinemia, treating drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, and managing prolactinomas in nonpregnant and pregnant subjects. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents for treating prolactinomas are also presented.

### Late primary autoimmune hypothyroidism in a patient with postdelivery autoimmune hypopituitarism associated with antibodies to growth hormone and prolactin-secreting cells [^1112fWUB]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pituitary and thyroid autoimmunity can be triggered by pregnancy. We report the first association of combined growth hormone (GH) and prolactin secretion deficiency due to autoimmune damage to GH- and prolactin-secreting cells in a patient with postdelivery lactation failure, presenting subsequently with primary autoimmune hypothyroidism.

Patient Findings

A 34-year-old woman presented with lactation failure following the delivery of her first child. She had a family history of hypothyroidism without a history of pituitary dysfunction. Physical examination did not show any abnormal findings. Laboratory investigations showed normal gonadotropin levels after the restoration of normal menstrual cycles following pregnancy, normal basal and stimulated cortisol levels, but an impaired GH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and low basal prolactin and insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations. Thyroid function was normal when initially investigated three months after delivery, but five months later, marked primary hypothyroidism (thyrotropin levels > 100mIU/L) occurred. Immunological investigation revealed the presence of antipituitary antibodies, identified by double immunofluorescence and targeting GH- and prolactin-secreting cells. Antithyroid antibodies, in the normal range three months postpartum, became significantly elevated when the hypothyroidism appeared. Autoimmune hypophysitis is responsible for selective or multiple pituitary-hormone deficiencies, sometimes involving thyrotropin secretion and causing secondary hypothyroidism, but usually associated with hyperprolactinemia. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of autoimmune hypopituitarism involving deficient growth hormone and prolactin secretion in a patient with lactation failure after delivery, subsequently followed by severe primary autoimmune hypothyroidism, thus falling into an unusual constellation of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 3.

Conclusions

Considering the well-known relationship between pregnancy and autoimmunity, an early postdelivery immunological and functional investigation in women presenting with disorders of lactation may be useful to detect potential pituitary and thyroid dysfunction even at a subclinical stage.

Hyperprolactinemia — women with microadenomas not desiring pregnancy: Women with microadenomas who are not desirous of pregnancy may be treated with a dopamine agonist or oral contraceptives, and no controlled trials have compared these two options; oral contraceptives are less expensive and have fewer side effects, amenorrhea will not be an indicator of hyperprolactinemia recurrence in patients treated with oral contraceptives, the effect of oral estrogen therapy on the growth of microadenomas has not been examined in a randomized controlled fashion, and patients treated with oral contraceptives and estrogen/progesterone replacement for 2 yr have not shown an increase in tumor size.

### Evaluation and treatment of galactorrhea [^115PjtEi]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

### Gynecologic and reproductive health concerns of adolescents using selected psychotropic medications [^115XmuAC]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychiatric disorders are common in adolescent girls and may require chronic therapies with psychotropic medications. Antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers have been increasingly prescribed to and widely used by adolescents for a variety of both "on" an "off" label indications. Studies on the safety and monitoring of these medications in adolescent girls have shown important potential for gynecologic and reproductive adverse effects. The objective of this article is to review the mechanisms for and management of menstrual disorders mediated by hyperprolactinemia associated with antipsychotic medications, hypothyroidism associated with lithium and quetiapine, and the independent association of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in girls using valproic acid. Beyond their susceptibility to these disruptions in the menstrual cycle, adolescent girls with psychiatric illness also have increased sexual risk behaviors. These behaviors makes it all the more important to review teratogenicity and clinically relevant contraceptive drug interactions in adolescent girls using these psychotropic medications.

### Ectopic hyperprolactinaemia due to a malignant uterine tumor resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROCST) [^116DrBqt]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human prolactin (PRL) gene, located on chromosome 6, apparently rose from a single common ancestral gene giving rise to the relatively homologous PRL, growth hormone (GH), and the placental lactogen-related proteins. Several factors influence PRL, gene expression, including oestrogen, dopamine, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and thyroid hormones. PRL secretion is under the inhibitory control of dopamine, which is produced mainly by the tuberoinfundibular cells and the hypothalamic tuberohypophyseal dopaminergic system. High concentrations of circulating prolactin are typically associated with either prolactin secreting pituitary tumors or interference with the dopaminergic control of prolactin from normal pituitary such as pituitary stalk disconnection and dopamine agonist medications, as well as other conditions including primary hypothyroidism, uraemia and hepatic insufficiency.

Apparently high levels of prolactin may be due to excess circulating prolactin complexes ('macroprolactin') which need to be differentiated from true hyperprolactinaemia. Increased prolactin may also rise due to acute medical stress and therefore diagnostic levels of prolactin should be ideally taken after intravenous cannulation.

The ectopic production of hormones from tissues that are not generally considered to be part of their usual cellular behaviour are a consistent theme in endocrinology and lead to distinct clinical syndromes. These syndromes can originate from either endocrine or non-endocrine neoplasms. They can precede, occur concomitantly, or present at a later stage of neoplasm development, and along with the secreted substances constitute the biological 'fingerprint' of the neoplasm. Their detection can facilitate early diagnosis of the underlying neoplasia, monitor response to treatment, and/or detect early recurrences following successful initial management.

Ectopic prolactin may arise from prolactinoma cells that have arisen intracranially or within the sinuses and these likely arise from normal pituitary cells that are remnants left during the development of the pituitary from Rathke's pouch. These have the cellular appearance of typical prolactinoma but are "extrapituitary". There are in addition a very small number of cases where prolactin has been released from tissues that do not usually express prolactin and are most frequently associated with neoplasms of the female reproductive system. In this report we have identified hyperprolactinaemia arising due to ectopic production from a malignant uterine tumor resembling ovarian sex cord tumor (UTROSCT).

### Hyperprolactinemia and infertility [^115g2efx]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors are a common cause of amenorrhea and infertility in premenopausal women. The goals of therapy are to normalize prolactin, restore gonadal function and fertility, and reduce tumor size, and dopamine agonists are the preferred therapy. Clinically significant tumor enlargement during pregnancy is uncommon and dependent on tumor size and prepregnancy treatment.

Hyperprolactinemia — initial evaluation and causes: In patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, we suggest assessing for macroprolactin. When prolactin is only mildly elevated despite a very large pituitary tumor, we recommend serial dilution of serum samples to address a possible "hook effect". For symptomatic nonphysiological hyperprolactinemia, we recommend excluding medication use, renal failure, hypothyroidism, and pituitary and parasellar tumors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116mbSh9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary tumor–related and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia — patients with large nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, or granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus can develop hyperprolactinemia because of pituitary stalk compression or dopaminergic neuronal damage, and in 226 patients with histologically confirmed nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, a prolactin level greater than 94 µg/liter reliably distinguished between prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas; dopamine agonist therapy lowers prolactin levels and improves symptoms in patients with stalk compression, but it is not definitive therapy for a nonfunctioning adenoma; fewer than 10% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia ultimately are found to harbor a microadenoma and progression from a microadenoma to a macroadenoma is rare; spontaneous normalization of prolactin levels occurs in approximately 30% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; and it is important to determine whether patients with hyperprolactinemia also have acromegaly because prolactin is elevated in up to 50% of patients with GH-secreting tumors.

### Elevated α-fetoprotein levels in van wyk-grumbach syndrome: a case report and review of literature [^117TtQXx]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The association between primary hypothyroidism and precocious puberty secondary to ovarian hyperstimulation has been recognized for over a century. Here, we report the case of a 9-year-old girl with severe primary hypothyroidism, who presented with premature menarche, enlarged pituitary gland, enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts, and elevated prolactin and alpha-feto protein levels. Pituitary and ovarian radiology findings, and alpha-feto protein levels normalized a few weeks after hypothyroidism treatment was started. Reviewing the literature we found several reports of increased levels of tumor markers in girls with this association. Thyroid function tests should be always part of the evaluation of patients with precocious puberty especially if the bone age is delayed. Tumor markers and liver function tests may be abnormal in patients with severe hypothyroidism and improve soon after thyroid hormone replacement is started.

### Drug insight: prolactin-receptor antagonists, a novel approach to treatment of unresolved systemic and local hyperprolactinemia? [^116S1dNQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone whose major biological actions are related to normal lactation and reproduction. Abnormally high prolactin levels, referred to as hyperprolactinemia, can result in various reproductive disorders. Currently, therapeutic management of hyperprolactinemia relies on dopamine agonists, since dopamine is the primary physiological suppressor of pituitary prolactin production. Epidemiologic studies have shown that prolactin levels in the high-normal range, as well as medications that interfere with dopamine action (e.g. certain antipsychotic drugs), might correlate with increased breast cancer risk. In addition to circulating prolactin, it is now well established that prolactin is also produced locally within various tissues, including breast and prostate. Increasing evidence, mainly from animal studies at present, suggests that excess locally produced prolactin may promote the growth of breast and prostate tumors via an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. These findings have renewed the interest in finding alternative strategies to suppress prolactin actions when dopamine agonists are ineffective. Our studies of the relationship between prolactin structure and function have resulted in the development of pure prolactin-receptor antagonists. These molecules prevent endogenous prolactin from exerting its actions via a competitive mechanism for receptor binding. In this review, we discuss the possible future therapeutic utility of this novel class of compounds.

### Galactorrhea: rapid evidence review [^1158ahkE]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Galactorrhea is the production of breast milk that is not the result of physiologic lactation. Milky nipple discharge within one year of pregnancy and the cessation of breastfeeding is usually physiologic. Galactorrhea is more often the result of hyperprolactinemia caused by medication use or pituitary microadenomas, and less often hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, pituitary macroadenomas, hypothalamic lesions, or unidentifiable causes. A pregnancy test should be obtained for premenopausal women who present with galactorrhea. In addition to prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, renal function should also be assessed. Medications contributing to hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued if possible. Treatment of galactorrhea is not needed if prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are normal and the discharge is not troublesome to the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland should be performed if the cause of hyperprolactinemia is unclear after a medication review and laboratory evaluation. Cabergoline is the preferred medication for treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Transsphenoidal surgery may be necessary if prolactin levels do not improve and symptoms persist despite high doses of cabergoline and in patients who cannot tolerate dopamine agonist therapy.

### Emotionally induced galactorrhoea in a non-lactating female – "Pseudo-lactation"? [^116D5XeR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Causes for hyperprolactinaemia are numerous; nipple stimulation, chest wall injury, breast feeding, co-morbid psychiatric disorders and treatment with dopamine antagonists are some of them. In addition direct stimulation of lactotrophs by oestrogen (during pregnancy, oestrogen containing contraceptive pills) also causes hyperprolactinaemia. In our patient all above causes except pregnancy have been excluded by a comprehensive history. Pregnancy was excluded by normal ultra sound scan of the abdomen.

Commonest pathological cause for galactorrhoea is a pituitary tumour. Prolactin secreting adenomas or other functional tumours co-secreting prolactin or any form of macroadenoma that is large enough to cause pituitary stalk compression (i.e. disconnection hyperprolactinaemia) may result in hyperprolactinaemia. In this patient MRI scan of the pituitary gland did not reveal any evidence of micro or macroadenoma. Although our patient underwent the MRI scan 4 months after the initial presentation it is highly unlikely for a pituitary tumour to undergo spontaneous regression even without any drugs such as dopamine receptor agonists.

Hypothyroidism removes the negative feedback on hypothalamic TRH and subsequently may cause an increase in prolactin secretion. Nearly 30% of patients with chronic kidney disease have high serum prolactin levels probably secondary to impaired renal excretion of prolactin. In our patient hypothyroidism was excluded by normal range of TSH and T 4. Although our patient has been diagnosed to have type 1 diabetes mellitus her renal function tests were normal including urine albumin creatinine ratio, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Stress is known to cause hyperprolactinaemia. In our patient venipuncture and psychological stressors are important to consider. When withdrawing venous blood for measurement of prolactin levels our patient was subjected to non-stress venipuncture and had only a single prolactin value. Endocrine society clinical practice guidelines also recommend single measurement of serum prolactin without excessive stress for diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia.

### Association between prolactin and incidence of cardiovascular risk factors in the framingham heart study [^115ppZH9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, the lack of associations observed between prolactin and changes in adiposity and body composition is not consistent with results published in primarily clinical studies. Prolactinomas producing high levels of prolactin are typically associated with weight gain. 4 In addition, a study in obese women found that increased BMI and VAT are associated with an increased prolactin secretion rate. 8 Similar to our findings, however, a previous cross‐sectional community‐based study did not find an association between BMI and prolactin in either men or women. 9 This study excluded participants with pituitary disease and, with this exclusion, likely removed most persons with prolactin levels outside of the physiological range. Our exclusion of participants with abnormally elevated prolactin may have similarly contributed to the lack of associations we observed, if these associations are better observed with very elevated prolactin.

Potential Mechanisms

Several mechanisms potentially explain the association between prolactin and hypertension. Studies in rats have demonstrated that high prolactin has chronotropic and vasoconstrictive effects. 27 A physiological study of 27 men with untreated hypertension and normal prolactin found that diurnal peaks in prolactin coincided with reduced endothelial function, which may play a role in elevating blood pressure. 28

Higher baseline prolactin may also reflect perturbations in other hormonal axes known to affect blood pressure and lipids, thus explaining both our hypertension and HDL cholesterol findings. Elevated prolactin may result from untreated hypothyroidism because hypothalamic thyrotropin‐releasing hormone, which is commonly elevated in hypothyroidism, stimulates both prolactin synthesis and release from the pituitary. 29 Hypothyroidism is associated with hypertension and elevations in HDL cholesterol. 30, 31 Nevertheless, this mechanism is speculative.

The association we observed between elevated prolactin and diabetes in men may be related to a possible mechanism of sex hormone–binding globulin, a glycoprotein that binds to androgens and estrogens and mediates their interaction with hormone receptors. 32, 33 Prolactin has been found to inhibit production of sex hormone–binding globulin in vitro. 34 Low sex hormone–binding globulin has been prospectively associated with increased odds of incident diabetes. 33, 35, 36 Although the mechanism and causality of this association has not been fully characterized, it is possible that elevated prolactin may influence diabetes risk by inhibiting production of sex hormone–binding globulin.

### Hyperprolactinemia [^114d4tBq]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult-the challenge is in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion. With immunoradiometric assays falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin (the hook effect). Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin. With prolactinomas, prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels that exceed 250 microg/l and may exceed 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

Verapamil causes hyperprolactinemia in 8.5% of patients, opiates and cocaine act through the μ-receptor to cause mild hyperprolactinemia, and twelve to 30% of women taking higher estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may have a small increase in serum prolactin.

### Hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism following cytotoxic therapy for central nervous system malignancies… [^114pksWd]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract Endocrinologic dysfunction including hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism are recognized complications of irradiation to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or thyroid gland in the course of treating CNS malignancies. However, the frequency of these adverse effects in both short- and long-term survivors may be underestimated. Sixty-five patients treated in the University of Rochester Cancer Center since 1968 with radiation with or without BCNU chemotherapy for CNS tumors not involving the hypothalamic-pituitary axis were evaluated for thyroid, prolactin, and gonadal disturbances regardless of clinical symptomatology. Prolactin values were elevated in 19 of 47 patients. For males and females treated with greater than 55 Gy, abnormal values were present in nine of 11 and seven of 14, respectively. For males and females treated with less than or equal to 55 Gy, two of nine and one of 13, respectively, were abnormal.

Six of six patients who also received BCNU chemotherapy were hyperprolactinemic, as compared with six of ten who did not receive BCNU. Seven of eight females with elevated prolactin levels had menstruation abnormalities, and five of seven adult males noted a decrease in libido. Mild abnormalities in testosterone concentration were found in three of nine men evaluated, all of whom had normal gonadotropins. Four of eight patients who also received BCNU had low T4 values, as compared with three of 14 who did not receive BCNU. Of 15 patients who were treated with 4 to 10 MV photon irradiation to the spinal axis, five patients had elevated TSH values. The mean spinal axis dose in these patients was 33 Gy. Two euthyroid children in this group manifested the early onset of puberty.

The complex of endocrinologic abnormalities observed in several patients receiving only cranial irradiation, that is elevated prolactin, decreased thyroid, and gonadal hormone secretion in the presence of otherwise normal pituitary hormone levels, suggests a radiation-induced insult to the hypothalamic regulation of pituitary function.

### Serum macroprolactin levels in pregnancy and association with thyroid autoimmunity [^117C44QB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prolactin, a protein hormone, is secreted from the anterior pituitary usually in response to physiological and rarely pathological stimuli. Prolactin concentrations begin to increase after 6 weeks of pregnancy and reach the highest level in late pregnancy to prepare the mammary glands of the breasts for the production of milk. It is well known that circulating prolactin is not homogenous and three different forms are defined according to molecular size: monomeric PRL (monoPRL), big PRL (bigPRL), and macroprolactin (macroPRL). Macroprolactin is described as a complex of PRL with immunoglobulin G (IgG) which is related to antiprolactin autoantibodies. This formulation of PRL may cause limited bioactivity, bioavailability and clearance from the glomerulus. Macroprolactinemia is usually asymptomatic, patients with macroprolactinemia do not need further therapy, and pregnancy is possible without any treatment for such hyperprolactinemia. Although the gold standard method for detecting macroPRL is gel filtration chromatography, precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used screening test. A low PRL recovery, < 40%, after PEG precipitation indicates the presence of macroPRL. In hyperprolactinemic states, the contribution of macroprolactin has been found to be 10 to 25% of prolactin and macroprolactinemia may be present in about 0.2–3.6% of the general population.

Normal maternal thyroid function is essential for both fetal and maternal health and many physiological alterations occur during pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and estrogen are two pregnancy-related hormones responsible for increased thyroid hormone levels in the blood. Thyroid disorders, particularly those with autoimmune origin, are common in women of reproductive age and both hypo and hyperthyroidism were reported to be associated with poor pregnancy outcome. Therefore, different trimester-specific reference ranges were defined to distinguish physiological alterations from pathological states. It has been shown that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) can stimulate the secretion of prolactin in experimental conditions; however its physiological influence is not so obvious. Hypothyroidism may cause pituitary and thyrotrophic hyperplasia which result in elevated TRH and prolactin release. The high levels of both hormones may return to normal after effective thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

### Marked hyperprolactinemia in subclinical hypothyroidism… [^117Ey6k2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Hyperprolactinemia is common in primary hypothyroidism but, to our knowledge, marked elevation of serum prolactin in subclinical hypothyroidism has not been previously reported. A 45-year-old woman presenting with carpal tunnel syndrome was found to have a minimally elevated level of thyrotropin with a normal level of thyroxine. Thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulation testing revealed hyperresponsiveness consistent with primary hypothyroidism. An unstimulated prolactin level was 187 μg/L and returned to normal with levothyroxine therapy. Results of visual field testing were normal, and a computed tomographic scan of the pituitary gland revealed no evidence of a macroadenoma. This case demonstrates the occurrence of significant hyperprolactinemia in the absence of overt primary hypothyroidism. Olive KE, Hennessey JV. Marked Hyperprolactinemia in Subclinical Hypothyroidism. Arch Intern Med. 1988; 148: 2278–2279.

### Clinical, surgical, and endocrine outcome following treatment of posterior pituitary tumors: a retrospective cohort study [^1125Dyxy]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Preoperative endocrine function

At diagnosis, 7 patients exhibited normal pituitary function, 2 had complete and 9 partial anterior pituitary insufficiency (Table 1). The most common dysfunction was hypogonadism (42%), followed by hypocortisolism (36.8%) and GH deficiency and hyperprolactinemia in equal measure (31.6%). One patient had isolated hyperprolactinemia. Assessment of the thyrotropic axis was affected by long-term L-thyroxine therapy in 8 patients. Among the remaining patients, 4 were newly diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Hypocortisolism was highest in PCs (67%), followed by SCOs (37.5%) and GCTs (25%). Hypogonadism was highest in PCs (67%) and GCTs (50%), and low in SCOs (25%). GH deficiency was observed in 33% of PC patients and 37.5% of GCT patients, but was present in only 25% of SCO patients. Hyperprolactinemia occurred in 50% of SCOs, 25% of GCTs, and was absent in PCs. Notably, no patients were diagnosed with AVP-D.

Endocrine function one week after surgery

Postoperatively, hyperprolactinemia improved in all 6 preoperative cases, with 4 normalizing and 2 significantly reduced (Fig. 1). Two patients developed hyperprolactinemia, both with panhypopituitarism and AVP-D. AI was present postoperatively in 9 patients (47%), with 6 persistent and 3 new-onset cases. Only one patient had cortisol normalization. Hypogonadism worsened postoperatively, increasing to 57.9% from 42% preoperatively (Fig. 1). This was especially evident in SCOs, where hypogonadism increased from 25 to 62.5%. Thyroid function remained unchanged in thyroxine-treated patients, but two developed hypothyroidism, while one resolved. GH deficiency varied: one GCT patient improved, while new cases arose in one PC and one SCO patient. AVP-D developed in four patients (21%): two GCT, one PC, and one SCO case.

### The relationship between bone and reproductive hormones beyond estrogens and androgens [^113KH3bT]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the high prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures in men with prolactinomas, parallel studies in women reveal a similar susceptibility to skeletal fracture. In a cross-sectional study of 78 women with prolactinomas, vertebral fractures occurred in 32% of patients, compared with 13% of age-matched healthy controls. Patients with fracture were older, had lower BMD, longer duration of disease, higher serum PRL, and lower insulin-like growth factor 1 levels compared to women without bone fracture. Similar to men, bone fractures occurred more frequently in women with untreated hyperprolactinemia compared with patients treated with dopamine agonists.

Adequate treatment of hyperprolactinemia and resultant hypogonadism rescues bone loss; however, recovery of BMD is only partial. In a study of 20 hyperprolactinemic men, despite restoration of testosterone and suppression of PRL, serum OC levels were normalized, whereas neither urinary NTX levels nor BMD values were normalized after 18 months of treatment with dopaminergic agents. Importantly, despite correction of serum PRL levels after 6 to 12 months of medical treatment, the improvement in BMD both at 12 and 24 months of treatment remained reduced in patients with disease onset during adolescence than onset during adulthood.

Taken together, these studies demonstrate direct and indirect roles for PRL in bone physiology. However, from a clinical perspective, there remain many unknowns. First, although restoration of normal PRL and gonadal function improves BMD, this is not always associated with complete normalization of BMD, emphasizing the clinical importance of early treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Second, the effect of treatments for hyperprolactinemia on BMD and fracture risk has limited data as yet. Third, most clinical evidence for a negative effect of hyperprolactinemia on bone is derived from patients with prolactinomas, despite medication-induced hyperprolactinemia representing the most frequent cause of nonphysiological hyperprolactinemia, principally from neuroleptics and antipsychotic agents. However, there are some studies of medication-induced hyperprolactinemia implicating it in reduced bone density and increased fracture risk. Further research in this area is warranted to inform more robust clinical guidelines regarding the use of these medications from a bone health perspective. Finally, many data in humans have been derived from small, heterogeneous, and cross-sectional or retrospective studies, which are likely to affect the generalizability of the results. To improve the granularity of the data, larger, multicenter and prospective studies are warranted, although the importance of PRL in overall bone physiology remains unquestionable (see Figure 1).

### Delusion of pregnancy in a drug-naïve young woman showing hyperprolactinemia and hypothyroidism: a case report [^112MgPX6]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The present article reports the case of a delusional pregnancy that developed in a drug-naïve young woman affected by paranoid schizophrenia and Hashimoto-related hyperprolactinemia. The literature in this field has addressed the phenomenon of distorted thoughts of pregnancy being elicited by physical changes due to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia. The present report gives account of a case of delusional pregnancy that developed in a schizophrenic patient with concurrent hyperprolactinemia induced by a primary endocrine disease. In this instance, however, amelioration of delusional beliefs did not ensue from hyperprolactinemia normalization, but was mostly due to cognitive restructuring of distorted thinking (together with the antipsychotic treatment). This finding confirms the importance of considering the key role of the interaction of biological, cognitive and psychological mechanisms in the construction of inaccurate beliefs and feelings about pregnancy.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia — serum prolactin testing during pregnancy advises: In pregnant patients with prolactinomas, we recommend against performing serum prolactin measurements during pregnancy. During pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase 10-fold, reaching levels of 150 to 300 μg/liter by term, and the pituitary gland increases in volume more than 2-fold; after dopamine agonists are discontinued at the start of pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase and subsequent increases do not accurately reflect changes in tumor growth or activity, prolactin may not increase during pregnancy in all patients with prolactinomas, and postpartum levels are frequently lower than before conception with hyperprolactinemia sometimes resolving entirely after pregnancy.

Supporting evidence notes that most patients with prolactin levels higher than 250 μg/liter will harbor a prolactinoma and that macroprolactinomas (> 10 mm in diameter) are typically associated with prolactin levels greater than 250 μg/liter, and that moderately elevated prolactin may occur with large nonfunctioning adenomas.

### Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, thyroid autoimmunity, and transient hyperprolactinemia [^113DKeRM]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency associated with thyroid autoimmunity, subclinical hypothyroidism, and transient hyperprolactinemia.

Methods

We present a detailed case report, including results of laboratory studies and magnetic resonance imaging, and discuss potential contributing factors in this setting.

Results

In a 23-year-old woman with isolated ACTH deficiency accompanied by thyroid autoimmunity (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), subclinical primary hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia, magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary showed normal findings but dynamic stimulation testing of the pituitary gland indicated an isolated ACTH deficiency with intact growth hormone and gonadotropin secretory reserves. The cortisol response to the short ACTH stimulation test was subnormal. Therapy with prednisolone (5 mg/day) and levothyroxine (100 microg/day) was initiated. Results of thyroid function tests were normalized after 1 month, the prolactin level decreased to normal after 1 year, and titers of thyroid autoantibodies decreased substantially after 1.5 years of treatment.

Conclusion

The correction of the related glucocorticoid deficiency resulted in resolution of the hyperprolactinemia and a decrease in titers of thyroid autoantibodies.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116HLXFb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — thyroid and prolactin assessment: Assessing thyroid function and prolactin levels is important in adolescents and women with FHA, and if a patient has more profound hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 100 ng/mL), she will require additional evaluation that is beyond the scope of this guideline; if TSH is low, one should consider a diagnostic assessment for thyrotoxicosis, especially if the free T4 is high, whereas if TSH is high, and free T4 is low or in the lower range of normal, then clinicians must consider subclinical hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism, and conversely, a normal or minimally elevated TSH with a low free T4 may indicate central hypothyroidism; in FHA, thyroid function is similar to that seen with any chronic illness, that is, TSH and free T4 levels in the lower range of normal, which generally reverse to normal with weight gain and psychological recovery, and evaluating basal pituitary hormones is usually sufficient to establish hypopituitarism while pituitary stimulation tests often do not determine the causes of the pituitary hypofunction; food, sleep, exercise, coitus, nipple stimulation, breast examination, lactation, and many medications can elevate prolactin concentrations.

Introduction

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize. As our case will demonstrate, however, there are a number of other causes that should be considered in any patient with otherwise unexplained hyperprolactinemia.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^115dXdb8]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea evaluation — prolactin and macroprolactin: Circulating levels in the range of 15–20 ng/mL will exclude hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea, and macroprolactinemia (molecular weight > 100 kDa) must be considered as a mechanism for persistently elevated prolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly MRI imaging, and because macroprolactin is biologically inert, macroprolactinemia is unlikely to be a cause of secondary amenorrhea.
