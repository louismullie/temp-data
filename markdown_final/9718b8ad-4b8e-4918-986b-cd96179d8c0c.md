## Question

alterd mental status pateint not waking up vitals normal. make a diagnostic plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a diagnostic plan for a patient with altered mental status who is "not waking up" despite normal vital signs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and rapidly reversible causes. Then, I should confirm core labs and toxicology screening. Next, I will address first-line neuroimaging and when to add EEG and lumbar puncture. After that, I need to consider targeted testing based on clinical clues and when to escalate to MRI. Finally, I should organize the differential by prevalence, outline key decision points, and specify reassessment and consultation triggers, all while cross-checking guideline support and diagnostic yields as I go [^114JoJvx] [^11197DCh] [^112f4jwX].

> Let me first confirm immediate priorities: even with "normal" vitals, I should secure airway, support breathing and circulation, place IV access, and initiate continuous monitoring, while documenting level of consciousness using GCS or, preferably, the FOUR score if available to mitigate known limitations of the GCS total score in reflecting true consciousness states [^114JoJvx] [^113bkHdP] [^117N2czz].

> Wait, let me verify the most time-critical reversible cause: obtain a STAT fingerstick glucose and treat hypoglycemia immediately with dextrose if present, without delaying for other tests; at the same time, give empiric thiamine 100 mg IV early, especially if malnutrition or alcohol use is suspected, to reduce risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy, while recognizing that dextrose should not be withheld pending thiamine when hypoglycemia is present [^114JoJvx] [^114U5dWA].

> Next, I should review core laboratory studies that commonly change management in undifferentiated AMS: BMP with electrolytes including sodium, calcium and magnesium, BUN/creatinine, CBC, liver panel, arterial or venous blood gas for acid-base disturbances, serum lactate, broad toxicology screening including ethanol, and targeted levels of suspect medications or antiepileptic drugs; I need to ensure thyroid function (TSH, free T4) if there are clues such as hypothermia, bradycardia, or elderly status, and ammonia if hepatic encephalopathy is in the differential [^114JoJvx] [^11197DCh] [^116nrVwh] [^115UFJgw].

> I will now examine first-line neuroimaging: when the cause is not immediately apparent from initial evaluation or a structural lesion is possible, obtain a non-contrast head CT expeditiously; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the diagnostic yield is modest overall in AMS, but remains appropriate to exclude time-sensitive intracranial processes, with pooled abnormal CT rates around 13% in ED/inpatient cohorts and higher in ICU settings [^11197DCh] [^115m1mG6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, should I order a routine chest radiograph for everyone with AMS? I initially thought yes, but I should double-check the evidence; the yield that alters management is modest and improves when respiratory symptoms, infection signs, or leukocytosis are present, so I will target chest imaging rather than apply it universally unless clinical clues warrant it [^114pRZ3Z].

> I need to ensure I do not miss nonconvulsive seizures: if altered mental status persists without explanation, if there is a seizure history, or if fluctuating consciousness is present, obtain EEG promptly and consider continuous EEG monitoring; nonconvulsive status epilepticus may be present in a small but meaningful fraction of AMS patients, and early EEG can change management [^114JoJvx] [^112SxSd7].

> Let me consider central nervous system infection next: if meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, perform lumbar puncture after excluding mass effect with CT when indicated by focal deficits, papilledema, or immunocompromise; send CSF cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain and culture, and add HSV PCR, starting empiric antimicrobials and acyclovir when clinical suspicion is high, because early treatment improves outcomes [^11197DCh] [^112iHeMu].

> But wait, what if CT is non-diagnostic yet the neurologic suspicion remains high? I should escalate to MRI brain, which is more sensitive for posterior fossa pathology, demyelination, early ischemia, or encephalitic changes, recognizing MRI's superior contribution to certain encephalopathy patterns compared with CT [^11197DCh] [^114XHzzr].

> Next, I should review targeted testing guided by clinical clues: review medication lists for serotonergic or anticholinergic toxicity and measure specific drug levels when indicated; consider theophylline levels in compatible histories; in appropriate populations, check pregnancy testing and evaluate for obstetric etiologies; include thyroid, B12, and ammonia when clinically suggested; maintain a high index of suspicion for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease; and in exposure-risk contexts, test for infections like TB or COVID-19 that may present with encephalopathy, revising the workup as new history or exam data emerge [^114zTvoy] [^111KR8eR] [^111hStWk] [^112iMe5v] [^115UFJgw] [^114pDeQk] [^114qXyuT].

> I will now organize the differential diagnosis framework by prevalence and clinical impact so I do not miss common and serious causes: toxicologic and medication-related etiologies are frequent, followed by neurologic causes such as seizure and stroke, infectious processes including sepsis-associated encephalopathy and CNS infections, metabolic and endocrine disturbances, traumatic etiologies, and primary psychiatric presentations; I should confirm this structure with local epidemiology and revisit it iteratively as data return [^114vhjci] [^113tSx4P] [^113cPYez] [^1128yLxQ].

> Hold on, I should verify reassessment cadence and consultation triggers: repeat the neurological examination and consciousness scale (GCS or FOUR) at regular intervals, escalate to ICU care for airway protection if GCS is 8 or below or if mental status is deteriorating, and involve neurology for EEG interpretation and further guidance; consult toxicology early for complex ingestions or polypharmacy, recognizing that diagnostic accuracy in early AMS can be challenging and benefits from multidisciplinary input [^113bkHdP] [^114JoJvx] [^112DrEiW].

> Let me reconsider key decision points to avoid missteps: intubate for airway protection when the patient cannot protect the airway regardless of "normal" vitals, prioritize head CT before LP when signs of mass effect are present, and narrow the diagnostic pursuit once a reversible cause is identified and the patient improves; if Phase 3 workup is unrevealing, broaden to less common etiologies such as autoimmune encephalitis or prion disease, integrating MRI, EEG, and CSF autoantibody testing as appropriate [^11197DCh] [^111JFJG8] [^117D5T3q].

> Finally, I should confirm that this staged approach aligns with guideline-backed algorithms: stabilize and correct immediately reversible causes, obtain focused labs and toxicology, perform timely CT, add EEG and LP when indicated, pursue targeted tests from history and exam, escalate to MRI as needed, and reassess continuously with early specialty involvement to reduce time to diagnosis and improve outcomes in undifferentiated AMS [^114JoJvx] [^11197DCh] [^112f4jwX].

For an unresponsive patient with normal vitals, the diagnostic plan is to **immediately check bedside glucose and give empiric thiamine, glucose, and naloxone** [^114JoJvx] [^112f4jwX] [^114U5dWA]. Next, perform a **focused neurologic exam** [^113bkHdP] and order urgent labs (CBC, CMP, ABG, lactate, ammonia, TSH, toxicology screen, ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylates, antiepileptic levels) [^112NYo2x] [^117Dwau1]. Obtain a **non-contrast head CT** [^11197DCh] to exclude structural causes, and if negative, get MRI brain [^114XHzzr] and EEG [^112SxSd7] to assess for nonconvulsive status epilepticus or encephalopathy [^114JoJvx]. If the diagnosis remains unclear, perform lumbar puncture with CSF analysis [^113cPYez] and consider autoimmune encephalitis testing [^111JFJG8]. Repeat neurologic exams and escalate to ICU if deterioration occurs [^1128yLxQ].

---

## Immediate bedside interventions

Perform a **bedside glucose check** to rapidly exclude hypoglycemia, a common reversible cause of AMS [^117Dwau1] [^114JoJvx], and give **empiric therapy** with thiamine (100 mg IV), glucose (50 mL of 50% dextrose IV), and naloxone (0.4–2 mg IV) to address potential Wernicke's encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, or opioid overdose [^114U5dWA] [^112f4jwX].

---

## Focused neurologic examination

- **Level of consciousness**: Assess using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) or FOUR score [^113bkHdP] [^117N2czz].

- **Pupillary response**: Evaluate for anisocoria, pinpoint, or dilated pupils, suggesting structural or toxicologic causes.

- **Motor response**: Check for posturing, asymmetry, or focal deficits indicating structural lesions.

- **Brainstem reflexes**: Assess corneal, gag, and oculocephalic reflexes to evaluate brainstem function [^113FsECM].

---

## Laboratory investigations

| **Laboratory test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| CBC, CMP, ABG, lactate | Identify metabolic, electrolyte, or acid-base disturbances [^112NYo2x] [^117Dwau1] |
| Ammonia, LFTs | Evaluate hepatic encephalopathy [^112NYo2x] [^115UFJgw] |
| TSH, free T4 | Assess thyroid dysfunction (myxedema coma) [^112NYo2x] [^116nrVwh] |
| Toxicology screen, ethanol, acetaminophen, salicylates | Detect toxic ingestions or overdoses [^112NYo2x] [^114vhjci] |
| Antiepileptic drug levels | Evaluate for drug toxicity or subtherapeutic levels [^114JoJvx] |

---

## Neuroimaging

Obtain a **non-contrast head CT** [^11197DCh] to rapidly exclude intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute ischemic stroke [^114JoJvx]. If CT is negative, follow with a **brain MRI** [^114XHzzr], which can detect subtle structural lesions, encephalitis, or demyelinating processes.

---

## Electroencephalography (EEG)

Obtain an **EEG** [^112SxSd7], which is essential to detect nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) [^114JoJvx] or diffuse encephalopathy — conditions that may present without overt seizures.

---

## Lumbar puncture (LP)

Indications for **lumbar puncture (LP)** include suspected infection (meningitis, encephalitis) [^112iHeMu] or autoimmune encephalitis [^111JFJG8] after imaging excludes mass effect; **CSF analysis** should include cell count, protein, glucose, Gram stain, culture, viral PCR (HSV, VZV, enterovirus), and an autoimmune encephalitis panel.

---

## Additional diagnostic considerations

- **Autoimmune encephalitis**: Consider anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis or other autoimmune causes if infectious and metabolic causes are excluded [^111JFJG8].

- **Paraneoplastic syndromes**: Evaluate for underlying malignancy if paraneoplastic encephalitis is suspected [^1158tLeA].

- **Toxic exposures**: Reassess history for potential toxic exposures or ingestions not initially identified [^113tSx4P].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Perform **serial neurologic exams** to detect changes or deterioration, and initiate **ICU monitoring** if clinical status worsens or if invasive monitoring is required [^115ai7cn].

---

## Summary of diagnostic plan

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Immediate bedside glucose check and empiric therapy (thiamine, glucose, naloxone) |
| 2 | Focused neurologic examination |
| 3 | Laboratory investigations (CBC, CMP, ABG, lactate, ammonia, LFTs, TSH, toxicology screen, antiepileptic drug levels) |
| 4 | Neuroimaging (non-contrast head CT, MRI brain) |
| 5 | EEG to detect NCSE or encephalopathy |
| 6 | Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis |
| 7 | Consider autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and toxicologic causes |
| 8 | Serial neurologic exams and ICU monitoring if needed |

---

A structured diagnostic plan for an unresponsive patient with normal vital signs includes immediate bedside interventions, focused neurologic examination, laboratory investigations, neuroimaging, **EEG**, and **lumbar puncture**. This approach ensures rapid identification and treatment of reversible causes, improving patient outcomes [^117Dwau1].

### Effect of microEEG on clinical management and outcomes of emergency department patients with altered mental status: a randomized controlled trial [^112SxSd7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Altered mental status (AMS) is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). A previous study revealed 78% electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, including nonconvulsive seizure (NCS; 5%) in ED patients with AMS. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of EEG on the clinical management and outcomes of ED patients with AMS.

This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at two urban teaching hospitals. Adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with AMS were included. Patients with immediately correctable AMS (e.g. hypoglycemia) or those admitted before enrollment were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive routine care (control) or routine care plus EEG (intervention). Research assistants used a scalp electrode set with a miniature, wireless EEG device (microEEG) to record standard 30-minute EEGs at presentation. Results were reported to the ED attending physician by an off-site epileptologist within 30 minutes. Primary outcomes included changes in ED management, such as differential diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, and treatment plan, from enrollment to disposition as determined by surveying the treating physicians. Secondary outcomes included length of ED and hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, and in-hospital mortality.

A total of 149 patients were enrolled, with 76 in the control group and 73 in the intervention group. Patients in the two groups were comparable at baseline. EEG in the intervention group revealed abnormal findings in 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 85% to 97%), including NCS in 5% (95% CI = 2% to 13%). Using microEEG was associated with changes in patient management.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^112yAfWC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Recognition is key**: Always maintain a high index of suspicion for sepsis. Maternal sepsis can present with multiple and varied symptoms, such as lethargy, chills and rigors, generalized malaise, rashes, lower abdominal or pelvic pain, foul lochia, contractions, malodorous or discolored leaking of fluid from the vagina, and breast engorgement. Signs of maternal sepsis include fever or hypothermia, tachycardia, hypotension, uterine tenderness, preterm labor or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, altered mental status, and end-organ dysfunction.

Although there are no standardized criteria to diagnose maternal sepsis, changes in vital signs are an early indicator of infection. However, these early vital sign changes may be dismissed as normal physiological changes of pregnancy, such as an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure. Additionally, external influences (e.g. blood loss during delivery, common infections, fluid administration, medications, and effects of anesthesia) may further confuse the clinical picture. Often, there is no obvious source of infection in maternal sepsis, making recognition more challenging and potentially resulting in delays in treatment and source control.

Because the symptoms of maternal sepsis are often nonspecific, health care professionals need to maintain a high index of suspicion. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends that health care professionals consider the diagnosis of sepsis in pregnant patients with otherwise unexplained end-organ damage in the presence of an infectious process, regardless of the presence of other symptoms.

### Altered mental status due to pruno intoxication [^111nmWXv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of alcohol intoxication might not be considered in patients coming from locations where access to alcohol is severely restricted or not permitted.

- **Objective**: We present a case of alcohol intoxication in a patient presenting from a military prison. The patient ingested an alcoholic beverage made in his prison cell with produce stolen from the prison cafeteria. We also discuss potential complications of "prison-brewed" alcoholic beverages.

- **Case report**: A 22-year-old male presented to the emergency department after being found in his cell with a depressed level of consciousness and next to a mouthwash bottle filled with a foul-smelling liquid. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 111 beats/min, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 11, no signs of injury or track marks on the skin, and intermittent agitation alternating with somnolence. Laboratory evaluation was significant for a serum ethanol level of 279 mg/dL. After a period of observation, mental status returned to normal and the patient admitted to making "pruno".

- **Conclusions**: Alcohol intoxication might be unexpected or not considered in patients that should have no access to common sources of ethanol. Awareness of methods of novel fermentation, even in incarcerated individuals, can assist in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with altered mental status.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute mental status change, delirium, and new onset psychosis [^115AkVzG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute changes in mental status represent a broad collection of symptoms used to describe disorders in mentation and level of arousal, including the more narrowly defined diagnoses of delirium and psychosis. A wide range of precipitating factors may be responsible for symptom onset, including infection, intoxication, and metabolic disorders. Neurologic causes that may be detected on neuroimaging include stroke, traumatic brain injury, nonconvulsive seizure, central nervous system infection, tumors, hydrocephalus, and inflammatory disorders. Not infrequently, two or more precipitating factors may be found. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is usually appropriate if the clinical suspicion for an acute neurological cause is high, where the cause of symptoms is not found on initial assessment, and for patients whose symptoms do not respond appropriately to management.

There was disagreement regarding the appropriateness of neuroimaging in cases where a suspected nonneurologic cause is found on initial assessment. Neuroimaging with CT is usually appropriate for patients presenting with delirium, although the yield may be low in the absence of trauma or a focal neurological deficit. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI may be appropriate in the evaluation of new onset psychosis, although the yield may be low in the absence of a neurologic deficit.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

### The mental status examination in emergency practice [^114D7PPV]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

A systematic approach to assessing mental status in the emergency department is key to identifying alterations in mental status and directing diagnostic testing and management. After initial stabilization of the patient, it is critical to assess a patient's alertness, attention, and cognition and to perform a brief psychiatric assessment to fully evaluate a patient with mental status changes. This article offers an approach to allow better management of a patient with altered mental status.

### Association between components of the delirium syndrome and outcomes in hospitalised adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bLDLj]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Delirium is a heterogeneous syndrome with inattention as the core feature. There is considerable variation in the presence and degree of other symptom domains such as altered arousal, psychotic features, and global cognitive dysfunction. Delirium is independently associated with increased mortality, but it is unclear whether individual symptom domains of delirium have prognostic importance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in hospitalised adults in general settings to identify the relationship between symptom domains of delirium and outcomes.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 2019. We included studies of hospitalised adults that reported associations between symptom domains of delirium and 30-day mortality (primary outcome), and other outcomes including mortality at other time points, length of stay, and dementia. Reviewer pairs independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies) and quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. We performed random-effects meta-analyses stratified by delirium domain where possible.

- **Results**: From 7,092 citations, we included 6 studies (6,002 patients, 1,112 with delirium). Higher mortality (ranging from in-hospital to follow-up beyond 12 months) was associated with altered arousal (pooled Odds Ratio (OR) 2.80, 95% Confidence Interval).

### Dazed and confused: Altered mental status in an adolescent male [^1133BV8h]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Absence status epilepticus (ASE) is a form of generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus. ASE is characterized by impaired consciousness, which can vary widely, making diagnosis difficult. The typical patient with ASE will be confused yet responsive, in a "trance-like state" with delayed speech, clumsy gait, and the ability to perform simple tasks after prompting. With treatment, typical ASE has an excellent prognosis and does not appear to be associated with significant neuronal damage.

- **Case presentation**: An 11-year-old boy with a history of febrile seizures presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status, without trauma or ingestion. His vital signs and physical examination were normal, except for appearing intoxicated with sparse verbalization and inappropriate emotional responses. All laboratory results and imaging were unremarkable. While in the ED, his neurological examination trended toward normal, returning almost to baseline. He was admitted to the hospital for a video electroencephalogram, which revealed status epilepticus. After benzodiazepine therapy, epileptic electrical activity ceased and the patient's symptoms resolved.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** ASE is a rare condition that is uncommonly described in the pediatric population. These patients are frequently misdiagnosed on initial presentation, as their alteration in mental status can be confused with ingestion, trauma, psychiatric illness, or infectious etiologies.

### Theo-24 [^114zTvoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdose management**: General recommendations for patients with symptoms of theophylline overdose or serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL. (Note: Serum theophylline concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care.) While simultaneously instituting treatment, contact a regional poison center to obtain updated information and advice on individualizing the recommendations that follow. Institute supportive care, including the establishment of intravenous access, maintenance of the airway, and electrocardiographic monitoring.

- **Treatment of seizures**: Due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with theophylline-induced seizures, treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated with an intravenous benzodiazepine, such as diazepam, in increments of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg every 1–3 minutes until seizures are terminated. Repetitive seizures should be treated with a loading dose of phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 30–60 minutes). Case reports of theophylline overdose in humans and animal studies suggest that phenytoin is ineffective in terminating theophylline-induced seizures. The doses of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital required to terminate theophylline-induced seizures are close to the doses that may cause severe respiratory depression or respiratory arrest; the healthcare professional should therefore be prepared to provide assisted ventilation. Elderly patients and patients with COPD may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of anticonvulsants.

### Delirium disorder: Integrating delirium and acute encephalopathy [^115ZrRZ1]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

As the US population ages and with no definitive delirium treatments on the horizon, the delirium epidemic is on course to expand over the coming decades. Recognizing the importance of this condition, a recent position statement from 10 medical societies, including the American Academy of Neurology, issued recommendations on the preferred nomenclature of delirium and acute encephalopathy. It concluded by preferring both terms. Urgently needed is an integrated model that addresses the near-total segregation of these separate bodies of literature, ideally one that offers an interdisciplinary framework to bring these two terms and those who use them together.

- **Methods**: We review the historical forces that have led these terms to diverge and consider the unique benefits of each approach as well as their liabilities when considered in isolation. We then explore the potential implications of integrating these concepts and propose a hybrid model to capitalize on the strengths of both the model of delirium and that of acute encephalopathy.

- **Results**: The model we propose, delirium disorder, builds on the recommendations of this recent position statement and provides a unifying framework designed to have clinical utility and interdisciplinary appeal. It also broadens the translational landscape by identifying four distinct treatment targets: underlying causes, procognitive factors, delirium (phenotype alone), and neurophysiologic targets.

- **Conclusions**: This person-centered model aims to integrate delirium and acute encephalopathy within a single framework and shared nomenclature.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® altered mental status, coma, delirium, and psychosis: 2024 update [^11197DCh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Altered mental status (AMS) and coma are terms used to describe disorders of arousal and content of consciousness. AMS may account for up to 4% to 10% of chief complaints in the emergency department setting and is a common accompanying symptom for other presentations. AMS is not a diagnosis, but rather a term for symptoms of acute or chronic disordered mentation, including confusion, disorientation, lethargy, drowsiness, somnolence, unresponsiveness, agitation, altered behavior, inattention, hallucinations, delusions, and psychosis. Some of the most common disorders associated with AMS are underlying medical conditions, substance use, and mental disorders.

This document focuses on the appropriateness of neuroimaging in adult patients presenting with AMS changes, including new onset delirium or new onset psychosis. In these cases, imaging is often expedited for initial stabilization and to exclude an intracranial process requiring intervention. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Diagnosing level of consciousness: The limits of the Glasgow Coma Scale total score [^117N2czz]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Low credibility.

In nearly all clinical and research contexts, the initial severity of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) total score. However, the GCS total score may not accurately reflect the level of consciousness, a critical indicator of injury severity. We investigated the relationship between GCS total scores and level of consciousness in a consecutive sample of 2,455 adult subjects assessed with the GCS 69,487 times as part of the multi-center Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study. We assigned each GCS subscale score combination a level of consciousness rating based on published criteria for the following disorders of consciousness (DoC) diagnoses: coma, vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, minimally conscious state, and post-traumatic confusional state.

Participants had the following characteristics: mean (standard deviation) age 41.9 (17.6) years, 69% male, initial GCS 3–8 = 13%; 9–12 = 5%; 13–15 = 82%. All GCS total scores between 4–14 were associated with more than one DoC diagnosis; the greatest variability was observed for scores of 7–11. Further, a wide range of total scores was associated with identical DoC diagnoses. Importantly, a diagnosis of coma was only possible with GCS total scores of 3–6. The GCS total score does not accurately reflect level of consciousness based on published DoC diagnostic criteria. To improve the classification of patients with TBI and to inform the design of future clinical trials, clinicians need to consider these findings.

### Atypical eclampsia in a normotensive patient with altered mental status and severely elevated transaminases: Case report and review [^111hStWk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Low credibility.

Classically, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are considered hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with diagnostic criteria including hypertension with proteinuria or other laboratory abnormalities or symptoms suggestive of end-organ damage. However, atypical presentations can occur in the absence of elevated blood pressures.

We present the case of a pregnant patient who developed status epilepticus at 24 weeks and 4 days of gestation, followed by altered mental status and severely elevated transaminases. She had no elevated blood pressures during her prenatal care or hospital course. Following delivery, she experienced normalization of transaminase levels and a return to her baseline mental status.

Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia can occur in the absence of elevated blood pressures, which highlights the limitations of using standard diagnostic criteria in normotensive patients with end-organ damage. In such cases, it is important to include pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in the differential diagnosis, as the diagnosis usually warrants preterm delivery to minimize maternal morbidity and mortality.

### Recognition and management of a malignant hyperthermia crisis: Updated 2024 guideline from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group [^115GMSXi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for malignant hyperthermia, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, the EMHG 2025 guidelines recommend including the following in the differential diagnosis of suspected MH:

- **Insufficient anesthesia, analgesia, or both**: This can be a complicating factor and should be considered when analyzing symptoms.

- **Infection or sepsis**: Both should be ruled out as potential causes due to overlapping symptoms with malignant hyperthermia.

- **Insufficient ventilation or fresh gas flow**: Ensure proper ventilation settings to avoid misdiagnosis.

- **Anesthetic machine malfunction**: Regular machine checks are essential to prevent equipment-related issues.

- **Anaphylactic reaction**: Consider and manage this possibility with appropriate interventions if presented.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: This tumor-associated condition can mimic similar symptoms.

- **Thyroid crisis**: Hyperthyroidism can present similarly and must be excluded.

- **Cerebral ischemia**: This condition should be investigated if neurological symptoms are evident.

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Rule out these disorders through comprehensive diagnostic tests.

- **Elevated ETCO2 due to laparoscopic surgery**: This postoperative complication should be considered when assessing elevated CO2 levels.

- **Ecstasy or other recreational drugs**: Substance use can cause similar hypermetabolic symptoms.

- **Malignant neuroleptic syndrome**: Differentiate this syndrome from malignant hyperthermia with targeted investigation.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: This drug-related syndrome can also mimic hyperthermic symptoms and must be considered.

### Decompensated hypothyroidism: A review for the emergency clinician [^116nrVwh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Decompensated hypothyroidism, formerly known as myxedema coma, is an endocrine emergency that commonly presents with altered mental status, as well as hypothermia and depressed vital signs. The condition is often caused by an inciting event, which may lead to significant delays in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Although the incidence is low, this disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of this condition.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine diagnosis and management of adult patients with decompensated hypothyroidism.

- **Discussion**: Decompensated hypothyroidism is a severe hypothyroid state associated with multiple organ failure. The diagnosis can be challenging due to similarities with more common diseases and lack of consideration of the diagnosis. Many patients may present with altered sensorium or depressed vital signs. Clinicians should obtain a thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine level when considering the diagnosis. Management involves resuscitation, early steroid supplementation, thyroid hormone replacement, and treatment of the inciting event.

- **Conclusions**: Decompensated hypothyroidism should be considered in the evaluation of patients with altered sensorium and depressed vital signs so as to not miss this critical diagnosis.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114D4UXd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in the context of differential diagnosis, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend conducting a neurological examination in patients presenting with a seizure to identify the cause. Attribute a seizure to alcohol withdrawal only if there has been a recent cessation of, or reduction in, alcohol consumption.

Obtain an EEG and/or neuroimaging in patients experiencing new onset seizures or in those with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures that show a new pattern. Avoid additional neurological testing and neurology consultation in patients with a known history of withdrawal seizure presenting with a seizure attributable to alcohol withdrawal, including generalized seizures without focal elements. This is applicable when a thorough neurological examination reveals no evidence of focal deficits, and there is no suspicion of meningitis or other causes.

### Use of multiple anticholinergic medications can predispose patients to severe non-exertional hyperthermia [^111KR8eR]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

When the patient first presented to the emergency department, she was febrile with a high temperature, leukocytosis, and hypotension. Initially, she was suspected to be severely septic and was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, upon admission to the ICU, there was concern regarding her home medications due to potential drug–drug interactions. Serotonin syndrome was considered because of the serotonergic actions of trazodone, amitriptyline, lurasidone, and cyclobenzaprine. However, suspicion for this was low as she presented with no neurological deficits other than altered mental status. Blood cultures were obtained, and a toxicology consultation was requested to assist the team in making a final diagnosis.

Surprisingly, blood cultures were positive for S. hominis, a part of the skin flora mainly found in nosocomial infections. Toxicology's assessment suggested that in the context of high ambient temperature, non-exertional hyperthermia (NEHT) was likely precipitated by the multiple home anticholinergic medications. Once the patient's mental state improved to baseline, she revealed that she had been feeling overheated and fatigued at home for the past two weeks. No medication changes had been made during that time period.

### A clinical approach to diagnosing encephalopathy [^114R7sxk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Encephalopathy refers to dysfunction of the level or contents of consciousness due to brain dysfunction and can result from global brain insults or focal lesions. The underlying causes of encephalopathy include both primary neurologic and systemic conditions. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy, with a focus on primary neurologic causes. A practical schema for organizing the differential diagnosis is to group etiologies by their pace of onset and evolution (e.g. sudden, acute, subacute, chronic).

### Evaluation of coma: a critical appraisal of popular scoring systems [^113bkHdP]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Numerous scoring scales have been proposed and validated to evaluate coma for rapid pre-hospital assessment and triage, disease severity, and prognosis for morbidity and mortality. These scoring systems have been predicated on core features that serve as a basis for this review and include ease of use, inter-rater reliability, reproducibility, and predictive value. Here we review the benefits and limitations of the most popular coma scoring systems. The methods include searches of Medline databases and manual reviews of article bibliographies.

Few of the many available coma scales have gained widespread approval and popularity. The best known and widely accepted scale is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The Reaction Level Scale (RLS85) has utility and proven benefit, but little acceptance outside of Scandinavia. The newer Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) score provides an attractive replacement for all patients with fluctuating levels of consciousness and is gradually gaining wide acceptance.

### Altered mental status in a child with an unwitnessed fall: A case report [^111ASQiB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

We report a case of altered mental status in a 5-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department after presumed head trauma. A computed tomography head scan was conducted, and its findings were normal. The boy was then discharged home. He returned the next day with persistent altered mental status and was found to have an abnormal MR brain suggestive of embolic strokes. An echocardiogram revealed a large atrial mass, later confirmed by pathology to be an atrial myxoma. This is a unique and, to our knowledge, unreported presentation of a known but rare disease process in a pediatric patient.

### Diagnosis of reversible causes of coma [^112f4jwX]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Because coma has many causes, physicians must develop a structured, algorithmic approach to diagnose and treat reversible causes rapidly. The three main mechanisms of coma are structural brain lesions, diffuse neuronal dysfunction, and, rarely, psychiatric causes. The first priority is to stabilize the patient by treating life-threatening conditions, then using the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings to identify structural causes and diagnose treatable disorders. Some patients have a clear diagnosis. In those who do not, the first decision is whether brain imaging is needed. Imaging should be performed in post-traumatic coma or when structural brain lesions are probable or possible causes. Patients who do not undergo imaging should be reassessed regularly. If a CT is non-diagnostic, a checklist should be used to indicate whether advanced imaging is needed or if there is evidence of a treatable poisoning or infection, seizures including non-convulsive status epilepticus, endocrinopathy, or thiamine deficiency.

### Altered and unstable: Wet beriberi, a clinical review [^114U5dWA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated altered mental status and hemodynamic instability are common presenting complaints in the Emergency Department (ED). Emergency practitioners do not have the luxury of time to perform sequential examination, history, testing, diagnosis, and treatment; rather, we do all of these things at once to save lives and decrease morbidity. An important diagnosis to consider, and upon which we can easily intervene, is that of thiamine deficiency.

- **Objectives**: We present a case of an altered and unstable woman who presented to our busy ED and had rapid improvement after the administration of vitamin B1. We discuss the presentation, pathophysiology, consequences of missed diagnosis, and management of this disease process.

- **Case report**: A middle-aged woman presented to our ED with unstable vital signs and an alteration in her mental status. She was unable to provide a history. Empiric treatment with thiamine resulted in the resolution of her hemodynamic instability and improvement in her mental status.

- **Conclusion**: Our patient benefited from the swift administration of thiamine and illustrates the importance of thiamine administration in the altered or hemodynamically unstable emergency patient with an elevated lactate.

### Going skin deep: Excavating a diagnosis of intravascular large B cell lymphoma [^1158tLeA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A fever of unknown origin is often pursued diagnostically under the framework of infectious, rheumatologic, and neoplastic causes. When encephalopathy ensues, the differential diagnosis narrows, but it can remain elusive, particularly when dealing with rare diseases.

We present the case of a patient with a fever of unknown origin and intermittent encephalopathy that spanned multiple hospital admissions and ultimately yielded a diagnosis of intravascular large B cell lymphoma complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We review the varying presentations of this disease, when to consider this as a diagnosis, and how to most accurately make the diagnosis.

### Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: A new name for the vegetative state or apallic syndrome [^115cpyyS]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In addition to this malaise regarding the chosen term and its unintended denigrating connotation, some feel that referring to these patients as being in a state may (incorrectly) denote chronicity. Despite the fact that the clinical criteria of the vegetative state do not imply a temporal dimension, referring only to a clinical tableau reflecting wakeful unawareness, for many physicians and healthcare workers, it has the negative connotation of being a longstanding and nearly irreversible condition. The introduction of the term persistent vegetative state (too often confounded with permanent vegetative state, with which it unfortunately shares the same abbreviation, PVS) may have contributed to this.

In contrast to coma, which is an acute and transitory condition lasting no more than days or weeks, a vegetative state may become chronic, lasting for decades, or may remain a transitory condition on the way to further recovery. This recently led the Aspen Neurobehavioral Conference Workgroup to characterize a new clinical entity coined the 'minimally conscious state' (MCS), describing patients who have recovered from a vegetative state, meaning they show more than reflex motor behavior but fail to show functional communication or object use. Despite clear evidence that vegetative patients are not uniformly hopeless, once stamped with the diagnosis VS, clinical practice shows it often is difficult to change the label, and the first signs of recovery of consciousness are too often missed. Previous studies by Childs et al. in Texas and Andrews et al. in London have estimated…

### Clinical reasoning: Patient with prior spinal cord injury who developed altered mental status following a fall [^111Lahft]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old man with a history of complete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) at C5-C7 three years prior presented with unresponsiveness and hypoxia following a fall. There were no overt signs of bruising or swelling. After an extensive and unrevealing initial workup, an MRI of the brain without contrast showed numerous diffusely scattered punctate foci of diffusion restriction and evidence of numerous microhemorrhages. A full-body skeletal survey revealed mildly affected, nondisplaced, incomplete fractures in the distal femoral metaphyses bilaterally.

This case presentation discusses specific considerations for patients with SCI, reviewing the differential diagnosis, workup, and management of altered mental status after minor falls or other trauma in this population.

### Is the chest x-ray an appropriate screening exam for ER patients with AMS [^114pRZ3Z]. Emergency Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency department patients with altered mental status (AMS) regularly undergo a routine chest radiograph at our institution. While there are many causes of chest pathology seen on the chest radiograph that may cause an altered mental status, it is not clear that a routine chest radiograph for these patients affects management. The goal of this study is to determine if a chest radiograph is an appropriate screening examination for AMS. This is a retrospective review of 100 consecutive patients who underwent head computed tomography for altered mental status in the emergency department and had a chest radiograph during the same visit.

Of 100 patients undergoing a routine chest radiograph for AMS, 17 had findings which altered patient care. Fifteen of those patients had signs or symptoms which clearly indicated that a chest radiograph was needed, and the other two had leukocytosis. The routine performance of a chest radiograph for patients presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status affected medical management in 17%, providing a modest benefit. The positive predictive value of a chest x-ray in these patients may be improved if certain symptomatologies are present.

### Etiologies of altered mental status in patients with presumed ethanol intoxication [^113tSx4P]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Altered mental status is a commonly evaluated problem in the ED. Ethanol intoxication is common, and prehospital history may bias emergency physicians to suspect this as the cause of altered mental status. Quantitative ethanol measurement can rapidly confirm the diagnosis, or if negative, prompt further evaluation. Our objective was to identify the etiologies of altered mental status in ED patients initially presumed to be intoxicated with ethanol but found to have negative quantitative ethanol levels.

- **Methods**: This was a 5-year (2012–2016) electronic medical record review of ED patients presenting with altered mental status. Patients were included if they presented with presumed ethanol intoxication and had an initial ethanol concentration of zero. Etiologies of altered mental status were categorized into medical, traumatic, psychiatric, and drug-related causes.

- **Results**: 29,322 patients presented during the study period with presumed alcohol intoxication; 1,875 patients had negative ethanol levels. The etiology of altered mental status was due to illicit substances in 1,337 patients (71%), psychiatric causes in 354 patients (19%), medical causes in 166 patients (9%), and trauma in 18 patients (1%). A total of 179 patients (10%) were admitted to the hospital; 19 patients (1%) to the ICU.

- **Conclusions**: The presumptive diagnosis of ethanol intoxication in patients presenting to the ED with altered mental status was inaccurate in 5% of patients. The etiology of altered mental status was serious and required hospitalization in 10% of the cohort.

### Altered mental status: Evaluation and etiology in the ED [^114vhjci]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the etiologies responsible for altered mental status (AMS) in an emergency department (ED) population, gauge the diagnostic (DX) value of various features of the clinical evaluation, and examine patient outcomes. Prospective identification of patients with AMS was followed by a retrospective review of the medical record in a university hospital ED. Among the ED patients with AMS, 317 (5% of the ED patient volume) were identified, with a mean age of 49 years (57% men).

Descriptions of AMS included: 24% unresponsive, 46% lethargic/difficult to arouse, 12% agitated, and 18% unusual behavior. The most common discharge diagnoses accounting for AMS were neurologic (28%) and toxicologic (21%), followed by trauma (14%), psychiatric (14%), infectious (10%), endocrine/metabolic (5%), pulmonary (3%), oncologic (3%), cardiovascular (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and renal (1%).

- **Diagnostic value**:
	- **High DX value**: History of present event (51%), past medical history (43%), and physical examination (41%).
	- **Low DX value**: Radiographs (16%), 12-lead electrocardiogram (7%), and various laboratory studies, including chemistry panel (5%), complete blood count (1%), coagulation panel (0%), and urinalysis (11%).

Sixty-four percent of the patients were admitted with a mean hospital stay of 7.6 days, and there was a 9% mortality rate. Common causes of AMS included neurologic, toxicologic, traumatic, and psychiatric syndromes.

### Altered mental status and seizures in a 3-year-old with suspected anemia [^1121THMg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Altered mental status and seizures are chief complaints frequently seen in pediatric emergency departments. A multitude of disease processes can cause pediatric patients to present with these complaints, so it is important to consider broad differential diagnoses. Here, we present the case of a 3-year-old patient with acute-onset mental status change and new-onset seizures who we diagnosed with a disorder not commonly seen in children, but one that requires prompt initiation of therapy.

### The etiology and outcome of non-traumatic coma in critical care: A systematic review [^1128yLxQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Coma is a serious condition requiring immediate medical decision-making upon arrival at the emergency department or intensive care unit (ICU). As coma can originate from many different etiologies and is life-threatening, it represents a challenge for emergency or critical care physicians. Approximately 5% of patients present to the emergency department with an altered mental state and 1% of admissions to the emergency department are due to coma. Coma is also a frequent cause for subsequent admission to the ICU. Although there is no consensus on the precise cut-off point to define coma, generally a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score lower than 10 points is used. Coma without a history of a traumatic event is an accompanying feature of many different conditions, such as severe sepsis, poisoning, and hepatic encephalopathy. These conditions, or the coma resulting from them, can be fatal if not detected or treated adequately.

- **Diagnosis and differentiation**: Usually, as a first diagnostic step, a differentiation is made between traumatic and non-traumatic coma (NTC). However, determining the cause of NTC is a challenge for physicians. In order to make adequate treatment decisions for patients suffering from NTC, it is vitally important to differentiate its etiology. An important first discrimination should be made between structural and non-structural causes of NTC by means of a computed tomography (CT) scan. Structural coma can be due to cerebral infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial malignancy, and central nervous system infection (e.g. encephalitis or abscess).

### Evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma [^115Dd149]. Clinics in Sports Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Blunt abdominal trauma is a medical condition associated with various symptoms and clinical signs. These may include altered mental status, abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, abdominal tenderness, and tachycardia. Other findings can be pneumoperitoneum, costal margin tenderness, hypotension, shock, seat belt sign, concomitant femur fracture, and increased white blood cell (WBC) count. Decreased hematocrit, free intraperitoneal fluid, microscopic hematuria (25 RBCs/hpf), and decreased serum base deficit are also potential indicators.

Additional observations may consist of abdominal guarding, abnormal chest radiograph, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, costal margin tenderness, and femur fracture. Furthermore, laboratory findings such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 130 U/L, increased serum lactate, and peritoneal findings like abdominal distension must be considered.

### Encephalitis [^112iHeMu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is a serious and potentially treatable infection of the central nervous system, with a pathogen identified in less than 50% of cases. The differential diagnosis includes acute infection, immune-mediated causes, and other central nervous system processes. Emergent investigations include blood work, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuroimaging. Empiric acyclovir and antibiotics should be started immediately to maximize the child's chance of neurologic recovery.

### The diagnostic value of the neurological examination in coma of unknown etiology [^113FsECM]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

There are several reasons that may explain the shortcomings of the neurological examination as a diagnostic tool in unconscious patients. Ideally, primary structural brain pathologies underlying disorders of consciousness should be clinically detectable by abnormal neurological findings. However, even in patients with unimpaired consciousness, the sensitivity of many clinical tests such as testing for meningism is well below 100%. A recent meta-analysis reported a sensitivity of 46.1% for nuchal rigidity in patients with suspected meningitis. A Cochrane review indicated a sensitivity of 75.5% for the jolt accentuation of headache, which decreased to 65.3% when patients with impaired consciousness were included.

Further, significant abnormal findings in unconscious patients are also found in patients without acute brain damage and systemic disorders. Obviously, constricted pupils are caused by opioid intoxication more often than by isolated pontine damage. But maybe less obviously, the whole range of possible metabolic disorders (depending on their severity) may also cause asymmetrical neurological abnormalities that may be misleading. Moreover, neurological abnormalities may have been pre-existing and may thus falsely suggest acute structural brain damage. Not knowing a patient's detailed past medical history, which is often the case early on in an emergency, may therefore also misdirect the course of management if major decisions are mainly based on clinical findings. Neurological abnormalities are thus generally not entirely specific for acute neurological causes.

### Recent-onset altered mental status: Evaluation and management [^117Dwau1]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Potential precipitating factors for the recent onset of altered mental status (AMS) include primary central nervous system insults, systemic infections, metabolic disturbances, toxin exposure, medications, chronic systemic diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Delirium is also an important manifestation of AMS, especially in older people who are hospitalized. Clinicians should identify and treat reversible causes of AMS, some of which require urgent intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality.

A history and physical examination guide diagnostic testing. Laboratory testing, chest radiography, and electrocardiography help diagnose infections, metabolic disturbances, toxins, and systemic conditions. Neuroimaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed when the initial evaluation does not identify a cause or raises concern for intracranial pathology. Lumbar puncture and electroencephalography are also important diagnostic tests in the evaluation of AMS.

Patients at increased risk of AMS benefit from preventive measures. The underlying etiology determines the definitive treatment. When intervention is needed to control patient behaviors that threaten themselves or others, nonpharmacologic interventions are preferred to medications. Physical restraints should rarely be used and only for the shortest time possible. Medications should be used only when nonpharmacologic treatments are ineffective.

### Accuracy of the initial diagnosis among patients with an acutely altered mental status [^112DrEiW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives of this prospective observational study were to determine the accuracy of physician diagnosis in patients with an acutely altered mental status (AMS) within the first 20 minutes of emergency department (ED) presentation and to assess if physician confidence in early diagnosis correlates with the accuracy of diagnosis.

A prospective observational convenience study was conducted on 112 adult patients who presented to an urban county ED with AMS (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≤ 14) between August 2008 and July 2009. Within the first 20 minutes of patient presentation to the ED, treating physicians were asked to record their best diagnostic guess of the cause of the patient's AMS and their confidence in this diagnosis. Serial hourly GCS was performed and the results of all diagnostic testing were recorded. Blinded investigators determined the final consensus diagnostic cause of the patient's AMS.

The final consensus diagnoses for AMS etiologies were as follows: isolated alcohol intoxication 31%, other (psychotic episodes, underlying dementia) 21%, combination alcohol/other drug intoxications 18%, isolated other drug intoxications 10%, other metabolic derangements 6%, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack 4%, seizures/post-ictal states 4%, traumatic brain injuries 3%, isolated opiate intoxications 2%, isolated benzodiazepine intoxication 1%, and septic episode 1%. The emergency physician's initial diagnosis of the AMS patient correlated with the accuracy of the final diagnosis (r² = 0.807).

### Sepsis-associated encephalopathy and its differential diagnosis [^113cPYez]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, associated with increased mortality and consistent with delirium, but it can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities in electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased biomarkers of brain injury (i.e. neuron-specific enolase, S-100 beta-protein), and frequently by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries.

Diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination, which can lead to specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging is recommended in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs, or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both are needed when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis.

Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, while avoiding neurotoxic drugs.

### Six-year-old with altered mental status: No "LACk" of clues [^114khubd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 6-year-old child presented to our emergency department following a brief seizure associated with hypoglycemia. The differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia can often lead to excessive testing and initiation of unnecessary therapies. It is well-known that alcohol ingestion can lead to hypoglycemia and potentially seizure in children and should be considered in pediatric patients with altered mental status. However, this child's presenting ethanol level was normal. Nonetheless, there were multiple clues that this was most likely the following diagnosis: hypoglycemia, mild metabolic ketoacidosis with no osmolar gap, and transient lactic acidemia. Ultimately, review of further history made this the most likely diagnosis. This case emphasizes that despite lacking the evidence of an elevated blood ethanol level at presentation, toxic ingestion of ethanol should still be suspected in cases of altered mental status and hypoglycemia.

### Etiologies and delirium rates of elderly ED patients with acutely altered mental status: A multicenter prospective study [^112iMe5v]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The study investigates the challenging diagnosis of altered mental status (AMS) in older patients, who can present with a wide range of etiologies. The aim is to enhance physician awareness of AMS backgrounds to improve outcomes and reduce mortality rates.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study was conducted at four emergency departments. Patients aged 65 years and older, presenting with acute AMS (lasting ≤ 1 week) and symptoms ranging from comas to combativeness, were included. The outcomes, etiologies, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores, and the presence of delirium were recorded.

- **Results**: Among 822 older patients with AMS, infection (39.5%) and neurological diseases (36.5%) were identified as the most common etiologies. The hospital admission and mortality rates were 73.7% (n = 606) and 24.7% (n = 203), respectively. The mortality rate increased if AMS persisted for more than three days. Delirium was observed in 55.7% of the patients, who experienced longer durations of AMS compared to those without delirium (median, 24 hours; interquartile range, 3–48 hours; median 6 hours, interquartile range, 3–48 hours, respectively; p = 0.010). Notably, more than two-thirds of neurological patients experienced delirium.

- **Conclusions**: Infections and neurological diseases were the most common causes of AMS. Delirium was associated with AMS in nearly half the patients. Moreover, the rates of hospitalization and mortality remained high.

### Stabilizing and managing patients with altered mental status and delirium [^115ai7cn]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Present in all patient populations, altered mental status (AMS) is a common but nonspecific emergency department (ED) presentation that can signify serious underlying pathology. Delirium is a more defined mental status change caused by another medical condition that carries high morbidity and mortality if missed. However, ED physicians miss the condition in more than 50% of cases. The ED physician should maintain a high index of suspicion for delirium because if missed in the ED, delirium is more likely to be missed on the floors as well. Management of delirium is directed toward treating the underlying cause.

### Diagnostic challenges of central nervous system tuberculosis [^114pDeQk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) of the central nervous system (CNS) is classically described as meningitis. However, altered mental status, including encephalitis, is within the spectrum of clinical manifestations. Because early treatment can dramatically improve outcomes, consideration of TB as a potential pathogen in CNS infections, including encephalitis, is vital. The California Encephalitis Project (CEP), initiated in 1998 to study the causative agents, epidemiology, and clinical features of encephalitis, has identified 20 cases of culture-confirmed tuberculous encephalitis. In most instances, TB was not initially considered to be a likely cause.

### What to see when you are looking at confusion: A review of the neuroimaging of acute encephalopathy [^114XHzzr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Acute encephalopathy presents as a clinical conundrum in neurocritical care, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to physicians. It arises from several causes, and delayed diagnosis can worsen its already grim prognosis. Diagnosis is achieved by combining clinical, neurophysiological, and biochemical features with various neuroimaging studies.

The study aimed to compile the pathophysiology of acute encephalopathies in adults and the contribution of cerebral CT, MRI, MR spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) to early diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication. Reports from 1990 to 2013 were reviewed, and reference lists were searched to identify additional publications.

Encephalopathy syndromes best studied by neuroimaging include those resulting from hypoxic-ischaemic injury, sepsis, metabolic derangements, autoimmune diseases, infections, and rapidly evolving dementias. Typical and pathognomonic neuroimaging patterns are presented. Cerebral imaging is vital for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of acute encephalopathy. Its contribution is significant in rapidly excluding acute cerebral lesions and varies greatly depending on the underlying aetiology and possible differential diagnoses.

CT has been well studied but is largely insensitive, whereas MRI appears to be the most helpful in evaluating encephalopathies. MRS may provide supplementary biochemical information and determines spectral changes in affected brain tissue. The less frequently used PET and SPECT may also offer valuable insights.

### Patient with altered mental status [^113S6fLK]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department after being found confused, non-verbal, and with low urine output in a nursing home. Her last known well was around 6 o'clock in the morning before presentation. Her temperature was 94.5°F, blood pressure (BP) was 179/80 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) was 50/min, and saturation was 97% on room air. She was cold to touch. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. She was noted to have gaze preference initially to the right, then to the left, right-sided weakness, and left facial droop. A code stroke was activated; however, the CT head showed no acute pathology. Laboratory results were significant for a white cell count of 12,500 cells/mm³ and a pH of 7.35. An hour later, her BP dropped to 88/50 mm Hg, and HR was 42/min with no rectal temperature measurement detected despite multiple attempts. The patient was started on intravenous fluids (IVF). Her ECG on presentation and an hour later are shown in Figure 1A, B.

### Clinical approach to the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis in the pediatric patient [^111JFJG8]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Existing diagnostic criteria for AE: The International Encephalitis Consortium 2013 diagnostic criteria for encephalitis of presumed infectious or autoimmune etiology require patients to have an altered mental status lasting more than 24 hours with no alternative cause identified. Confirmation of this diagnosis requires at least three minor criteria, including fever within 72 hours of presentation; new-onset focal neurologic findings; CSF leukocytosis; acute new neuroimaging abnormality suggestive of encephalitis; or EEG abnormalities consistent with encephalitis. These criteria do not differentiate autoimmune from infectious encephalitis.

More recently, an international group developed diagnostic criteria for the early diagnosis of AE in adults, which require: (1) subacute onset over less than 3 months of working memory deficits, altered mental status, or psychiatric symptoms; (2) at least one of the following: new focal CNS findings, seizures not explained by a preexisting disorder, CSF pleocytosis, and/or MRI features suggestive of encephalitis; and (3) reasonable exclusion of alternative causes. Specific neurologic syndromes were given criteria, including limbic encephalitis, anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and autoantibody-negative AE.

These AE criteria required modification to be applied to children. For example, deficits in working memory are challenging to identify in younger children. Also, children are less likely to present with a well-defined neurologic syndrome, and even in anti-NMDAR encephalitis, the sequence of symptom development may differ from adults.

### Integrative basic sciences: Change in mental status [^11614bKe]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

This case discussion is part of the Integrating Basic Science Into Clinical Teaching Initiative. It examines the presentation of altered mental status and describes the underlying physiology, which explains the basic laboratory findings in an attempt to reach a diagnosis. This article describes a 13-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status after being found unconscious and alone in an abandoned building. He was unresponsive to painful and verbal stimuli, with otherwise normal findings on physical examination.

Basic laboratory studies, including arterial blood gas, electrolytes, and serum osmolality, were obtained. The case discussion uses fundamentals of anatomy to build a focused differential diagnosis. The laboratory studies are interpreted using basic physiologic principles, including acid-base balance, anion gap, and osmolar gap, to determine the most likely cause of this patient's altered mental status.

Subsequent investigation confirms a diagnosis of ethanol toxic effects. An understanding of electrolyte and acid-base physiology allows the clinician to use basic laboratory studies to build a focused differential diagnosis for altered mental status. This case discussion demonstrates how basic science principles of anatomy and physiology can be applied in clinical settings.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115QwBEZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive assessment of the patient's signs, symptoms, and history as part of the differential diagnosis. It is important to exclude other serious illnesses that may mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and determine if patients are on medications that could mask the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

### Seizures as a cause of altered mental status [^111MG6An]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis and empiric management of altered mental status and seizures often overlap. Altered mental status may accompany seizures or simply be the manifestation of a postictal state. This article provides an overview of the numerous causes of altered mental status and seizures, including metabolic, toxic, malignant, infectious, and endocrine causes.

The article focuses on agents that should prompt the emergency physician to initiate unique therapy to abate the seizure and correct the underlying cause.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^115bWXJi]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

It is recognized that the primary differential diagnosis involves separating ITES from encephalitis, which is important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons. To aid in this separation, clinical, biological, and investigation features of ITES, infectious encephalitis, and inflammatory/autoimmune encephalitis are provided.

For the diagnosis of ITES, our consensus definition recommends a two-step approach. Patients are first evaluated to determine whether they meet the general diagnostic criteria for ITES, and then whether they meet the individual ITES criteria, specifically for AESD, ANE, MERS, AFCE, and ASEM.

- **Core ITES criteria**: The criteria include the presence of a febrile illness followed by neurological symptoms such as encephalopathy (decreased or altered level of consciousness, altered mental status, lethargy, or personality change). Seizures are another commonly observed symptom. Additional symptoms, including dyskinesia or cerebellar ataxia, may be seen. Neurological symptoms, by definition, appear within 7 days of the previous infection, typically within 2 days when the previous infection is still active, and fever is still present. The diagnosis of ITES also requires the exclusion of encephalitis (infection in the CNS or autoimmune process) and other causes of encephalopathy, while acknowledging that the hyperacute course of ITES may preclude full availability of virological and metabolic information.

### Yield of neurodiagnostic testing in children presenting to a pediatric emergency department with altered mental status [^1151omJH]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Emergency department (ED) visits for altered mental status (AMS) in children are common. Neuroimaging is often performed to ascertain etiology, but its utility has not been well studied. Our objective is to describe the yield of neuroimaging studies in children who present to an ED with AMS.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of children aged 0–18 years, presenting to our pediatric ED between 2018 and 2021 with AMS. We abstracted patient demographics, physical examination, neuroimaging and EEG results, and final diagnosis. Neuroimaging and EEG studies were classified as normal or abnormal. Abnormal studies were categorized as clinically important and contributory (abnormalities that were clinically important and contributed to the etiology), clinically important but noncontributory (abnormalities that were clinically significant but did not explain the etiology), and incidental (abnormalities that were not clinically significant).

- **Results**: We analyzed 371 patients. The most common etiology of AMS was toxicologic (188, 51%), with neurologic causes (n = 50, 13.5%) accounting for a minority. Neuroimaging was performed in half of the cases (169, 45.5%), and abnormalities were noted in 44 (26%) studies. Abnormalities were clinically important and contributed to the etiologic diagnosis of AMS in 15/169 (8.9%), clinically important and noncontributory in 18/169 (10.7%), and incidental in 11/169 (6.5%). EEG was performed in 65 patients (17.5%), of which 17 (26%) were abnormal, with only one being clinically important and contributory.

- **Conclusions**: Although neuroimaging was p

### Etiologies and yield of diagnostic testing in children presenting to the emergency department with altered mental status [^112mfReY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

To identify the etiologies of altered mental status in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), a retrospective chart review was conducted. The study focused on children aged 1–17 years presenting with a chief complaint or International Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition code of altered mental status between December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014.

- **Study design**: The primary outcome was the etiology, defined as "immediate diagnosis" if known at triage, "definitely established" if confirmed by physical examination and abnormal findings in laboratory tests, imaging, or electrocardiograms, "probable" if highly suspected in the ED but not confirmed, or "unknown". The secondary outcome assessed the utilization and contribution of diagnostic tests to the diagnosis.

- **Results**: Three hundred thirty-six eligible subjects were identified, with a mean age of 9 years (± 6 years). The etiology was immediately established in 114 subjects (34%, 95% CI: 29, 39). Among the remaining subjects (N = 222), a definite or probable cause was determined in 82% (N = 182, 95% CI: 76, 86), while the etiology remained "unknown" in 18% (N = 40, 95% CI: 14, 24). Only 10% of diagnostic tests conducted were abnormal and contributed to the diagnosis. The median number of diagnostic tests per patient was 6 (IQR: 3, 8).

- **Conclusions**: Etiologies of altered mental status in children varied widely, and often, an underlying diagnosis was not immediately apparent.

### Infection-associated encephalopathies: Their investigation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115Hziqh]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reduced level of consciousness is a common clinical finding in acutely sick patients. In the majority of cases, a cause for the encephalopathy is readily identifiable, whilst in a minority the etiology is more difficult to ascertain. Frequently, the onset of encephalopathy is associated with or follows an infection. The mechanisms through which infection leads to encephalopathy are diverse. They range from direct microbial invasion of the brain or its supporting structures to remote, infection-triggered mechanisms such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Most common, however, is the encephalopathy caused through a remote effect of systemic sepsis — septic encephalopathy. This article discusses the clinical presentation and underlying pathogeneses of the acute encephalopathies associated with infection, aiming to aid both their recognition and treatment.

### Presentations and mechanisms of CNS disorders related to COVID-19 [^114qXyuT]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to severe respiratory symptoms, there are a growing number of reports showing a wide range of CNS complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we review the literature on these complications, ranging from nonspecific symptoms to necrotizing encephalopathies, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, endotheliitis, and stroke.

We postulate that several different mechanisms are involved in COVID-19–associated CNS dysfunction, particularly the activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and, in a few patients, a direct viral effect on the endothelium and the parenchyma. Critically ill patients frequently present with protracted cognitive dysfunction in the setting of septic encephalopathy, likely due to multifactorial mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, but available data suggest that CNS complications in COVID-19 are rare and probably not directly caused by the virus.

### Altered mental status: What is the diagnosis [^1131Eno4]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We report a patient presenting with a 2-day history of altered mental status and lethargy. She had recently started taking prednisone for suspected 'autoimmune arthritis'. Clinical deterioration in the hospital was characterized by increasing confusion, alternating hyperarousal and somnolence, auditory hallucinations, and eventual unresponsiveness, leading to an intensive care unit transfer. Initial laboratory and radiological testing did not reveal a cause for her symptoms. The only abnormality detected was antithyroid peroxidase antibody levels elevated to > 900 IU/mL, with the patient demonstrating marked clinical improvement within 24 hours of receiving high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis.

Hashimoto's encephalitis is an underdiagnosed reversible neuropsychiatric disorder with unknown pathogenesis. Recent studies indicate that autoimmune encephalopathy, and specifically Hashimoto's encephalitis, is under-reported. Our case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a wide differential for altered mental status, especially following a negative initial diagnostic work-up of more common etiologies. Although steroids are an effective treatment for Hashimoto's encephalitis, the addition of early plasmapheresis may be indicated in patients with severe presentation and those who develop the disease while taking steroids.

### How to diagnose and manage hepatic encephalopathy: A consensus statement on roles and responsibilities beyond the liver specialist [^115UFJgw]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

General practitioners, acute care physicians, and others who may encounter patients with cirrhosis should be aware of the signs and symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). If these healthcare providers identify cognitive impairment or symptoms of HE in patients with cirrhosis, additional clinical assessment or workup may be required. This may include specialist consultation if helpful. All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed clinically for overt HE by their family physician: 38% strongly agree; 25% agree (mean score: 3.63/5).

Most patients with cirrhosis will be under appropriate specialist care. The primary care physician plays a vital role in identifying patients with liver disease and should be aware of at-risk groups in addition to clinical signs and symptoms. Guidelines for the primary care provider on this are lacking. While HE as a first presentation of cirrhosis would be unusual, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in appropriate clinical settings — for example, in patients with risk factors for liver disease, physical signs suggesting liver disease, or abnormal serum liver function tests.

Unlike other decompensation events (e.g. variceal bleeding, ascites), patients with HE may not present to their usual specialist due to their symptoms. Patients with prior HE are more likely to present to their primary care provider or as an emergency admission. Therefore, it is necessary that patients with HE not presenting to their usual healthcare provider are identified, and appropriate treatment is administered.

### A guide to guidelines for pulmonary, sleep, and critical care medicine clinicians [^115eYdvR]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Both the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network have recently published standards for trustworthy guidelines. These standards address multiple aspects of guideline development, including being transparent about funding and methodology, minimizing bias related to conflicts of interest, assembling writing committees with broad stakeholder representation, using rigorous and systematic methods to synthesize evidence and formulate recommendations, and periodically assessing guidelines for currency and updating them as required.

In this article, we present the perspective of the Documents Development and Implementation Committee of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) on these and other guideline-related topics of relevance to ATS members. Additionally, we summarize the many important take-home messages from a workshop that was jointly sponsored by the ATS and the European Respiratory Society. We also attempt to place these messages in the context of a methodology that is rapidly evolving and a landscape in which clinical practice guidelines are subjected to ever-increasing scrutiny by clinicians, patients, and other third-party stakeholders.

### Diagnostic yield of CT head in delirium and altered mental status-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115m1mG6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Low credibility.

CT head is commonly performed in the setting of delirium and altered mental status (AMS), with variable yield. We aimed to evaluate the yield of CT head in hospitalized patients with delirium and/or AMS across various clinical settings and identify factors associated with abnormal imaging.

- **Methods**: We included studies in adult hospitalized patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) and inpatient medical unit (grouped together) or the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients had a diagnosis of delirium/AMS and underwent a CT head that was classified as abnormal or not. We searched Medline, Embase, and other databases (informed by PRISMA guidelines) from inception until November 11, 2021. Studies exclusively performed in patients with trauma or a fall were excluded. A meta-analysis of proportions was performed; the pooled proportion of abnormal CTs was estimated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was determined via the I² statistic. Factors associated with an abnormal CT head were summarized qualitatively.

- **Results**: Forty-six studies were included for analysis. The overall yield of CT head in the inpatient/ED was 13% (95% CI: 10.2%-15.9%) and in ICU was 17.4% (95% CI: 10%-26.3%), with considerable heterogeneity (I² 96% and 98% respectively). Heterogeneity was partly explained after accounting for study region, publication year, and representativeness of the target population. Yield of CT head diminished after the year 2000 (19.8% vs. 11.1%) and varied widely depending on the geographical region (8.4%-25.9%). The presence of focal neurological.

### Fever and neurologic conditions [^114DV6VY]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Neurologic conditions are categorized as either those that cause a change in mental status or those that create a focal finding on physical examination. Neurologic abnormality associated with fever can be caused by a primary neurologic condition or one that does not originate in the central nervous system. Optimal management of such conditions requires high clinical suspicion and a broad differential diagnosis, which facilitates rapid recognition and effective treatment. A thorough history and physical examination are key determinants in accurately diagnosing neurologic conditions associated with fever, often requiring acquisition of collateral information from persons other than the patient.

### Clinical reasoning: A 17-year-old adolescent boy with new altered mental status in the pediatric intensive care unit [^112hPnAe]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

We present the case of a 17-year-old adolescent boy admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with an extensive necrotizing soft tissue infection who subsequently developed altered mental status and autonomic instability. Altered mental status is a common occurrence in critically ill children, with a broad differential of etiologies. After ruling out organic causes of encephalopathy, management is typically focused on avoiding deliriogenic agents, including benzodiazepines. Dopamine antagonist medications may also be administered adjunctively to manage agitation or delirium that is refractory to other measures. We review the workup and differential diagnosis for altered mentation in critically ill children and discuss the understanding of a rare etiology of altered mental status in the pediatric population.
