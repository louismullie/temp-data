## Question

Aspirin overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aspirin overdose management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway/ventilation strategy. Then, I should verify the approach to decontamination and timing. Next, I will review acid-base management and urine alkalinization. After that, I need to check indications and timing for extracorporeal treatment. I will then consider special populations and co-formulations, followed by monitoring and disposition. Finally, I should confirm pediatric thresholds and reconcile any conflicting guidance, ensuring each step is supported by the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status, with a strict rule to avoid suppressing the patient's respiratory drive because hyperventilation is compensatory for metabolic acidosis. I should not intubate solely for tachypnea unless there is impending respiratory failure, and if I must intubate, I need to match the patient's minute ventilation to avoid worsening acidemia, which is a classic pitfall in salicylate poisoning [^5c20fe25] [^8562d625].

> Wait, let me verify the decontamination strategy before jumping ahead. Activated charcoal is reasonable if the patient is awake, not vomiting, and it can be given within about 1 hour of ingestion; beyond that window, I should still consider charcoal for large ingestions or modified-release formulations because salicylate absorption can be erratic and prolonged, and I must not delay transport to give charcoal. I should avoid ipecac or induced emesis because aspiration risk outweighs benefit, and I need to remember that enteric-coated or massive ingestions can have delayed peaks, so serial levels are essential [^8562d625] [^61bb709e] [^ce3bda69] [^f477ce7d].

> I need to check the acid-base plan next. Serial salicylate levels every 2–4 hours until peak and decline, serial ABGs to track mixed respiratory alkalosis and evolving metabolic acidosis, and correction of volume status with isotonic fluids are foundational. Urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is a cornerstone to enhance renal clearance, targeting urine pH above 7.5 if feasible, while carefully monitoring potassium and avoiding overalkalinization that could precipitate alkalemia or hypokalemia [^5c20fe25] [^a9a30a10].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to extracorporeal treatment. EXTRIP recommends intermittent hemodialysis for severe cases, including salicylate concentration greater than about 6.5–7.2 mmol/L (90–100 mg/dL), altered mental status, refractory acidemia with pH ≤ 7.20, renal failure, or clinical deterioration despite maximal supportive care. I should also continue IV bicarbonate between dialysis sessions and stop dialysis when clinical improvement occurs and salicylate is less than about 1.4 mmol/L (19 mg/dL) or after 4–6 hours if levels are unavailable [^9230d9c7] [^a3c4a38f] [^888e6f03] [^a2efa1e0] [^acb0206b] [^d503d96d].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations. In pediatrics, I initially thought the referral threshold of 150 mg/kg was universally accepted, but wait, I should double-check newer data suggesting that significant toxicity can occur at lower doses, with median doses around 132–182 mg/kg associated with moderate effects; thus, I should maintain a low threshold for evaluation and consider that some centers may refer at 100–150 mg/kg depending on context. In neonates and infants, exchange transfusion may be considered if hemodialysis is not feasible. For combination products, I must treat both components, for example, adding naloxone for opioid co-ingestion and managing dipyridamole-related vasodilation with fluids and vasopressors as needed [^707287ac] [^891e2fdd] [^7ac80dc6] [^1105209a].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and disposition. I need to ensure follow-up salicylate levels until a clear downward trend is established, recognizing delayed peaks with enteric-coated or large ingestions, and I should observe for at least 12–24 hours depending on formulation. Any patient with intentional overdose, co-ingestants, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability warrants admission, whereas reliable patients with minimal ingestion, no symptoms, and declining levels may be discharged with strict return precautions [^cfa4af1e] [^5c20fe25].

> I will now examine pediatric thresholds more carefully. The traditional 150 mg/kg referral threshold remains a guideline anchor, but the recent large pediatric series shows that moderate effects can occur at roughly 132–182 mg/kg, so I should individualize decisions by symptoms, time since ingestion, and formulation, and I should avoid anchoring bias that delays care when clinical toxicity is evolving despite lower reported doses [^707287ac].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with tinnitus and a normal initial salicylate level? I should confirm that early levels can be misleading due to delayed absorption or distribution, so repeating levels every 2–4 hours and correlating with acid-base status is essential. Case reports document toxicity emerging 24–35 hours after ingestion with initially undetectable levels, reinforcing the need for serial monitoring and a high index of suspicion when clinical features fit salicylate poisoning [^f477ce7d] [^3351f98c].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed key pitfalls: do not suppress respirations, do not rely on a single early salicylate level, do not delay transport for charcoal, and do not forget to alkalinize urine while correcting electrolytes. If I catch myself drifting toward routine intubation for tachypnea, I should pause and reassess whether the patient is compensating appropriately and whether I can safely avoid sedation that will blunt ventilation, because that is where iatrogenic harm often occurs in salicylate toxicity [^5c20fe25] [^8562d625].

Aspirin overdose is a **medical emergency** characterized by tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status, with severity correlating to serum salicylate levels [^5c20fe25]. Immediate management includes **activated charcoal within 1 hour** if not contraindicated, aggressive IV fluids, and urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate to enhance elimination [^ce3bda69] [^40969788]. Hemodialysis is indicated for severe toxicity (salicylate > 7.2 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]), altered mental status, refractory acidosis, or renal failure [^a3c4a38f] [^888e6f03] [^a2efa1e0]. Early recognition and treatment are critical, as mortality can reach 5% in severe cases [^5c20fe25].

---

## Clinical presentation and severity grading

Aspirin overdose presents with a characteristic progression of symptoms, and severity is typically graded based on serum salicylate concentrations:

| **Severity** | **Serum salicylate concentration** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 300–500 mg/L (2.17–3.62 mmol/L) | - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Tinnitus <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Lethargy [^5c20fe25] |
| Moderate | 500–750 mg/L (3.62–5.43 mmol/L) | - Tachypnea <br/> - Hyperpnea <br/> - Sweating <br/> - Dehydration <br/> - Confusion <br/> - Coagulopathy [^5c20fe25] |
| Severe | > 750 mg/L (> 5.43 mmol/L) | - Hallucinations <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Cerebral edema <br/> - Renal failure <br/> - Cardiovascular collapse <br/> - Coma [^5c20fe25] |

---

Early signs of salicylism include tinnitus, nausea, and vomiting, while **severe toxicity** can lead to metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hyperthermia, and multi-organ failure [^5c20fe25].

---

## Pathophysiology

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased metabolic rate, heat production, and lactic acidosis. It also stimulates the respiratory center, causing respiratory alkalosis, followed by metabolic acidosis as the toxicity progresses [^5c20fe25].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Serum salicylate concentration**: Essential for confirming diagnosis and guiding management. Serial measurements are recommended every 2–4 hours until peak and decline are documented [^5c20fe25].
- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: To assess acid-base status, typically showing early respiratory alkalosis followed by metabolic acidosis [^5c20fe25].
- **Electrolytes, renal function, glucose**: To monitor for electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, and hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [^5c20fe25].
- **Coagulation profile**: Aspirin-induced coagulopathy is common and should be monitored [^5c20fe25].

---

## Immediate management

### General supportive care

Supportive care includes establishing **airway, breathing, and circulation** with early intubation if there is altered mental status or respiratory failure, and aggressive IV crystalloids for dehydration and to maintain urine output. Correct electrolyte abnormalities — especially potassium — and manage hyperthermia with cooling measures [^5c20fe25].

---

### Gastrointestinal decontamination

Activated charcoal is indicated within 1 hour of ingestion if the airway is protected and there is no contraindication; it is effective in reducing absorption. Gastric lavage is rarely indicated and should be avoided due to aspiration risk [^ce3bda69] [^61bb709e].

---

### Alkalinization of urine

Sodium bicarbonate is administered to alkalinize urine, enhancing renal elimination of salicylates. The target urine pH is **≥ 7.5**. Potassium supplementation is often required to maintain alkalinization [^a9a30a10].

---

### Indications for hemodialysis

Hemodialysis is indicated in the following scenarios:

- Serum salicylate concentration > 7.2 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) [^a3c4a38f].
- Altered mental status or seizures [^888e6f03].
- Refractory metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.20) [^a2efa1e0].
- Renal failure or severe electrolyte disturbances.
- Clinical deterioration despite aggressive supportive care [^5e26235b].

Intermittent hemodialysis is the **preferred modality** for extracorporeal removal of salicylates [^d4b9a427].

---

## Complications

Aspirin overdose can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Common and potentially life-threatening [^5c20fe25].
- **Renal failure**: Due to direct nephrotoxicity and hypoperfusion [^5c20fe25].
- **Pulmonary edema**: Particularly in chronic toxicity [^notfound].
- **Coagulopathy**: Increased bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction [^25f2eb41].
- **Seizures and cerebral edema**: Indicators of severe toxicity [^5c20fe25].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity of toxicity, timeliness of intervention, and presence of complications. With prompt and aggressive management, mortality is approximately 1–2% in mild to moderate cases, but can reach **5% or higher** in severe toxicity [^5c20fe25].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **patient education** regarding safe use and storage of aspirin-containing medications, and on **poison control** — contacting poison control centers immediately in cases of suspected overdose [^e51978bc].

---

Aspirin overdose is a **potentially fatal** condition requiring rapid recognition, aggressive supportive care, and timely use of antidotal therapy, including urine alkalinization and hemodialysis. Early intervention significantly improves outcomes and reduces mortality.

The following constitutes key background information on aspirin overdose:

- **Definition**: Aspirin overdose is the plasma salicylate concentration of 300–500 mg/L in mild toxicity, 500–700 mg/L in moderate toxicity, and > 750 mg/L in severity toxicity.
- **Pathophysiology**: Aspirin overdose is caused by accidental ingestions in children, suicidal or intentional overdoses in adults.
- **Disease course**: Acute aspirin overdose results in salicylate poisoning resulting in either mild, moderate, or severe toxicity depending on the plasma salicylate concentration. Mild toxicity presents with burning in the mouth, lethargy, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, or dizziness. Moderate toxicity includes additional symptoms of tachypnea, hyperpyrexia, sweating, dehydration, loss of coordination, and restlessness. Severe toxicity causes hallucinations, stupor, convulsions, cerebral edema, oliguria, renal failure, cardiovascular failure, metabolic acidosis, and coma.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe salicylate poisoning results in 5% mortality.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Initial Dosage].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSAGE].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

### Medical outcomes of acute aspirin single substance poisoning in pediatric patients [^707287ac]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A consensus guideline on salicylate poisoning recommends referring patients to the emergency department if they ingested 150 mg/kg of aspirin. The dose of aspirin associated with severe poisoning in pediatric patients has not been investigated.

Objective

This study aims to associate medical outcomes with aspirin overdoses in patients 5 years old and younger.

Methods

A retrospective review of data on pediatric patients with single substance aspirin exposures reported from poison centers across the country was conducted. The primary endpoint was to associate aspirin doses with medical outcomes. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of the signs, symptoms, and treatments of ingestion and their association with medical outcomes.

Results

There were 26488 included exposures with aspirin exposures resulting in no effect (92.5%), minor effect (6.0%), moderate effect (1.4%), major effect (0.2%), and death (0.02%). There were 8921 cases with available weight-based dosing information. Median doses associated with no effect, minor effects, moderate effects, major effects, and death ranged between 28.4 and 40.9 mg/kg, 52.5 and 82.3 mg/kg, 132.1 and 182.3 mg/kg, 132.3 and 172.8 mg/kg, and 142.2 and 284.4 mg/kg, respectively. Minor effect and moderate effect exposures were more likely to have alkalinization documented compared to no effect exposures (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.41–2.17; OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.12–2.86). There was no difference in rates of alkalinization between minor and moderate exposures (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.61–1.7).

Conclusions and Relevance

Reevaluation of the current recommendation of 150 mg/kg for referral to a healthcare facility is necessary for pediatric acute salicylate overdoses.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^7ac80dc6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 grams.

Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^8562d625]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS clinical guidelines — Aspirin overdose directs: Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 gm/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion. As ASA is erratically absorbed, charcoal is highly recommended to be administered early. If altered mental status or risk of rapid decreasing mental status from polypharmacy, do not administer oral agents including activated charcoal. In salicylate poisonings, let the patient breathe on their own, even if tachypneic, until there is evidence of decompensation or dropping oxygen saturation; acid/base disturbances and outcomes worsen when the patient is manually ventilated.

### Meprobamate and aspirin (equagesic) [^25f2eb41]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Overdosage

Treatment of overdose with Equagesic is essentially symptomatic and supportive. In cases where excessive doses of Equagesic have been taken, sleep ensues rapidly and blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rates are reduced to basal levels. Any drug remaining in the stomach should be removed and symptomatic treatment given. After emesis and/or lavage, activated charcoal may reduce absorption of both aspirin and meprobamate. Should respiration or blood pressure become compromised, respiratory assistance, central nervous system stimulants, and pressor agents should be administered cautiously as indicated. Diuresis, osmotic (mannitol) diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis have been used successfully in removing both aspirin and meprobamate. Alkalinization of the urine increases the excretion of salicylates. Careful monitoring of urinary output is necessary, and caution should be taken to avoid overhydration. Relapse and death, after initial recovery, have been attributed to incomplete gastric emptying and delayed absorption. Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, acid-base disturbances with development of metabolic acidosis, convulsions, delirium, hyperpnea, hyperthermia, hypoprothrombinemia, restlessness, Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and vomiting. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus, occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 μg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 μg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately. Careful medical management is essential. In acute aspirin overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Treatment of aspirin overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage.

in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at
30 g.

Treatment of overdose consists
primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination,
and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or
lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has
vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration
of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3
hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not
be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely
with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and
electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and
augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use
of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Administration of xanthine derivatives
(e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole
overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially
to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal.
 In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening
intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose;
however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not
likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated
in infants and young children.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE Capsules. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children

Advise caregivers that BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE is contraindicated in all children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children 12–18 years of age receiving BUTALBITAL, ASPIRIN, CAFFEINE and CODEINE PHOSPHATE to monitor for signs of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8); Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.

Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

### Methocarbamol and aspirin [^140c45c5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Limited information is available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose of methocarbamol is frequently in conjunction with alcohol or other CNS depressants and includes the following symptoms: nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma.

In post-marketing experience, deaths have been reported with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants, alcohol or psychotropic drugs.

Early signs of acute aspirin (salicylate) overdose including tinnitus occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or suspected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately.

In acute salicylate overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration, and coma. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. Serious symptoms such as depression, coma, and respiratory failure progress rapidly.

Salicylism (chronic salicylate toxicity) may be noted by symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental confusion. More severe salicylism may result in respiratory alkalosis.

Treatment of Overdosage: Supportive therapy for 24 hours, as methocarbamol is excreted within that time. If salicylate intoxication occurs, especially in children, the hyperpnea may be controlled with sodium bicarbonate. Judicious use of 5% CO₂with 95% O₂may be of benefit. Abnormal electrolyte patterns should be corrected with appropriate fluid therapy.

Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most common culprits of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and can lead to a wide array of adverse effects. The accurate and timely diagnosis of aspirin and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions is important for both patient safety and for the initiation of appropriate disease-specific management and treatment. Because there are no reliably validated in vitro tests available, aspirin and NSAID challenges are considered to be the criterion standard for the diagnosis of these hypersensitivity reactions, though in some patients the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a clear clinical history.

### Questions regarding future research on aspirin and the gastrointestinal tract [^958fed4a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite great proven and potential benefits, aspirin also has adverse side effects on all parts of the gastrointestinal tract including ulceration, bleeding, perforation, and stenosis. Because of widespread and growing use, there is a need to understand and, if possible, prevent the adverse effects of aspirin while maintaining its benefits. This article is part of a report from a consensus meeting in 1999 on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and examines possible mechanisms of each of the risks of normal and low-dose aspirin use including areas of uncertainty. Based on these issues, we recommend studies that would further clarify the actions of aspirin. We also examine various strategies that might be used to prevent or mitigate adverse effects. Finally, we propose future research prospects in the search for a safer aspirin.

### Self-administration of aspirin after chest pain for the prevention of premature cardiovascular mortality in the United States: a population-based analysis [^21a3ef93]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Encouraging patients to carry and self‐administer a therapeutic is not a novel prevention strategy. Individuals with severe allergies are told to carry epinephrine to reduce the risk of death from anaphylaxis. A recent advisory from the US Surgeon General calls for individuals taking opioids to keep naloxone on hand to prevent overdose deaths. Even within the field of cardiovascular disease, a new injectable antiplatelet is in development, intended for patients with a history of AMI to self‐administer at the onset of AMI symptoms. Efforts needed to scale‐up the use and advertise benefits of aspirin could draw from previous work encouraging self‐administration of these other therapeutics. We anticipate that uptake of aspirin self‐administration may be high given the low‐cost and oral route of administration.

There are a few assumptions and limitations to note. We assumed that the benefits of early aspirin use would also apply to individuals taking daily low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention. This is supported by pharmacodynamic studies examining different dosing regimens, which found that high‐risk patients with cardiovascular disease had greater inhibition of platelet reactivity when given higher doses of aspirin. Limited data availability prevented us from calculating age‐ and sex‐specific PPV of severe chest pain for AMI as well as mortality RR reduction for aspirin; thus, we assumed these parameters apply to all age‐sex groups. Moreover, we focused on chest pain alone, rather than considering shortness of breath, diaphoresis or other pain, because this is the most reliable sign of an AMI. We only examined the net benefits of aspirin on mortality, ignoring nonfatal bleeding risks, which may similarly be negligible in comparison to nonfatal benefits. Lastly, we did not include the cost of an education dissemination campaign to encourage aspirin use at severe chest pain onset in our cost‐effectiveness analysis, though we expect additional costs of such campaign would be unlikely to exceed the threshold for cost‐effectiveness based on past research (ie, $50 000/YOLS).

### Activated charcoal and bicarbonate for aspirin toxicity: a retrospective series [^40969788]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin overdose causes acid-base disturbances and organ dysfunction. Management is guided by research reported over 50 years ago when chronic aspirin toxicity was common and accounted for significant morbidity. We investigate our experience of aspirin overdose and the effectiveness of charcoal and bicarbonate administration over 20 years.

Methods

This is a retrospective series of acute aspirin overdose from two toxicology units from January 2000 to September 2019. Acute aspirin ingestions > 3000 mg were identified in each unit's database. Excluded were cases of chronic exposure, hospital presentation > 24 hours after ingestion, and cases without a salicylate concentration. Included in our analysis was demographic data, clinical effects, investigations, complications, and treatment.

Results

There were 132 presentations in 108 patients (79 females (73%)). The median age was 28 years (range: 13–93 years). The median dose ingested was 7750 mg (IQR: 6000–14,400 mg). There were 44 aspirin-only ingestions. Mild toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus or hyperventilation) occurred in 22 with a median dose of 160 mg/kg. Moderate toxicity (acid-base disturbance, confusion) occurred in 16 with a median ingested dose of 297 mg/kg. There were no cases of severe toxicity (coma or seizures) due to aspirin alone. The median peak salicylate concentration was 276 mg/L (IQR: 175–400 mg/L, range: 14–814 mg/L). There was a moderate association between dose ingested and peak concentration (Pearson r = 0.58; 95% CI 0.45–0.68). Activated charcoal was administered in 36 (27%) cases, which decreased the median peak salicylate concentration (34.2 to 24.8 mg/L/g (difference: 9.4, 95% CI: 1.0–13.1)). Bicarbonate was administered in 34 (26%) presentations, decreasing the median apparent elimination half-life from 13.4 to 9.3 h (difference: 4.2 h, 95% CI: 1.0–6.5 h).

Conclusions

Acute aspirin overdose caused only mild to moderate effects in this series. Early administration of activated charcoal decreased absorption and use of bicarbonate enhanced elimination.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is no clinical data on overdosage with YOSPRALA.

Aspirin

Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mg/mL. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.

Signs and Symptoms: In acute overdose, severe acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis.

Treatment: Treatment consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing salicylate elimination, and correcting the acid-base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage.

Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. Serial salicylate levels should be obtained every 1 to 2 hours until concentrations have peaked and are declining. Acid-base status should be closely followed with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Fluid and electrolyte balance should also be maintained.

In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water. Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body drug content. In patients with renal impairment or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

### Side effects of commonly prescribed analgesic medications [^5463ce71]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Analgesics, including opioids, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, acetaminophen, antiepileptics, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are medications commonly used to treat many forms of pain. However, all of these agents may have significant adverse side effects. Adverse effects may occasionally be inseparable from desired effects. Side effects are often dose dependent and time dependent. It is critical that the prescribing practitioner and the dispensing pharmacist provide a thorough, understandable review of the potential side effects to all patients before these drugs are administered. Proper monitoring and follow-up during therapy are crucial.

### Delayed salicylate toxicity at 35 hours without early manifestations following a single salicylate ingestion [^f477ce7d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of delayed toxicity following a single ingestion of aspirin, where the initial concentrations were nearly undetectable and the patient was completely asymptomatic for the first 35 hours.

Case Summary

A 14-year-old white female was evaluated after a single ingestion of 120 tablets of aspirin 81 mg/tablet hours before arrival to the emergency department. She denied nausea, abdominal pain, tinnitus, or shortness of breath. She received one dose of activated charcoal. The first salicylate concentration (4 h after ingestion) was 1 mg/dL. At 35 hours, the patient became symptomatic (dizziness, tinnitus, epigastric discomfort). Her salicylate concentration at that time was 46 mg/dL. A second dose of activated charcoal was administered, and intravenous bicarbonate with potassium was started as a continuous infusion for 30 hours.

Discussion

While delayed salicylate toxicity is well reported in the literature, no report was found regarding concentrations increasing to toxicity 35 hours after ingestion. The delayed aspirin absorption may be due to salicylate-induced pylorospasm or the formation of pharmacobezoars.

Conclusions

In cases with known salicylate ingestion, it is important to follow salicylate concentrations every 4 hours until they are steadily decreasing according to a 4-hour half-life and the patient shows no symptoms of salicylate intoxication.

### Oxycodone and aspirin (Endodan) [^9f441836]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric emptying and/or lavage may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.
This procedure is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the
patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of
activated charcoal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than three hours have
passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to
lavage and emesis.

In severe cases of salicylate overdose, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the
major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged with tepid water.
Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and augmented with
correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to
promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of
glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. With more severe acute toxicity
respiratory alkalosis may occur.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be performed to reduce the body
content of aspirin. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of
life-threatening salicylate intoxication dialysis is usually required. Exchange
transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.

In case of real or suspected overdose, a poison control center should be
consulted for the treatment of salicylism.

The toxicity of oxycodone and aspirin in combination is unknown.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of the opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.

2.3 Dosing Information

One or two capsules every 4 hours as needed for pain. Total daily dosage should not exceed 6 capsules. Use the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of Butalbital, Aspirin, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules, USP.

### Absorption of salicylate powders versus tablets following overdose: a poison center observational study [^981fd754]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate absorption following overdose of aspirin (ASA) tablet formulations can be prolonged for greater than 24h. Accordingly, serial serum concentrations are typically recommended to guide treatment. However, there are little published data on absorption following ingestion of powder ASA formulations, and it is not known if delayed ASA absorption occurs following overdose of powder formulations. The objective of this study is to compare the absorption characteristics of powder and tablet formulations of ASA in patients reported to a single poison center.

Methods

Electronic records from an accredited poison center were searched for single substance acute or acute on chronic ingestions of ASA in powder form between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2014. An identical search for ingestions of ASA tablet products between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013 was undertaken as the comparator group. Other inclusion criteria were age > 12 years, documented time of ingestion, treatment in a health care facility within nine hours of ingestion and at least two detectable serum salicylate concentrations.

Results

16 of 25 powder and 22 of 49 tablet cases met inclusion criteria for analysis. Repeat serum salicylate concentrations following ingestion of tablets increased or insignificantly changed in 11 of 22 (50%) cases, and median serum salicylate concentrations in followed cases remained elevated for up to 12h in some cases. In comparison, serum salicylate concentrations following powder ingestions declined in 15 of 16 (94%) cases. One patient, who ingested a powder product, underwent hemodialysis pursuant to an initial serum salicylate concentration of 96mg/dL.

Conclusions

In contrast to persistent concentrations following overdose of tablets, the majority of serum salicylate concentrations declined following ingestion of powder formulations. In this small study population, these findings suggest that prolonged absorption is unlikely following ingestions of ASA powders.

This case, as well as previous cases of delayed aspirin therapy, may prompt providers to consider educating patients and their care providers regarding the need to return for further testing if symptoms, such as vomiting or tinnitus, develop after an aspirin ingestion.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^ee32013d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Notes/Educational Pearls — key considerations for opioid overdose in emergency medical services (EMS): The essential feature of opioid overdose requiring EMS intervention is respiratory depression or apnea, managed by ventilation followed by naloxone. Some opioids have additional toxic effects (i.e., methadone can produce QT prolongation and tramadol can produce seizures). Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental and intentional opioid overdoses. Some opioids are manufactured as a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances, with examples including Vicodin, Percocet, Percodan, and Suboxone combination products. High-potency opioids include fentanyl, which is 50–100 times more potent than morphine with legally manufactured injectable, oral liquid, tablet, and transdermal (worn as a patch) forms but often appears as illegal fentanyl analogs such as acetyl fentanyl, and carfentanil, which is 10,000 times more potent than morphine.

### Salicylate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^e51978bc]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 40,000 exposures to salicylate-containing products. A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and pre-hospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected exposure to salicylates by 1) describing the process by which a specialist in poison information should evaluate an exposure to salicylates, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of salicylate exposure, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses: 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the victims of a potentially malicious administration of a salicylate, should be referred to an emergency department immediately. This referral should be guided by local poison center procedures. In general, this should occur regardless of the dose reported (Grade D). 2) The presence of typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity such as hematemesis, tachypnea, hyperpnea, dyspnea, tinnitus, deafness, lethargy, seizures, unexplained lethargy, or confusion warrants referral to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 3) Patients who exhibit typical symptoms of salicylate toxicity or nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained lethargy, confusion, or dyspnea, which could indicate the development of chronic salicylate toxicity, should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 4) Patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation, including determination of the dose, time of ingestion, presence of symptoms, history of other medical conditions, and the presence of co-ingestants. The acute ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin equivalent, whichever is less, warrants referral to an emergency department. Ingestion of greater than a lick or taste of oil of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate) by children under 6 years of age and more than 4 mL of oil of wintergreen by patients 6 years of age and older could cause systemic salicylate toxicity and warrants referral to an emergency department (Grade C). 5) Do not induce emesis for ingestions of salicylates (Grade D). 6) Consider the out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal for acute ingestions of a toxic dose if it is immediately available, no contraindications are present, the patient is not vomiting, and local guidelines for its out-of-hospital use are observed. However, do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 7) Women in the last trimester of pregnancy who ingest below the dose for emergency department referral and do not have other referral conditions should be directed to their primary care physician, obstetrician, or a non-emergent health care facility for evaluation of maternal and fetal risk. Routine referral to an emergency department for immediate care is not required (Grade C). 8) For asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and the patient can be observed at home for development of symptoms (Grade C). 9) For patients with an ocular exposure of methyl salicylate or salicylic acid, the eye(s) should be irrigated with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes. If after irrigation the patient is having pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent irritation, referral for an ophthalmological examination is indicated (Grade D). 10) Poison centers should monitor the onset of symptoms whenever possible by conducting follow-up calls at periodic intervals for approximately 12 hours after ingestion of non-enteric-coated salicylate products, and for approximately 24 hours after the ingestion of enteric-coated aspirin (Grade C).

### Within-the-clinic shared decision for an over-the-counter medication [^f770de22]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin and its relatives are some of the oldest and most widely used drugs, dating back thousands of years and treating aches, pains, and fevers. Since the 1980s, aspirin has been regularly used to prevent and treat heart disease and stroke. Unlike the robust data supporting the use of aspirin in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, uncertainty remains regarding its role in primary prevention. The uncertainty behind aspirin use in primary prevention is mainly due to imprecision underlying the relative size of the risk and benefit of aspirin use in a low‐risk, otherwise healthy population. 1 Despite this, nearly every major cardiovascular health organization has published guidelines and statements on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Controversy and complexity of the available research combined with the over‐the‐counter accessibility of aspirin make translation of the evidence into practice particularly challenging for both clinicians and patients alike.

In 2009, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned grade‐A recommendations for the use of aspirin in men ages 45 to 79 years for the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and in women ages 55 to 79 years for the prevention of ischemic stroke, in both cases where the prevention risks outweigh the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. 2 These recommendations are echoed to varying degrees in multiple cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines, including those of the American Heart Association (AHA). 3 Conversely, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 declared that the available evidence does not support the general use of aspirin for primary prevention. These conflicting statements can be confusing for both healthcare providers and patients to digest, potentially leading to underutilization of aspirin for primary prevention. 4 The key for appropriate use of aspirin in primary prevention lies in the identification of the correct candidate for whom aspirin use is truly beneficial. This can be a complex task as consensus on assessment of cardiovascular risk remains elusive, and integrating bleeding risk with cardiovascular risk further complicates the decision‐making process.

### Altered mental status and complete heart block: an unusual presentation of aspirin toxicity [^030901c0]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is one of the most commonly used medications. We report a patient who presented with severe weakness, altered mental status and complete heart block requiring temporary pacing. Despite the patient's family denying that the patient used aspirin, an arterial blood gas that revealed a respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis suggested the diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. The salicylate level was extremely elevated and the patient was successfully treated with haemodialysis. Our case illustrates that salicylate toxicity should be considered in a patient with a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. A prompt salicylate level should be obtained. This is also the first case of salicylate toxicity causing complete heart block in an adult. The heart block resolved with treatment of the salicylate toxicity.

Self‐Administration of Aspirin Scenario

We examined the effect of full coverage of starting self‐administration of aspirin within 4 hours of severe chest pain onset using 325 mg aspirin tablets (which is the standard high‐dose formulation in the United States) and continuing treatment for 28 days if an AMI was diagnosed, regardless of need for emergent surgical procedures. This is consistent with guidelines that indicate aspirin may be continued throughout the perioperative period before cardiac surgery, without major risks. If severe chest pain did not lead to a diagnosis of AMI, patients would of course discontinue taking aspirin after the first dose. We applied the benefit only to individuals experiencing severe chest pain under the "usual care" scenario to receive aspirin either late or never (Figure S1). We approximated this target population by combining 2 different estimates. First, as a proxy for access to care after AMI, we used the proportion of AMI deaths occurring in a health care facility (defined as hospice facility, inpatient medical facility, outpatient medical facility, and nursing home/long‐term care) versus those occurring outside health care facilities. Data on this proportion were derived from the vital statistics report analyzed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for 2019 by age and sex. Almost all individuals who accessed care (97.4%) received aspirin within 24 hours of arrival, based on quality of care metric data from the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain‐MI Registry reported in the Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Report for 2022. Disaggregated data by age and sex were not reported. Second, we used evidence on the proportion of patients receiving aspirin late (ie, > 4 hours after symptom onset) from an analysis of hospital discharge data from almost half a million AMI patients enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, which found that 55.5% of all patients received aspirin > 4 hours after the event.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^fb969d21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Acute and chronic effects of aspirin toxicity and their treatment… [^61147258]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Salicylate poisoning remains a major clinical hazard, usually resulting from accidental ingestions in preschool children, suicidal overdoses in adults and teenagers, and therapeutically acquired intoxication in all ages. Alkalemia or acidemia, alkaluria or aciduria, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, and water and electrolyte imbalances may occur; nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, hyperpnea, hyperpyrexia, disorientation, coma, and/or convulsions are common. With chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism, these symptoms may be mistaken for symptoms resulting from the illness for which the salicylates were administered. For acute ingestions, the magnitude of the poisoning is clearly dose related. Blood level determinations are good prognostic indicators for acute ingestions but are of limited value in chronic, therapeutically induced salicylism. Fluid and electrolyte management is the mainstay of therapy.

### Diltiazem overdose: a role for high-dose insulin [^ef434099]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented 6h after a mixed intentional overdose of dilatizem (Adizem-SR), atorvastatin, aspirin and isosorbide mononitrate. He was symptomatic, with vomiting, blurred vision and unsteady gait. Despite initial fluid resuscitation and calcium chloride, glucagon, and high-dose ionotropic therapy, his hypotension remained refractory to treatment. A bolus of high-dose insulin (Actrapid) was administered, followed by a continuous infusion. Glucose was administered to maintain a state of euglycaemia. Over the following 24h, the patient was given 1140 units of accumulative insulin. This resulted in a significant improvement in arterial blood pressure values and metabolic indices, allowing contiguous weaning off inotropes. This case supports the use of rescue hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemia in patients with an overdose of calcium channel blockers who remain hypotensive despite standard pharmacological measures.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

3.4.2 Treatment‐emergent AEs

Treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) are summarized in Table 3. The proportion of participants with any TEAE was 50.7% with acarbose versus 33.3% with alogliptin, and the proportions of those with treatment‐related TEAEs were 32.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Thus, most TEAEs in participants receiving alogliptin were not treatment‐related. The most commonly reported TEAEs were overdose (9.5%), hyperlipidaemia (3.9%) and constipation (2.9%) with alogliptin, and flatulence (22.3%), overdose (15.5%) and abdominal distension (10.7%) with acarbose. With the exception of constipation, which occurred more commonly with alogliptin (2.9% vs. 1.9%), individual gastrointestinal TEAEs were at least twice as common with acarbose versus alogliptin. In both treatment groups, the incidence of gastrointestinal TEAEs peaked in the first week of the study, and subsequently decreased; however, these effects occurred more frequently with acarbose than with alogliptin in most study weeks, and a difference was still apparent at Week 16.

TABLE 3
Treatment‐emergent adverse events

Significantly more participants discontinued treatment due to a treatment‐related TEAE with acarbose compared with alogliptin (2.5% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.0006). No new safety signals were identified during the study, and there were no deaths from treatment‐related TEAEs in either treatment arm.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^97af2da6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — clinical features, diagnosis, and management — The clinical picture starts with nasal congestion and anosmia, progressing to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; asthma and hypersensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) develop subsequently, and following ingestion of aspirin or NSAIDs, an acute asthma attack develops within minutes to 1–2 hours, sometimes progressing to severe bronchospasm, shock, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest. AERD is more likely to be associated with low lung function and severe asthma, and the prevalence of AERD is 7% in general adult asthma populations and 15% in severe asthma. For diagnosis, a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive, and aspirin challenge (oral, bronchial or nasal) is the gold standard as there are no reliable in vitro tests; oral aspirin challenge tests must only be conducted in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation capabilities because of the high risk of severe reactions, while bronchial and nasal challenges with lysine aspirin are safer than oral challenges and may be safely performed in allergy centers. For management, patients with AERD should avoid aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1); when an NSAID is indicated for other conditions, a COX-2 inhibitor or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be considered with supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of asthma therapy in AERD, but oral corticosteroids (OCS) are sometimes required and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) may also be useful.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^a9a30a10]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 grams), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5% to > 80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.

Aspirin:

Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.

The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5% to > 80%.

### Death due to acute salicylate intoxication despite dialysis [^b85b235f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Salicylate poisoning is a common problem with appreciable morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a patient with a large aspirin ingestion who expired despite aggressive hemodialysis (HD).

Case Report

A 35-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Department 7.5 h after ingesting 400 tablets of 325-mg aspirin. He was afebrile, the respiratory rate (RR) was 30 breaths/min, heart rate (HR) 120 beats/min, blood pressure (BP) 125/76 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. His salicylate concentration was 89.6 mg/dL. His initial arterial blood gas: pH 7.48, pCO₂ 21 mm Hg, PaO₂ 97 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 15.8 mmol/L. His initial serum chemistry panel was normal. He received activated charcoal and intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate. Two hours after arrival, salicylate concentration was 91.6 mg/dL. The patient became agitated and HD was initiated; 22 h after presentation, repeat salicylate concentration was 88.4 mg/dL and his creatinine was 3.9 mg/dL. A second run of HD was performed. After this, his temperature had risen to 39.06°C (102.3°F), BP 122/64 mm Hg, HR 168 beats/min, RR 43 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95% (2 L nasal cannula). His confusion increased, and he died 40 h after his ingestion.

Conclusion

HD is widely advocated in managing severe salicylate intoxications, however, no consensus exists for the duration and best mode of therapy. Patients with severe salicylate poisonings may require extended durations of HD to effectively mitigate toxicity. Additional study is warranted to determine optimal therapy in severe salicylate intoxications.

### Propoxyphene napsylate and acetominophen [^c01cd5c8]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In a survey conducted in hospitalized patients, less than 1% of patients taking propoxyphene hydrochloride at recommended doses experienced side effects. The most frequently reported were dizziness, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down.

Other adverse reactions include constipation, abdominal pain, skin rashes, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, euphoria, dysphoria, hallucinations, and minor visual disturbances.

Liver dysfunction has been reported in association with both active components of propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen tablets, USP. Propoxyphene therapy has been associated with abnormal liver function tests and, more rarely, with instances of reversible jaundice (including cholestatic jaundice). Hepatic necrosis may result from acute overdose of acetaminophen (see Management of Overdosage). In chronic ethanol abusers, this has been reported rarely with short-term use of acetaminophen dosages of 2.5 to 10 g/day. Fatalities have occurred.

Renal papillary necrosis may result from chronic acetaminophen use, particularly when the dosage is greater than recommended and when combined with aspirin.

Subacute painful myopathy has occurred following chronic propoxyphene overdosage.

### Activated charcoal for acute poisoning: one toxicologist's journey [^0b5ca743]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

What all three of these authors emphasize is the importance of assessing each case individually. Based on personal experience, knowledge of the pharmacology and toxic behavior of a drug, and the unique circumstances of the ingestion, we make our best judgment of the value or risk of GI decontamination. For example, I know that aspirin may remain in the stomach for several hours — in one reported case, gastric lavage recovered over 20 g of salicylate 9 h after an ingestion of 200 aspirin tablets (31% of the ingested dose). That is the equivalent of over 60 tablets! As a result, I often advise aggressive gut decontamination even several hours after a large aspirin overdose. The same goes for ingestion of a modified-release preparation, especially of a toxic drug such as a calcium channel blocker. On the other hand, given that most overdoses involve nonlethal doses of drugs with low to moderate toxicity, in which GI decontamination is not likely to affect outcome, I am less enthusiastic about routine use of charcoal. The decision to use AC in such cases depends the time since ingestion, the patient's mental status, and their willingness to drink the charcoal, as well as an assessment of the potential toxicity of the ingested drugs. Table 1 illustrates the role of several variables in the decision to use oral activated charcoal.

Table 1
Some contributors to the risk assessment for use of oral activated charcoal

How to manage the patient who meets some of the "risky" criteria but might still benefit from decontamination? Bailey presents a hypothetical 16-year-old girl who ingested up to 28 venlafaxine SR and 28 zaleplon 45 min prior to arrival in the ED. She has slurred speech but normal vital signs and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15. This is a case whose discussion among clinical toxicologists is likely to induce heated debate. Bailey contends that the girl may benefit from oral AC since a significant portion of the venlafaxine probably remains unabsorbed. But there is a risk that the patient will become drowsy or convulse, which would increase the likelihood of pulmonary aspiration. For this reason, many clinicians would favor early endotracheal intubation followed by nasogastric administration of AC. Because the ingested venlafaxine is in a sustained-release preparation, I would also recommend whole bowel irrigation, which may help reduce the total amount absorbed as well as the peak serum level.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — trigger identification and avoidance — Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by a detailed history and eliminated, if possible; management should focus on identifying specific triggers based on history with focused testing and symptomatic relief. A delayed syndrome has been recognized with acute urticaria/angioedema with a delay of 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of beef, pork, lamb, or venison. Medication-induced disease requires careful history: ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema after months or even years of therapy, and over-the-counter aspirin or NSAIDs (including aspirin-like remedies) can be associated with acute relapsing urticaria/angioedema; aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, as feasible, with substitution of an equally efficacious alternative not commonly associated with urticaria.

Harms of Aspirin Use

To assess potential harms, we considered risk of death from gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhaging, which may be increased from aspirin use. Individuals who were eligible to receive aspirin under the intervention were at risk for bleeding deaths. This translates to the population of adults > 40 years old receiving aspirin never or > 4 hours of chest pain onset. We quantified the estimated number of bleeding deaths using the following: (1) the estimated number of people experiencing severe chest pain each year who do not receive aspirin within ≤ 4 hours, (2) the RR of severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage associated with one‐time aspirinuse by age and sex, and (3) annual mortality rates from gastrointestinal hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage obtained from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Wide‐ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) in 2019 (Table S3). In addition to the populations experiencing AMI but receiving aspirin > 4 hours, to whom we applied both mortality benefits and risks, we also included individuals experiencing severe chest pain with no AMI to quantify mortality risks. We estimated this population by subtracting the positive predictive value (PPV) of severe chest pain (ie, the ratio of AMI cases with chest pain to all individuals who experience severe chest pain for each age‐sex group), from the annual AMI incidence with chest pain and then dividing by the PPV of severe chest pain for AMI.

To quantify the PPV, we conducted a de novo systematic review and meta‐analysis of studies examining the incidence of AMI among individuals experiencing undifferentiated severe chest pain. Studies were primarily hospital‐based, in which patients being admitted to the emergency room with the chief complaint of chest pain were followed up for the occurrence of AMI. Eleven articles met our inclusion criteria (Tables S4 and S5; Figures S2 and S3), and the pooled PPV was 16.82%, (ie, 17% of patients who experienced severe chest pain had an AMI).

To quantify the relative risk of excessive bleeding from 325 mg aspirin daily, we used evidence from a meta‐analysis of 11 randomized control trials that reported a RR of 1.47 for long‐term daily aspirin use. Considering that the average cumulative dose of aspirin in the 11 trials was 331 g and using a log‐linear dose–response curve, the RR of bleeding for 28‐day daily 325 mg aspirin use was estimated to be 1.011 (ie). We added an additional 325 mg to the cumulative dose when estimating the additional bleeding risk for patients who received aspirin > 4 hours but < 24 hours after an AMI.

### The association of hemodialysis and survival in intubated salicylate-poisoned patients [^6cac7a44]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Salicylate poisonings are common due to their multiple uses and wide availability. The variation of presenting symptoms contributes to inconsistent treatments in the emergency department. Patients with severe salicylate overdose require a high minute ventilation. Early in the course of an overdose, a patient will require hyperventilation. If they become too fatigued to compensate, mechanical ventilation may be needed. It can be impossible to recreate such a high minute ventilation with mechanical ventilation. This places patients at a high risk for decompensation and death. Hemodialysis is an effective elimination technique for salicylate overdose and should be considered early.

Methods

All salicylate cases reported to the Illinois Poison Center were reviewed from 2003–2014. All intubated patients with a salicylate level > 50mg/dl were included for analysis. Survival was compared to measured serum salicylate level and the administration of hemodialysis.

Results

56 Cases were identified with an overall survival rate of 73.2% in patients with a serum salicylate level > 50mg/dl. When patients did not receive hemodialysis, a peak salicylate level > 50mg/dl had a 56% survival rate and 0% survival when the level was > 80mg/dl. In the patients who received hemodialysis, a peak salicylate level > 50mg/dl had a 83.9% survival rate and 83.3% survival when the level was > 80mg/dl.

Conclusion

Survival was decreased in these patients if hemodialysis was not performed. Mortality increases with the measured serum salicylate level. Timely hemodialysis for intubated salicylate overdose patients decreases mortality.
