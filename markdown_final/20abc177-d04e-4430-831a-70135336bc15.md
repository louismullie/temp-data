## Question

Best treatment for muscle strain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for muscle strain injuries, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and severity classification. Then, I should verify the overarching management philosophy and whether rest or early loading is favored. Next, I will examine acute-phase interventions, including cryotherapy, protection, and analgesia. After that, I need to review early rehabilitation with eccentric loading and progression. I will then consider advanced or adjunctive options like PRP, injections, and modalities. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, phase-based algorithm and highlight key principles and uncertainties, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate evidence and noting where the evidence is weak or conflicting [^114RKhR1] [^112viJpX].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and classification, because management hinges on severity and tissue involved. Muscle strain refers to an acute indirect injury to muscle fibers with partial tearing, typically occurring during eccentric loading or high-speed maneuvers, and is distinct from contusion or complete rupture; severity is commonly graded I–III, though imaging-based anatomic classifications better reflect prognosis and guide management, particularly for hamstring injuries where MRI-positive injuries carry different timelines than MRI-negative functional disorders [^114RKhR1] [^116TYFC9] [^113aRzxa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rest; I should verify the current management philosophy. The paradigm has shifted from prolonged rest and immobilization to early activation and progressive loading, because controlled loading accelerates tissue remodeling, preserves muscle length, and reduces reinjury risk, whereas overprotection can promote atrophy and scar formation; this active approach is supported by contemporary reviews and guidelines emphasizing early, pain-guided movement and strengthening [^114RKhR1] [^112jC966].

> Next, I should review acute-phase management over the first 48–72 hours. Protection with relative rest and avoidance of aggravating activities is appropriate, but I need to ensure we do not prescribe strict bed rest; gentle range-of-motion and isometric activation can begin early if pain allows. Cryotherapy can reduce pain and acute swelling, but I should double-check whether it improves function or time to recovery; the best evidence suggests modest pain benefits without proven functional gains, so ice is reasonable for symptom control but should not delay early activation, and application of 20–30 minutes, 3–4 times daily with barrier protection is reasonable [^1159vuTw].

> I will now examine pharmacologic pain control, and I need to ensure I prioritize options with the best benefit–harm ratio. Topical NSAIDs are first-line for acute musculoskeletal pain, including strains, because they provide clinically meaningful pain relief and improved function with minimal systemic adverse effects; diclofenac gel and ketoprofen gel have the strongest evidence, with low NNTs for 50% pain relief and favorable safety profiles. If topical therapy is insufficient, oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen are acceptable alternatives, but I should confirm that opioids are not superior and carry more harms; indeed, high-quality comparative evidence shows no clinically important pain advantage of NSAIDs over acetaminophen and highlights more GI adverse events with NSAIDs, while opioids show no superiority and greater harms, so opioids should be avoided for routine acute muscle strain pain [^116F4iu4] [^1158ExMm] [^116tWJmr] [^114RL3vx] [^111LjcnW].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially thought NSAIDs might accelerate recovery by reducing inflammation, but I should reconsider that assumption. Emerging translational and clinical data suggest NSAIDs may impede satellite cell function and muscle regeneration if used indiscriminately, so I should limit NSAID use to short courses for pain control and prefer topical formulations when possible to minimize systemic exposure and downstream effects on healing [^1121Zq4P] [^114RL3vx].

> Now, I need to check the timing and content of rehabilitation. Early initiation of eccentric strengthening within pain-tolerant ranges is central, with evidence that lengthening-type eccentric programs accelerate return to play and may reduce reinjury compared with conventional strengthening; specific programs like the L-protocol and incorporation of Nordic-type exercises at long muscle lengths are supported. I should confirm whether pain-free or pain-threshold progression is better; randomized data show no significant difference in time to return but better strength and fascicle length maintenance with pain-threshold approaches, so I should individualize loading while avoiding sharp pain exacerbation [^111bFKf9] [^113CBm5F] [^1139G2VW] [^115sVFBy] [^112jC966].

> Let me consider progression milestones and functional criteria, because premature return increases reinjury risk. Progressive agility and trunk stabilization should be layered onto eccentric and multiplanar strengthening, with running programs that advance from straight-line jogging to acceleration and deceleration drills before full-speed return. I should double-check prognostic markers: MRI-defined structural injury, prolonged time to first treatment, large active knee extension deficits, and persistent pain with walking predict longer recovery; validated functional scales and objective strength symmetry thresholds can support return-to-play decisions, though no single criterion is universally validated [^112jC966] [^111XMPbH] [^117SCqVQ].

> But wait, what about injections and biologics; I need to ensure I do not overstate their role. Platelet-rich plasma has conflicting evidence: some meta-analyses and trials suggest earlier return to sport by a few days, whereas high-quality randomized trials, including a NEJM study, show no benefit in time to return or reinjury, and contemporary consensus places PRP's benefit as minimal to none for acute muscle strains; therefore, PRP should not be routine and, if considered, should be framed as experimental and adjunctive to standard rehabilitation. Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection may provide short-term pain relief in select cases but carries theoretical risks of impairing regeneration and should be reserved for carefully selected scenarios after shared decision-making [^112chfKs] [^1147uPvW] [^113azD3a] [^1121Zq4P].

> I should also review other modalities and manual therapies. Neural tissue mobilization may reduce adhesions and improve symptoms, and early therapeutic modalities for pain and swelling can be used adjunctively, but evidence quality is limited; thus, these should be secondary to active exercise-based care. For persistent pain or chronic sequelae, heavy eccentric resistance training can improve strength, function, and symptoms even years after injury, though structural abnormalities may persist, reinforcing that function and load capacity matter more than imaging appearance alone [^112SeDfL] [^1175g7Qf].

> Let me synthesize a practical, phase-based algorithm while keeping it evidence-aligned. In the acute phase (days 0–3), emphasize protection with relative rest, cryotherapy for pain control, and topical NSAIDs as first-line analgesia, with early gentle range-of-motion and isometrics as tolerated. In the subacute phase (days 3–7), progress to pain-limited eccentric strengthening at long muscle lengths, initiate trunk stabilization, and begin straight-line walking or cycling. In the functional phase (weeks 2–4), advance to progressive agility, trunk control drills, and a structured running progression from jog to sprint, using functional criteria and symptom monitoring to guide return to sport. Throughout, avoid opioids, minimize systemic NSAIDs, and reserve injections for exceptional cases after informed consent [^112viJpX] [^112jC966] [^114RKhR1].

> Hold on, I should verify key principles that cut across phases. Eccentric loading at long muscle lengths is the cornerstone to restore tissue capacity and mitigate reinjury risk; progressive, criteria-based loading outperforms rigid timelines; and multimodal rehabilitation addressing strength, neuromuscular control, and kinetic chain mechanics is superior to isolated hamstring work. I need to ensure patients understand that residual imaging abnormalities may persist despite clinical recovery, so functional readiness rather than radiographic "clearance" should drive return decisions [^112jC966] [^111Dx9QR] [^114RKhR1].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and tailor to context. Much of the highest-quality evidence centers on hamstring injuries in athletes, and generalization to other muscles or nonathletic populations requires caution; evidence quality for several interventions remains low to moderate, so shared decision-making and close monitoring for response are essential. Where data are limited, I should document rationale for departures from standard pathways and adjust based on patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, injury severity, and sport demands [^111F9kQS] [^111ha4ES].

The best treatment for muscle strain is a **progressive, load-based rehabilitation** program that starts with POLICE (Protection, Optimal Loading, Ice, Compression, Elevation) in the acute phase and advances to **eccentric and lengthening exercises** to restore strength, flexibility, and function [^114RKhR1] [^112jC966]. Topical NSAIDs are the **preferred analgesic** for pain control due to their favorable benefit–harm profile, while oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen are alternatives if needed [^116F4iu4] [^112viJpX]. Ice and compression reduce pain and swelling early, but prolonged rest should be avoided to prevent stiffness and atrophy [^1159vuTw] [^114RKhR1]. PRP injections are not recommended due to inconsistent evidence and lack of benefit in return-to-play or reinjury reduction [^111F9kQS] [^1147uPvW]. Return to activity should be guided by pain-free range of motion, near-normal strength, and functional testing to minimize reinjury risk [^111iUatg] [^111Dx9QR].

---

## Acute phase management (0–7 days)

### Protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, elevation (POLICE)

- **Protection**: Avoid activities that cause pain or provoke the injury [^notfound].
- **Optimal loading**: Early, gentle, pain-free movement and isometric contractions to maintain muscle activation and prevent atrophy [^notfound].
- **Ice**: Apply for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours in the first 48–72 hours to reduce pain and swelling [^notfound].
- **Compression and elevation**: Use compression bandages and elevate the limb to minimize swelling [^notfound].

---

### Pain management

Topical NSAIDs are **first-line** because of their favorable benefit–harm profile and local anti-inflammatory effect [^116F4iu4] [^112viJpX]. Oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen are alternatives if topical therapy is insufficient or unavailable [^111LjcnW]. Avoid opioids due to limited benefit and higher risk of adverse effects [^111e6CK4].

---

## Subacute phase management (7–14 days)

### Progressive loading and eccentric strengthening

- **Eccentric exercises**: Initiate eccentric training (e.g. Nordic hamstring exercises) to promote muscle remodeling, increase tensile strength, and reduce reinjury risk [^112jC966].
- **Lengthening exercises**: Emphasize exercises that load the muscle at longer lengths to restore flexibility and function [^111bFKf9].
- **Progressive loading**: Gradually increase load, volume, and intensity based on pain tolerance and functional capacity [^112jC966].

---

### Neuromuscular training

Neuromuscular training should include **balance, proprioception, and coordination exercises** to restore joint stability and movement patterns [^112jC966]. Functional training should incorporate sport-specific drills and movement patterns to prepare for return to activity [^112jC966].

---

## Chronic phase management (> 14 days)

### Advanced rehabilitation and return-to-sport criteria

- **Strength training**: Continue progressive resistance training to restore pre-injury strength levels [^1175g7Qf].
- **Flexibility training**: Maintain and improve muscle flexibility through regular stretching and mobility exercises [^notfound].
- **Return-to-sport criteria**: Ensure pain-free range of motion, near-normal strength (≥ 90% of contralateral limb), and successful completion of functional tests (e.g. hop tests, sprint drills) before returning to sport [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

### Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections

Evidence for PRP is **limited and inconsistent**; current evidence does not support routine use for muscle strains [^111F9kQS] [^1147uPvW]. PRP may be considered only in select cases of high-grade injuries refractory to conservative care, ideally within clinical trials [^notfound].

---

### Physical modalities

Physical modalities such as ultrasound, laser therapy, and electrotherapy may provide **short-term pain relief** but have limited evidence for accelerating healing or improving long-term outcomes [^1167Ku9z]. Use these modalities as adjuncts, not replacements, for active rehabilitation [^112SeDfL].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **regular eccentric training** (e.g. Nordic hamstring exercises) to reduce reinjury risk [^112jC966]. Dynamic warm-up and regular flexibility training improve muscle compliance and reduce injury risk [^117Rvg9N]. Address modifiable risk factors — such as muscle imbalances, fatigue, and poor conditioning — through targeted training programs [^114nFVvR].

## Summary of evidence-based treatment protocol

| **Phase** | **Interventions** | **Goals** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute (0–7 days) | - POLICE <br/> - Topical NSAIDs <br/> - Pain management | - Reduce pain and swelling <br/> - Protect injured tissue <br/> - Maintain muscle activation |
| Subacute (7–14 days) | - Eccentric strengthening <br/> - Lengthening exercises <br/> - Neuromuscular training | - Restore strength <br/> - Flexibility <br/> - And function |
| Chronic (> 14 days) | - Advanced strength training <br/> - Flexibility maintenance <br/> - Return-to-sport criteria | - Achieve pre-injury function <br/> - Minimize reinjury risk |

The best treatment for muscle strain is a **progressive, load-based rehabilitation** program that starts with POLICE and advances to eccentric and lengthening exercises, with topical NSAIDs for pain control. PRP is not routinely recommended, and return to activity should be guided by functional criteria to minimize reinjury risk [^112jC966] [^116F4iu4] [^111F9kQS].

### Cooling an acute muscle injury: can basic scientific theory translate into the clinical setting? [^111FABT6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Ice is commonly used after acute muscle strains but there are no clinical studies of its effectiveness. By comparison, there are a number of basic scientific studies on animals which show that applying ice after muscle injury has a consistent effect on a number of important cellular and physiological events relating to recovery. Some of these effects may be temperature dependant; most animal studies induce significant reductions in muscle temperature at the injury site. The aim of this short report was to consider the cooling magnitudes likely in human models of muscle injury and to discuss its relevance to the clinical setting. Current best evidence shows that muscle temperature reductions in humans are moderate in comparison to most animal models, limiting direct translation to the clinical setting. Further important clinical questions arise when we consider the heterogenous nature of muscle injury in terms of injury type, depth and insulating adipose thickness. Contrary to current practice, it is unlikely that a 'panacea' cooling dose or duration exists in the clinical setting. Clinicians should consider that in extreme circumstances of muscle strain (eg, deep injury with high levels of adipose thickness around the injury site), the clinical effectiveness of cooling may be significantly reduced.

Conclusion

Hamstring muscle strains have been recognised as a significant injury for over 100 years. Remarkably, by the mid-20th century, the foundations for our current management strategies were well established. Furthermore, despite the remarkable advances of the past 30 years, we have made only incremental progress in our understanding and management of this complex injury. The history of hamstring injury management is characterised by interventions which over time have failed to become established, typically without evidence ever being produced either for, or against their application. Most novel treatment interventions currently used continue to lack scientific validity; if we are to avoid repeating past mistakes, we must take up the challenge of obtaining high-quality data. To achieve this, we must challenge dogma that underpins 'usual care' and subject all elements of our management strategies to scientific scrutiny.

There is now evidence to use MRI to distinguish MRI-positive and MRI-negative injuries as these have a distinct prognoses and treatments. However, whether MRI or US aids in predicting of prognosis beyond this distinction remains to be determined. Minimising acute inflammation and optimising regeneration remain key goals in hamstring injury management; current techniques having changed little in 40 years and the medical manipulation of these pathophysiological processes warrants further clinical and laboratory research (eg, role of PRP). Finally, the development of scar tissue appears related to recurrent injuries and poor outcomes. Recently identified techniques for inhibition of growth factors involved in the development of scar tissue present an exciting development, but require further high-quality clinical trials in order to establish themselves in the standard management of muscle injuries.

To progress, we must encourage communication among (I) the proponents of published evidence-based, clinical guidelines, (II) those practitioners overtly working outside the recognised scientific evidence base and applying novel therapies based on their personal experience and (III) those researchers able to test novel hypotheses. Typically, these groups have not interacted, likely to the detriment of the profession and patients. We are at the start of the specialist era in Sports and Exercise Medicine, and maintaining status quo is unacceptable. For the credibility of all clinicians in the field of sports injury management, it is vital to accumulate appropriate evidence to progress from the scientific baseline established by our forbearers in the mid-20th century.

### Does platelet-rich plasma lead to earlier return to sport when compared with conservative treatment in acute muscle injuries? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112chfKs]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the time to return to sport and reinjury rate after platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection versus control therapy (i.e., physiotherapy or placebo injection) in patients with acute grade I or II muscle strains.

Methods

All eligible studies comparing PRP against a control in the treatment of acute (≤ 7 days) grade I or II muscle strains were identified. The primary outcome was time to return to play. The secondary outcome was the rate of reinjury at a minimum of 6 months of follow-up. Subgroup analysis was performed to examine the efficacy of PRP in hamstring muscle strains alone. The checklist to evaluate a report of a nonpharmacologic trial (CLEAR-NPT) was used to assess the quality of studies.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials including a total of 268 patients with grade I and II acute muscle injuries were eligible for review. The pooled results revealed a significantly earlier return to sport for the PRP group when compared with the control group (mean difference, -5.57 days [95% confidence interval, -9.57 to -1.58]; p = 0.006). Subgroup analysis showed no difference in time to return to sport when comparing PRP and control therapy in grade I and II hamstring muscle strains alone (P = 0.19). No significant difference was noted in the rate of reinjury between the 2 groups (P = 0.50) at a minimum of 6 months of follow-up.

Conclusions

Evidence from the current literature, although limited, suggests that the use of PRP may result in an earlier return to sport among patients with acute grade I or II muscle strains without significantly increasing the risk of reinjury at 6 months of follow-up. However, no difference in time to return to sport was revealed when specifically evaluating those with a grade I or II hamstring muscle strain.

Level Of Evidence

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^115NiYLS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hamstring muscle strain injuries remain one of the most challenging issues facing sports medicine. Over the past 100 years, there has been a gradual evolution in our understanding and management of hamstring injuries, but the challenge of optimising the management of the acutely injured hamstring remains. In recent years, increasingly high-quality studies have addressed the aetiology, risk factors and management of hamstring strains.–Paradoxically, many popular treatment options have little evidence and remain controversial.–The history of hamstring injury management is characterised as a longstanding dissociation between popular clinical techniques and a limited evidence base. Taking a historical perspective on the management of hamstring muscle strains, this study aims to place the current management strategies in a temporal perspective.

By the mid-18th century, the importance of exercise for health was established, and the physical demands of different forms of exercise were recognised, in a manner not dissimilar to descriptions 200 years later. By the start of the 20th century, the Olympics had been re-invented, sport and exercise were recognised as a means of developing characterand maintaining health in a world experiencing an explosion in leisure time.–Given the limitations of the training methodology of the time, it is possible that muscle strains were a common finding, but there is limited epidemiological literature available from the time.

### Acute muscle strain injuries: a proposed new classification system [^116TYFC9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To better define and classify acute muscle strain injuries.

Methods

Historically, acute muscle strains have been classified as grade I, II and III. This system does not accurately reflect the anatomy of the injury and has not been shown to reliably predict prognosis and time for return to sport.

Results

We describe an imaging (magnetic resonance or ultrasound) nomenclature, which considers the anatomical site, pattern and severity of the lesion in the acute stage. By site of injury, we define muscular injuries as proximal, middle and distal. Anatomically, based on the various muscular structures involved, we distinguish intramuscular, myofascial, myofascial/perifascial and musculotendinous injuries.

Conclusions

This classification system must be applied to a variety of muscle architectures and locations to determine its utility; additional studies are therefore needed prior to its general acceptance.

### Use of autologous platelet-rich plasma to treat muscle strain injuries [^116wqJgL]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Standard nonoperative therapy for acute muscle strains usually involves short-term rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but there is no clear consensus on how to accelerate recovery.

Hypothesis

Local delivery of platelet-rich plasma to injured muscles hastens recovery of function.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

In vivo, the tibialis anterior muscles of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were injured by a single (large strain) lengthening contraction or multiple (small strain) lengthening contractions, both of which resulted in a significant injury. The tibialis anterior either was injected with platelet-rich plasma, was injected with platelet-poor plasma as a sham treatment, or received no treatment.

Results

Both injury protocols yielded a similar loss of force. The platelet-rich plasma only had a beneficial effect at 1 time point after the single contraction injury protocol. However, platelet-rich plasma had a beneficial effect at 2 time points after the multiple contraction injury protocol and resulted in a faster recovery time to full contractile function. The sham injections had no effect compared with no treatment.

Conclusion

Local delivery of platelet-rich plasma can shorten recovery time after a muscle strain injury in a small-animal model. Recovery of muscle from the high-repetition protocol has already been shown to require myogenesis, whereas recovery from a single strain does not. This difference in mechanism of recovery may explain why platelet-rich plasma was more effective in the high-repetition protocol, because platelet-rich plasma is rich in growth factors that can stimulate myogenesis.

Clinical Relevance

Because autologous blood products are safe, platelet-rich plasma may be a useful product in clinical treatment of muscle injuries.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were first mentioned in the routine management of muscle strain injuries in the late 1960sand their use has persisted in sports medicine. While they may have a role in limited situations (eg, reducing the incidence of myositis ossificans following muscle contusion injuries), increasing in vitro evidence suggests that NSAIDs may impede regeneration and increase fibrosis during muscle healing, and hence should be considered relatively contraindicated in muscle strain injuries.–

The 1970s and 1980s saw increasing attention being paid to physiotherapeutic means of rehabilitation. There remained a focus on minimising bleeding and inflammation while maximising regeneration, by the increasingly novel use of cooling, electrotherapy (which was clinically already being used in the latter 19th century), manipulative techniquesand specific strengthening programmes. Sports medicine had started to identify the role that muscular trigger points may play in muscle-related pain (recognised in muscles since the 1930s)perhaps contributing to the false positive (MRI negative)muscle injuries. The use of invasive injection techniques such as Traumeel and Actovegin in the management of acute muscle injuries has been promoted in Europe for at least three decades, but their use remains controversial and not established in mainstream sports medicine literature– predominantly due to a lack of scientific evidence. Their clinical use has, however, persisted and despite a lack of substantial evidence, has in recent years expanded beyond Western Europe.

The last two decades have seen an explosion in literature regarding the hamstring muscle strain, with increased understanding of the epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology.–Subtle refinement of techniques for minimising inflammation and maximising regeneration has evolved, but many of the underlying principles of treatment have remained unchanged from the mid-20th century. Novel approaches to prevention and treatment continue to appear, but often lack an evidence base. Blood injections have been recognised as potentially therapeutic in sports medicine for over 60 years, and refinement of this in the form of autologous plasma preparations (platelet-rich plasma) has recently been popularised for muscle strain injuries. Currently, the evidence to support this remains limited from the basic science and clinical perspective–– in fact to date the published evidence is only slightly greater than that for the use of hyaluronidase injections, and possibly slightly less than the evidence for the use of corticosteroid injections in acute muscle injuries.

### Clinical and morphological changes following 2 rehabilitation programs for acute hamstring strain injuries: a randomized clinical trial [^111Dx9QR]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial.

Objectives

To assess differences between a progressive agility and trunk stabilization rehabilitation program and a progressive running and eccentric strengthening rehabilitation program in recovery characteristics following an acute hamstring injury, as measured via physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Background

Determining the type of rehabilitation program that most effectively promotes muscle and functional recovery is essential to minimize reinjury risk and to optimize athlete performance.

Methods

Individuals who sustained a recent hamstring strain injury were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 rehabilitation programs: (1) progressive agility and trunk stabilization or (2) progressive running and eccentric strengthening. MRI and physical examinations were conducted before and after completion of rehabilitation.

Results

Thirty-one subjects were enrolled, 29 began rehabilitation, and 25 completed rehabilitation. There were few differences in clinical or morphological outcome measures between rehabilitation groups across time, and reinjury rates were low for both rehabilitation groups after return to sport (4 of 29 subjects had reinjuries). Greater craniocaudal length of injury, as measured on MRI before the start of rehabilitation, was positively correlated with longer return-to-sport time. At the time of return to sport, although all subjects showed a near-complete resolution of pain and return of muscle strength, no subject showed complete resolution of injury as assessed on MRI.

Conclusion

The 2 rehabilitation programs employed in this study yielded similar results with respect to hamstring muscle recovery and function at the time of return to sport. Evidence of continuing muscular healing is present after completion of rehabilitation, despite the appearance of normal physical strength and function on clinical examination.

It is true that coach and trainer still attempt to exert their influence by calling men yellow at times who claim to have been injured, or try to bring undue influence on the athletic physician to permit an excellent player to return to competition before he should.

Despite being recognised at the time as both lacking consistent efficacyand potentially having a negative impact on muscle regeneration, corticosteroid injections for acute muscle injury were popular through the 1950s and 1960s. In vitro studies have confirmed the negative long-term consequences of cortisone on muscle injury repair, and as such, despite case series appearing to support its clinical efficacy, this technique remains controversial.

"(cortisone will)… defer the onset and retarding the rate of muscle regeneration after a simple crushing injury, (but) does not change the course or eventual outcome… "

The year that Dr Roger Bannister broke the 4 min mile saw a paradigm shift in the management of muscle injury, characterised by an increased emphasis on the specific pathological processes involved determining the nature of the treatment.

"Proper treatment of the actual injury must be predicated on a sound appreciation of the pathological changes that develop as a result of the injury".26

Remarkably, by 1954, many of the principles and practices used in the management of muscle injuries today were already articulated (table 1).

Table 1
Management of acute muscle injuries: 1954

"… treatment must be designed to minimise the haemorrhage and inflammatory reaction so that there will be as little granulation (scar) tissue formed as possible… "26

The imperative of controlling haemorrhage and inflammation to minimise scar tissue remains unchanged 60 years on. The theme of scar tissue minimisation has been resurrected in recent years, with the identification of numerous medications that may potentially assist in this task.–While their clinical utility remains to be delineated, 57 years on, this remains an exciting area of research.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^111F9kQS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have graded the quality of evidence concerning diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the most common muscle injuries and provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the best available evidence. Most clinical tests showed very low to low diagnostic effectiveness. For hamstring injury prevention, programmes that included the Nordic hamstring exercise resulted in a risk reduction of 45% to 65% when compared with usual care. For prevention of groin injuries, both the FIFA 11+ programme and the Copenhagen adductor strengthening programme resulted in risk reduction of 41% when compared with usual care. For treatment of hamstring injuries, lengthening hamstring exercises showed fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate when compared with conventional hamstring exercises. Platelet-rich plasma had no effect on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk after a hamstring injury when compared with placebo or rehabilitation. Most outcomes for all muscle injuries and domains were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, indicating that further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates. At this point, research on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscle injuries primarily concerns hamstring muscle injuries, with only limited research on quadriceps, adductor and calf muscle injuries. Furthermore, muscle injury prevention research is mainly conducted in football, whereas muscle injury treatment research is conducted across different sports.

What is already known

Lower extremity muscle strain injuries are very common in multidirectional sports.
The quality of evidence related to diagnosis, prevention and treatment for the most common muscle injuries (hamstring, adductor, calf, rectus femoris/quadriceps) have not been investigated.

What are the new findings

Most clinical tests for acute muscle injuries show very low to low diagnostic effectiveness.
Hamstring and groin injuries can be reduced 40% to 65% using specific exercise interventions.
Lengthening hamstring exercises show fastest return to play and lower reinjury rate compared with conventional exercises, and platelet-rich plasma offers no additional effect to current rehabilitation.
Most outcomes were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, thus further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates.

### Hamstring strain injuries: recommendations for diagnosis, rehabilitation, and injury prevention [^111iUatg]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hamstring strain injuries remain a challenge for both athletes and clinicians, given their high incidence rate, slow healing, and persistent symptoms. Moreover, nearly one third of these injuries recur within the first year following a return to sport, with subsequent injuries often being more severe than the original. This high reinjury rate suggests that commonly utilized rehabilitation programs may be inadequate at resolving possible muscular weakness, reduced tissue extensibility, and/or altered movement patterns associated with the injury. Further, the traditional criteria used to determine the readiness of the athlete to return to sport may be insensitive to these persistent deficits, resulting in a premature return. There is mounting evidence that the risk of reinjury can be minimized by utilizing rehabilitation strategies that incorporate neuromuscular control exercises and eccentric strength training, combined with objective measures to assess musculotendon recovery and readiness to return to sport. In this paper, we first describe the diagnostic examination of an acute hamstring strain injury, including discussion of the value of determining injury location in estimating the duration of the convalescent period. Based on the current available evidence, we then propose a clinical guide for the rehabilitation of acute hamstring injuries, including specific criteria for treatment progression and return to sport. Finally, we describe directions for future research, including injury-specific rehabilitation programs, objective measures to assess reinjury risk, and strategies to prevent injury occurrence.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^112CxNGu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This statement is divided into four sections: (1) hamstring, (2) adductor, (3) rectus femoris/quadriceps and (4) calf muscle strain injuries, and it includes three domains in each section: (1) diagnosis, (2) prevention and (3) treatment. We did not include studies solely reporting on non-acute problems, and/or clear traumatic injuries such as total muscle ruptures, avulsion injuries and muscle contusions. A systematic search was employed to identify literature for the three domains in each section, with inclusion of studies based on the highest level of available evidence. Data were synthesised and the quality of evidence were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group.

Search

Twelve systematic searches covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment for each of the four sections (1: hamstring, 2: adductor, 3: rectus femoris/quadriceps and 4: calf) were conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), CENTRAL and Embase (via Ovid) during July 2018 and updated in September 2019. No restrictions were applied concerning year of publication, however, only publications in English were included. We searched individual text words in title and abstract supplemented with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We combined anatomical region of interest (eg, 'Groin (MeSH)' OR 'adductor' OR 'groin') AND type of injury (eg, 'Athletic Injury (MeSH)' OR 'Strains and Sprains (MeSH)' OR 'strain' OR 'injur' OR 're-injur' OR 'reinjur') AND outcome for diagnosis and treatment domains (eg, 'Diagnosis (MeSH)' OR 'exam' and 'Return To Sport' OR 'full training', respectively) or intervention for prevention domains (eg, 'Primary Prevention (MeSHs)' OR 'Reduc'). If studies from one search was deemed relevant for one of the other 11 searches, the study was included as literature identified from other sources. In addition, reference lists of the included trials and relevant systematic reviews were scanned for relevant references. A flow chart of searches (see online supplementary file 1) and the complete search strategy for all searches and databases (see online supplementary file 2) is available as supplementary.

### Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs versus other oral analgesic agents for acute soft tissue injury [^116PZopS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute soft tissue injuries are common and costly. The best drug treatment for such injuries is not certain, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often recommended.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of NSAIDs compared with other oral analgesics for treating acute soft tissue injuries.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (12 September 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, 2014 Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2014), EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), CINAHL (1937 to November 2012), AMED (1985 to November 2012), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to November 2012), PEDro (1929 to November 2012), and SPORTDiscus (1985 to November 2012), plus internet search engines, trial registries and other databases. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of retrieved studies and pharmaceutical companies to obtain relevant unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving people with acute soft tissue injury (sprain, strain or contusion of a joint, ligament, tendon or muscle occurring up to 48 hours prior to inclusion in the study) and comparing oral NSAID versus paracetamol (acetaminophen), opioid, paracetamol plus opioid, or complementary and alternative medicine. The outcomes were pain, swelling, function, adverse effects and early re-injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Main Results

We included 16 trials, with a total of 2144 participants. Two studies included children only. The other 14 studies included predominantly young adults, of whom over 60% were male. Seven studies recruited people with ankle sprains only. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of bias; however, two were at high risk of selection bias, three were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding, one was at high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data, and four were at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. The evidence was usually either low quality or very low quality, reflecting study limitations, indirectness such from as suboptimal dosing of single comparators, imprecision, or one or more of these. Thus we are either uncertain or very uncertain of the estimates. Nine studies, involving 991 participants, compared NSAIDs with paracetamol. While tending to favour paracetamol, there was a lack of clinically important differences between the two groups in pain at less than 24 hours (377 participants, 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence), at days 1 to 3 (431 participants, 4 studies; low quality), and at day 7 or over (467 participants, 4 studies; low quality). A similar lack of difference between the two groups applied to swelling at day 3 (86 participants, 1 study; very low quality) and at day 7 or over (77 participants, 1 study; low quality). There was little difference between the two groups in return to function at day 7 or over (316 participants, 3 studies; very low quality): based on an assumed recovery of function of 804 per 1000 participants in the paracetamol group, 8 fewer per 1000 recovered in the NSAID group (95% confidence interval (CI) 80 fewer to 73 more). There was low-quality evidence of a lower risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in the paracetamol group: based on an assumed risk of gastrointestinal adverse events of 16 per 1000 participants in the paracetamol group, 13 more participants per 1000 had a gastrointestinal adverse event in the NSAID group (95% CI 0 to 35 more). Four studies, involving 958 participants, compared NSAIDs with opioids. Since a study of a selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAID (valdecoxib) that was subsequently withdrawn from the market dominates the evidence for this comparison (706 participants included in the analyses for pain, function and gastrointestinal adverse events), the applicability of these results is in doubt and we give only a brief summary. There was low quality evidence for a lack of clinically important differences between the two groups regarding pain at less than 24 hours, at days 4 to 6, and at day 7. Evidence from single studies showed a similar lack of difference between the two groups for swelling at day 3 (68 participants) and day 10 (84 participants). Return to function at day 7 or over favoured the NSAID group (low-quality), and there were fewer gastrointestinal adverse events in the selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAID group (very low quality). Four studies, involving 240 participants, compared NSAIDs with the combination of paracetamol and an opioid. The applicability of findings from these studies is partly in question because the dextropropoxyphene combination analgesic agents used are no longer in general use. While the point estimates favoured NSAID, the very low-quality evidence did not show a difference between the two interventions in the numbers with little or no pain at day 1 (51 participants, 1 study), day 3 (149 participants, 2 studies), or day 7 (138 participants, 2 studies). Very low-quality evidence showed a similar lack of difference between the two groups applied to swelling at day 3 (reported in two studies) and at day 7 (reported in two studies), in return to function at day 7 (89 participants, 1 study), and in gastrointestinal adverse events (141 participants, 3 studies). No studies compared NSAIDs with complementary and alternative medicines, and no study reported re-injury rates.

Authors' Conclusions

There is generally low- or very low-quality but consistent evidence of no clinically important difference in analgesic efficacy between NSAIDs and other oral analgesics. There is low-quality evidence of more gastrointestinal adverse effects with non-selective NSAID compared with paracetamol. There is low- or very low-quality evidence of better function and fewer adverse events with NSAIDs compared with opioid-containing analgesics; however, one study dominated this evidence using a now unavailable COX-2 selective NSAID and is of uncertain applicability. Further research is required to determine whether there is any difference in return to function or adverse effects between both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs versus paracetamol.

### Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs versus other oral analgesic agents for acute soft tissue injury [^116tWJmr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute soft tissue injuries are common and costly. The best drug treatment for such injuries is not certain, although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often recommended. There is concern about the use of oral opioids for acute pain leading to dependence. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the benefits or harms of NSAIDs compared with other oral analgesics for treating acute soft tissue injuries.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, 2020 Issue 1, MEDLINE (from 1946), and Embase (from 1980) to January 2020; other databases were searched to February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving people with acute soft tissue injury (sprain, strain, or contusion of a joint, ligament, tendon, or muscle occurring within 48 hours of inclusion in the study), and comparing oral NSAIDs versus paracetamol (acetaminophen), opioid, paracetamol plus opioid, or complementary and alternative medicine. The outcomes were pain, swelling, function, adverse effects, and early re-injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 20 studies, with 3305 participants. Three studies included children only. The others included predominantly young adults; approximately 60% were male. Seven studies recruited people with ankle sprains only. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of bias; however, two were at high risk of selection bias, three were at high risk of bias from lack of blinding, and five were at high risk of selective outcome reporting bias. Some evidence relating to pain relief was high certainty. Other evidence was either moderate, low or very low certainty, reflecting study limitations, indirectness, imprecision, or combinations of these. Thus, we are certain or moderately certain about some of the estimates, and uncertain or very uncertain of others. Eleven studies, involving 1853 participants compared NSAIDs with paracetamol. There were no differences between the two groups in pain at one to two hours (1178 participants, 6 studies; high-certainty evidence), at days one to three (1232 participants, 6 studies; high-certainty evidence), and at day seven or later (467 participants, 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). There was little difference between the groups in numbers of participants with minimal swelling at day seven or later (77 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence from three studies (386 participants) means we are uncertain of the finding of little difference between the two groups in return to function at day seven or later. There was low-certainty evidence from 10 studies (1504 participants) that NSAIDs may slightly increase the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events compared with paracetamol. There was low-certainty evidence from nine studies (1679 participants) of little difference in neurological adverse events between the NSAID and paracetamol groups. Six studies, involving 1212 participants compared NSAIDs with opioids. There was moderate-certainty evidence of no difference between the groups in pain at one hour (1058 participants, 4 studies), and low-certainty evidence for no difference in pain at days four or seven (706 participants, 1 study). There was very low-certainty evidence of no important difference between the groups in swelling (84 participants, 1 study). Participants in the NSAIDs group were more likely to return to function in 7 to 10 days (542 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence (1143 participants, 5 studies) that NSAIDs were less likely to result in gastrointestinal or neurological adverse events compared with opioids. Four studies, involving 240 participants, compared NSAIDs with the combination of paracetamol and an opioid. The applicability of findings from these studies is in question because the dextropropoxyphene combination analgesic agents used are no longer in general use. Very low-certainty evidence means we are uncertain of the findings of no differences between the two interventions in the numbers with little or no pain at day one (51 participants, 1 study), day three (149 participants, 2 studies), or day seven (138 participants, 2 studies); swelling (230 participants, 3 studies); return to function at day seven (89 participants, 1 study); and the risk of gastrointestinal or neurological adverse events (141 participants, 3 studies). No studies reported re-injury rates. No studies compared NSAIDs with oral complementary and alternative medicines, AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with paracetamol, NSAIDs make no difference to pain at one to two hours and at two to three days, and may make no difference at day seven or beyond. NSAIDs may result in a small increase in gastrointestinal adverse events and may make no difference in neurological adverse events compared with paracetamol. Compared with opioids, NSAIDs probably make no difference to pain at one hour, and may make no difference at days four or seven. NSAIDs probably result in fewer gastrointestinal and neurological adverse effects compared with opioids. The very low-certainly evidence for all outcomes for the NSAIDs versus paracetamol with opioid combination analgesics means we are uncertain of the findings of no differences in pain or adverse effects. The current evidence should not be extrapolated to adults older than 65 years, as this group was not well represented in the studies.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^117Rvg9N]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Domain 2: prevention

Several interventions for prevention of groin injuries have been investigated primarily in football including both males and females, however, no RCT's have specifically reported on adductor strain injuries. Thus, the quality of evidence for all studies/outcomes have been downgraded due to indirectness. The highest quality of evidence for a preventive effect was observed for an adductor strengthening programme consisting of the Copenhagen adduction exerciseperformed at different levels of intensity (moderate quality of evidence). The outcome measure in the study was the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center Overuse Injury Questionnaire, which captures all problems rather than only time-loss injuries. Thus, the risk reduction of 41% following the adductor strengthening programme encompass all groin problems from delayed onset muscle soreness to more severe injuries, hence the preventive effect specifically on acute adductor strain injures is uncertain. The FIFA 11+ programme also showed a medium risk reduction of 42% in football players and is a viable option for prevention of groin injuries. The preventive effect of an adductor strengthening programmeindicates the importance to focus on hip adduction strength gains for prevention. These findings are partly in line with prevention practices of groin injuries in football, with a recent survey of 64 professional youth academies demonstrating focus on adductor strengthening, although only few academies specifically performed the Copenhagen adduction exercise.

Domain 3: treatment

No studies were identified for treatment of acute adductor injuries, which is remarkable since acute adductor injuries are considered a common muscle injury in football. However, based on current literature concerning long-standing adductor-related pain, an exercise-based approach with a large focus on strengthening the adductor muscles has been recommended.

### Management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114RL3vx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients and clinicians can choose from several treatment options to address acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Purpose

To assess the comparative effectiveness of outpatient treatments for acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries by performing a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to 2 January 2020.

Study Selection

Pairs of reviewers independently identified interventional RCTs that enrolled patients presenting with pain of up to 4 weeks' duration from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.

Data Extraction

Pairs of reviewers independently extracted data. Certainty of evidence was evaluated by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Data Synthesis

The 207 eligible studies included 32 959 participants and evaluated 45 therapies. Ninety-nine trials (48%) enrolled populations with diverse musculoskeletal injuries, 59 (29%) included patients with sprains, 13 (6%) with whiplash, and 11 (5%) with muscle strains; the remaining trials included various injuries ranging from nonsurgical fractures to contusions. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) proved to have the greatest net benefit, followed by oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen with or without diclofenac. Effects of these agents on pain were modest (around 1 cm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale, approximating the minimal important difference). Regarding opioids, compared with placebo, acetaminophen plus an opioid improved intermediate pain (1 to 7 days) but not immediate pain (≤ 2 hours), tramadol was ineffective, and opioids increased the risk for gastrointestinal and neurologic harms (all moderate-certainty evidence).

Limitations

Only English-language studies were included. The number of head-to-head comparisons was limited.

Conclusion

Topical NSAIDs, followed by oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen with or without diclofenac, showed the most convincing and attractive benefit-harm ratio for patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. No opioid achieved benefit greater than that of NSAIDs, and opioids caused the most harms.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1159vuTw]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Sprains and strains — supportive guidance notes that the mainstay of treatment is rest and limiting the use of the injured extremity. Cold application can acutely decrease pain and swelling in joint sprains and muscle strains; in an RCT of 74 patients with sports-related soft tissue injury, cold therapy to soft tissue injuries improved pain scores at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after injury, and cold therapy improved edema compared with heat therapy in the acute time period, although cold application has not been demonstrated to improve function or time to recovery. The greatest tissue cooling is achieved by using a bag filled with ice and water surrounded by a damp cloth; other modalities such as refreezable gel packs or ice alone can also be used but do not cool the area as effectively as an ice and water mixture; experts recommend limiting the duration of cold application to 20 to 30 minutes for 3 to 4 times daily, and to prevent cold injury, ice should not be placed directly on the skin.

### Topical NSAID therapy for musculoskeletal pain [^112tZNAX]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Systematic reviews previously reported in the literature document that topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in relieving pain in acute and chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis, tendonitis, and muscle strains. Because several topical NSAIDs are available, with important differences among the formulations, there is a need to address and summarize the evidence of their effectiveness and safety.

Design

We searched Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for clinical trials and systematic reviews of topical NSAIDs in musculoskeletal pain, using the following keywords: "NSAID", nonsteroidal", antiinflammatory", topical", cream", gel", solution", lotion", patch", plaster", musculoskeletal", tendonitis", strain", sprain", trauma", and word roots "pain" and "arthritis".

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs may vary significantly in their absorption kinetics and pharmacodynamic effects, based on NSAID molecule and the formulation chosen. Some topical NSAID formulations have been shown to be more effective than placebo in multiple studies, or to have comparable efficacy and a better safety profile than oral NSAIDs for single joint osteoarthritis and acute muscle injuries. In acute and chronic low back pain, widespread musculoskeletal pain, and in peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes, the current evidence does not support the use of topical NSAIDs.

Question 5: What is the Evidence for Treatment of Muscular Pathologies with Injectable Biologics?

Muscle Injury/Strain

Muscle strains and tears are common with the hamstring and rotator cuff muscles frequently injured. For persistent or high-grade injuries, refractory to rest, ice, and physical therapy, injectable biologics have been explored as both monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgical repair. PRP is the most extensively studied injectable biologic for muscle injuries. Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated faster return to sport with PRP compared to placebo or therapy alone, although the quality of evidence is low due to inconsistency in findings, presence of clinical heterogeneity, and lack of blinding.

Of muscle groups, most regenerative medicine trials have focused on hamstrings. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs reported non-significant improvements in return to play and re-injury rates in hamstring injuries treated with PRP combined with therapy instead of therapy alone or no treatment. For rotator cuff tears, PRP adjuncts to surgical repair significantly lowered re-tear rates and fatty infiltration on imaging, but not pain or speed of healing.

One double-blind pilot RCT reported improved gluteus medius strength, volume, and histological healing response with placenta-derived MSCs versus placebo administered during and after hip arthroplasty, with no adverse events reported over a 2-year follow-up.

Consensus Point 15. There is limited evidence to suggest that a strategy of PRP with physical therapy is superior to a strategy with just physical therapy alone for treatment of muscle injuries. Current evidence suggests there is likely minimal to no benefit (Level I, Grade C).

### Platelet rich plasma therapies for sports muscle injuries: any evidence behind clinical practice? [^112Bk2JH]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

At present, no drugs are available to hasten restoration of muscle function after injury. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies may help athletes by promoting muscle regeneration.

Areas Covered

This is a systematic review assessing the evidence base for PRP therapies in the management of muscle injuries. A computerized literature search, citation tracking and hand searching for original studies assessing the effect of PRP therapies on skeletal muscle cell biology, skeletal muscle repair, or regeneration in animals or humans was performed. No randomized trials have studied the merits of PRP injections for muscle healing. Clinical studies indicated that PRP therapies may enhance muscle repair after strain or contusion, and laboratory data indicated that they can enhance diverse aspects of myogenesis. However muscle injuries present a complicated picture that includes many components other than muscle cells, such as blood vessels, connective tissue and neural components.

Expert Opinion

The field is relevant but under-researched. No PRP formulation has yet displayed proven solid evidence for the stimulation of healing and recovery after sports muscle injuries. Therefore, major issues, including standardization of formulations and application procedures, need to be addressed to inform clinical studies before recommending best practice guidelines.

### Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute musculoskeletal pain [^116F4iu4]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with reduced pain intensity in acute musculoskeletal conditions, but without increased adverse events?

Bottom Line

When treating musculoskeletal conditions such as sprains, strains, and contusions, topical NSAIDs are associated with greater pain relief, but are not associated with an increase in adverse events compared with placebo.

### Pain-free versus pain-threshold rehabilitation following acute hamstring strain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^1139G2VW]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Background

Conventional guidelines recommend hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation should only be performed and progressed in complete absence of pain, despite lack of comparison to alternative approaches.

Objectives

The primary aim of this study was to compare the number of days from acute HSI to return to play (RTP) clearance following a standardised rehabilitation protocol performed within either pain-free or pain-threshold limits. The secondary aims were to compare isometric knee flexor strength, biceps femoris long head (BFlh) fascicle length, fear of movement and re-injury during a six-month follow-up between pain-free and pain-threshold groups.

Methods

Forty-three men with acute HSIs were randomly allocated to either a pain-free (n = 22) or pain-threshold (n = 21) rehabilitation group. Days from HSI to RTP clearance, isometric knee flexor strength, BFlh fascicle length, fear of movement and re-injuries within six-month follow-up were reported.

Results

The median time from HSI to RTP clearance was 15 days (95% CI = 13 to 17) in the pain-free group and 17 days (95% CI = 11 to 24) in the pain-threshold group, which was not significantly different (p = 0.37). Recovery of isometric knee flexor strength at 90/90 degrees of hip/knee flexion was greater in the pain-threshold group at RTP clearance by 15% (95% CI = 1 to 28) and by 15% (95% CI = 1 to 29) at two-month follow-up. BFlh fascicles were 0.91cm (95% CI = 0.34 to 1.48) longer at two-month follow-up in the pain-threshold group. Two re-injuries occurred in both the pain-free and pain-threshold group during six-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Pain-threshold rehabilitation did not accelerate RTP clearance but did result in greater recovery of isometric knee flexor strength and better maintenance of BFlh fascicle length improvements compared to pain-free rehabilitation.

### Hamstring muscle strain injuries: what can we learn from history? [^111aAfHt]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In contrast to these underlying principles which have generally withstood the test of time, Delaruealso recommended the use of combined intralesional hyaluronidase/local anaesthetic injections, in the management of acute muscle injuries. This modality appears well recognised at the timebut by the 1970s had lost popularity. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown and inactivation of hyaluronic acid and was believed to be of benefit when used in the initial phase of muscle injury. Intriguingly, the in vivo function of hyaluronic acid has recently been elucidated, with its synthesis up-regulated in areas of acute soft tissue injury and functioning to promote and modulate inflammation, as well as potentially minimising scar tissue development. Thus, at least theoretically, minimising any hyaluronic acid excesses in the early phase of an acute soft tissue injury (thereby reducing inflammation) may be of some benefit, although paradoxically hyaluronic acid itself has been advocated for use in soft tissue injuries, with apparently good results.–

While core stability is now recognised as a critical component of hamstring rehabilitation and athletic performance,–the concept was first recognised as early as 1958. Writing after the VI British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Cardiff the same year, Lloyd (1958)recognised that hamstrings strains were one of the most common injuries observed, but also that the risk for all sports injuries may be minimised by an 'alerted posture'.

"Alerted posture' means alerting the prime fixer muscles so that quick movements can be carried out by activators and synergists acting on a frame already made firm by the prime fixers".42

By the late 1960s, the use of 'enzymatic preparations' including trypsin, chymotrypsin, streptokinase and streptodornase had replaced hyaluronidase injections. The use of oral enzyme preparations in the management of muscle injuries remains popular with some practitioners, despite limited scientific evidence of any benefit. Other medications such as Hirudoid (a heparinoid)and muscle relaxantswere also popular at the time.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^115KXbJA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The following sections discuss the statements for each type of injury and domain including the limitations in the existing literature.

Hamstring injuries

Domain 1: diagnostic tests

Based on the existing literature, conducted mostly in male football players, very low to low diagnostic effectiveness was observed for most clinical tests. This means that the shift in pre-test to post-test probability, and thus the change in the certainty of an injury or not, was minimal for most tests. For example, in Wangensteen et al the certainty of an MRI-defined hamstring injury was 78% (pre-test probability) before clinical testing, and this changed to 80% to 84% for a positive test and to 59% to 73% for a negative test (moderate to high quality of evidence). In practice, this means that 59% to 73% of players will still have a hamstring injury following a negative test, and thus commonly used tests, such as pain during strength testing and/or stretching of the hamstring muscles, seems to provide limited value in ruling in or out a hamstring injury. This, notion is confirmed by Schneider-Kolsky et al, who observed no shift in pre-test to post-test probability (67% to 67%) following a cluster of tests (moderate quality of evidence). The only test with high diagnostic effectiveness was the 'Taking off shoe test', which showed perfect agreement with ultrasound when positive, which means that a negative test is highly effective at ruling out a hamstring injury. However, the study was associated with serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding, which results in very low quality of evidence for this test. The limited diagnostic effectiveness of most tests may be explained by inclusion of athletes with acute onset of posterior thigh pain during sportor a verified hamstring injury on ultrasonography, that is a high pre-test probability of a hamstring strain injury. Thus, if a clear medical history, such as self-reported onset of acute posterior thigh pain during sport, is present it is questionable whether pain on stretching and/or contraction provide additional value in the clinical setting when diagnosing hamstring strain injuries, despite being considered important by most experts.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^116HdHm8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Is there a role for Platelet-rich plasma?

The use of autologous blood injections, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become widespread in recent years, primarily in the treatment of chondral and tendon problems. Recently the first two high-quality studies have been published examining the use of PRP in muscle injuries. Two studies produced conflicting results.

Using a double-blind, randomised and multicentre approach, Reurink et al recruited 80 recreational athletes with hamstring muscle strain injuries, and infiltrated the injured area with either isotonic saline or a standardised formulation of PRP. Ultimately, the authors found no statistical or clinically significant difference in either of their key outcome measures, RTP duration and reinjury rate, leading them to conclude that PRP is no more effective than a placebo injection of saline.

Hamid et al compared a group who received a PRP injection along with a standard rehabilitation programme with a control group who received the rehabilitation programme alone and found that patients in the PRP group achieved full recovery significantly earlier than controls. Significantly, lower pain severity scores were observed in the PRP group throughout the study. They concluded that a single autologous PRP injection combined with a rehabilitation programme was significantly more effective in treating hamstring injuries than a rehabilitation programme alone.

Of the two studies, the Reurink paper is of substantially higher quality with its use of a placebo saline injection. Previous PRP studies using saline as placebohave also failed to confirm the improvements found in those studies without placebo. There is not at this stage sufficient evidence to advocate the use of PRP in acute muscle injuries.

### Pain-free versus pain-threshold rehabilitation following acute hamstring strain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^115sVFBy]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The primary aim was to compare time from acute hamstring strain injury (HSI) to return-to-play (RTP) clearance following a standardized rehabilitation protocol performed within either pain-free or pain-threshold limits. Secondary aims were to compare isometric knee flexor strength, biceps femoris long head (BFLH) fascicle length, fear of movement, and reinjury occurrence at the 6-month follow-up between pain-free and pain-threshold groups.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Forty-three men with acute HSIs were randomly allocated to a pain-free (n = 22) or pain-threshold (n = 21) rehabilitation group. Days from HSI to RTP clearance, isometric knee flexor strength, BFLH fascicle length, fear of movement, and reinjury occurrence at the 6-month follow-up were reported.

Results

Median time from HSI to RTP clearance was 15 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13, 17) in the pain-free group and 17 days (95% CI: 11, 24) in the pain-threshold group, which was not significantly different (P = 0.37). Isometric knee flexor strength recovery at 90° of hip and 90° of knee flexion was greater in the pain-threshold group at RTP clearance by 15% (95% CI: 1%, 28%) and by 15% (95% CI: 1%, 29%) at 2-month follow-up, respectively. Improvement in BFLH fascicle length from baseline was 0.91 cm (95% CI: 0.34, 1.48) greater at 2-month follow-up in the pain-threshold group. Two reinjuries occurred in both the pain-free and pain-threshold groups between RTP clearance and the 6-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Pain-threshold rehabilitation did not accelerate RTP clearance, but resulted in greater recovery of isometric knee flexor strength and better maintenance of BFLH fascicle length, compared to pain-free rehabilitation.

### Topical analgesics for acute and chronic pain in adults-an overview of cochrane reviews [^114VXrSJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Topical analgesic drugs are used for a variety of painful conditions. Some are acute, typically strains or sprains, tendinopathy, or muscle aches. Others are chronic, typically osteoarthritis of hand or knee, or neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of topical analgesics (primarily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylate rubefacients, capsaicin, and lidocaine) applied to intact skin for the treatment of acute and chronic pain in adults.

Methods

We identified systematic reviews in acute and chronic pain published to February 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library). The primary outcome was at least 50% pain relief (participant-reported) at an appropriate duration. We extracted the number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for efficacy outcomes for each topical analgesic or formulation, and the number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for adverse events. We also extracted information on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, systemic and local adverse events, and serious adverse events. We required information from at least 200 participants, in at least two studies. We judged that there was potential for publication bias if the addition of four studies of typical size (400 participants) with zero effect increased NNT compared with placebo to 10 (minimal clinical utility). We extracted GRADE assessment in the original papers, and made our own GRADE assessment.

Main Results

Thirteen Cochrane Reviews (206 studies with around 30,700 participants) assessed the efficacy and harms from a range of topical analgesics applied to intact skin in a number of acute and chronic painful conditions. Reviews were overseen by several Review Groups, and concentrated on evidence comparing topical analgesic with topical placebo; comparisons of topical and oral analgesics were rare. For at least 50% pain relief, we considered evidence was moderate or high quality for several therapies, based on the underlying quality of studies and susceptibility to publication bias. In acute musculoskeletal pain (strains and sprains) with assessment at about seven days, therapies were diclofenac Emulgel (78% Emulgel, 20% placebo; 2 studies, 314 participants, NNT 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.1)), ketoprofen gel (72% ketoprofen, 33% placebo, 5 studies, 348 participants, NNT 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4)), piroxicam gel (70% piroxicam, 47% placebo, 3 studies, 522 participants, NNT 4.4 (3.2 to 6.9)), diclofenac Flector plaster (63% Flector, 41% placebo, 4 studies, 1030 participants, NNT 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5)), and diclofenac other plaster (88% diclofenac plaster, 57% placebo, 3 studies, 474 participants, NNT 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2)). In chronic musculoskeletal pain (mainly hand and knee osteoarthritis) therapies were topical diclofenac preparations for less than six weeks (43% diclofenac, 23% placebo, 5 studies, 732 participants, NNT 5.0 (3.7 to 7.4)), ketoprofen over 6 to 12 weeks (63% ketoprofen, 48% placebo, 4 studies, 2573 participants, NNT 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3)), and topical diclofenac preparations over 6 to 12 weeks (60% diclofenac, 50% placebo, 4 studies, 2343 participants, NNT 9.8 (7.1 to 16)). In postherpetic neuralgia, topical high-concentration capsaicin had moderate-quality evidence of limited efficacy (33% capsaicin, 24% placebo, 2 studies, 571 participants, NNT 11 (6.1 to 62)). We judged evidence of efficacy for other therapies as low or very low quality. Limited evidence of efficacy, potentially subject to publication bias, existed for topical preparations of ibuprofen gels and creams, unspecified diclofenac formulations and diclofenac gel other than Emulgel, indomethacin, and ketoprofen plaster in acute pain conditions, and for salicylate rubefacients for chronic pain conditions. Evidence for other interventions (other topical NSAIDs, topical salicylate in acute pain conditions, low concentration capsaicin, lidocaine, clonidine for neuropathic pain, and herbal remedies for any condition) was very low quality and typically limited to single studies or comparisons with sparse data. We assessed the evidence on withdrawals as moderate or very low quality, because of small numbers of events. In chronic pain conditions lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with topical diclofenac (6%) than placebo (9%) (11 studies, 3455 participants, number needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) 26, moderate-quality evidence), and topical salicylate (2% vs 7% for placebo) (5 studies, 501 participants, NNTp 21, very low-quality evidence). Adverse event withdrawals were higher with topical capsaicin low-concentration (15%) than placebo (3%) (4 studies, 477 participants, NNH 8, very low-quality evidence), topical salicylate (5% vs 1% for placebo) (7 studies, 735 participants, NNH 26, very low-quality evidence), and topical diclofenac (5% vs 4% for placebo) (12 studies, 3552 participants, NNH 51, very low-quality evidence). In acute pain, systemic or local adverse event rates with topical NSAIDs (4.3%) were no greater than with topical placebo (4.6%) (42 studies, 6740 participants, high quality evidence). In chronic pain local adverse events with topical capsaicin low concentration (63%) were higher than topical placebo (5 studies, 557 participants, number needed to treat for harm (NNH) 2.6), high quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence indicated more local adverse events than placebo in chronic pain conditions with topical diclofenac (NNH 16) and local pain with topical capsaicin high-concentration (NNH 16). There was moderate-quality evidence of no additional local adverse events with topical ketoprofen over topical placebo in chronic pain. Serious adverse events were rare (very low-quality evidence).GRADE assessments of moderate or low quality in some of the reviews were considered by us to be very low because of small numbers of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that some formulations of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are useful in acute pain conditions such as sprains or strains, with low (good) NNT values. There is a strong message that the exact formulation used is critically important in acute conditions, and that might also apply to other pain conditions. In chronic musculoskeletal conditions with assessments over 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in hand and knee osteoarthritis, as did topical high-concentration capsaicin in postherpetic neuralgia. Though NNTs were higher, this still indicates that a small proportion of people had good pain relief. Use of GRADE in Cochrane Reviews with small numbers of participants and events requires attention.

### Effectiveness of hematoma aspiration and platelet-rich plasma muscle injections for the treatment of hamstring strains in athletes [^1135TRWr]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment on recovery in acute hamstring injuries is controversial. Previous study results are inconsistent, and a standardized therapeutic approach has not been established yet.

Purpose

To assess the treatment effect using a combination of hematoma aspiration and muscle strain PRP injection in partial hamstring muscle tears (grade 2 strains) in athletes.

Methods

Magnetic resonance imaging of athletes with grade 2 hamstring strains were reviewed from 2013 to 2018. From 2013 to 2015, athletes were treated conservatively, and from 2016 to 2018, with a combination of ultrasound-guided hematoma aspiration and PRP muscle strain injection. The outcome, including return-to-play (in days) and recurrence rate, was compared retrospectively between both groups (conservative vs aspiration/PRP) using ANOVA and Fisher's exact test. There was no significant difference in age, type of sport, and muscle involvement (including injury grade/location, hamstring muscle type, and length/cross-sectional area of the strain).

Results

Fifty-five athletes (28 treated conservatively, 27 with hematoma aspiration/PRP injection) were included. Average return-to-play time (mean) was 32.4 d in the conservative group and 23.5 d in the aspiration/PRP group (P < 0.001). Recurrence rate of the hamstring strain was 28.6% (8/28) in the conservative treatment group and less than 4% (1/27) in the aspiration/PRP group (P = 0.025).

Conclusions

Athletes with grade 2 hamstring strains treated with a combination of hematoma aspiration and PRP injection had a significantly shorter return-to-play and a lower recurrence rate compared with athletes receiving conservative treatment.

### Strain-dependent variation in acute ischemic muscle injury [^1169ZhpJ]. The American Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Limited efficacy of clinical interventions for peripheral arterial disease necessitates a better understanding of the environmental and genetic determinants of tissue pathology. Existing research has largely ignored the early skeletal muscle injury response during hind limb ischemia (HLI). We compared the hind limb muscle response, after 6 hours of ischemia, in two mouse strains that differ dramatically in their postischemic extended recovery: C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ. Perfusion, measured by laser Doppler and normalized to the control limb, differed only slightly between strains after HLI (< 12% across all measures). Similar (< 10%) effect sizes in lectin-perfused vessel area and no differences in tissue oxygen saturation measured by reflectance spectroscopy were also found. Muscles from both strains were functionally impaired after HLI, but greater muscle necrosis and loss of dystrophin-positive immunostaining were observed in BALB/cJ muscle compared with C57BL/6J. Muscle cell-specific dystrophin loss and reduced viability were also detected in additional models of ischemia that were independent of residual perfusion differences. Our results indicate that factors other than the completeness of ischemia alone (ie, background genetics) influence the magnitude of acute ischemic muscle injury. These findings may have implications for future development of therapeutic interventions for limb ischemia and for understanding the phasic etiology of chronic and acute ischemic muscle pathophysiology.

### Platelet-rich plasma in orthopaedic applications: evidence-based recommendations for treatment [^115z8g47]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies have seen a dramatic increase in breadth and frequency of use for orthopaedic conditions in the past 5 years. Rich in many growth factors that have important implications in healing, PRP can potentially regenerate tissue via multiple mechanisms. Proposed clinical and surgical applications include spinal fusion, chondropathy, knee osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, acute and chronic soft-tissue injuries, enhancement of healing after ligament reconstruction, and muscle strains. However, for many conditions, there is limited reliable clinical evidence to guide the use of PRP. Furthermore, classification systems and identification of differences among products are needed to understand the implications of variability.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111e6CK4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioid Medication for Acute Pain

A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, no opioid provided better benefit than NSAIDs, and opioid use caused the most harms. The evidence review found that opioids might not be more effective than nonopioid therapies for some acute pain conditions, and use of opioids might negatively affect recovery and function. The review found that opioids were probably less effective than NSAIDs for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain, less effective than acetaminophen for kidney stone pain, and similarly effective as NSAIDs for low back pain. For postoperative pain, effects of opioids on pain intensity were inconsistent, and opioids were associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue analgesic use. Evidence was insufficient for opioids in treatment of episodic migraine. Compared with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, opioids were associated with increased risk for short-term adverse events, including any adverse event, nausea, dizziness, and somnolence. Observational studies found that opioid use for acute low back pain or postoperative pain was associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use. Proportions of adults with new long-term opioid use at follow-up after initiation for short-term use for postoperative pain have ranged from < 1% to 13%. Odds of long-term opioid use at follow-up after initiation for short-term use for acute pain might be greater with higher dosage and longer initial duration of exposure. For example, one study found that, compared with no early opioid use for acute low back pain, the adjusted odds ratio was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.55–2.78) for an early prescription totaling 1–140 MME and increased to 6.14 (95% CI: 4.92–7.66) for an early prescription totaling ≥ 450 MME. In episodic migraine, opioids as well as butalbital-containing medications were associated with a twofold higher risk for development of medication overuse headache compared with simple analgesics and triptans. Serious adverse events were uncommon for opioids and other medications; however, studies were not designed to assess risk for overdose, opioid use disorder, or long-term harms.

### Cryotherapy or gradual reloading exercises in acute presentations of rotator cuff tendinopathy: a randomised controlled trial [^111uQ5ju]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Tendons present a complex healing process that involves structural, cellular and vascular changes over time. During the 6-week follow-up, the natural tendon healing process, which implies a gradual decrease in inflammatory and pain mediators, could explain the similar progression of the two groups regarding pain and function. The effect of ice or gradual exercises could be negligible compared with the time factor, which could explain the lack of difference between the two groups in the short term. The strength, ROM and AHD results, which did not improve over time for both groups, support this hypothesis.

A recent literature reviewsuggested that an imbalanced adaptation between muscles and tendons in response to specific loading conditions might be responsible for tendon injuries. Muscles can improve in their strength and size under moderate loads, while tendons only seem to effectively be strengthened (increase stiffness) when high-magnitude tendon strain is applied (ie, 90% isometric maximum voluntary contraction). This imbalance leads to a higher tendon strain during maximal voluntary contraction and increases the mechanical demand on the tendon by the muscle contraction, which increases the risk of tendon injury. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that including gradual reloading exercises early in the rehabilitation that leads to high-magnitude tendon strain could be beneficial to address possible imbalances that could be responsible for the acute tendinopathy, which in turn would help prevent progression to chronicity. However, our protocol did not include such high reinforcement parameters, which would not have been enough to create a tendon adaptation. Future studies should include higher reinforcement parameters to observe the effect of early loading exercises.

The second objective of this study was to determine if these two interventions have different effects on shoulder strength, ROM and AHD. There was no significant difference between the two groups and there was no time effect. At baseline, both groups had AHD within the normal range, so there was no capacity or requirement for it to increase as expected. Similarly, the mean ROM values at baseline were close to the normative valuesand no ROM exercise was included in our interventions; therefore, it is not really surprising that ROM did not significantly change over time. Since 3–4 weeks are necessary to observe an increase in strength following resistance exercises, it also seems normal to observe no strength improvement within 2 weeks of treatment. Force measurements at 6-week follow-up would have made it easier to see if there is a variation in strength following these two interventions.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^113CBm5F]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Rehabilitation programmes

For a number of years the only RCT comparing different hamstring rehabilitation programmes was Sherry and Beststudy, which reported significantly lower reinjury rates in athletes who completed a progressive agility and trunk stabilisation (PATS) programme, compared to those whose rehabilitation programmes focused on isolated hamstring strengthening and stretching.

Silder et al demonstrated a similar degree of muscle recovery at the time of return to sport in patients with an acute hamstring strain injury treated with either the PATS programme or a programme with a heavy emphasis on eccentric strengthening (PRES).

Askling et al performed two identical studies, one in footballers and other in sprinters and jumpers, and demonstrated that a rehabilitation protocol consisting of mainly lengthening type of exercises (L-protocol) is more effective than a conventional protocol in promoting return to sport after acute hamstring injury. The most conspicuous characteristics of the more successful L-protocol were the systematic attempts to put load on the hamstrings during maximal dynamic lengthening, using exercises entitled The Extender, The Diver and The Glider. On this basis, they recommended that hamstring injury rehabilitation protocols should be preferentially based on strength and flexibility exercises that primarily involve exercises with high loads at long muscle–tendon lengths.

### Traumatic muscle injury [^114RKhR1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Traumatic muscle injury represents a collection of skeletal muscle pathologies caused by trauma to the muscle tissue and is defined as damage to the muscle tissue that can result in a functional deficit. Traumatic muscle injury can affect people across the lifespan and can result from high stresses and strains to skeletal muscle tissue, often due to muscle activation while the muscle is lengthening, resulting in indirect and non-contact muscle injuries (strains or ruptures), or from external impact, resulting in direct muscle injuries (contusion or laceration). At a microscopic level, muscle fibres can repair focal damage but must be completely regenerated after full myofibre necrosis. The diagnosis of muscle injury is based on patient history and physical examination. Imaging may be indicated to eliminate differential diagnoses. The management of muscle injury has changed within the past 5 years from initial rest, immobilization and (over)protection to early activation and progressive loading using an active approach. One challenge of muscle injury management is that numerous medical treatment options, such as medications and injections, are often used or proposed to try to accelerate muscle recovery despite very limited efficacy evidence. Another challenge is the prevention of muscle injury owing to the multifactorial and complex nature of this injury.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in adults: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians [^112viJpX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) guideline evidence base — The network meta-analysis included 207 trials comprising 32 959 patients, with the median of mean patient ages 34.3 years (interquartile range, 28 to 39 years); causes and locations varied across studies (for example, 48% mixed musculoskeletal injuries, 26% sprains, 6% whiplash, 5% muscle strains; 29% isolated ankle injuries, 26% various injuries, 11% neck injuries, 9% upper- and lower-limb injuries, and 7% isolated shoulder injuries), the median average baseline pain was 6.49 cm on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS), and a separate systematic review on predictors of prolonged use included 13 observational studies with 13 263 393 participants.

### Muscle contusion injuries: current treatment options [^111KaTW1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Muscle contusion is second only to strain as the leading cause of morbidity from sports-related injuries. Severity depends on the site of impact, the activation status of the muscles involved, the age of the patient, and the presence of fatigue. The diagnosis has traditionally been one of clinical judgment; however, newer modalities, including ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, are becoming increasingly important in both identifying and delineating the extent of injury. Although controlled clinical studies are scarce, animal research into muscle contusions has allowed the description of the natural healing process, which involves a complex balance between muscle repair, regeneration, and scar-tissue formation. Studies are being performed to evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, operative repair, and exercise protocols. Prevention and treatment of complications such as myositis ossificans have also been stressed, but recognition may improve the outcome of these ubiquitous injuries.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111LjcnW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain

Many acute pain conditions often can be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, topical NSAIDs provided the greatest benefit-harm ratio, followed by oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen with or without diclofenac. NSAIDs have been found to be more effective than opioids for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain and similarly effective to opioids for low back pain. Evidence is limited on comparative effectiveness of therapies for acute neuropathic pain, neck pain, and postoperative pain. For episodic migraine, triptans, NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (gepants), and lasmiditan are associated with improved pain and function with usually mild and transient adverse events.

ACP recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain. For acute musculoskeletal injuries other than low back pain, ACP and AAFP recommend topical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy and suggest oral NSAIDs to relieve pain or improve function or oral acetaminophen to reduce pain. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends NSAIDs as first-line treatment for acute dental pain management. For acute kidney stone pain, NSAIDs are at least as effective as opioids, can decrease the ureteral smooth muscle tone and ureteral spasm causing kidney stone pain, and are preferred for kidney stone pain if not contraindicated. Triptans, NSAIDs, combined triptans with NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, and acetaminophen are established acute treatments for migraine. Lasmiditan, an 5-HT1F receptor agonist, and ubrogepant, a gepant, were approved by FDA in 2019 for the treatment of migraine; another gepant, rimegepant, was approved in 2020. Lasmiditan and the gepants were more effective than placebo in providing pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week. Adverse events related to these newer medications require further study; however, their mechanisms of action are believed to be nonvasoconstrictive and potentially carry lower risks than vasoactive medications in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

### Chronic sequelae after muscle strain injuries: influence of heavy resistance training on functional and structural characteristics in a randomized controlled trial [^1175g7Qf]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Muscle strain injury leads to a high risk of recurrent injury in sports and can cause long-term symptoms such as weakness and pain. Scar tissue formation after strain injuries has been described, yet what ultrastructural changes might occur in the chronic phase of this injury have not. It is also unknown if persistent symptoms and morphological abnormalities of the tissue can be mitigated by strength training.

Purpose

To investigate if heavy resistance training improves symptoms and structural abnormalities after strain injuries.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 30 participants with long-term weakness and/or pain after a strain injury of the thigh or calf muscles were randomized to eccentric heavy resistance training of the injured region or control exercises of the back and abdominal muscle. Isokinetic (hamstring) or isometric (calf) muscle strength was determined, muscle cross-sectional area measured, and pain and function evaluated. Scar tissue ultrastructure was determined from biopsy specimens taken from the injured area before and after the training intervention.

Results

Heavy resistance training over 3 months improved pain and function, normalized muscle strength deficits, and increased muscle cross-sectional area in the previously injured region. No systematic effect of training was found upon pathologic infiltration of fat and blood vessels into the previously injured area. Control exercises had no effect on strength, cross-sectional area, or scar tissue but a positive effect on patient-related outcome measures, such as pain and functional scores.

Conclusion

Short-term strength training can improve sequelae symptoms and optimize muscle function even many years after a strain injury, but it does not seem to influence the overall structural abnormalities of the area with scar tissue.

Registration

NCT02152098 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

### Terminology and classification of muscle injuries in sport: the munich consensus statement [^113aRzxa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ekstrand et al described a significantly and clinically relevant shorter return to sports in MRI negative cases (without oedema) compared to MRI grade 1 injuries (with oedema, but without fibre tearing). Similar findings are published also by others. However, muscle oedema is a very complex issue and in our opinion too little is known so far. Therefore, we decided to mention in the classification system that several functional disorders present 'with or without' oedema (table 3). This is in our eyes the best way to handle the currently insufficient data. We think that discussion of the phenomenon of oedema at this point is premature but will be a focus of high level studies in the future, with more precise imaging and with studies which are based on a common terminology and classification.

Terminology

An aspect that may contribute to a high rate of inaccurate diagnosis and recurrent injury is that terminology of muscle injuries is not yet been clearly defined and a high degree of variability continues to exist between terms frequently used to describe muscle injury. Since it has been documented that variations in definitions create significant differences in study results and conclusions, it is critically important to develop a standardisation.

Strain and tear

Hagglund et al defined 'muscle strain' as 'acute distraction injury of muscles and tendons'. However, this definition is rarely used in the literature and in the day-to-day management of athletic muscle injuries. Our survey demonstrates that the term strain is used with a high degree of variability between practitioners. Strain is a biomechanical term; thus, we do not recommend the use of this term. Instead, we propose to use the term tear for structural injuries of muscle fibres/bundles leading to loss of continuity and contractile properties. Tear better reflects structural characteristics as opposed to a mechanism of injury.

### Efficacy and safety profile of a topical methyl salicylate and menthol patch in adult patients with mild to moderate muscle strain: a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study [^114rH94n]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

An occlusive patch formulation containing 10% methyl salicylate and 3% l-menthol was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Despite widespread use of counterirritants, including methyl salicylate and menthol, for topical pain relief, published efficacy and safety data regarding the use of the agents alone or in combination are limited.

Objective

The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety profile of a patch containing 10% methyl salicylate and 3% l-menthol compared with a placebo patch in adult patients with mild to moderate muscle strain.

Methods

Eligible patients were men or women aged ≥ 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate muscle strain. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1 active patch or 1 placebo patch applied to the skin at the affected area (ie, shoulder, upper back, upper arm, neck, calf, thigh, forearm, abdomen). Pain intensity was assessed on a 100-mm visual analog scale while at rest and with movement for 12 hours after patch application. The primary efficacy end point was the summed pain intensity difference score through 8 hours (SPID8) with movement. Analyses included use of descriptive statistics and an ANOVA model. Safety data, including adverse events, and secondary efficacy end points were also evaluated.

Results

A total of 208 patients (104 men, 104 women; age range, 18–78 years) were randomized to 1 of 2 study groups (105 in the active-patch group [mean age, 37.3 years], 103 in the placebo-patch group [mean age, 38.1 years]). The primary efficacy analysis (SPID8 with movement) indicated that patients receiving the active patch experienced significantly greater pain relief (approximately 40%) than those patients receiving a placebo patch (mean [SD], 182.6 [131.2] vs 130.1 [144.1]; P = 0.005). Analysis of the per-protocol population also found significantly more relief (P = 0.024) in the active-patch group (176.2 [131.4]; n = 92) versus the placebo-patch group (130.2 [144.0]; n = 96). Statistical analysis of secondary efficacy measures supported the primary end-point results. The number of patients experiencing any type of adverse event was comparable between study groups (active patch, 6.7% [7 events]; placebo patch, 5.8% [6 events]). No serious adverse events were reported during the study.

Conclusion

A single, 8-hour application of a patch containing methyl salicylate and l-menthol provided significant relief of pain associated with mild to moderate muscle strain in these adult patients compared with patients receiving a placebo patch.

### Ultrasound elastography in the assessment of post-stroke muscle stiffness: a systematic review [^116KV54i]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Similar to assessments made in healthy muscles the stiffness of paretic muscles is affected by the joint angle and the level of activation. The increased elbow extension increased the stiffness of the biceps. The change from palmar flexion to dorsiflexion increased the stiffness of the flexor carpi radialis as did the change from plantar flexion to dorsiflexion for the gastrocnemius medialis. In assessments of active muscle contraction, Saadat et al. and Lee et al. found an increased SWV in the active state compared to the passive state.

Clinical implications of detecting changes in muscle stiffness include potentially establishing a more accurate assessment for spasticity; however, research correlating clinical assessments of muscle stiffness with ultrasound elastography measurements is still in infancy. Most studies have commented on the correlation with clinical assessments, but the generally low sample sizes do limit evaluations. Despite no studies having a primary aim of correlating clinical assessments with muscle stiffness measured by ultrasound elastography, there were multiple attempts made in most of which the correlation proved true. Congruently, the recent meta-analysis by Miller et al. found that there was a positive correlation between the SWV values and the MAS and TS on the paretic side.

The assessment of muscle mechanical properties by strain elastography and SWE can be used to comment on the effect of the pharmacological or physical therapies. The literature supports findings of decreased stiffness which is in line with the aims of treatments such as BoNT-A injections and shock wave therapy. This demonstrates the potential for ultrasound elastography to be used not only in categorizing the changes in muscle stiffness in post-stroke, but also for quantifying the effect of treatment and potentially guiding the treatment to increase the efficacy.

An early assessment of the muscle mechanical properties before the non-neural components begin to take effect would be, in our opinion, the most appropriate 'base-line' value. Wu et al. had the earliest inclusion criteria of less than 6 months and found a correlation between the SWV of the biceps in a longitudinal axis and the duration of time since stroke. More research is needed to determine the stiffness of muscles as measured by ultrasound elastography in the acute stage post-stroke.

### CPAP improves regional lung strain rate and diaphragm velocity of relaxation in experimental self-inflicted lung injury [^114PZUBm]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Strong respiratory effort can lead to a second hit in severely injured lungs, increasing lung edema and collapse, and exacerbating lung injury. This phenomenon has been recently termed "patient-self-inflicted lung injury" (P-SILI). During strenuous respiratory effort, respiratory muscles generate forces that induce high levels of lung strain, distributed heterogeneously throughout the lungs. Early intervention using controlled low tidal volume mechanical ventilation (MV), the standard of care for moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, effectively prevents harmful negative esophageal pressure swings, regional lung strain progression, and lung injury.

Considerable attention has been directed toward minimizing the risks associated with MV. Noninvasive respiratory support has emerged as a promising approach, offering benefits such as reduced sedation requirements, mitigation of diaphragm dysfunction, improved patient mobilization, and prevention of infections and ICU-acquired weakness. The COVID-19 pandemic further expedited the adoption of noninvasive respiratory support strategies. In particular, noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has become an efficient therapy, enhancing oxygenation and reducing respiratory effort, as reported by multiple healthcare centers worldwide. More specifically, experimental studies have shown that noninvasive CPAP attenuates lung and diaphragmatic injury during P-SILI, significantly increasing oxygenation and reducing respiratory rate. However, thoroughly studying the mechanisms involved in reducing tissue damage remains elusive. Given the dynamic nature of lung tissue and diaphragmatic deformation during strenuous breathing, injury progression may depend not only on the deformation amplitude (strain) of tissue, but also on its rate of change (strain rate).

In this study, we investigate the effects of noninvasive CPAP on regional lung strain and diaphragmatic deformation and velocity in an experimental P-SILI model. We hypothesized that reducing respiratory effort by CPAP would result in reduced levels of strain rate and biomechanical improvement of the diaphragmatic kinetics at a regional level throughout the respiratory cycle.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112ommnJ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) clinical practice guideline (CPG) scope and outcome focus states that the CPG includes sports-related overloading and overstretching injuries to myofascial or musculotendinous structures in any combination of the 3 hamstring muscles and excludes isolated tendon injuries because tendon-only injuries differ in incidence, mechanism, pathoanatomy, clinical course, and treatment. Ultimate rehabilitation success is defined by return to sports participation while preventing reinjury, and only studies directly assessing time to return to play (RTP) and reinjury rates were included when discussing interventions for HSIs.

### WITHDRAWN: immobilisation and functional treatment for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries in adults [^113LTca2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lateral ankle ligament injuries (ankle sprains) are common problems in acute medical care. The treatment variation observed for the acutely injured lateral ankle ligament complex suggests a lack of evidence-based management strategies for this problem.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of methods of immobilisation for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries and to compare immobilisation with functional treatment methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (December 2001); the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-May 2000), EMBASE (1988-May 2000), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either different types of immobilisation or immobilisation versus functional treatments for injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults were included. Trials which investigated the treatment of chronic instability or post-surgical treatment were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two authors. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled using fixed effects models. Individual and pooled statistics were reported as relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and weighted (WMD) or standardised (SMD) mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcome measures. Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test.

Main Results

Twenty-one trials involving 2184 participants were included. The mean validity score of the included trials increased from 9.1 (SD 3.0) to 10 (SD 2.9) after retrieving further information (maximum 18 points). Statistically significant differences in favour of functional treatment when compared with immobilisation were found for seven outcome measures: more patients returned to sport in the long term (relative risk (RR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.86); the time taken to return to sport was shorter (WMD 4.88 (days), 95% CI 1.50 to 8.25); more patients had returned to work at short term follow-up (RR 5.75, 95% CI 1.01 to 32.71); the time taken to return to work was shorter (WMD 8.23 days, 95% CI 6.31 to 10.16); fewer patients suffered from persistent swelling at short term follow-up (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.59); fewer patients suffered from objective instability as tested by stress X-ray (WMD 2.60, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.96); and patients treated functionally were more satisfied with their treatment (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.07). A separate analysis of trials that scored 50 per cent or more in quality assessment found a similar result for time to return to work only (WMD (days) 12.89, 95% CI 7.10 to 18.67). No significant differences between varying types of immobilisation, immobilisation and physiotherapy or no treatment were found, apart from one trial where patients returned to work sooner after treatment with a soft cast. In all analyses performed, no results were significantly in favour of immobilisation.

Authors' Conclusions

Functional treatment appears to be the favourable strategy for treating acute ankle sprains when compared with immobilisation. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as most of the differences are not significant after exclusion of the low quality trials. Many trials were poorly reported and there was variety amongst the functional treatments evaluated.

### Lidocaine and menthol (Lidothol) [^111ykstX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:

Lidothol is a formulation used to assist patients in the treatment of mild to moderate acute or chronic aches or pain. Muscle or joint pain can be due to muscle or ligament strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains. It can also be used to help with certain types of headaches, but use with caution when applying in order to avoid eye contact.

Other uses may be considered if deemed clinically relevant.

### Mechanisms of muscle injury gleaned from animal models [^112hFQYH]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Eccentric contractions of skeletal muscles produce injury and, ultimately, muscle strengthening. Current data suggest that the earliest events associated with injury are mechanical in nature and may be based primarily on the sarcomere strain experienced by the muscle. In this review, recent experimental data, primarily from rabbit dorsiflexor muscles, are used to provide general information regarding the factors that cause injury and means for preventing injury. Mechanical experiments reveal that excessive sarcomere strain is the primary cause of injury. We hypothesize that excessive strain permits extracellular or intracellular membrane disruption that may permit hydrolysis of structural proteins, leading to the myofibrillar disruption that is commonly observed. Inflammation that occurs after injury further degrades the tissue, but prevention of the inflammation leads to a long-term loss in muscle function. Simple preventative treatments such as increasing muscle oxidative capacity (getting into shape) or cyclic stress-relaxation of tissue (stretching out) have no measurable effect on the magnitude of muscle injury that occurs. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the damage mechanism may improve our ability to provide rehabilitative and strengthening prescriptions that have a rational scientific basis.

### Imaging and ultrasound-guided steroid injection of internal oblique muscle strains in baseball pitchers [^116xQ2aR]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Internal oblique muscle injuries are common in professional baseball pitchers and may require a prolonged convalescence of up to 10 weeks. Most strains can be diagnosed clinically, but imaging can be helpful to assess the severity of injury, which may predict recovery and return to play.

Hypothesis

Ultrasound-guided injection of steroid and local anesthetic into the muscle tear can speed recovery and subsequent return to play.

Study Design

Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

Methods

Three professional baseball pitchers with acute tears of the internal oblique muscle confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging underwent ultrasound-guided injection of steroid and local anesthetic.

Results

All 3 patients experienced significant pain relief within a few days of the injection and were able to pitch at full speed within 3 weeks of injury (mean, 21 days) and return to able status by 5 weeks (mean, 30.7 days). The 3 athletes continue to pitch in Major League Baseball 36 months, 36 months, and 14 months, respectively, after injury, and none have sustained reinjury during this time.

Conclusion

Therapeutic injection of steroids and anesthetic under ultrasound guidance appears to speed recovery and rehabilitation in professional baseball pitchers with acute side strains.

### Topical NSAIDs for acute pain in adults [^112rV5Sq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical NSAIDs to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions is widely accepted in some parts of the world, but not in others. Their main attraction is their potential to provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events.

Objectives

To review the evidence from randomised, double-blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs in acute pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and our own in-house database to December 2009. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching on-line clinical trial registers and manufacturers web sites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or placebo (inert carrier)-controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adult patients with acute pain resulting from strains, sprains or sports or overuse-type injuries (twisted ankle, for instance). There had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and validity, and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Forty-seven studies were included; most compared topical NSAIDs in the form of a gel, spray, or cream with a similar placebo, with 3455 participants in the overall analysis of efficacy. For all topical NSAIDs combined, compared with placebo, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for clinical success, equivalent to 50% pain relief, was 4.5 (3.9 to 5.3) for treatment periods of 6 to 14 days. Topical diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and piroxicam were of similar efficacy, but indomethacin and benzydamine were not significantly better than placebo. Local skin reactions were generally mild and transient, and did not differ from placebo. There were very few systemic adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. There were insufficient data to reliably compare individual topical NSAIDs with each other or the same oral NSAID.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs can provide good levels of pain relief, without the systemic adverse events associated with oral NSAIDs, when used to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^112iVgqD]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

Two authors assessed the quality of evidence (LI and KK) for each outcome relating to diagnostic tests (eg, effectiveness), prevention (eg, risk of injury) and treatment (eg, time to return-to-play) according to the approach from the GRADE working group. Agreement was reached by consensus. The quality of evidence was graded as: (1) high, indicating that further research is unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect, (2) moderate, indicating that further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate, (3) low, indicating that further research is very likely have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate or (4) very low, indicating high uncertainty about the estimate. The starting quality of evidence was rated as 'high' when data was based on either RCTs for treatment and prevention purposes or rated as 'low' when based on observational studies. For diagnostic purposes, the starting quality of evidence was rated as high when based on cohort studies (prospective or cross-sectional). Subsequently, the quality of evidence could be downgraded one or two levels (eg, from high to moderate) for each of the following five domains of the GRADE approach: Study limitations (ie, serious risk of bias such as lack of blinding of outcome assessor or other concerns determined to influence the study result), inconsistency (ie, the heterogeneity of the results across studies if more than one study was included for the specific outcome), indirectness (ie, poor generalisability of the findings to the target population, eg, use groin injuries vs acute adductor injuries for prevention, and/or use of a clinically irrelevant outcome in relation to the question, eg, 'time to end of treatment' for 'time to return-to-play' outcomes), imprecision of the estimates (ie, wide CIs)and the risk of publication bias. Furthermore, the level of evidence for cohort studies could be upgraded due to a large effect, a dose–response relationship or if no effect was found and all plausible confounding factors identified in the study could be expected to increase the effect. An overview of the risk of bias and grading is provided as supplementary material (see online supplementary file 3; Table 1–11).

### Acute effect of heavy weightlifting on the pelvic floor muscles in strength-trained women: an experimental crossover study [^113WY5ZH]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Although heavy weightlifting exercises (e.g. back squat and deadlift) are assumed to produce strain on the pelvic floor, our results imply that these exercises are well tolerated by the PFM in healthy, nulliparous strength-trained women. Heavy weightlifting did not affect levels of exhaustion or muscle tone in our sample. However, the effect may be different among women with a higher risk of PFD, such as parous, postpartum, or older (> 35 yr) women. Our findings suggest that heavy weightlifting at 75%–85% of 1RM has limited effects on levels of fatigue and muscle tone in strength-trained women. Because PFD is common among female powerlifters and Olympic weightlifters, the long-term effects of heavy weightlifting and lifting greater than 85% of 1RM should be further investigated. Furthermore, individual PFM tolerance to training loads may vary, and PFD in strength athletes is important to address to identify relevant treatment options. Finally, our results show that whole-body strength is not associated with stronger PFM. Studies assessing the effect of targeted PFM training in strength athletes are therefore warranted — especially for women with SUI or other PFD.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^113GrC7v]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower extremity muscle injuries are frequent in sports involving explosive actions such as high-speed running, jumping, change of direction and kicking. In professional football, muscle injuries constitute up to half of all injuries, and in sports, such as American football, Australian football, rugby, basketballand track and field, the incidence is also high. The majority of muscle injuries in football occur during non-contact situations, classified as 'indirect muscle injuries' or 'muscle strains'. These are typically thought to occur in the muscle-tendon junctionwhen the force applied exceeds the tissue capacity.

In football, muscle strain injuries constitute up to 31% of all injuries, and up to 37% of players experience absence from training and/or match play during a season due to a muscle injury. Besides from significant financial costs at the professional level, the high injury burden of muscle injuriesalso have substantial implications on player availability, potentially affecting team performance. Up to 92% of all muscle strain injuries encountered in football are located in the hamstrings (37%), adductors (23%), rectus femoris/quadriceps (19%) and calf muscles (13%), with hamstring strain injuries also being the most common diagnosis in sports such as Australian footballand track and field.

The fact that incidence of muscle strain injury has remained constant during the last decades in footballand Australian footballwith slightly increased incidence for hamstringand calf muscle strains, highlights the ongoing challenge of muscle strain injuries in sport. Thus, to aid management of common muscle injuries in sport, the aim of this statement, commissioned by the Danish Society of Sports Physical Therapy, was to provide an overview of the existing literature. We identify, evaluate and grade the quality of evidence concerning the diagnostic effectiveness of clinical tests and the effect of preventive and treatment strategies for the most common lower limb muscle injuries including hamstring, adductor, rectus femoris/quadriceps and calf muscle injuries.

### Topical NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain in adults [^1158ExMm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical NSAIDs to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events. This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for acute pain in adults' originally published in Issue 6, 2010.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs in acute musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to February 2015. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers websites. For the earlier review, we also searched our own in-house database and contacted manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or placebo (inert carrier)-controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with acute pain resulting from strains, sprains or sports or overuse-type injuries (twisted ankle, for instance). There had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate the risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or other active treatment. We reported 95% confidence intervals (CI). We were particularly interested to compare different formulations (gel, cream, plaster) of individual NSAIDs.

Main Results

For this update we added 14 new included studies (3489 participants), and excluded four studies. We also identified 20 additional reports of completed or ongoing studies that have not been published in full. The earlier review included 47 studies. This update included 61 studies. Most compared topical NSAIDs in the form of a gel, spray, or cream with a similar topical placebo; 5311 participants were treated with a topical NSAID, 3470 with placebo, and 220 with an oral NSAID. This was a 63% increase in the number of included participants over the previous version of this review. We also identified a number of studies in clinical trial registries with unavailable results amounting to about 5900 participants for efficacy and 5300 for adverse events. Formulations of topical diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, and indomethacin demonstrated significantly higher rates of clinical success (more participants with at least 50% pain relief) than matching topical placebo (moderate or high quality data). Benzydamine did not. Three drug and formulation combinations had NNTs for clinical success below 4. For diclofenac, the Emulgel® formulation had the lowest NNT of 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1) in two studies using at least 50% pain intensity reduction as the outcome. Diclofenac plasters other than Flector® also had a low NNT of 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2) based on good or excellent responses in some studies. Ketoprofen gel had an NNT of 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4), from five studies in the 1980s, some with less well defined outcomes. Ibuprofen gel had an NNT of 3.9 (2.7 to 6.7) from two studies with outcomes of marked improvement or complete remission. All other drug and formulation combinations had NNT values above 4, indicating lesser efficacy. There were insufficient data to compare reliably individual topical NSAIDs with each other or the same oral NSAID. Local skin reactions were generally mild and transient, and did not differ from placebo (high quality data). There were very few systemic adverse events (high quality data) or withdrawals due to adverse events (low quality data).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs provided good levels of pain relief in acute conditions such as sprains, strains and overuse injuries, probably similar to that provided by oral NSAIDs. Gel formulations of diclofenac (as Emugel®), ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, and some diclofenac patches, provided the best effects. Adverse events were usually minimal. Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have provided additional information. In particular, information on topical diclofenac is greatly expanded. The present review supports the previous review in concluding that topical NSAIDs are effective in providing pain relief, and goes further to demonstrate that certain formulations, mainly gel formulations of diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, provide the best results. Large amounts of unpublished data have been identified, and this could influence results in updates of this review.

### WITHDRAWN: different functional treatment strategies for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries in adults [^113d2gh3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lateral ankle ligament ruptures are common problems in present health care. Early mobilisation and functional treatment are advocated as a preferable treatment strategy. However, functional treatment comprises a broad spectrum of treatment strategies and as of yet no optimal strategy has been identified.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess different functional treatment strategies for acute lateral ankle ligament ruptures in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (December 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000), EMBASE (1980 to May 2000), CURRENT CONTENTS (1993 to 1999), BIOSIS (to 1999), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials describing skeletally mature individuals with an acute lateral ankle ligament rupture and comparing different functional treatment strategies were evaluated for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included trials and extracted relevant data on treatment outcome. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. Individual and pooled statistics are reported as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous outcome and (weighted) mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcome measures with 95 per cent confidence intervals (95%CI). Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test.

Main Results

Nine trials involving 892 participants were included. Lace-up ankle support had significantly better results for persistent swelling at short-term follow up when compared with semi-rigid ankle support (RR 4.19, 95% CI 1.26 to 13.98); elastic bandage (RR 5.48; 95% CI 1.69 to 17.76); and to tape (RR 4.07, 95% CI 1.21 to 13.68). Use of a semi-rigid ankle support resulted in a significantly shorter time to return to work when compared with an elastic bandage (WMD (days) 4.24; 95% CI 2.42 to 6.06); one trial found the use of a semi-rigid ankle support saw a significantly quicker return to sport compared with elastic bandage (RR 9.60; 95% CI 6.34 to 12.86) and another trial found fewer patients reported instability at short-term follow-up when treated with a semi-rigid support than with an elastic bandage (RR 8.00; 95% CI 1.03 to 62.07). Tape treatment resulted in significantly more complications, the majority being skin irritations, when compared with treatment with an elastic bandage (RR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.86). No other results showed statistically significant differences.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of an elastic bandage has fewer complications than taping but appears to be associated with a slower return to work and sport, and more reported instability than a semi-rigid ankle support. Lace-up ankle support appears to be effective in reducing swelling in the short-term compared with semi-rigid ankle support, elastic bandage and tape. However, definitive conclusions are hampered by the variety of treatments used, and the inconsistency of reported follow-up times. The most effective treatment, both clinically and in costs, is unclear from currently available randomised trials.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^1175tZrn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury clinical diagnosis — presentation and directive: Clinicians should make a diagnosis of HSI when an individual presents with a sudden onset of posterior or thigh pain during activity, pain reproduced with hamstring stretching and/or activation, muscle tenderness with palpation, and loss of function. Although evidence for the use of clinical examination to diagnose an HSI is limited, an individual with an acute injury typically presents with a sudden onset of well-localized posterior thigh pain, muscle tenderness, and loss of function, and hamstring group stretching and/or activation may reproduce the pain.

Acute and subacute low back pain — Grunnesjo et al trial adding modalities to "stay active": Participants were randomized to four groups — "stay active" only (n = 35), "stay active" plus muscle stretching (n = 36), "stay active, muscle stretching and manual therapy (n = 42), or "stay active", muscle stretching, manual therapy and steroid injections (n = 47) — with quality of life measured at baseline, after 5 weeks, and at the end of the 10 week trial. There was a significant trend for increasing well-being as additional modalities were added, and adding manual therapy to staying active and stretching had positive effects on quality of life compared to staying active and stretching alone in 10 weeks.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^115jiAnL]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute pain — comparative efficacy and recommendation indicates limited benefit and unfavorable safety for opioids. "There were four quality trials of acute pain patients treated with opioids compared with placebo, with a small overall magnitude of benefit, whereas the adverse effects profile was high". Non‑opioid comparators performed as well or better: "Ibuprofen was reportedly superior to codeine or acetaminophen for acute injuries including fractures", "Diflunisal was equivalent to codeine for sprains, strains, and mild-to-moderate LBP", "Valdecoxib was also superior to codeine/acetaminophen for acute LBP treated in emergency departments", and "One trial suggests that transcutaneous electrical stimulation was equivalent to codeine/acetaminophen for acute trauma". The evidence summary states "No quality trials suggest superiority of opioids to other active treatments", and "Quality evidence indicates that safety profiles are considerably worse for opioids". Accordingly, "Routine use of opioids for treatment of acute pain is strongly not recommended and the recommendation for select use of opioids based purely on the evidence is downgraded from 'A' to 'C' (Table 1)". Note that "Valdecoxib is currently withdrawn from the market".

### Core muscle injury producing groin pain in the athlete: diagnosis and treatment [^111xn8CK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Groin pain is a common cause of pain in the athlete and may be the result of a variety of causes. Musculoskeletal groin injuries are often associated with muscle strain, particularly the adductor and abdominal muscles, termed "core muscle injury" (CMI). Since the early 1960s, there have been a growing number of articles intending to identify, define, prevent, and treat this condition; to date, however, the lack of a universal definition and treatment approach has complicated the narrative around CMI. This article intends to review the recent literature surrounding CMI, identifying common defining characteristics, as well as delineating treatment protocols that benefit the injured patient populations.

Hamstring strain injury (HSI) rehabilitation — A high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that a standardized progressive rehabilitation protocol performed within either pain-free limits (n = 21) or pain-threshold limits (n = 22) reported 2 reinjuries per group, with no difference in return to play (RTP) time; the median time from HSI to RTP was 15 days (95% CI: 13, 17) for the pain-free group and 17 days (95% CI: 11, 24) for the pain-threshold group (P = 0.37).

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^1121cUrZ]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Benzodiazepines

Small trials conducted in the 1970s to 1990s report some effect on acute or chronic low back pain (effect size and level of certainty not reported). Other studies indicate that benzodiazepines do not possess meaningful analgesic properties separate from their sedative properties. A 2017 RCT of 114 patients conducted in the US did not find that that adding diazepam to diclofenac in people attending an emergency department improved functional outcomes or pain at one week. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased falls, cognitive impairment, and risk of addiction.

Non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants

This category of medicine is broad and includes a variety of pharmacologically unrelated medications such as cyclobenzaprine, tolperisone, baclofen, and orphenadrine with similar indications. In both acute and chronic low back pain, there is low and very low certainty evidence that non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxants might offer small benefits (mean difference −0.8 (−1.2 to −0.3) from 14 RCTs from the US, Finland, UK, Turkey, and India) but increase the risk of harms, primarily sedation.

Oral corticosteroids

Limited evidence suggests they may be not effective for acute or chronic low back pain (mean difference 0.6 (−2.2 to 1.0) from one RCT conducted in the US), and may not cause harm in short courses.

Cannabinoids

A single RCT of oral cannabidiol in 100 patients conducted in Australia found no effect on low back pain compared with placebo (mean difference −0.3 (−1.3 to 0.6)) and no increase in short term harms in a hyperacute, emergency department setting. There are no data for chronic low back pain, and no data on harms associated with long term use in other chronic conditions.

Oral combination medicines

There is low certainty evidence that combining medicines does not produce superior effect sizes and may increase the risk of harms. An example of combination medicines sometimes used to treat low back pain is an opioid plus an NSAID or paracetamol.

Topical preparations

There is some indirect evidence (level of certainty not assessed) that some formulations of NSAIDS and rubefacients may reduce back pain attributed to muscle strains or sprains more than placebo (effect size not reported), which may apply to some cases of acute low back pain, with no increased risk of harms. There are no data on efficacy for chronic low back pain, but indirect evidence from other chronic pain conditions such as knee osteoarthritis has shown limited effect.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^112jC966]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Hamstring strain injury rehabilitation — exercise initiation and dosing: Evidence supports initiating hamstring-strengthening exercises, including eccentrics, early in the rehabilitation process, guided by patient pain tolerance, with successful interventions included 6 to 12 repetitions, depending on the intensity of the exercise, with both load and ROM increased as tolerated; patients should perform the exercises 2 to 3 times per week. Evidence also supports progressive agility and trunk stabilization exercises and a running program involving acceleration and deceleration phases, with a progressive increase in speed and distance, throughout the rehabilitation process as tolerated, and the benefits of eccentric training, added to stretching, strengthening, stabilization, and progressive running programs, are improved RTP times and reduced reinjury rates, while potential harms include a potential to aggravate symptoms and load the activity that was causative.

### Clinical principles in the management of hamstring injuries [^113cjjoL]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hamstring injuries are among the most common muscle injuries seen in sports clinical practice. This narrative review covers essential knowledge of hamstring injuries, ranging from strains to total proximal three-tendon ruptures. The primary aim is to provide basic information for clinicians and sports medicine therapists dealing with hamstring problems.

Methods

In this review, existing literature of hamstring injuries was taken together. Emphasis was given to subjects less well covered in previous reviews, such as preventive measures, as well as the most relevant information needed in the treatment of these injuries.

Results

Occasionally, symptoms remain after hamstring injuries which can be successfully treated with surgery. Knowledge of the effectiveness of preventive measures and nonsurgical and surgical treatment is limited by small studies of low evidence level.

Conclusions

Evidence-based treatment algorithms are not available. Larger studies of better quality with more concrete grading of hamstring tears are needed to improve knowledge in prevention and treatment of hamstring injuries.

### Clinical perspectives regarding eccentric muscle injury [^115UP3C5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

Muscle strain injuries occur to predictable muscles at consistent locations during expected sporting maneuvers when a muscle is stretched and then activated, particularly during high intensity bursts of activity. More than 30% of the injuries seen in the clinician's office are injuries to skeletal muscle. The typical location of the injury is just proximal to the distal muscle tendon junction regardless of strain rate or architecture of the muscle. After the injury, the muscle is weaker, continues to weaken, then recovers during the next week. An inflammatory response is seen in the following 1 to 2 days. By the seventh day, fibrous tissue replaces the inflammatory reaction and a scar forms. When a muscle is stretched, its tension still is reduced making the healing muscle more susceptible to a repeat injury. Viscoelastic properties of muscle also can help explain how muscle can be protected against strain injury. A 1 degree C increase in muscle temperature (warm-up) increases the muscle length to failure and a fatigued muscle is more susceptible to strain injury. It probably is impossible to prevent muscle strain injury; however, preventive measures can make muscle more resistant to these stretch-induced injuries.

Tendinopathy

Background: Tendinopathy is characterized by pain and dysfunction in a tendon, commonly due to excessive load or strain. In active patients and athletes, overuse can lead to chronicity. The most common tendinopathy in the knee is of the patellar tendon, is colloquially known as "jumper's knee" since it is commonly seen in jumping athletes, and can lead to microtears at the tendon insertion at the distal pole.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam. Patients with patellar tendinopathy present with anterior knee pain that is worse with activity, tenderness to palpation at the inferior pole of the patella. Other tendinopathies present with tenderness to palpation and pain at the tendon insertion site with activation of the muscle. Radiologic imaging will be normal. Ultrasound can assist in confirming diagnosis and will show loss of the normal fibrillar pattern, increased spacing between fibrillar lines, and generally reduced echogenicity.MRI will show increased signal at the tendon insertion.
Treatment: Pain secondary to tendinopathy is treated symptomatically in the acute phase – this includes NSAIDs and physical therapy with a progressive loading program. Additional adjuncts for pain control such as cryotherapy, peritendinous injection with corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered if the pain fails to respond to NSAIDs and PT and/or the pain persists beyond the acute phase. Ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy, percutaneous needle scraping, and high volume injection, and stem cells are at the forefront of regenerative medicine for tendinopathy and are currently being evaluated. If non-invasive management fails, surgical intervention would be the next step.

### Acute hamstring injuries in Swedish elite sprinters and jumpers: a prospective randomised controlled clinical trial comparing two rehabilitation protocols [^111bFKf9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hamstring strain is a common injury in sprinters and jumpers, and therefore time to return to sport and secondary prevention become of particular concern.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of two rehabilitation protocols after acute hamstring injury in Swedish elite sprinters and jumpers by evaluating time needed to return to full participation in the training process.

Study Design

Prospective randomised comparison of two rehabilitation protocols.

Methods

Fifty-six Swedish elite sprinters and jumpers with acute hamstring injury, verified by MRI, were randomly assigned to one of two rehabilitation protocols. Twenty-eight athletes were assigned to a protocol emphasising lengthening exercises, L-protocol, and 28 athletes to a protocol consisting of conventional exercises, C-protocol. The outcome measure was the number of days to return to full training. Re-injuries were registered during a period of 12 months after return.

Results

Time to return was significantly shorter for the athletes in the L-protocol, mean 49 days (1SD ± 26, range 18–107 days), compared with the C-protocol, mean 86 days (1SD ± 34, range 26–140 days). Irrespective of protocol, hamstring injuries where the proximal free tendon was involved took a significantly longer time to return than injuries that did not involve the free tendon, L-protocol: mean 73 vs 31 days and C-protocol: mean 116 vs 63 days, respectively. Two reinjuries were registered, both in the C-protocol.

Conclusions

A rehabilitation protocol emphasising lengthening type of exercises is more effective than a protocol containing conventional exercises in promoting time to return in Swedish elite sprinters and jumpers.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^116sjocn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical management

What are the implications of this research for clinical practice? Perhaps more emphasis should be placed on reduction of pain in the early days after hamstring injury to reduce the neuromuscular inhibition associated with pain, while at the same time encouraging early muscle activation, particularly eccentric exercise at longer muscle lengths, and early return to running with rapid progression to high-speed running.

While the concept of eccentric muscle training as an important component of the rehabilitation process has been with us for many years, it now appears that these exercises must be in the lengthened position. This makes sense when you think that the majority of hamstring muscle injuries are located in the long head of biceps femoris, a muscle that straddles both the hip and knee joints. The standard leg curl exercise, therefore, does not work the long head sufficiently. As a result, lengthening eccentric exercises such as the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), the Romanian dead lift and Askling's 'extender', 'diver' and 'glider' exercisesare now becoming the mainstay of postinjury rehabilitation.

Two papers have proposed parameters by which hamstring rehabilitation programmes can be created. Malliaropoulos et al suggested the following parameters — injury mechanism, hip or knee dominant, location, targeted muscle, length rather than strength, training parameters — should be considered when devising a rehabilitation protocol.

Guex and Milletsuggested a conceptual framework for strengthening exercises for hamstring muscles specific to the terminal swing phase of sprinting based on six key parameters (contraction type, load, range of motion, angular velocity, unilateral/bilateral exercises, kinetic chain) for strain prevention. They advocated that in sprinting sports, high-load eccentric contractions should be performed at a slow to moderate angular velocity and focused at the knee joint, while the hip is kept in a large flexion position (80°) in order to expose the hamstrings to a greater elongation stress than occurs in the terminal swing phase. They postulated that as a result, during sprinting, athletes would be better trained to brake knee extension effectively in the whole range of motion without overstretch of the hamstrings.

They also advocated unilateral open kinetic chain exercises based on their functional application. After analysing some of the frequently used hamstring strengthening exercises, they came to the conclusion that the 'optimal exercise had not been designed yet'. Finally, they noted that strain prevention is not only a question of strength, but also depends on the timing of contraction, or a combination of both.

### Musculoskeletal pain management and thermotherapy: an exploratory analysis of Italian physicians' attitude, beliefs, and prescribing habits [^115pR6uG]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In line with previous studies, our findings confirm that GPs are at the forefront of the MSK patient journey, mostly taking care of the initial therapy prescription as less than 10% of their patients were already experiencing a trial of analgesic treatment. In line with previous reports indicating NSAIDs as the dominant prescription for MSK pain in primary care, Italian GPs preferentially select NSAIDs as first-line option in arthrosis, muscle stiffness, and strain while prescribing heat wraps as preferred choice in presence of muscle spasm/contracture. The latter choice would acknowledge GPs' understanding of the physiological effects of superficial heat applications, particularly those relevant in case of muscle contracture such as the changes in elasticity of connective tissue and the reduction in muscle spasms. A similar pattern of prescribing habits can be found among specialists who, in contrast to GPs, adopted more frequently ice/cold therapy to relieve pain due to muscle strain and limited paracetamol use. After an acute injury, ice could be used to minimize swelling for the first two to three days. Therefore, icing rationale of use lies upon the premise that it eases pain, reduces tissue metabolism, and modifies vascular responses to decrease swelling. Once the swelling has subsided, heat could be used to increase blood flow and speed up the natural healing process. Knowing exactly when to use heat or ice can shorten recovery time and help with chronic aches, pains, and stiffness. To date, the greater rate of paracetamol use among GPs could be the result of the large clinical experience with this drug over the years, even in special populations like the elderly who are the most frequent age group referring to GPs for MSK pain of non-traumatic origin. Nevertheless, although paracetamol use has been long debated due to liver toxicity (albeit at doses higher than 4g/day), it is still recommended by guidelines for the treatment of multiple painful conditions.

### Does platelet-rich plasma decrease time to return to sports in acute muscle tear? A randomized controlled trial [^1128E8zD]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study is to report the effects of autologous PRP injections on time to return to play and recurrence rate after acute grade 2 muscle injuries in recreational and competitive athletes.

Methods

Seventy-five patients diagnosed with acute muscle injuries were randomly allocated to autologous PRP therapy combined with a rehabilitation programme or a rehabilitation programme only. The primary outcome of this study was time to return to play. In addition, changes in pain severity and recurrence rates were evaluated.

Results

Patients in the PRP group achieved full recovery significantly earlier than controls (P = 0.001). The mean time to return to play was 21.1 ± 3.1 days and 25 ± 2.8 days for the PRP and control groups, respectively (P = 0.001). Significantly lower pain severity scores were observed in the PRP group throughout the study. The difference in the recurrence rate after 2-year-follow-up was not statistically significant between groups.

Conclusions

A single PRP injection combined with a rehabilitation programme significantly shortened time to return to sports compared to a rehabilitation programme only. Recurrence rate was not significantly different between groups.

### Terminology and classification of muscle injuries in sport: the munich consensus statement [^116XtDDB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Muscle injury survey

Nineteen of the 30 questionnaires were returned for evaluation (63%). (Eleven experts did not respond even after repeated reminders.) Even though, this is a limited number, the responses demonstrated a marked variability in the definitions for hypertonus, muscle hardening, muscle strain, muscle tear, bundle/fascicle tear and laceration, with the most obvious inconsistencies for the term muscle strain (see online supplementary appendix 2). Relatively consistent responses were obtained for pulled muscle (Layman's term) and laceration.

Marked heterogeneity was also encountered regarding structural versus functional (non-structural) muscle injuries. Sixteen percent of expert responders considered strain a functional muscle injury, whereas 0 percent considered tear a functional injury (see online supplementary appendix 3). Sixteen percent were undecided to both terms, 68 percent considered strain and 84 percent tear a structural injury (see online supplementary appendix 3).

This confirms that even among sports experts considerable inconsistency exists in the use of muscle injury terminology and that there is no clear definition, differentiation and use of functional and structural muscle disorders. The results emphasised the need for a more uniform terminology and classification that reflects both, the functional and structural aspects of muscle injury.

The following consensus statement on terminology and classification of athletic muscle injuries is perhaps best referred to as a position statement based upon wide-ranging experience, observation and opinion made by experts with diverse clinical and academic backgrounds and expertise on these injuries.

Definitions — recommended terminology

Functional muscle disorder

Acute indirect muscle disorder 'without macroscopic' evidence (in MRI or ultrasound (for limitations see Discussion)) of muscular tear.

Often associated with circumscribed increase of muscle tone (muscle firmness) in varying dimensions and predisposing to tears. Based on the aetiology several subcategories of functional muscle disorders exist.

Structural muscle injury

Any acute indirect muscle injury 'with macroscopic' evidence (in MRI or ultrasound (for limitations see Discussion)) of muscle tear.

Further definitions reached in the consensus conference are presented in table 3 together with the classification system.

### Hamstring injuries: prevention and treatment-an update [^112vrJLZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recurrence

Reinjury after RTP remains a major problem. It is more common when the injury involves the biceps femoris. The number of previous hamstring injuries, active knee extension deficit, isometric knee flexion force deficit at 15°, and presence of localised discomfort on palpation just after RTP are also associated with a higher hamstring reinjury rate.

There is increasing evidence that even after RTP, eccentric hamstring strength is reduced, which may be a factor in the high recurrence rate of these injuries. Earlier studies failed to show any differences.

Whereas studies by Silder et al and Emami et al have failed to show any difference, Opar et al demonstrated that previously injured hamstrings displayed lower rate of torque development (RTD) and early contractile impulse (IMP) during slow maximal eccentric contraction compared with the contralateral uninjured limb. Lower myoelectrical activity was confined to the biceps femoris long head.

Regardless of whether these deficits are the cause of or the result of injury, these findings could have important implications for hamstring strain injury and reinjury. Particularly, given the importance of high levels of muscle activity to bring about specific muscular adaptations, lower levels of myoelectrical activity may limit the adaptive response to rehabilitation interventions and suggest that greater attention be given to neural function of the knee flexors after hamstring strain injury.

It has been suggested that the cause of this eccentric weakness is prolonged neuromuscular inhibition at long muscle lengths after hamstring muscle injury. Pain-driven neuromuscular inhibition of hamstring voluntary activation occurs following hamstring strain injury, and this inhibition has a detrimental effect on hamstring recovery by limiting hamstring exposure to eccentric stimuli at long muscle lengths during rehabilitative exercise.

Mendiguchia et al examined the effects of an acute hamstring strain injury on sprinting performance, and mechanical properties of sprint running at the time of return to sport and 2 months later. The study showed that despite being cleared to play, soccer players returning from a recent hamstring injury had substantial lower sprinting speed performance and reduced mechanical horizontal properties compared to the uninjured players. The greater magnitude differences in horizontal force compared to maximum velocity suggested that the lower maximal horizontal power observed in the injured player was mainly related to the reduced maximal horizontal force component. Approximately 2 months of regular soccer training after return to sports resulted in substantial improvements in sprinting speed (acceleration) concomitant with an increase in maximal horizontal force and power, whereas the speed component and top speed remained unaltered.

### Acupuncture for treating acute ankle sprains in adults [^114Db2it]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An acute ankle sprain is a sudden-onset injury of one or more of the ankle ligaments. It is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in the general population as well as in athletes. In some countries, such as China and Korea, acupuncture is frequently used in the treatment of ankle sprains, either as a single treatment or a secondary intervention accompanied by standard medical treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to May week 2 2013), China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (1994 to August week 4 2013), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1937 to May 2013), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (1985 to May 2013), Science Links Japan (1996 to August week 4 2013), several Korean medical databases (August week 4 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (August week 4 2013), the bibliographic references of included trials and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving adults with acute ankle sprains. We included all types of acupuncture practices, such as needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, pharmacoacupuncture, non-penetrating acupuncture point stimulation (e.g. acupressure and magnets) and moxibustion. Acupuncture could be compared with control (no treatment or placebo) or another standard non-surgical intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses using the fixed-effect method or, where appropriate, the random-effects method, and used 95% confidence intervals (CI) throughout.

Main Results

We included a total of 20 heterogeneous studies (2012 participants with acute ankle sprains); three of which included more than one comparison. Seventeen trials were conducted in China. All of the studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The results may also have been affected by selection bias, particularly as five studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and 12 studies gave no information on their method of randomisation. Of our three prespecified primary outcomes, only cure rate was reported by the majority of studies. No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function and only one reported on adverse events (in which three participants receiving a control intervention experienced skin problems from over-the-counter Chinese herbal patches). The other 19 studies did not record or report on adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence for cure rates as very low for all comparisons, which means we are very uncertain about the reliability of any of the estimates. The single study comparing acupuncture treatment with no treatment found acupuncture to be more effective with regard to cure rate at five days (31/31 versus 1/30; RR 20.34, 95% CI 4.27 to 96.68). Acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone was tested in eight studies; with cure rate data available for seven. Most of these studies reported higher cure rates in the acupuncture plus another standard treatment group than in the standard treatment alone group. However, while the results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from eight trials testing acupuncture versus no acupuncture tended to favour acupuncture, the results were very inconsistent across the studies and the estimated effect was very imprecise (383/396 versus 272/355; RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84; P value = 0.1; I(2) = 98%). Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese drug patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, oral Chinese herbal medicine and elastic bandage. Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test. The results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from 11 trials testing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to slightly favour acupuncture, but these were not statistically significant and the data were very heterogeneous (404/509 versus 416/497; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22; P value = 0.30; I(2) = 92%).

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence from a very heterogeneous group of randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of acute ankle sprains does not provide reliable support for either the effectiveness or safety of acupuncture treatments, alone or in combination with other non-surgical interventions; or in comparison with other non-surgical interventions. Future rigorous randomised clinical trials with larger sample sizes will be necessary to establish robust clinical evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for acute ankle sprains.

### Ultrasound elastography in the assessment of post-stroke muscle stiffness: a systematic review [^112oFFDG]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Changes in muscle stiffness after treatment

The objectives of therapy and antispasticity medications include reducing the degree of spasticity, improving joint function and decreasing pain. Rehabilitation therapy is highly patient-specific and requires daily commitment. Botulinum Toxin-A (BoNT-A) injections are administered into the muscle by the physician as a relaxant treatment to reduce muscle activation. The therapeutic response from these options, much like the initial development of spasticity, is measured by clinical tests such as the MAS and TS; however, there is growing literature to support the use of ultrasound elastography to measure the response.

The effect of BoNT-A injections into the biceps muscle was evaluated by Aşkın et al. by strain elastography. Their research showed a decreased strain ratio (correlating with less stiff muscles) at 4 weeks post-injection. Gao et al. also assessed the change in muscle stiffness after BoNT-A by both SWE and strain elastography. All patients (n = 7) were evaluated again between 17 and 30 days after injection, and there was a decrease in SWV from 1.90 to 1.63 m/s at 90° elbow flexion suggesting reduced muscle stiffness. More recently, Furukawa and Masakado investigated the change in strain ratio of both the biceps and medial gastrocnemius before and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after a BoNT-A injection. They noted a decrease in muscle stiffness; however, the change for each of their two participants followed a different pattern.

Liu et al. measured the SWV in spastic muscles before and immediately after therapy and functional electrical stimulation. The spastic muscles had a significant reduction in SWV from the treatment, despite having a higher SWV compared to the non-affected side both pre- and post-therapy.

Huang et al. explored the effects of whole-body vibration on the shear modulus of the medial gastrocnemius muscle every minute for the first five minutes after vibration. They did not find any difference in the stiffness of the paretic or non-paretic muscles from this intervention.

Yoldaş Aslan et al. assessed the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on the stiffness of the gastrocnemius muscle measured immediately prior, after the 2 week therapy and 4 weeks later. This randomized controlled trial also included a sham therapy and a control group. The strain index decreased in all three groups; however, the clinical assessments only decreased in the extracorporeal shock wave therapy group. Given that there were no between-group differences, they interpreted that the conventional therapy received by all groups was the reason for the decreased strain index.

In patients exhibiting unclear haemodynamic instability, echocardiography can be used to distinguish between a wide range of differential diagnoses such as pericardial effusion and tamponade, acute right heart strain as an indicator of pulmonary arterial embolism, restricted pump function, valve defects and others. For cardiogenic shock in particular, TTE and TEE are an essential part of the diagnostic armoury.

Existing guidelines:

The American Heart Association classifies the deployment of TTE in patients with hypotension or an unclear case of haemodynamic instability as 'Appropriate', with the highest grade of recommendation (A9).

The S3 guideline 'Treatment of multiple trauma/seriously-injured patients' states that echocardiography should be performed in haemodynamically unstable patients with multiple traumas for the diagnosis of pericardial tamponade or rupture. The guideline recommends TTE as the method of choice.

The S3 guideline 'Postinfarction cardiogenic shock: diagnosis, monitoring and therapy' states that TTE is essential for patients with post-infarction cardiogenic shock and should be performed as soon as possible following patient admission. Data obtained by echocardiography helps to assess the global and regional pump and valve function of the left and right ventricle, and to detect acute complications of a myocardial infarction, such as free wall rupture, ventricular septal defect or papillary muscle rupture.

The S3 guideline 'Provision of intensive care medicine to cardiosurgical patients: haemodynamic monitoring and cardiovascular therapy' recommends echocardiography to confirm diagnosis in the perioperative period for patients exhibiting acute and sustained haemodynamic disorders who do not respond to initial treatment, and for those whose ventricular function and its determinants are unclear. The guideline recommends this as a prudent step that improves the clinical outcome (GoR B).

### Implementing the 27 PRISMA 2020 statement items for systematic reviews in the sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports science fields: the PERSiST (implementing prisma in exercise, rehabilitation, sport medicine and sporTs science) guidance [^115ufKKT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Note for systematic reviewers. The PRISMA Search Reporting Extension (PRISMA-S) and accompanying checklistaids quality reporting for search strategies. PRISMA-S outlines how and what to report so others can reproduce the search. Consider seeking peer review from an information specialist or librarian (eg, using the PRESS 2015 Guideline Evidence-Based Checklistwhen developing a search strategy to improve the quality of the search.

Example: 'Twelve systematic searches covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment for each of the four sections (1: hamstring, 2: adductor, 3: rectus femoris/quadriceps and 4: calf). No restrictions were applied concerning year of publication, however, only publications in English were included. We searched individual text words in title and abstract supplemented with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We combined anatomical region of interest (eg, 'Groin (MeSH)' OR 'adductor' OR 'groin') AND type of injury (eg, 'Athletic Injury (MeSH)' OR 'Strains and Sprains (MeSH)' OR 'strain' OR 'injur' OR 're-injur' OR 'reinjur') AND outcome for diagnosis and treatment domains (eg, 'Diagnosis (MeSH)' OR 'exam' AND 'Return To Sport' OR 'full training', respectively) OR intervention for prevention domains (eg, 'Primary Prevention (MeSHs)' OR 'Reduc'). A flow chart of searches and the complete search strategy for all searches and databases is available as supplemental'
METHODS

Item 8: selection process

Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.

Example: 'The selection of studies was a three-stage process, with the identified citations independently evaluated for inclusion by two reviewers. The first stage was evaluation of titles selected with systematic searches described above. The article was included in this first screen if the title identified athletes and/or lumbar discectomy. We then reviewed the abstracts of all articles identified as meeting the search criteria. Full-text articles meeting criteria were retrieved and read independently by both reviewers and assessed for inclusion in the study. Disagreement was resolved by consensus between the two reviewers and a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached'.

### Imaging of hamstring injuries: therapeutic implications [^111ykpdh]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Though recent research into the diagnosis and management of hamstring disorders has resulted in early and accurate recognition of injury, hamstring strain remains the most common form of muscle injury in the active population. With prompt recognition of hamstring strain, an appropriate rest and rehabilitation routine may be devised by the sports clinician in the hope of avoiding future and possibly more debilitating injury. As such, imaging has played a pivotal role in assisting athletes, both elite and recreational, in returning to activity expeditiously.

### Rationale, secondary outcome scores and 1-year follow-up of a randomised trial of platelet-rich plasma injections in acute hamstring muscle injury: the Dutch hamstring injection therapy study [^1147uPvW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections are an experimental treatment for acute muscle injuries. We examined whether PRP injections would accelerate return to play after hamstring injury. The methods and the primary outcome measure were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) as 'Platelet-rich plasma injections in acute muscle injury' (2014). This article shares information not available in the NEJM letter or online supplement, especially the rationale behind the study and the secondary outcome measures including 1 year re-injury data.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 80 competitive and recreational athletes with acute hamstring muscle injuries. Details can be found in the NEJM (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1402340). The primary outcome measure was the time needed to return to play during 6 months of follow-up. Not previously reported secondary outcome scores included re-injury at 1 year, alteration in clinical and MRI parameters, subjective patient satisfaction and the hamstring outcome score.

Results

In the earlier NEJM publication, we reported that PRP did not accelerate return to play; nor did we find a difference in the 2-month re-injury rate. We report no significant between-group difference in the 1-year re-injury rate (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.38 to 2.13; p = 0.80) or any other secondary outcome measure.

Conclusions

At 1-year postinjection, we found no benefit of intramuscular PRP compared with placebo injections in patients with acute hamstring injuries in the time to return to play, re-injury rate and alterations of subjective, clinical or MRI measures.

### Management of acute musculoskeletal pain… [^1146guvj]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The guideline was developed by the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Management of acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries… [^1167Ku9z]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Acupressure and TENS techniques are effective nonpharmacologic options for acute pain. From the AFP Editors. Medication Therapy Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the primary recommended treatment, being among the most effective medications and the only to improve all measured outcomes. Topical NSAIDs improve pain within two hours, provide sustained relief over one week, and are the most effective intervention for improving physical function. They also lead to symptom relief and patient satisfaction more than oral NSAIDs. No adverse effects are more common with topical NSAIDs than with placebo. The effectiveness of topical NSAIDs with menthol gel is similar to that of topical NSAIDs alone. Oral NSAIDs are recommended as a secondary medical intervention. Oral NSAIDs also reduce pain at two hours and over one week and increase physical function and symptom relief, although to a lesser extent than topical NSAIDs.

Oral NSAIDs do not increase patient satisfaction and lead to more gastrointestinal adverse events. Acetaminophen reduces pain at two hours and over one week, similar to oral NSAIDs, but without increasing physical function, symptom relief, or patient satisfaction. Combining acetaminophen with oral NSAIDs does not appear to be better than either treatment alone. Nonpharmacologic Treatments Acupressure is the recommended nonpharmacologic therapy with the most evidence of benefit. Acupressure appears to produce short-term pain relief and is effective for at least one week. It also improves function, but does not improve symptom relief or treatment satisfaction. Studies are limited by different acupressure treatment plans. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is also a recommended nonpharmacologic option. TENS appears to produce short-term pain relief and pain relief for up to one week, but it does not improve physical function or symptom relief.

Other nonpharmacologic options have more limited evidence. Massage therapy produces short-term pain relief but has no other evidence of benefit. Joint manipulation may reduce short-term pain and improve symptom relief without improving physical function or treatment satisfaction. Supervised rehabilitation reduces pain over one week without improving physical function. Neither ultrasound therapy nor laser therapy reduces pain over one week, but laser therapy improves symptom relief.

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant… [^111nb5yE]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Cyclobenzaprine has been the most heavily studied drug, with consistently proven effectiveness. 17, 18 It was shown to improve pain, muscle spasm, functional status, and global evaluation versus diazepam in two fair-quality studies. 23, 24 Conversely, two other fair- and poor-quality studies did not reveal any significant difference between cyclobenzaprine and diazepam. Skeletal muscle relaxants have also been studied as adjunctive therapy to analgesics in treating acute low back pain. In one open-label study, the addition of cyclobenzaprine to naproxen resulted in a statistically significant decrease in muscle spasm and tenderness compared with naproxen alone. 28 A Cochrane review analyzed three high-quality trials that showed tizanidine plus analgesics was more effective in providing pain relief and decreasing muscle spasm than analgesics alone.

17 Conversely, one low-quality open-label study comparing cyclobenzaprine alone versus combination with ibuprofen showed that, although all groups improved at seven days, there was no statistical difference in outcomes among the groups. 29 Nonetheless, the use of combination therapy has been supported in quickening recovery, 17 with minimal overall risk of adverse effects (relative risk = 1. 34; 95% confidence interval,
0. 67 to 2. 67].
20. Selection of a skeletal muscle relaxant should be individualized to the patient. If there are tender spots over the muscle or trigger points on physical examination, a skeletal muscle relaxant is a reasonable adjunct to analgesic treatment of low back pain. Skeletal muscle relaxants may also be used as an alternative to NSAIDs in patients who are at risk of gastrointestinal or renal complications.

33 It may optimally be used in younger patients with limited or no medical conditions. Higher doses of cyclobenzaprine or tizanidine would be appropriate to promote sedation in cases of more severe discomfort or perceived muscular spasm. Although there appears to be insufficient data on metaxalone and methocarbamol, these may be useful in patients who cannot tolerate the sedative properties of cyclobenzaprine or tizanidine. Of note, methocarbamol costs substantially less than metaxalone.

### Nonopioid therapies for pain management… [^115CtpDo]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians can consider using nonopioid therapies to treat common types of acute pain including:

- Low back or neck pain
- Dental pain
- Kidney stone pain
- Pain related to musculoskeletal injuries
- Pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain
- Headaches, including episodic migraine. Nonopioid treatment options for acute pain Nonpharmacologic pain therapies
- Ice
- Heat
- Elevation
- Rest
- Immobilization
- Exercise Nonopioid medications
- Topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Acetaminophen
- Triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine for migraine Refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for additional information and examples of nonopioid therapies to treat acute pain.
- Exercise
- Exercise therapy
- Mind-body practices
- Weight loss
- Psychological therapies
- Manual therapies
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction.
- Low-level laser therapy
- Acupuncture
- Massage
- Spinal manipulation Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life. Nonopioid medications Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies can be used for subacute and chronic pain conditions. Some examples include:

- Topical and oral NSAIDs
- Acetaminophen
- Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants
- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Capsaicin and lidocaine patches. For example, for many people, low-cost group aerobics can be as effective as individual physical therapy for reducing low back pain and improving function. While the cost may vary, physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or have not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.
