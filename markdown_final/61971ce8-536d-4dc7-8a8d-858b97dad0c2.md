## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered when initiating lithium therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which baseline laboratory tests should be ordered when initiating lithium therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-authority sources that specify pre-treatment requirements. Then, I should translate those categories into specific tests. Next, I will verify additional tests commonly recommended by guideline syntheses and nephrology practice. After that, I need to separate baseline testing from ongoing monitoring and clarify timing. Finally, I will consider special populations and crystallize a clean pre-initiation checklist with justifications.

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility guidance to anchor the baseline panel. The FDA Prescribing Information repeatedly states that before initiating lithium, clinicians should evaluate renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function, assess concomitant medications, and for women of childbearing potential consider pregnancy status and potential, and it also warns that facilities for prompt and accurate serum lithium determinations must be available before starting therapy [^117S8BsX] [^115zwJ5V] [^114ZjWrE] [^1173Kw3f] [^116SffNV]. I should also cross-check these with the NICE bipolar disorder guideline, which operationalizes baseline and follow-up testing of urea and electrolytes including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function, with structured lithium level monitoring schedules that I must not confuse with baseline requirements [^1144GRtd] [^116uuDTX] [^113fzS5K].

> Now, I will translate the FDA categories into concrete baseline renal assessments. Given lithium's near-exclusive renal elimination and the explicit cautions for impaired renal function, baseline serum creatinine with calculation of eGFR and urea or blood urea nitrogen are necessary to characterize clearance and risk, and to decide if dosing needs adjustment or if lithium is contraindicated in severe impairment, defined as creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, while 30 to 89 mL/min warrants lower starting doses and slower titration with frequent monitoring [^1162YrHb] [^1177veaM]. Wait, let me verify if NICE expects creatinine alone or a fuller panel; NICE indeed expects urea and electrolytes and eGFR to be obtained and trended, which supports including creatinine, eGFR, and urea at baseline [^1144GRtd].

> Next, I should confirm the thyroid testing needed up front. Lithium increases the risk of hypothyroidism, particularly in women, and guidelines consistently require thyroid function assessment at baseline with ongoing surveillance, so I will order TSH and free T4 before the first dose to capture subclinical disease and establish comparators for follow-up every six months per NICE, recognizing early shifts can occur within months and may reverse after lithium discontinuation in a subset of patients [^1144GRtd] [^116ptV67] [^116mDdEz] [^1164uikN]. Hold on, I should verify if free T3 is mandatory; evidence and guidelines prioritize TSH and free T4, while T3 is optional unless the pattern is discordant or clinical suspicion warrants, so TSH and free T4 suffice for baseline in routine practice [^1144GRtd].

> I will now examine the electrolyte expectations, ensuring I do not miss calcium. Baseline sodium and potassium are core electrolytes given lithium's natriuretic interactions and toxicity profiles, and calcium should be included because lithium is associated with hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism; NICE explicitly lists calcium among the urea and electrolytes to track, and case-control data show a higher prevalence of hypercalcemia in lithium-exposed patients, supporting baseline calcium to detect pre-existing abnormalities and to benchmark future changes [^1144GRtd] [^116XQvqg]. Hmm, wait a minute, do guidelines require magnesium at baseline? I initially thought magnesium might be mandated, but I should double-check; neither the FDA nor NICE lists magnesium specifically for baseline lithium initiation, so I will not label it as mandatory unless clinical context warrants it [^117S8BsX] [^1144GRtd].

> Let me think about pregnancy considerations. For women of childbearing potential, I need to verify pregnancy status before starting lithium because per FDA labeling, pregnancy status and potential must be considered at initiation, and if lithium is continued in pregnancy, dosing and monitoring need adjustment due to increased clearance and peripartum volume shifts, implying that a baseline β-hCG is appropriate as part of pre-treatment safety evaluation and counseling [^115zwJ5V] [^1177veaM]. Hold on, I should verify if any other authoritative guideline contradicts this; I do not see contradictions, and specialist input is prudent if pregnancy is present or planned [^1177veaM].

> Next, I should review additional baseline tests that, while not always labeled mandatory in FDA text, are frequently recommended across clinical practice guidelines. A cross-guideline synthesis indicates that, beyond renal and thyroid function and electrolytes, many guidelines also advise obtaining a complete blood count, liver function tests, baseline weight and blood pressure, and urinalysis to assess concentrating ability and proteinuria, which is relevant for detecting early nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or pre-existing kidney disease; this is consistent with nephrology-oriented recommendations to include urinalysis alongside creatinine and eGFR when starting lithium [^112UGe5U] [^113uFE8k]. I should confirm that I differentiate these as strongly recommended consensus parameters rather than FDA-labeled essentials, to be transparent about evidence hierarchy [^117S8BsX] [^112UGe5U].

> I need to ensure the readiness of the clinical laboratory infrastructure before initiation. The FDA boxed warning emphasizes that facilities for prompt and accurate serum lithium measurement must be available before treatment starts, which means I should verify that the treating setting can obtain timed lithium levels reliably; this is a prerequisite rather than a biomarker test itself, but practically it belongs on the pre-initiation checklist [^1173Kw3f] [^116SffNV]. Wait, let me verify if this requirement is repeated across multiple labels; yes, consistent language appears in multiple lithium labeling documents, underscoring its weight [^117S8BsX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monitoring cadence; I need to separate baseline labs from post-initiation schedules. Once lithium is started, the level should be checked as a 12-hour trough after the last dose and repeated until stable; NICE advises level checks one week after starting and one week after any dose change, then weekly until levels are stable, then every three months for the first year and every six months thereafter, with more frequent checks in older adults, those with renal or thyroid impairment, high levels, poor adherence, interacting drugs, or poor symptom control; the ISBD/IGSLI task force also endorses the 12 ± 1 hour sampling convention, which aligns with FDA guidance on timing [^113fzS5K] [^116uuDTX] [^114FcgWm] [^112pgDsz] [^117S8BsX]. I initially conflated some of this with baseline testing, but to be precise, these are follow-up instructions after the first dose, not pre-treatment labs [^113fzS5K].

> Next, I should review special populations to ensure baseline interpretation and decisions are correct. In renal impairment, baseline eGFR under 30 mL/min contraindicates lithium, and eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min requires lower starting doses and slower titration with closer monitoring; in pregnancy, baseline confirmation and subsequent intensified level monitoring are required due to increased clearance during gestation and abrupt changes peripartum; in older adults, start low and monitor closely given greater sensitivity and toxicity at lower levels, which argues for cautious baseline thresholds and early specialist involvement when abnormalities are present [^1162YrHb] [^1177veaM] [^111q5bzj]. I should double-check that these constraints are reflected in the FDA labeling and not solely expert opinion; they are indeed specified in labeling, which strengthens their authority [^1177veaM] [^1162YrHb].

> But wait, what about patient education and early toxicity signals related to the baseline context. Before the first dose, I should counsel patients to report vomiting, diarrhea, or acute illness that can alter lithium levels and volume status, and document any baseline neurological or cardiovascular symptoms; NICE specifically instructs education on reporting acute gastrointestinal illness, and EXTRIP systematically catalogues the multi-system manifestations of lithium toxicity that inform what we monitor for during titration and follow-up, even though these do not change the baseline panel per se [^113f38Xy] [^1121kRqt]. This reinforces why the baseline electrolytes, renal function, and calcium are not perfunctory but foundational for risk mitigation [^1144GRtd].

> Let me synthesize this into a crisp pre-treatment protocol. Before the very first lithium dose, I will obtain serum creatinine with calculated eGFR and urea to characterize renal function, serum electrolytes including sodium and potassium and explicitly calcium to screen for and benchmark risks of natriuretic shifts and hypercalcemia, thyroid function with TSH and free T4 to detect pre-existing or subclinical dysfunction, and for women of childbearing potential a pregnancy test with appropriate counseling; I will add a complete blood count, liver panel, urinalysis for specific gravity and protein to round out consensus safety baselines and document baseline weight and blood pressure, and I will confirm that timely serum lithium assays are available in our laboratory, recognizing this infrastructure requirement is mandated by FDA labeling [^117S8BsX] [^115zwJ5V] [^1173Kw3f] [^1144GRtd] [^112UGe5U] [^113uFE8k]. Hold on, I should verify that each element maps to a source of authority or consensus; renal function, electrolytes, thyroid, and pregnancy are FDA and NICE aligned, while CBC, liver tests, urinalysis, and vitals are widely recommended across guideline syntheses and nephrology practice and are prudent to include as strongly recommended adjuncts [^117S8BsX] [^1144GRtd] [^112UGe5U].

> Finally, I need to clearly distinguish that none of the above baseline labs include a pre-treatment lithium level, and I should specify post-initiation sampling. After the first dose, I will plan the first serum lithium measurement as a 12-hour trough at about three to seven days depending on formulation and dosing schedule and then continue per NICE with weekly checks until stable, transitioning to quarterly for the first year and then semiannually, with more frequent monitoring in high-risk scenarios, ensuring results are interpreted alongside clinical status rather than relying on serum levels alone as FDA labeling cautions [^117S8BsX] [^113fzS5K] [^116uuDTX] [^114FcgWm]. I should double-check timing guidance consensus, and the ISBD/IGSLI task force confirms the 12 ± 1 hour convention for comparability, which I will adhere to in ongoing monitoring plans [^112pgDsz].

Before starting lithium [^117S8BsX], obtain baseline tests: **renal function (serum creatinine, eGFR, BUN)**, **thyroid function (TSH, free T4)**, **serum calcium** [^1144GRtd], **electrolytes (sodium, potassium)**, **CBC** [^113HT5S8], and a **pregnancy test** in women of childbearing potential [^1162YrHb]. These labs establish baseline organ function, identify contraindications, and guide safe dosing and monitoring.

---

## Renal function tests

Lithium is renally excreted; impaired renal function increases toxicity risk [^1162YrHb]. Baseline renal assessment is **essential** to guide dosing and monitoring [^117S8BsX] [^113uFE8k]. Serum creatinine and eGFR establish **baseline renal function**; avoid lithium if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^1177veaM], and **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)** provides additional context [^113XMz5z].

---

## Thyroid function tests

Lithium can cause **hypothyroidism**; baseline thyroid assessment is necessary [^1135D7PB] [^115zwJ5V]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the primary baseline test to detect preexisting dysfunction, and **Free thyroxine (free T4)** complements it to identify subclinical disease [^1144GRtd].

---

## Serum calcium and parathyroid function

Lithium may cause **hypercalcemia** via hyperparathyroidism; therefore, baseline calcium is recommended [^1135D7PB] [^1144GRtd]. Serum calcium detects **preexisting hypercalcemia** [^116XQvqg] or parathyroid disease.

---

## Electrolyte panel

Electrolyte disturbances affect **lithium levels** and toxicity risk [^1144GRtd]; baseline electrolytes are required [^117S8BsX]. Sodium and potassium identify abnormalities that can alter **lithium handling** [^113uFE8k].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC)

Complete blood count (**CBC**) establishes baseline hematologic status [^114hGEwj] and may reveal underlying conditions [^113HT5S8].

---

## Pregnancy test

Lithium is **teratogenic**; confirm pregnancy status before initiation [^117S8BsX]. A **pregnancy test** is required in women of childbearing potential [^115zwJ5V].

---

## Summary table of recommended baseline laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Serum creatinine and eGFR | Baseline renal function |
| Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) | Additional renal assessment |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Baseline thyroid function |
| Free thyroxine (free T4) | Detect subclinical thyroid disease |
| Serum calcium | Baseline calcium/parathyroid status |
| Sodium and potassium | Baseline electrolytes |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Baseline hematologic status |
| Pregnancy test | Confirm pregnancy status |

## Clinical implications of baseline laboratory results

Baseline **labs** guide dosing, monitoring, and risk mitigation:

- **Renal impairment**: Lower initial dose, slow titration, and frequent monitoring [^117S8BsX] [^1177veaM].
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Monitor closely and treat hypothyroidism if it develops [^1135D7PB].
- **Hypercalcemia**: Evaluate for hyperparathyroidism before starting lithium [^116XQvqg].
- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Correct before initiation to reduce toxicity risk [^1144GRtd].
- **Pregnancy**: Weigh risks and benefits carefully due to teratogenicity [^1177veaM].

---

Baseline labs for lithium initiation include **renal function, thyroid function, serum calcium, electrolytes, CBC, and pregnancy testing** [^115zwJ5V]. These tests enable safe dosing, early detection of adverse effects, and support ongoing monitoring [^112UGe5U].

## References

### Lithium [^117S8BsX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment screening**: Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: See Table 1 for dosage recommendations for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years). Obtain a serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose, and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. Refer to Table 2 for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose conversion.

- **Table 2. Lithium Carbonate and Lithium Oral Solution Dose Conversion**

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Evaluation of clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder [^113HT5S8]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In total, 247 monitoring instructions were found for monitoring of patients using lithium in all CPGs for BD, with an average of 27 instructions (range 4–61) per CPG. The content of monitoring instructions varied between guidelines.

Parameters of renal and thyroid function needed to be monitored according to all guidelines, although differences were noticeable concerning specific biomarkers. Besides renal and thyroid function, monitoring of body weight, blood pressure, electrolytes, hepatic function, and full blood count was most frequently mentioned. A pregnancy test for baseline monitoring of female patients was mentioned in many CPGs.

Most instructions were formulated such that monitoring was mandatory (n = 178, 72%), while in others, monitoring was recommended (n = 26, 11%) or on indication (n = 43, 17%). Only in the ISBD, Japanese, and American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines were most parameters recommended to be monitored. In the Dutch guideline, several parameters only needed to be monitored during maintenance treatment if clinically indicated. The CPGs produced by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT), Nederlandse Vereniging voor Psychiatrie (NvVP), NICE, and Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) contained many mandatory parameters to be monitored for all patients with BD.

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^1144GRtd]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, particularly in relation to laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining urea and electrolytes, including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function, every six months. This should be done more frequently if there is evidence of renal or thyroid impairment, elevated calcium levels, or an increase in mood symptoms that might be related to impaired thyroid function.

### Lithium [^1162YrHb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: As lithium is eliminated primarily through the kidneys, its renal clearance is decreased in patients with abnormal renal function, leading to a considerably increased risk of lithium intoxication in this setting. Lithium should not be used in cases of severe renal insufficiency, defined as a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min evaluated by the Cockcroft-Gault method, particularly if the condition requires adherence to a low-sodium diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function, characterized by a creatinine clearance of 30 to 89 mL/min as evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault, should start with lower doses of lithium. Slow titration should be employed, with frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentrations and vigilance for signs of lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^116uuDTX]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of lithium toxicity, particularly concerning laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining serum lithium levels every three months for the first year and every six months thereafter.

### Lithium in the kidney: Friend and foe [^115u8Ntm]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Trace amounts of lithium are essential for our physical and mental health, and the administration of lithium has improved the quality of life for millions of patients with bipolar disorder for over 60 years. However, in a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder, long-term lithium therapy comes at the cost of severe renal side effects, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and, rarely, end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although the mechanisms underlying lithium-induced renal pathologies are becoming clearer, several recent animal studies revealed that short-term administration of lower amounts of lithium prevents different forms of experimental acute kidney injury (AKI).

In this review, we discuss the knowledge of the pathologic and therapeutic effects of lithium in the kidney. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying mechanisms of these seemingly paradoxical effects of lithium, in which fine-tuned regulation of glycogen synthase kinase type 3, a prime target for lithium, seems to be key. The new discoveries regarding the protective effect of lithium against AKI in rodents call for follow-up studies in humans and suggest that long-term therapy with low lithium concentrations could be beneficial in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

In regard to medical management for suicidal ideation, specifically concerning the use of lithium, the DoD/VA 2025 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to either recommend or oppose the use of lithium to reduce the risk of suicide or suicide attempts in patients with mood disorders.

### European Academy of Neurology guidelines on the treatment of cluster headache [^111kb9BW]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cluster headache, particularly in terms of preventative therapy, the EAN 2023 guidelines recommend ensuring that lithium levels do not exceed 1.2 mmol/L. It is recognized that maintaining levels at 0.4 mmol/L is probably sufficient, with 0.6–0.8 mmol/L being considered ideal.

### Saliva testing as a means to monitor therapeutic lithium levels in patients with psychiatric disorders: Identification of clinical and environmental covariates, and their incorporation into a prediction model [^11681dKb]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Advantages to using saliva rather than blood are numerous, including the fact that it doesn't require trained personnel for collection and can be conducted in any setting; these features could directly translate into more frequent and improved lithium monitoring for both outpatients and inpatients. For outpatients, saliva sampling could allow for at-home collection, enabling patients to schedule lithium measurements around last dosing, food, and other activities, without the need to arrange and attend a pathology clinic. Additionally, lithium measurements could be obtained from saliva samples collected during phases of acute bipolar illness, when an individual may be unable to attend a pathology clinic. During such times, knowledge of plasma lithium levels would help clinicians determine the optimal therapeutic dose.

Such results could be tabulated in a lithium therapy chart alongside symptoms, medication tolerability, general health, and significant life events, as outlined by the Lithiumeter guide, to provide a comprehensive overview of illness and treatment. Overall, at-home sampling would more accurately predict an individual's lithium level amidst these other potentially confounding activities. This is important because the prescription of lithium medications is based on the level in the blood 12 hours after an individual's last dose, which is challenging to capture precisely in a clinical appointment. While no association was found between the time lapsed from the last dose to blood collection and either salivary lithium, serum lithium, or saliva/serum lithium ratios, previous research by Serdar provides further context.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^112pgDsz]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **What is the best timing of blood sampling**: No study was found that directly addressed this question. However, most of the included studies adhered to the generally accepted recommendation of sampling blood 12 ± 1 hours after the last (i.e. evening) intake. There was also consensus on this practice among the Task Force members for patients taking lithium twice daily or once daily in the evening. In contrast, no consensus was achieved concerning whether to sample in the evening or the following morning for patients taking lithium once daily in the morning, a dosing schedule likely seldom applied in clinical practice.

- **Should the recommendations be different for dosing once daily vs. twice daily and for immediate release vs. extended release formulations**: There is pharmacogenetic evidence indicating that a total daily dose of lithium given once daily results in a 10%-15% higher 12 ± 1 hours trough level than when administered twice daily. Nevertheless, the Task Force members reached a consensus that the same recommendations for optimal lithium serum levels could be applied to both dosing strategies. Similarly, it was agreed that the recommendations should remain consistent for different formulations (immediate release vs. extended release).

An important clinical implication of this approach is that the relatively small changes in 12 ± 1 hours trough levels caused by adjustments in dosing schedule or lithium formulation should not necessarily necessitate modifications to the targeted lithium levels. In the absence of solid evidence supporting an alternative approach, this simple pragmatic strategy is reasonable.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^116REhmR]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: A considerable number of patients using lithium were not monitored according to the Dutch guidelines. Compliance was relatively higher for laboratory monitoring of creatinine compared to monitoring of lithium serum levels and TSH. The higher proportion of patients being monitored for creatinine might be explained by the fact that creatinine is more often included in laboratory protocols than lithium serum levels, for example, during admission laboratory measurements or when needed for other medications. In elderly patients, renal function will gradually decline, which may be the reason why this parameter is more frequently monitored in this group.

The most recent version of the Dutch Guideline for Bipolar Disorders (2015) states that TSH needs to be monitored at least once a year instead of every six months. It is possible that some health care professionals may have questioned the advice in the previous guidelines to monitor TSH every six months and for this reason have been less compliant with the guidelines before 2015. Some health care professionals may have implemented guidelines of 2015 directly and have monitored at least TSH once a year in the period starting from February, when the guideline was issued.

In general, males were monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines for TSH, but not for creatinine and lithium serum levels. Compliance was especially higher in older patients (> 65 years) compared to patients aged < 65 years. Patients using fewer than five medications were monitored less often in compliance with the guidelines for creatinine.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^116mDdEz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The association between lithium and thyroid dysfunction has long been known; however, it remains unknown if lithium-associated hypothyroidism is reversible once lithium treatment has been stopped.

- **Aims**: To determine whether lithium-associated hypothyroidism was reversible in patients who subsequently discontinued lithium.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Swedish region of Norrbotten into the effects and side effects of lithium treatment and other drugs for relapse prevention, known as the Lithium - Study into Effects and Side Effects (LiSIE). For this particular study, medical records between 1997 and 2015 of patients with lithium-associated hypothyroidism who had discontinued lithium were reviewed.

- **Results**: Of the 1340 patients screened, 90 were included in the study. Among these, 27% had overt hypothyroidism at the start of thyroid replacement therapy. The mean delay from starting lithium to initiating thyroid replacement therapy was 2.3 years (SD 4.7). Overall, 50% of patients received thyroid replacement therapy within 10 months of starting lithium. Of the 85 patients available for follow-up, 41% stopped thyroid replacement therapy after lithium discontinuation. Only six patients reinstated thyroid replacement therapy subsequently, and of these, only one had overt hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Lithium-associated hypothyroidism seems reversible in most patients once lithium has been discontinued. In such cases, discontinuation of thyroid replacement therapy could be attempted much more often than is currently done. Based on the limited evidence of our study, we expect hypothyroidism to potentially recur.

### Lithobid [^11524MyS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	- **Acute mania**: Optimal patient response can usually be established with 1800 mg/day in the following dosages: such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium concentration ranging between 1.0 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum concentrations and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and of serum lithium concentrations is necessary. Serum concentrations should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum concentrations and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

	- **Long-term control**: Desirable serum lithium concentrations are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L, which can usually be achieved with 900 to 1200 mg/day. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but generally, the following dosages will maintain this concentration: serum lithium concentrations in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months. Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum concentrations of 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L. Geriatric patients often respond to reduced dosage and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum concentrations ordinarily tolerated by other patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

	- **Important considerations**: Blood samples for serum lithium determinations should be obtained.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^112rmq96]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). High credibility.

- **Description of the included trials**: Jerram 21 included "just over 80" patients with bipolar (BP) or unipolar depressive (UP) disorder, of whom 51 BP (and 22 UP) patients completed the one-year study, indicating that about 10 BP or UP patients dropped out. At baseline, all patients were in remission and using lithium, while the potential use of other psychotropic medication is not reported. Patients were randomized to three different a priori defined 12-hour lithium level ranges: < 0.50, 0.50–0.69, and ≥ 0.70 mmol/L. The endpoint was "need for additional psychotropic medication and/or admission".

Thus, this study fulfilled four of the six original inclusion criteria (2, 3, 5, and 6). Other limitations are that the minimum and maximum lithium levels were not defined for the lower and upper lithium level ranges, respectively; the randomization procedure is unclear; the study was not blind; blood was collected between 12 and 16 hours after the last intake; and only the number of BP patients who completed the study is presented, leaving unclear how many BP patients were included and how many dropped out.

Waters 22 included 36 BP patients, of whom 29 completed the one-year study. It is uncertain whether patients were in remission, as they "had to have reported residual endogenous mood swings which had not required hospitalization" in the past two years, indicating that this study was not a pure recurrence prevention study. At baseline randomization, all were using lithium, while the potential use of other psychotropic medication is not reported.

### Extracorporeal treatment for lithium poisoning: Systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP Workgroup [^1121kRqt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). High credibility.

The disease of lithium toxicity can be associated with various symptoms, including:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, vomiting, ileus, nausea
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypotension, bradycardia, sinus bradycardia, ST-segment elevation, a Brugada ECG pattern, increased QT interval
- **Neurological and muscular symptoms**: Lithium-induced tremor, muscular rigidity, intention tremor, myoclonus, hypertonia, convulsions, muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, fatigue, stupor, altered mental status, coma, somnolence, ataxia
- **Kidney and fluid balance issues**: Polyuria, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI), increased serum sodium, polydipsia
- **Metabolic and hormonal effects**: Metabolic acidosis, increased serum calcium, increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)

This breakdown highlights the wide range of symptoms associated with lithium toxicity and categorizes them by system or effect for clarity.

### The low risk for early renal damage during lithium treatment has not changed over time [^1145QGaz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The study is retrospective and relies on data that was not specifically collected for the study. The low incidence of CKD4 and CKD5 over the 10 years of follow-up may lead to type 2 error. A longer timeframe may be needed to detect the possible differences.

Treatment variables were calculated based on assumptions about laboratory data; one year without any lithium measurement was regarded as treatment interruption, but in reality, it could be a treatment period with very poor compliance. Three variables were used in the multivariate analysis (cohort, age at index start, and S-creatinine at index start), while the total number of events was 22. This results in less than 10 events per variable (EPV), in breach of the rule of thumb stating that the Cox model shall include at least 10 EPV. However, it has been shown that the model's performance when using 5–9 EPV is fairly comparable to that for 10–16 EPV, especially when the multivariate model is used to address adjusting for covariates.

No adjustments have been made for somatic comorbidities that play a role in the progression of renal impairment, nor for associated medications. This is an important limitation, as later cohorts may have included a higher proportion of patients with somatic comorbidities. An indication of this might be the lower eGFR at index start in the later cohorts, despite a lower age at index start.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^113KivXk]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Delphi method**: Anticipating that our literature review would fall short of providing clear evidence-based conclusions and definitive guidance regarding optimal lithium serum levels, we concurrently developed a survey consisting of clinical questions and corresponding statements using the Delphi method. Informed by the findings of clinical trials that have been conducted and by existing reviews and guidelines, we formulated 32 statements on 16 clinical questions (see Supplemental Table S1). These were presented to all 50 Task Force members, representing 15 countries. They were asked to score all statements as "Agree" or "Not agree", with the option in several statements to mark a preferred additional more specified response. For statements endorsed by at least 80% of the participating members, consensus was considered as having been achieved.

- **Survey rounds**: Two survey rounds were initially planned. In the first survey round, we tested the statements and, besides asking members to choose among the additional responses, we also asked for comments on the statements and on the additional responses. After receiving the responses and comments, it was concluded that a second survey round was not needed as the comments received did not reveal a need to change statements or responses.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^113pN6ss]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

If co-medication interacting with lithium had been prescribed within periods, patients were monitored more often compliant with the guidelines for lithium serum levels. This may be caused by alerts from clinical decision support systems, which remind the prescriber to monitor lithium serum levels.

Patients without other days with laboratory measurements were less often monitored in accordance with the guidelines for creatinine. The reasons for this difference can be related to the willingness of patients to have blood tests, comorbidities, or medications requiring additional monitoring.

Many guidelines advise monitoring lithium serum levels at least twice a year. Therefore, our findings could be compared to monitoring compliance in other countries. In agreement with other monitoring studies on adherence to guidelines, improvement of laboratory monitoring of patients using lithium in clinical practice is needed. The study by Collins et al. reported that 68% of patients had undergone two or more tests for lithium serum levels per year, 55% had undergone two or more tests for creatinine, and 82% had undergone at least one TSH test per year after at least one year of lithium use. The time periods in which laboratory measurements had been assessed were different (one-year periods compared to six-month periods for lithium, creatinine, and TSH), but their results indicate a similar trend. Paton et al. described in a later study that monitoring of lithium serum levels, creatinine and TSH had increased to 80%, 70%, and 92%, respectively. Monitoring rates increased after.

- **Warning: Risks of hepatotoxicity**: Hepatotoxicity has occurred with the use of Veozah in the postmarketing setting. Perform hepatic laboratory tests prior to the initiation of treatment to evaluate for hepatic function and injury. Do not start Veozah if either aminotransferase is ≥ 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory. Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory testing monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months of treatment.

	- Advise patients to discontinue Veozah immediately and seek medical attention, including hepatic laboratory tests, if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury (new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain). Discontinue Veozah if transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN, or if transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and the total bilirubin level is > 2 x ULN. If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI task force on treatment with lithium [^113B2BUQ]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Delphi survey**: The Delphi survey was completed by 33 of the 50 (66.6%) Task Force members. Many statements received additional comments, most frequently that evidence regarding a statement or a specified response was lacking.

There was consensus on recommendations regarding the timing of blood sampling to measure lithium serum levels during the day and on whether recommendations for optimal serum lithium levels should be the same with once daily dosing compared to twice daily dosing, as well as with different formulations of lithium medication (immediate release vs. extended release).

There was a lack of consensus on the overall statement "The higher the lithium serum level, the higher the likelihood of a preventative response" (endorsed by only 54.5%), while several members commented that serum levels in the lower range (below 0.60 mmol/L) are associated with efficacy but in the higher range (above 1.00 mmol/L) with more adverse effects and toxicity. In addition, there was no consensus on the statement "There is a minimum serum cut-off level below which essentially no patients are likely to experience a preventative effect" (endorsed by 72.7%), while there was a wide range of specified responses regarding a specific cut-off level (0.30, 0.40, 0.50, or 0.60 mmol/L, endorsed by 16.7, 41.7, 16.7, or 20.8%, respectively). In contrast, there was consensus on the statement "There is a maximum lithium serum level that should ideally never be exceeded because of the risk of severe intolerance and/or intoxication" (endorsed by 93.9%), but lack of agreement on a specific upper limit.

### Decoding laboratory test names: A major challenge to appropriate patient care [^114ticPx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory tests have no value if clinicians cannot quickly order and obtain the results they need. We found that efforts to obtain even the most commonly ordered tests are often derailed by excessively complex nomenclature. Ordering the right laboratory tests is critical to diagnosis and treatment, but existing mechanisms for entering lab orders actively interfere with physicians' efforts to provide good clinical care.

Rather than simplifying lab orders, the advent of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems — generally programmed by non-clinicians — has introduced new and vexing practical problems. Medical laboratories have filled their test menus, whether paper or electronic, with bewildering nomenclature and abbreviations, and have failed to appreciate the dangers of assigning perilously similar names to different tests. The efficient and efficacious patient care demanded by the quality care initiative requires progress beyond traditional solutions, such as convening naming conventions, to the development of innovative software with intelligent, real-time, clinically driven search functions that will allow these programs to help rather than hinder physicians.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^112pu8fB]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Outcomes**: Lithium serum levels were monitored in 65% of periods of lithium use, creatinine in 73%, and TSH in 54% of periods of lithium use. About half of all patients were monitored according to the guidelines during the total follow-up of lithium use for lithium serum levels (46%) and creatinine (47%), and about one-fifth for TSH (21%). Approximately one-seventh (16%) of patients were monitored according to the guidelines for all three parameters during the total period of lithium use.

	- Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the percentages of monitoring compliant with the guidelines in periods were increased to 69%, 79%, and 68% for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH respectively, when measured over a 9-month period. During total follow-up, the percentage of monitoring in compliance with the guidelines increased to 56%, 63%, and 42% for lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH, respectively.

- **Characteristics of periods monitored in compliance with the guidelines**: Monitoring of lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH seemed to be correlated with different characteristics. Between subgroups, the odds for being monitored differed for some characteristics. Males were less often monitored for TSH according to the guidelines compared to females (52% vs. 56%; OR 0.83; 0.77–0.90).

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^113pb1xi]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Thus, this study fulfilled only two of the original inclusion criteria, namely criteria five and six. Further limitations include the study not being blind and only presenting the number of bipolar (BP) patients included, without clarifying how many completed the study and how many dropped out.

Nolen published a post-hoc analysis of a long-term study intended to test the efficacy of quetiapine. In this study, patients with BP-1 disorder who had recently experienced a manic or depressive episode and achieved remission during at least four weeks of open-label treatment with quetiapine monotherapy were randomized to two-year treatment with continued quetiapine, or a switch to placebo or lithium. According to the protocol, the 418 patients in the lithium arm were supposed to receive a lithium dose resulting in a 12-hour lithium level of 0.60–1.20 mmol/L. This was guided by a "programmed automatic system" to alert treating clinicians to adjust doses while maintaining a blind to the drug (lithium, quetiapine, or placebo). However, in 54 patients, no blood levels were measured, and in 137 patients, mean lithium levels remained below the minimum predefined level of 0.60 mmol/L. This was probably due to the failure of the programmed automatic system to adjust the dosage, rather than due to adverse events or early response, which are important indicators of channeling. This situation created the opportunity to compare these 137 patients with the 201 patients receiving lithium within the predefined range of 0.60–1.20 mmol/L and with the patients receiving placebo (n = 404). The endpoint was a recurrence defined as the initiation of [psychotherapy].

### Saliva testing as a means to monitor therapeutic lithium levels in patients with psychiatric disorders: Identification of clinical and environmental covariates, and their incorporation into a prediction model [^112DTFnc]. Bipolar Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Previous studies dating back 30 years have suggested the use of saliva as an alternative to blood monitoring in humans. Several of these studies demonstrated significant correlations between serum lithium and salivary lithium in adult patients being treated with lithium carbonate, although other studies found only weaker associations. These past studies suffered from inconsistencies in saliva collection and storage procedures, variations in saliva processing methods, differences in the lithium detection method, and overall provided little information regarding patient demographic and clinical features.

Nonetheless, saliva sampling provides enormous potential clinical utility as a non-invasive, cost-effective approach for lithium level monitoring that can be carried out in any setting. Indeed, the potential for patients to collect saliva samples at home would reduce the need for trained laboratory personnel and allow patients to collect a sample at a time that is not only convenient for them but can also be better coordinated with their daily dose, timing of other medication, food intake, and/or emergence of acute illness. In addition, saliva collection is safer than blood draws, as it does not require the use of a needle, which can increase the transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

In this study, we explored the relationships between lithium levels in saliva and serum in a multicenter cohort of patients taking lithium medications and confirmed a strong correlation between saliva and blood serum lithium levels. We further identified a number of clinical and lifestyle factors associated with these levels.

### Lithium carbonate [^115zwJ5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concomitant medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: See Table 1 for dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (ages 7 to 17 years). Obtain a serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose, and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate. See Table 2 for lithium carbonate and lithium oral solution dose conversion.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Lithium carbonate [^1177veaM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman, because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to reduce neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases, and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery, with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations].

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^114vEGuy]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The observation that improvement is needed in terms of compliance with monitoring guidelines is not only seen in patients treated with lithium. The prevalence of lipid and glucose monitoring in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic agents was found by earlier studies to be low as well. The PHARMO Database Network covers a broad area in the Netherlands. Therefore, one can assume that our findings are generalizable to other patients using lithium in the Netherlands. With this rich database, the odds of being monitored for diverse patient characteristics could be assessed.

Because patients may go to other laboratories not included in the PHARMO Database Network, there is a possible risk of bias due to incomplete laboratory data. In addition, the possibility of hospitalization cannot be ruled out for some patients during the study period or within the six-month period before initiation of lithium. Some patients may have been admitted to an institution or hospital for a short duration and lithium treatment may have been initiated there. To lower bias due to missing data, only patients with at least one dispensing in the six-month period before lithium treatment were included. The data provided no information regarding clinical indications for lithium use or comorbidities.

Ideally, the type of health care professional requesting laboratory parameters should be evaluated to have insight into which health care professional is most involved in patient monitoring. Only information on the prescriber of lithium was available; the health care professional requesting laboratory parameters was not specified.

### A novel, point-of-care test for lithium levels: Description and reliability [^115JPXf4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Lithium is a highly effective agent for numerous psychiatric disorders but requires therapeutic monitoring because of its narrow therapeutic index. This article describes a novel instant blood test that will facilitate the routine monitoring process.

- **Method**: This instant blood test allows the clinician to take a finger-stick sample of whole blood and determine the plasma lithium level in a 2-minute period. This new test is compared with standard laboratory measurements for lithium in human subjects. The reliability of the new test is reported as agreement with standard laboratory values in three studies involving a total of 269 subjects.

- **Results**: The test demonstrates extremely high reliability (r = 0.962, 0.928, 0.983 for studies 1–3, respectively) for the measurement of serum and plasma lithium levels as compared with standard laboratory measures.

- **Conclusion**: This new test is reliable and offers unique advantages over standard laboratory procedures for measuring lithium levels in patients.

### The low risk for early renal damage during lithium treatment has not changed over time [^1127cFd9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Modern lithium management guidelines were introduced to improve the renal prognosis of lithium patients.

- **Aims**: To examine whether prospects for severe renal impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease at least stage 4 (CKD4)), in long-term lithium patients, have changed over time after the introduction of lithium monitoring guidelines.

- **Methods**: The time to and hazard for CKD4 were compared between three patient cohorts who started long-term lithium in three consecutive decades: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The follow-up time was 10 years after the completion of 1-year treatment. The data were collected from Sahlgrenska University Hospital's laboratory database.

- **Results**: In all, 2169 patients were included: 623 in Cohort 1 (started lithium during the 1980s), 874 in Cohort 2 (1990s), and 672 in Cohort 3 (2000s). Compliance with lithium monitoring guidelines improved, and mean serum lithium decreased through the cohorts. In all, 22 patients developed CKD4 during follow-up. The time to CKD4 was the same in all three cohorts (overall: 10.96 years, 95% confidence interval: 10.94–11 years). Age and serum creatinine concentration at start were significant risk factors, while sex had no prognostic value. After adjusting for the significant covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in the hazard for CKD4 between the three cohorts.

- **Conclusion**: The risk for severe renal damage during the first decade of long-term lithium is low but has not changed over time. Our data suggest that improved compliance with lithium guidelines is not reflected in less risk for severe renal damage.

### Lithium carbonate [^111q5bzj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Optimal patient response to Lithium Carbonate is usually established and maintained with 600 mg t.i.d., producing an effective serum lithium level between 1 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient's clinical state and serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.

- **Long-term control**: The desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Dosage will vary among individuals, but usually, 300 mg of Lithium Carbonate t.i.d. or q.i.d. will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.

- **Note**: Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels of 1 to 1.5 mEq/L. Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosages and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by other patients. Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 8–12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone; accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis.

### Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcaemia: a case-control cross-sectional study [^116XQvqg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Lithium is recommended as a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD). Thyroid and renal alterations are well-known lithium side effects, while effects on parathyroids are less studied. The aim of this case-control cross-sectional study is to compare parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium levels in lithium-exposed bipolar patients and in subjects who had never been exposed to lithium.

- **Methods**: 112 BD patients were enrolled, including 58 on lithium for at least 1 month (mean exposure 60.8 ± 74.8 months) and 54 in the control group. Blood exams included complete blood count, PTH, total and ionized calcium, TSH, T3 and T4, creatinine, urea, sodium and potassium, and lithium serum levels. The Student's t-test and Pearson's Chi-square test were used for bivariate analyses. A linear regression model analyzed the relationship between the duration of exposure to lithium and PTH and calcium levels.

- **Results**: PTH and ionized calcium levels were significantly higher in lithium-exposed patients; the proportion of subjects with hyperparathyroidism (8.6%) and hypercalcaemia (24.1%) was significantly greater in lithium-exposed patients. The linear regression analyses showed a significant effect of exposure to lithium in months on ionized calcium levels but not on PTH levels.

- **Limitations**: Given the cross-sectional design of the study, we could not identify the exact time of occurrence of hyperparathyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Our results indicate that lithium-associated stimulation of parathyroid function is more common than assumed at the time of writing. Among parameters to be evaluated…

### Evaluation of thyroid function monitoring in people treated with lithium: Advice based on real-world data [^1164uikN]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Blood test monitoring is essential for the management of lithium treatment, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance recommends 6-monthly serum testing of thyroid function. We examined conformity to these guidelines and the impact of monitoring outside these intervals.

- **Methods**: We extracted serum lithium and thyroid hormone results at one center between January 2009 and December 2020. We identified 266 patients who started lithium during this period with no history of thyroid abnormality within the previous 2 years and were at risk of developing thyroid abnormalities. We examined the interval between tests, time between the onset of lithium testing and first thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) outside the laboratory reference range, and assessed the impact of testing outside recommended 6-monthly intervals.

- **Results**: The most common testing frequency was 3 months (± 1 month), accounting for 17.3% of test intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that most thyroid dysfunction manifests within 3 years (proportion with abnormal TSH at 3 years = 91.4%, 19.9% of total patients). In the first 3 months after commencing lithium therapy, eight patients developed subclinical hypothyroidism and had clinical follow-up data available. Of these, half spontaneously normalized without clinical intervention. In the remaining patients, thyroxine replacement was only initiated after multiple occasions of subclinical hypothyroidism (median = 2 years after initiating lithium, range: 6 months to 3 years).

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^114FcgWm]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for lithium toxicity, particularly in relation to laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining serum lithium levels every three months after the first year in patients with the following conditions:

- **Older age**: Patients in this category need more frequent monitoring.
- **High risk**: This includes risks of renal or thyroid impairment, raised calcium levels, or other complications.
- **Prescription medications**: Especially those interacting with lithium.
- **Poor symptom control**: Indicates a necessity for close observation.
- **Poor adherence**: Non-compliance with treatment regimens.
- **Last serum lithium level**: Greater than 0.8 mEq/L (> 0.8 mmol/L).

These guidelines emphasize careful monitoring to prevent toxicity and ensure effective management of bipolar disorder.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^111Yp2mo]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The number of patients using interacting comedication could have been underestimated. Information on the use of over-the-counter medication, such as certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), was not available in the database. NSAIDs can increase lithium serum levels but can be dispensed in the Netherlands without a prescription.

Our results raise questions as to why patients are not monitored in compliance with the guidelines. To ensure the safe and effective treatment of patients using lithium, the reasons behind these results need to be assessed. First, it should be assessed whether monitoring parameters are requested by healthcare professionals, to determine whether healthcare professionals do not request lithium serum levels, creatinine, and TSH, or whether patients are hesitant to comply with requested monitoring parameters. Previous studies have identified patient factors that influence monitoring rates, which included the willingness of patients to have blood tests. On the other hand, prescribers may think the guidelines are too burdensome and recommend testing too frequently. It is not clear if the recommended monitoring scheme in the guidelines is the optimal frequency because most recommendations have not been examined in controlled studies. Some prescribers could have also used different guidelines that may include other recommendations for monitoring patients using lithium. Qualitative studies may provide in-depth insight into the personal rationale for choices.

Klann et al. suggested an algorithm for automating drug monitoring.

### Quality of laboratory biomarker monitoring during treatment with lithium in patients with bipolar disorder [^112YHgN6]. Bipolar Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Clinical guidelines recommend monitoring creatinine and lithium levels throughout treatment with lithium. We assessed the extent to which this occurs in healthcare in Sweden.

- **Methods**: This observational study included all adults with bipolar disorder starting lithium therapy in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2007 to 2018. The main outcome was the monitoring of blood lithium and creatinine at therapy initiation and/or annually. The secondary outcome was the monitoring of calcium and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Patients were followed until therapy cessation, death, out-migration, or the end of 2018.

- **Results**: We identified 4,428 adults with bipolar disorder who started lithium therapy and were followed for up to 11 years. Their median age was 39 years, and 63% were women. The median duration on lithium therapy was 4.3 years (IQR: 1.9–7.45), and most individuals who discontinued therapy soon started another mood stabilizer. Overall, 21% began lithium therapy without assessing the serum/plasma concentration of creatinine. The proportion of people who did not have both lithium and creatinine measured increased from 21% in the first year to 33% in the eleventh year. The proportion with annual testing for TSH or calcium was slightly lower. Only 16% of patients had both lithium and creatinine tested annually throughout their entire time on lithium.

- **Conclusions**: In a Swedish community sample, lithium and creatinine monitoring was inconsistent with guideline recommendations that call for annual biomarker level measurement.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116afznd]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have been linked to lithium treatment for decades, yet other drugs have been less well studied. Our objective was to compare hypothyroidism risk for lithium versus the anticonvulsants and second-generation antipsychotics commonly prescribed for BD.

- **Methods**: Administrative claims data on 24,574 patients with BD were analyzed with competing risk survival analysis. Inclusion criteria were (i) one year of no prior hypothyroid diagnosis nor BD drug treatment, (ii) followed by at least one thyroid test during BD monotherapy on lithium carbonate, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, or carbamazepine), or antipsychotics (aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine). The outcome was cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism per drug, in the presence of the competing risk of ending monotherapy, adjusted for age, sex, physician visits, and thyroid tests.

- **Results**: Adjusting for covariates, the four-year cumulative risk of hypothyroidism for lithium (8.8%) was 1.39-fold that of the lowest risk therapy, oxcarbazepine (6.3%). Lithium was non-statistically significantly different from quetiapine. While lithium conferred a higher risk when compared to all other treatments combined as a group, hypothyroidism risk error bars overlapped for all drugs. Treatment (p = 3.86e-3), age (p = 6.91e-10), sex (p = 3.93e-7), and thyroid testing (p = 2.79e-87) affected risk. Patients taking lithium were tested for hypothyroidism 2.26–3.05 times more frequently than those on other treatments.

### Evaluation of clarity of presentation and applicability of monitoring instructions for patients using lithium in clinical practice guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder [^112UGe5U]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Lithium is used in the treatment and prevention of mood episodes in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), as well as in an augmenting strategy for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Adequate monitoring of lithium treatment is essential to assess the balance between efficacy and side effects at the level of the individual patient and to adjust the treatment if necessary. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index with high inter- and intra-individual variability of the dose-concentration relationship. High lithium levels increase the risk of side effects and intoxication, rendering patient monitoring even more important than for most other drugs. Known long-term side effects of lithium treatment include the development of renal impairment and hypothyroidism. Regular measurement of biomarkers is considered standard of care for the early identification of patients with an increased risk of these side effects.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide guidance to healthcare professionals on patient monitoring. CPGs aim to bridge the gap between clinical research and clinical practice and to aid healthcare professionals in evidence-based decision-making. A good-quality guideline has been defined as providing confidence that the potential biases inherent in guideline development have been addressed adequately and that the recommendations are both internally and externally valid — that is, supported by evidence and applicable to target populations — and are feasible for practice.

- **Aims**: To examine whether prospects for severe renal impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease at least stage 4 [CKD4]) in long-term lithium patients have changed over time after the introduction of lithium monitoring guidelines.

- **Methods**: The time to and hazard for CKD4 were compared between three patient cohorts who started long-term lithium in three consecutive decades: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. The follow-up time was 10 years after completion of 1-year treatment. The data were collected from the Sahlgrenska University Hospital's laboratory database.

- **Results**: In all, 2169 patients were included: 623 in Cohort 1 (started lithium during the 1980s), 874 in Cohort 2 (1990s), and 672 in Cohort 3 (2000s). Compliance with lithium monitoring guidelines improved, and the mean serum lithium decreased through the cohorts. In all, 22 patients developed CKD4 during follow-up. The time to CKD4 was the same in all three cohorts (overall: 10.96 years, 95% confidence interval: 10.94–11 years). Age and serum creatinine concentration at the start were significant risk factors, while sex had no prognostic value. After adjusting for the significant covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in the hazard for CKD4 between the three cohorts.

The risk for severe renal damage during the first decade of long-term lithium is low but has not changed over time. Our data suggest that improved compliance with lithium guidelines is not reflected in less risk for CKD4.

### Starting lithium in patients with compromised renal function - is it wise [^113XMz5z]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about the risks involved for patients who, at the start of lithium treatment, already have compromised renal function.

- **Aims**: To assess the risk of developing severe renal impairment (chronic kidney disease (CKD) 4–5) among those patients and to explore predictors for the progression.

- **Methods**: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study using data from Sahlgrenska University Hospital's laboratory database from 1981 to 2017. We compared the risk of developing CKD 4–5 in two patient cohorts: an exposed cohort of 83 patients who had high serum creatinine prior to the start of lithium and a reference cohort of 83 patients with normal serum creatinine, matched by gender, duration of lithium treatment, and age at the start of lithium treatment. The patients' medical charts were reviewed, and the Swedish Renal Registry was used to identify patients undergoing renal replacement therapy.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences between the exposed and reference cohorts with respect to our matching criteria. Almost half the patients in the exposed cohort, compared to only 10% of the reference cohort, progressed to CKD 4–5 (HR 6.7, 95% CI 3.1–14.3, p < 0.001) during a mean observation time of more than 10 years. The progressors were older at the start of lithium treatment and were characterized by a higher burden of comorbid somatic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases.

- **Conclusions**: Compromised renal function prior to initiating lithium treatment increases the risk of developing severe renal impairment. Monitoring of renal function should include an assessment of somatic comorbidity.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116ptV67]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by episodes of mania, hypomania, and depression, occurring in about 2% of the population. While acute episodes can be dramatic and require hospitalization, successful treatment rests on the effective prevention of recurrences and residual symptoms.

Lithium has been a cornerstone of the treatment of acute mania and the prevention of mood episodes during the maintenance phase of the disease. Despite its narrow therapeutic range, which requires careful monitoring of drug serum levels, lithium has proven effective in 30–50% of patients, particularly in those with a family history of BD, with non‐rapid cycling BD, and without comorbid substance use disorders. Lithium appears to have neuroprotective properties and reduces suicidal behavior. However, potentially severe side effects have also been reported, including hypothyroidism, particularly in middle‐aged women, for whom rates as high as 37% have been reported.

The link between hypothyroidism and lithium treatment has been supported by case reports and other observational studies, as reflected in a recent meta‐analysis. These anticipated adverse effects have led to recommendations for frequent thyroid testing of patients treated with lithium, as reflected in recent UpToDate guidelines, despite some negative findings.

Guidelines for lithium treatment in patients with BD recommend thyroid function studies prior to treatment, once or twice during the first 6 months of therapy, and every 6–12 months thereafter.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^116u9NcL]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Mood stabilizers aim to prevent manic and depressive relapses in patients with bipolar disorder during maintenance therapy. The balance between the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy needs to be monitored and evaluated for each patient before and periodically during treatment. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide instructions regarding both clinical and biomarker monitoring. Clinical monitoring includes the monitoring of both signs and symptoms, while biomarker monitoring can be divided into monitoring of physical and laboratory parameters. Although the need for monitoring of patients treated with psychotropic drugs is widely recognized, adherence to monitoring guidelines is often found to be suboptimal. For example, monitoring rates of metabolic parameters such as weight, glucose, and lipids in patients using antipsychotic drugs have been found not to correspond with advice given in CPGs, posing unnecessary risks of morbidity to patients.

Lithium is approved for the acute treatment of mania and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder and is additionally used to augment antidepressant therapy in unipolar depression. Monitoring of lithium serum levels is important to prevent harm and to improve effectiveness among its users. The effectiveness of the treatment may decrease during subtherapeutic lithium serum levels, with a risk of relapse or recurrence, while higher lithium serum levels may be associated with a higher risk of adverse effects. Adverse effects with regard to renal and thyroid function frequently occur with lithium treatment.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^115U84dk]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Setting and source population**: For this retrospective follow-up study, the monitoring of ambulatory patients treated with lithium was assessed in multiple regions in the Netherlands. Data were obtained from the PHARMO Database Network, a population-based network of electronic databases from primary and secondary healthcare settings in the Netherlands. The PHARMO Database Network is a large patient-centered data network, including multiple linked observational databases designed for use in pharmacoepidemiology and outcomes studies of drugs. It collates patient records in geographically defined areas throughout the Netherlands. Mandatory health insurance requires patients to register with a general practitioner, and most patients are registered with a single pharmacy in the Netherlands. To address the objectives of the study, data from the Out-patient Pharmacy Database and the Clinical Laboratory Database were used.

- **Out-patient Pharmacy Database**: This database comprises all general practitioner- and specialist-prescribed healthcare products dispensed by outpatient pharmacies and covers a catchment area representing 4.2 million residents. The dispensing records include information on the type of product, strength, dosage regimen, dispensing date, quantity dispensed, and prescriber specialty. Dispensed drugs are coded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System.

- **Clinical Laboratory Database**: This database comprises results of tests performed on clinical specimens. These laboratory tests are requested by general practitioners, and include various measures relevant to the monitoring of patients treated with lithium.

### Long-term effects of lithium on renal, thyroid, and parathyroid function: a retrospective analysis of laboratory data [^1135D7PB]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Lithium is a widely used and highly effective treatment for mood disorders but causes poorly characterized adverse effects in the kidney and endocrine systems. We aimed to analyze laboratory information system data to determine the incidence of renal, thyroid, and parathyroid dysfunction associated with lithium use.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective analysis of laboratory data from Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Trust (Oxfordshire, UK), we investigated the incidence of renal, thyroid, and parathyroid dysfunction in patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who had at least two creatinine, thyrotropin, calcium, glycated hemoglobin, or lithium measurements between Oct 1, 1982, and March 31, 2014, compared with controls who had not had lithium measurements taken. We used survival analysis and Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each event with lithium use, age, sex, and diabetes as covariates.

- **Findings**: Adjusting for age, sex, and diabetes, the presence of lithium in serum was associated with an increased risk of stage three chronic kidney disease (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.76–2.12; p < 0.0001), hypothyroidism (2.31, 2.05–2.60; p < 0.0001), and raised total serum calcium concentration (1.43, 1.21–1.69; p < 0.0001) but not with hyperthyroidism (1.22, 0.96–1.55; p = 0.1010) or raised adjusted calcium concentration (1.08, 0.88–1.34; p = 0.4602). Women were at greater risk of developing renal and thyroid disorders than men, with younger women at higher risk than older women. The adverse effects occurred early in treatment (HR < 1 for length of treatment with lithium).

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^112kwiXT]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The following covariates were examined for their effect on the CIF:

- **Treatment**: Using lithium as the reference, binary dummy variables were created for the non-lithium treatments.
- **Age at treatment**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among older patients.
- **Sex**: Accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among female patients.
- **Patient visit days in the year preceding monotherapy**: A proxy for engagement with the healthcare system before monotherapy.
- **Whether thyroid testing was performed in the 14 days preceding monotherapy**: Accounts for observation bias. Patients who tested positive for hypothyroidism were excluded since patients receiving lithium are more likely to be tested pretreatment than patients receiving other therapies.
- **Nonparametric thyroid testing rank during monotherapy**: Used to adjust for observation bias. Hypothyroidism should not be diagnosed without a thyroid test, and not all treatments have comparable thyroid testing.

We used the following SNOMED-CT procedure concepts and their descendants to count thyroid tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement (61167004), thyroid hormone measurement (390780008), thyrotropin-releasing hormone test (252219000), thyroid panel (35650009), and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins measurement (104972000).

To account for different observation times, covariates were calculated as follows. For each patient (p), we found the competition rank of p's number of thyroid tests among the smallest time interval centered around p's treatment time that included at least 50 patients and normalized it to (0).

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^115HvyjM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded patients who had received a lithium prescription but never exceeded 0.2 mmol/L in lithium concentration. We further excluded patients who reinstated lithium within 3 months of lithium discontinuation. We chose a lithium-free period of 3 months based on the available experience with amiodarone, assuming that any reversible effects of lithium on the thyroid would wear off within this time period. We also excluded patients for whom we could not clearly establish that the thyroid dysfunction was attributable to lithium. This concerned patients who had (a) started TRT before they started lithium or commenced on the same day as lithium, (b) used lithium only in the short term and discontinued within 3 months, (c) commenced TRT 3 months or more after lithium discontinuation, or (d) received TRT as an adjuvant treatment for depression rather than a correction of thyroid dysfunction. We finally excluded patients (e) who started and stopped TRT during lithium treatment.

Variable definitions

Hypothyroidism was thought to be reversible if TRT could be stopped after lithium discontinuation without persistent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation during follow-up. We explored the potential reversibility of hypothyroidism at several intervals, within 2, 5, and 10 years after lithium discontinuation. We categorized thyroid status into six categories: normal, overt hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, low free serum T4, unclassified, and hyperthyroidism (Table 1). We classified these categories according to the laboratory methods and reference.

### The use of lithium for the treatment of bipolar disorder: Recommendations from clinical practice guidelines [^115Nj2Tv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer that is used principally for the management of bipolar disorder (BD). Its administration is complex and often requires sophisticated management and assiduous monitoring. When considering the use of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, clinicians are advised to refer to recommendations outlined in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); however, due to varying emphases placed by different international CPGs, recommendations addressing the practical use of lithium lack consistency.

- **Method**: To inform clinicians of optimal lithium therapy for bipolar disorder, we compared and synthesized recommendations for the treatment of bipolar disorder made by recognized CPGs internationally. We conducted a search of the literature and extracted guidance across multiple clinical issues, including clinical indications, disorder subtypes, additional uses, special populations, practical aspects, and side effects.

- **Results**: Collectively, CPGs consider lithium most robustly as a first-line intervention for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and strongly for the treatment of mania, with relatively modest support for the management of acute bipolar depression. Additionally, there is consensus across the CPGs that lithium tangibly reduces the risk of suicide. Generally, CPGs provide guidance on the many facets of initiating and maintaining patients on lithium therapy, but individually, the CPGs varied in terms of the depth and practical guidance they provide across these areas.

### Lithium: Clinical considerations in internal medicine [^114hGEwj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorders affect up to 5% of the population. While the pharmacological options for the treatment of bipolar disorder have expanded over the past several years, lithium remains an inexpensive and efficacious treatment for the condition. It has been demonstrated to be effective for acute mania, bipolar depression, the prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder, and as an augmentation agent for unipolar major depression. Notably, lithium is the only mood stabilizer shown to lower the suicide rate in patients with bipolar disorder.

- **Special populations, side effects, and toxicity**: Use in special populations, as well as potential side effects and toxicity, are discussed.

- **Drug interactions**: Important drug interactions are explored.

- **Laboratory monitoring guidelines**: This review includes critical laboratory monitoring guidelines.

Lithium remains an important intervention for the treatment of mood disorders.

### Compliance with the guidelines for laboratory monitoring of patients treated with lithium: A retrospective follow-up study among ambulatory patients in the Netherlands [^111DLEBJ]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Period characteristics**: Age (as determined by year of birth) was assessed in a time-dependent manner at the start of each period. The characteristics of prescribers during lithium use were analyzed; the type of prescriber for lithium was assessed within every period from the pharmacy records and categorized into "medical specialist", "general practitioner", or "both". A medical specialist could, for example, be a psychiatrist or geriatrist.

	- A distinction was made between patients based on the duration of lithium use. Patients were divided into (re-)initiators and prevalent users at the start of each 6-month period. An (re-)initiator of lithium was defined as having a dispensed lithium prescription without having a lithium dispensing within the 6 months before the prescription, while being noninstitutionalized (defined as having at least one drug dispensing event for any other drug within 6 months before dispensing). A patient was defined as a prevalent user (maintenance) during consecutive lithium periods of 6 months after the index date. Patients may have had more than one lithium treatment episode.

	- The number of different dispensed medications (based on ATC codes) was determined within each period. Patients were divided into those with polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications including lithium) or those with < 5 medications, and it was assessed whether patients with polypharmacy were monitored more often in accordance with the guidelines than patients with < 5 medications.

	- Co-medications interacting with lithium requiring monitoring according to the G-standard, an evidence-based system, were also considered.

### What is the optimal serum level for lithium in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder? A systematic review and recommendations from the ISBD/IGSLI Task Force on treatment with lithium [^117TdQdM]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

This study fulfilled only two of the original inclusion criteria (1 and 6). Another limitation is that the study was not blinded.

Gelenberg studied 94 BP-1 patients, of whom 59 completed the 3-year trial. All patients had to be stable for at least two months since the last episode and at least two months tolerating lithium at a serum level of 0.60–1.00 mmol/L, while the potential use of other psychotropic medication at the start or during the trial is not reported. At baseline, patients were randomized to two different a priori defined lithium level ranges: 0.40–0.60 and 0.80–1.00 mmol/L. The endpoint was a recurrence of mania or major depression, defined by DSM-III or RDC criteria.

This study fulfilled five of the original inclusion criteria (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). A source of bias could be the abrupt lowering of the lithium levels at randomization in patients previously responding to high levels, resulting in a risk of drug-discontinuation related morbidity. Another limitation is that only the patients, but not the investigators/clinicians, were blinded to the dosage assignment.

Vestergaard included 57 BP and 34 UP patients in a 2-year follow-up trial. At baseline, all patients were still hospitalized (indicating that they were not in remission and implying that it was not a real recurrence prevention study), and about half of them were still using antipsychotics or antidepressants. Whether some patients were also already using lithium remains unclear in the report. At baseline, patients were randomized double-blind to two different a priori defined lithium level ranges of 0.50–0.80.

### The lithiumeter: A measured approach [^116dy6dX]. Bipolar Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Lithium has long been recognized for its mood-stabilizing effects in the management of bipolar disorder (BD) but in practice, its use has been limited because of real and 'imagined' concerns. This article addresses the need for lithium to be measured with respect to its clinical and functional effects. It introduces a visual scale, termed the lithiumeter, which captures the optimal lithium plasma levels for the treatment of BD.

- **Methods**: Key words pertaining to lithium's administration, dosing, and side effects, as well as its efficacy in acute and long-term treatment of BD, were used to conduct an electronic search of the literature. Relevant articles were identified by the authors and reviewed.

- **Results**: This paper outlines the considerations necessary prior to initiating lithium therapy and provides a guide to monitoring lithium plasma levels. Recommendations for optimal plasma lithium levels in the management of BD are then discussed with respect to indications for use in the acute phases of the illness and maintenance therapy. The risks associated with lithium treatment are also discussed.

- **Conclusions**: The lithiumeter provides a practical guide to optimal lithium levels for the clinical management of BD.

### Managing the risk of lithium-induced nephropathy in the long-term treatment of patients with recurrent affective disorders [^113uFE8k]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Close monitoring of patients on lithium therapy is crucial. What are the implications of these findings for the long-term treatment of patients being treated with lithium in clinical practice? First of all, kidney function should be carefully assessed in every patient for whom lithium is considered a viable treatment option and before treatment is started. In an inpatient setting, the measurement of creatinine clearance is recommended, as it usually accurately reflects glomerular filtration rate, and complete 24-hour urine collection is feasible.

In an outpatient setting, this may be more difficult; therefore, measuring serum creatinine to calculate the eGFR may represent a reasonable alternative, although it is considered less precise in the early stages of chronic kidney disease. The eGFR is either provided directly by the laboratory or can be calculated with the help of internet-available calculators, for example, from the UK CKD eGuide on the Renal Association website. Compared to the measurement of serum creatinine alone, both parameters are more sensitive to detecting mild renal insufficiency.

If a patient shows values within the normal range in these assessments and is put on lithium thereafter, serum creatinine to calculate eGFR should be assessed at least twice a year, and more frequently if indicated, supplemented by urinalysis to assess urine concentration ability and proteinuria. If eGFR falls below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m² (generally referred to as chronic kidney disease), a nephrologist should be consulted for discussion and more comprehensive evaluation.
