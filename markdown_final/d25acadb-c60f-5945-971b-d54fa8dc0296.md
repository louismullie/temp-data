## Question

My patient developed sudden severe respiratory distress after getting a blood transfusion. I've given diuretics and put them on high-flow oxygen but their saturation is still dangerously low. Think it might be an allergic TRALI? What's your take?

Assistant: It could be **transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)**, especially if symptoms started soon after the transfusion. Here's a quick breakdown:

1. **Clinical Signs**: Sudden hypoxia, respiratory distress, or hypotension post-transfusion suggests TRALI.
2. **Differentiating Factors**: Although allergic/anaphylactic reactions can occur during transfusions, TRALI often presents with acute lung injury signs — like bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxia.
3. **Initial Management**: Diuretics may help if there's fluid overload, but TRALI also needs supportive care: high-flow oxygen and possible ventilatory support if severe.
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for hypotension or shock. If the patient doesn't improve with these measures, advanced respiratory support or escalation of care might be necessary.

If they're truly not improving on diuretics and oxygen, recheck chest imaging, consider alternative causes (e.g., volume overload vs. allergic or anaphylactic transfusion reaction), and be ready for **further intervention**.

The BP is dropping fast, and IV fluids didn't help. The patient looks even worse. Is it worth calling a code team now or just continue the same regimen?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to call a rapid response/code team now for a patient with suspected TRALI who is deteriorating despite diuretics and high-flow oxygen, with falling blood pressure and no response to IV fluids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether TRALI is the leading diagnosis. Then, I should verify the immediate risks and whether the current trajectory constitutes a life-threatening emergency. Next, I will review guideline-based escalation thresholds and the evidence that delays worsen outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and outline the next steps, including what to do while awaiting the team and what not to do in suspected TRALI [^f5dd86bb] [^7f33d5ea].

> Let me first confirm the syndrome. Sudden severe respiratory distress with hypoxemia within 1–2 hours of transfusion, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and hypotension strongly suggest TRALI, which is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and can be fatal in 5–10% of cases; importantly, diuretics do not reverse the pathophysiology and may worsen hypotension if used indiscriminately, so I need to ensure I'm not anchoring on fluid overload as the driver here [^f5dd86bb] [^d7f576d9].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate risks. The combination of refractory hypoxemia and shock physiology (falling BP unresponsive to fluids) indicates impending respiratory failure and circulatory collapse; TRALI can progress rapidly, and the mortality signal is nontrivial, so I should not delay escalation based on the hope that more diuretics or oxygen alone will stabilize this trajectory [^f5dd86bb] [^d7f576d9].

> I need to check guideline-based thresholds for calling a rapid response or code team. Multiple high-credibility sources endorse hospital-wide RRT/MET deployment with explicit activation criteria and emphasize that staff should activate for acute respiratory failure, persistent hypoxemia, or shock physiology even if all numeric criteria are not met; importantly, delays in activation are associated with higher mortality, longer length of stay, and worse outcomes, so I should not wait for further deterioration [^7f33d5ea] [^423073c8] [^3a73a106].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the practical next steps while awaiting the team. Immediately stop the transfusion, obtain a chest radiograph to document bilateral infiltrates, draw ABG to quantify hypoxemia, and initiate noninvasive ventilation if oxygenation fails to improve; if shock persists, start vasopressors early (typically norepinephrine) to restore perfusion, and avoid further diuretics unless there is clear evidence of intravascular volume overload, because TRALI is noncardiogenic and diuresis can worsen hypotension [^f5dd86bb] [^d7f576d9] [^e85526cc].

> But wait, what if this is an allergic transfusion reaction rather than TRALI? Let me reconsider the phenotype. Anaphylaxis tends to feature urticaria, angioedema, stridor, and bronchospasm rather than diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates and severe hypoxemia; if anaphylaxis were suspected, epinephrine would be first-line, but the described course and imaging pattern here fit TRALI better, so I should proceed with TRALI-directed supportive care and escalation rather than antihistamines or steroids as primary therapy [^381064e8] [^d7f576d9].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Yes, call the rapid response/code team now. The patient meets objective criteria for life-threatening respiratory failure and shock physiology, delays in activation worsen outcomes, and the team can deliver timely airway/ventilatory support, hemodynamic stabilization, and ICU transfer; continuing diuretics and oxygen alone risks progression to intubation, prolonged hypoperfusion, and preventable mortality [^7f33d5ea] [^3a73a106] [^f5dd86bb].

---

Call the **code team now**. Sudden severe respiratory distress with hypoxemia after transfusion, unresponsive to diuretics and high-flow oxygen, is classic for **TRALI** [^f5dd86bb] — a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate escalation. Delaying **code activation** increases mortality and morbidity [^3a73a106], and TRALI needs **supportive care** (oxygen, ventilatory support, and hemodynamic stabilization) — not diuretics, which can worsen hypotension [^d7f576d9]. Activate the code team, stop the transfusion, and prepare for **intubation and ICU transfer** [^7f33d5ea].

---

## Clinical features supporting TRALI

TRALI presents with **acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates** within 6 hours of transfusion, typically with normal cardiac function and without fluid overload [^f5dd86bb]. Key features include:

- **Respiratory distress**: Sudden dyspnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis [^f5dd86bb].
- **Hypoxemia**: Severe oxygen desaturation unresponsive to supplemental oxygen [^f5dd86bb].
- **Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates**: Chest radiograph shows bilateral alveolar infiltrates ("white-out") [^d7f576d9].
- **Hypotension**: Common, often requiring vasopressor support [^f5dd86bb].
- **Normal cardiac function**: Differentiates TRALI from cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^d7f576d9].

---

## Differentiating TRALI from other transfusion reactions

| **Feature** | **Trali** | **Allergic reaction** | **Taco** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Onset | Within 6 hours post-transfusion | Immediate (< 1 hour) | Gradual, during or after transfusion |
| Respiratory symptoms | Severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates | Bronchospasm, wheezing, stridor | Dyspnea, orthopnea, crackles |
| Cardiac status | Normal | Normal | Elevated JVP, S3, cardiomegaly |
| Response to diuretics | Poor | Poor | Good |
| Management | Supportive care, oxygen, ventilatory support | Epinephrine, antihistamines | Diuretics, oxygen |

---

## Immediate management steps

Given the patient's deterioration despite diuretics and high-flow oxygen, **immediate escalation is critical**:

- **Stop the transfusion**: Immediately stop the transfusion and close the blood set [^160cb2e9].
- **Call the code team**: Activate the rapid response or code team for immediate support [^7f33d5ea].
- **Oxygenation and ventilation**: Provide high-flow oxygen and prepare for non-invasive or invasive ventilation if needed [^fc4241b3].
- **Hemodynamic support**: Initiate vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine) for persistent hypotension [^e85526cc].
- **ICU transfer**: Arrange urgent ICU admission for advanced supportive care [^ca444cf9].

## Why diuretics are ineffective in TRALI

Diuretics are ineffective in TRALI because the pulmonary edema is **non-cardiogenic** and driven by increased capillary permeability, not fluid overload. Diuretics can cause hypovolemia and worsen hypotension, so they are contraindicated in TRALI unless there is clear evidence of fluid overload [^d7f576d9].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

TRALI has a **significant mortality rate** (5–10%) and requires prompt recognition and supportive care [^f5dd86bb]. Early intervention with oxygen, ventilatory support, and hemodynamic stabilization improves outcomes, whereas delays increase morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient's presentation is **highly suggestive of TRALI**, a life-threatening emergency. Call the **code team now**, stop the transfusion, and initiate supportive care with oxygen, ventilatory support, and hemodynamic stabilization. Delays in escalation increase mortality, so **act immediately** [^3a73a106].

Objective To determine if blood products from a frequent plasma donor, whose blood product was implicated in a fatal case of TRALI, caused symptoms of TRALI. Main Outcome Measure Occurrence of mild/moderate or severe reaction associated with transfusion. Results Superimposed illness prevented assessment of TRALI in 14 patients. Of. Conclusions TRALI was frequently underdiagnosed and underreported in recipients of blood products from a donor whose blood products may have caused TRALI in several transfusion recipients. Clinical education and awareness of this often-overlooked diagnosis are imperative for appropriate prevention and treatment.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a clinical syndrome. associated with transfusion that typically includes dyspnea, hypoxemia, hypotension, bilateral pulmonary edema, and fever. 1 Symptoms may occur during the period between the beginning of transfusion and 4 hours afterward. The severity of symptoms can range from mild to severe. However, in a large series of TRALI cases, 100% required oxygen support, and 72% also. reported to cause TRALI, 6 but pooled solvent detergent–treated plasma has not. Severity of TRALI does not appear to be related to the volume of plasma infused, but may be correlated with the degree of hypoxemia. 2 Infusion of white blood cell antibodies alone is probably not sufficient to. hypothesis of TRALI has been advanced as a possible way of explaining why some recipients experience the reaction while others do not.

1, 4 It has been theorized that a transfusion recipient must first have a predisposing condition and then receive plasma that contains leukocyte antibody or biologically active lipid. 4 Conditions thought to predispose. transfusion recipients to develop TRALI include infection, cytokine administration, recent surgery, and/or transfusion of large volumes of blood products. 4 Leukocytes coated with antibodies localize to the pulmonary microvasculature. 9 The release of cytokines by these antibody-coated leukocytes in the vascular space is thought to lead to an increase in vascular. permeability and exudation of fluid and protein into the alveolar spaces. 1, 10 The degree of fluid exudation likely determines the severity of the pulmonary reaction and whether oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation is required. TRALI is fatal in 5% to 10% of cases, 2, 11. and is the third leading cause of transfusion-related mortality.

12 Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms associated with TRALI can easily be attributed to other causes, including fluid overload, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1, 13 Pulmonary edema, with bilateral "white out" on chest radiograph, similar to that seen in ARDS. is generally present along with fever and hypotension. The key to distinguishing TRALI from other forms of pulmonary edema is recognition that the pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic and that affected patients do not have volume overload. 1 This distinction is important because treating patients with TRALI with aggressive diuresis can result in further hypotension, shock. and death. 14, 15 Treatment should consist of maintenance of hemodynamic status and ventilatory assistance. An extensive review of TRALI, including diagnostic criteria, has recently been published. 1 Although TRALI is often discussed in the transfusion literature, it has received little attention among clinicians.

### Characteristics of rapid response calls in the United States: an analysis of the first 402, 023 adult cases from the get with the guidelines resuscitation-medical emergency team registry [^91c7e21f]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize the rapid response team activations, and the patients receiving them, in the American Heart Association-sponsored Get With The Guidelines Resuscitation-Medical Emergency Team cohort between 2005 and 2015.

Design

Retrospective multicenter cohort study.

Setting

Three hundred sixty U.S. hospitals.

Patients

Consecutive adult patients experiencing rapid response team activation.

Interventions

Rapid response team activation.

Measurements and Main Results

The cohort included 402,023 rapid response team activations from 347,401 unique healthcare encounters. Respiratory triggers (38.0%) and cardiac triggers (37.4%) were most common. The most frequent interventions-pulse oximetry (66.5%), other monitoring (59.6%), and supplemental oxygen (62.0%)-were noninvasive. Fluids were the most common medication ordered (19.3%), but new antibiotic orders were rare (1.2%). More than 10% of rapid response teams resulted in code status changes. Hospital mortality was over 14% and increased with subsequent rapid response activations.

Conclusions

Although patients requiring rapid response team activation have high inpatient mortality, most rapid response team activations involve relatively few interventions, which may limit these teams' ability to improve patient outcomes.

### The influence of fluid resuscitation strategy on outcomes from dengue shock syndrome: a review of the management of 691 children in 7 southeast Asian hospitals [^c00ebce9]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

The primary inclusion criterion for the study was having a clinical diagnosis of DSS on discharge from designated wards at selected centres of excellence across Malaysia (four sites), Myanmar (one site) and Vietnam (two sites). We included all sequential cases without specific age limits. In hospitals with a very high cases burden, we limited the case selection to one or two specialist dengue wards plus the HDU/ICU. Potential cases were identified from the central electronic hospital register, or from direct examination of relevant ward admission/discharge record books. The in-patient records of all potential cases were subsequently reviewed by one of the study clinicians to confirm the discharge diagnosis.

A unique case report form (CRF) was used to extract the following information from all included cases: clinical history and baseline severity indicators at presentation with DSS; all therapeutic interventions throughout the hospital course, in particular detailed information on all intravenous fluids given (timing, type, rate of administration, etc); all cardiovascular observations recorded from onset of DSS for 72 hours or until discharge/death (in most centres pulse and blood pressure were measured every 1–2 hours until stable, then with gradually reducing frequency over 24 hours); adverse events including occurrence and timing of reshock episodes, development and severity of bleeding, respiratory distress, organ impairment etc; and final outcome. A unique code number was assigned to each record to maintain anonymity. In each country, a small team of dengue-experienced doctors and nurses were trained to extract the information, closely supervised by the core Vietnamese study team. CRFs were subsequently transferred to HCMC for double data entry into a secure electronic database designed to maintain patient and site anonymity.

### Medical emergency team syndromes and an approach to their management [^54db5c0a]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	Little information is currently available on what conditions trigger medical emergency team (MET) calls.

- 	We reviewed 400 MET calls and found that they could be reduced to five main syndromes.

- 	More than 90% of calls were associated with hypoxia, hypotension or altered conscious state.

- 	Sepsis, pulmonary oedema and arrhythmias were the most common underlying triggers for MET calls.

- 	Given the above observations, we propose minimum standards of response and a structured approach to managing MET calls.

Early recognition of sick patients with a poor prognosis, and the rapid institution of appropriate therapy are tenets of good medical management across all specialties. Here we highlight five recent papers that aid us in achieving such goals in and around the intensive care unit (ICU). Both score-generating clinical tools and clinical acumen are championed for identifying the sick, while appropriate, early intervention in acute deterioration is shown to be beneficial, before and after ICU admission. Saline or albumen for resuscitation? The answer became clearer in May, as did what to do about all those mobile phones…

### Circadian pattern of activation of the medical emergency team in a teaching hospital [^07e0abe9]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The hospital

Austin Health is a university-affiliated teaching hospital with three hospital campuses situated in Melbourne, Australia. The Austin Hospital is the acute care hospital in which the MET service operates. It has 400 beds and receives approximately 60,000 day and overnight admissions per year.

Hospital emergency response teams

The acute care hospital has two levels of medical emergency responses and teams. A traditional cardiac arrest ('code blue') team is comprised of a cardiology fellow and coronary care nurse, as well as an intensive care fellow and nurse, and the receiving medical unit fellow. All wards are equipped with resuscitation trolleys containing resuscitation drugs and defibrillators.

In September 2000 a MET system was introduced into the acute campus following an extensive preparation and education process. The team consists of an intensive care fellow and nurse, as well as the receiving medical unit fellow. It can be activated by any member of the hospital staff according to preset criteria for physiological instability. All code blue and MET calls are communicated by the switchboard operators through the hospital loudspeakers and paging system, and a detailed log of all calls is maintained.

Criteria for medical emergency team activation

Calling criteria for our MET service are based on acute changes in heart rate (< 40 or > 130 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (< 90 mmHg), respiratory rate (< 8 or > 30 breaths/min), conscious state, urine output (< 50 mL over 4 hours), and oxygen saturation derived from pulse oximetry (< 90%, despite oxygen administration). In addition, the calling criteria contain a 'staff member is worried' category to allow staff to summon senior assistance to manage any possible emergency situation.

NASEMSO respiratory distress — adults with suspected pulmonary edema due to acute heart failure or fluid overload prioritize oxygenation and ventilation, with CPAP/BiPAP per the Airway Management Guideline. For systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 100 mmHg, give an IV fluid bolus 250–500 mL and consider vasopressor norepinephrine 0.02–2 mcg/kg/min. For SBP less than 160 mmHg, administer nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL and repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg. For SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 120, use nitroglycerin 0.8 mg SL and repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg, and consider IV nitroglycerin infusion titrated to blood pressure.

### Medical emergency team syndromes and an approach to their management [^2578652e]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Results

Characteristics of 400 MET calls

Of the 400 MET calls, 23 had only the 'staff worried' criterion. Of the remainder, 248 had one listed physiological MET criterion, 105 had two, 23 had three and one patient had four criteria. The average number of listed MET criteria for the 400 MET calls was 1.3 (531 criteria for 400 calls).

The proportions of MET criteria triggering a call were hypoxia (41%), hypotension (28%), altered conscious state (23%), tachycardia (19%), increased respiratory rate (14%) and oliguria (8%). Of the 531 calling criteria for the 400 MET calls, 61 had no documented provisional diagnosis. Several common causes for these triggers were identified (Table 2 in Additional file 1). Infections (especially pneumonia; 125/531 criteria), cardiogenic shock or pulmonary oedema (104/531 criteria) and arrhythmias (51/531 criteria) were thought to be responsible for 53% (280/531) of all triggers for MET calls (Table 2 in Additional file 1).

Proposed minimum standards for managing a MET call

The proposed minimum requirements for managing an episode of a MET review included the following: first, determining the cause of the deterioration; second, documenting the events surrounding the MET; third, establishing a medical plan and ongoing medical follow-up; and fourth, discussing the case with the intensivist if predefined criteria were fulfilled (Table 3 in Additional file 1). Requirements specific to the Austin Hospital also included automatic medical referral for surgical patients who remained on the ward after a MET call for a medical reason, and compulsory review of the patient by an intensivist for a patient requiring two MET reviews in a seven-day period.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^6ebc762e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Altitude illness — prehospital patient management prioritizes descent as definitive therapy while addressing airway and circulation. Patients with acute mountain sickness only may remain at their current altitude and initiate symptomatic therapy, whereas patients with HACE or HAPE should initiate descent. Perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), administer supplemental oxygen, if available, with goal to keep oxygen saturations 90%, and descend to lower altitude, as descent is the mainstay of therapy and should be initiated as soon as scene conditions permit. If severe respiratory distress is present and pulmonary edema is found on exam, clinician should start positive pressure ventilation; establish IV and perform fluid bolus with goal to maintain systolic BP greater than 90 mmHg and monitor cardiac rhythm. Descent should always be the primary treatment strategy, and if descent is not possible or if medical direction permits, the EMS clinician may consider portable hyperbaric chambers; however, they should not be used in lieu of descent, only as an alternative should descent be unfeasible.

### Long term effect of a medical emergency team on cardiac arrests in a teaching hospital [^33baad5a]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The hospital

The Austin Hospital is a 400 bed acute care hospital affiliated with the University of Melbourne. The hospital provides services such as cardiothoracic surgery and neurosurgery and is also the referral center for acute spinal injuries and liver transplantation for the state of Victoria. The intensive care unit (ICU) has 21 beds and receives approximately 2,000 admissions per year.

Ethics approval

Approval was obtained from the Institution's Ethics Committee for implementation of the MET system and collection of the data related to it. The need for informed consent was waived by the committee.

Medical emergency responses

The acute care hospital has two levels of emergency response. The traditional 'Code Blue' call is intended for resuscitation of cardiac arrests and other sudden life-threatening medical emergencies. It consists of an anesthetic fellow, a coronary care fellow and nurse, an ICU fellow and nurse, as well as the Medical fellow of the receiving unit of the day. The MET is intended to review all medical emergencies other than cardiac arrests, and has been described in detail previously. It consists of an ICU fellow and nurse, as well as the Medical fellow of the receiving unit of the day. It can be activated by any member of hospital staff according to pre-determined criteria that are based primarily on abnormalities of vital signs and clinical status. Specifically, the criteria include acute changes in heart rate (< 40 or > 130 beats/minute), systolic blood pressure (< 90 mmHg), respiratory rate (< 8 or > 30 breaths/minute), oxygen saturation (< 90% despite oxygen therapy) or conscious state. Any staff member can also initiate a MET review if they are worried about the patient for any other reason.

Study design

The study is a prospective before-and-after interventional trial. All patients admitted to the hospital for at least one night were considered as participants. The period 1 January 1999 to 31 August 1999 was the control or 'before' period. In the educational phase preceding implementation of the MET (1 September 1999 to 31 August 2000), detailed education and information sessions where held with all members of hospital staff. The period 'after' the implementation of the MET included the interval spanning from 1 September 2000 to 31 October 2004.

### Hospital-wide code rates and mortality before and after implementation of a rapid response team [^409ae470]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Rapid response teams have been shown in adult inpatients to decrease cardiopulmonary arrest (code) rates outside of the intensive care unit (ICU). Because a primary action of rapid response teams is to transfer patients to the ICU, their ability to reduce hospital-wide code rates and mortality remains unknown.

Objective

To determine rates of hospital-wide codes and mortality before and after implementation of a long-term rapid response team intervention.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A prospective cohort design of adult inpatients admitted between January 1, 2004, and August 31, 2007, at Saint Luke's Hospital, a 404-bed tertiary care academic hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Rapid response team education and program rollout occurred from September 1 to December 31, 2005. A total of 24 193 patient admissions were evaluated prior to the intervention (January 1, 2004, to August 31, 2005), and 24 978 admissions were evaluated after the intervention (January 1, 2006, to August 31, 2007).

Intervention

Using standard activation criteria, a 3-member rapid response team composed of experienced ICU staff and a respiratory therapist performed the evaluation, treatment, and triage of inpatients with evidence of acute physiological decline.

Main Outcome Measures

Hospital-wide code rates and mortality, adjusted for preintervention trends.

Results

There were a total of 376 rapid response team activations. After rapid response team implementation, mean hospital-wide code rates decreased from 11.2 to 7.5 per 1000 admissions. This was not associated with a reduction in the primary end point of hospital-wide code rates (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.76 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.57–1.01]; P = 0.06), although lower rates of non-ICU codes were observed (non-ICU AOR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.40–0.89] vs ICU AOR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64–1.43]; P = 0.03 for interaction). Similarly, hospital-wide mortality did not differ between the preintervention and postintervention periods (3.22 vs 3.09 per 100 admissions; AOR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.81–1.11]; P = 0.52). Secondary analyses revealed few instances of rapid response team undertreatment or underuse that may have affected the mortality findings.

Conclusion

In this large single-institution study, rapid response team implementation was not associated with reductions in hospital-wide code rates or mortality.

Research agenda for recognizing deterioration outside the ICU — Important questions remain across multiple domains relevant to recognizing critical illness outside of the ICU, including, but not limited to: what physiologic parameters could improve the recognition of at-risk patients and be included in the bedside examination, RRT/MET activation criteria, and Early Warning Scores; whether electronic health record-enabled RRT/MET activation is superior to clinician-initiated RRT/MET activation; whether the professional composition of an RRT/MET team affects patient outcomes; whether the use of specific treatment protocols for specific conditions (shock, respiratory failure, etc.) improves patient outcomes; how patient- and family-important outcome measures can be incorporated in studies evaluating RRS effectiveness; and whether there are key interventions/resuscitation goals to be met that need to take place within a specific time period to improve outcomes.

### Medical emergency team syndromes and an approach to their management [^b5557d77]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most literature on the medical emergency team (MET) relates to its effects on patient outcome. Less information exists on the most common causes of MET calls or on possible approaches to their management.

Methods

We reviewed the calling criteria and clinical causes of 400 MET calls in a teaching hospital. We propose a set of minimum standards for managing a MET review and developed an approach for managing common problems encountered during MET calls.

Results

The underlying reasons for initiating MET calls were hypoxia (41%), hypotension (28%), altered conscious state (23%), tachycardia (19%), increased respiratory rate (14%) and oliguria (8%). Infection, pulmonary oedema, and arrhythmias featured as prominent causes of all triggers for MET calls. The proposed minimum requirements for managing a MET review included determining the cause of the deterioration, documenting the events surrounding the MET, establishing a medical plan and ongoing medical follow-up, and discussing the case with the intensivist if certain criteria were fulfilled. A systematic approach to managing episodes of MET review was developed based on the acronym 'A to G': ask and assess; begin basic investigations and resuscitation, call for help if needed, discuss, decide, and document, explain aetiology and management, follow-up, and graciously thank staff. This approach was then adapted to provide a management plan for episodes of tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia and dyspnoea, reduced urinary output, and altered conscious state.

Conclusion

A suggested approach permits audit and standardization of the management of MET calls and provides an educational framework for the management of acutely unwell ward patients. Further evaluation and validation of the approach are required.

### Error traps in the intrahospital transport of critically ill and anesthetized children [^6e264b4e]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Error Trap #2: Failure to Secure Appropriate Resources for Transport and at Every Destination

Intrahospital transport of critically ill and anesthetized children requires maintenance of ongoing therapies and continuous monitoring, all while physically moving the patient. It is essential to determine the optimal personnel for transport and to secure appropriate equipment and supplies, as well as prepare the destination(s) prior to initiating care of the patient. Guidelines and standardization of personnel and equipment reduce planning workload and improve processes of care. Mnemonics and checklists can also be helpful. Several examples can be found in the references. Preparation for transport also includes preparing the patient, often by simplifying infusions and clustering care immediately prior to transport. The choice to simplify infusions should be individualized. The benefits should be weighed against the risk of creating pharmaceutical waste and the need to disconnect and reconnect infusions to the central venous catheters with resulting risk of catheter‐associated infections.

3.1 Personnel

The care team must include personnel who are adequately trained to manage all required equipment. For example, patients with VAD, on ECMO, high‐frequency ventilation, or with external ventricular drains must have staff trained and able to operate that equipment during their time away from the intensive care unit. Patients may require changes in VAD, ventilatory, ECMO, or ventricular drain parameters as a necessary consequence of receiving anesthetics or undergoing surgical procedures. While the attending anesthesiologist leading the transport team may be comfortable operating these devices, this is not advisable during the transport of high‐risk patients. The anesthesiologist should be free to manage the team and direct overall care, akin to a resuscitation (code) team leader. Thus, for example, if the anesthesiologist is the only transport team member comfortable operating the portable ventilator, then another team member should be added to operate that ventilator, such as a respiratory therapist or member of the ICU team.

The transport team leader should count all tasks required during transport and have an appropriately skilled team member dedicated to each one. These can include pushing the bed and/or IV pole; operating a portable ventilator or manually ventilating; monitoring the patient; providing ongoing resuscitation including fluid, blood products, and/or medications; operating and adjusting infusion pumps and other equipment; clearing the path and obtaining an elevator (if needed); and directing overall care. It is essential to utilize anesthesia technicians and similar staff to perform simpler tasks, such as pushing the bed, to ensure that physician and nursing staff can focus on higher order tasks.

### Feasibility of accelerated code team activation with code button triggered smartphone notification [^0615adb2]. Resuscitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Studies support rapid interventions to improve outcomes in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. We sought to decrease the time to code team activation and improve dissemination of patient-specific data to facilitate targeted treatments.

Methods

We mapped code blue buttons behind each bed to patients through the electronic medical record. Pushing the button sent patient-specific data (admitting diagnosis, presence of difficult airway, and recent laboratory values) through a secure messaging system to the responding teams' smartphones. The code button also activated a hospital-wide alert through the operator. We piloted the system on seven medicine inpatient units from November 2019 through May 2022. We compared the time from code blue button press to smartphone message receipt vs traditional operator-sent overhead page.

Results

The code button was the primary mode of code team activation for 12/35 (34.3%) cardiac arrest events. The code team received smartphone notifications a median of 78 s (IQR = 47–127 s) before overhead page. The median time to adrenaline administration for codes activated with the code button was not significantly different (240 s (IQR 142–300 s for code button) vs 148 s (IQR = 34–367 s) for overhead page, p = 0.89). Survival to discharge was 3/12 (25.0%) for codes activated with the code button vs 4/23 (17.4%) when activated by calling the operator (p = 0.67).

Conclusion

Implementation of a smartphone-based code button notification system reduced time to code team activation by 78 s. Larger cohorts are necessary to assess effects on patient outcomes.

### Fluid therapy for critically ill adults with sepsis: a review [^c8e3732e]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Approximately 20% to 30% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit have sepsis. While fluid therapy typically begins in the emergency department, intravenous fluids in the intensive care unit are an essential component of therapy for sepsis.

Observations

For patients with sepsis, intravenous fluid can increase cardiac output and blood pressure, maintain or increase intravascular fluid volume, and deliver medications. Fluid therapy can be conceptualized as 4 overlapping phases from early illness through resolution of sepsis: resuscitation (rapid fluid administered to restore perfusion); optimization (the risks and benefits of additional fluids to treat shock and ensure organ perfusion are evaluated); stabilization (fluid therapy is used only when there is a signal of fluid responsiveness); and evacuation (excess fluid accumulated during treatment of critical illness is eliminated). Among 3723 patients with sepsis who received 1 to 2 L of fluid, 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported that goal-directed therapy administering fluid boluses to attain a central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, vasopressors to attain a mean arterial blood pressure of 65 to 90 mm Hg, and red blood cell transfusions or inotropes to attain a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70% did not decrease mortality compared with unstructured clinical care (24.9% vs 25.4%; P = 0.68). Among 1563 patients with sepsis and hypotension who received 1 L of fluid, an RCT reported that favoring vasopressor treatment did not improve mortality compared with further fluid administration (14.0% vs 14.9%; P = 0.61). Another RCT reported that among 1554 patients in the intensive care unit with septic shock treated with at least 1 L of fluid compared with more liberal fluid administration, restricting fluid administration in the absence of severe hypoperfusion did not reduce mortality (42.3% vs 42.1%; P = 0.96). An RCT of 1000 patients with acute respiratory distress during the evacuation phase reported that limiting fluid administration and administering diuretics improved the number of days alive without mechanical ventilation compared with fluid treatment to attain higher intracardiac pressure (14.6 vs 12.1 days; P < .001), and it reported that hydroxyethyl starch significantly increased the incidence of kidney replacement therapy compared with saline (7.0% vs 5.8%; P = 0.04), Ringer lactate, or Ringer acetate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fluids are an important component of treating patients who are critically ill with sepsis. Although optimal fluid management in patients with sepsis remains uncertain, clinicians should consider the risks and benefits of fluid administration in each phase of critical illness, avoid use of hydroxyethyl starch, and facilitate fluid removal for patients recovering from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Delayed rapid response team activation is associated with increased hospital mortality, morbidity, and length of stay in a tertiary care institution [^3a73a106]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify whether delays in rapid response team activation contributed to worse patient outcomes (mortality and morbidity).

Design

Retrospective observational cohort study including all rapid response team activations in 2012.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Patients

All those 18 years old or older who had a rapid response team call activated. Vital sign data were abstracted from individual patient electronic medical records for the 24 hours before the rapid response team activation took place. Patients were considered to have a delayed rapid response team activation if more than 1 hour passed between the first appearance in the record of an abnormal vital sign meeting rapid response team criteria and the activation of an rapid response team.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 1,725 patients were included in the analysis. Data were compared between those who had a delayed rapid response team activation and those who did not. Fifty seven percent patients met the definition of delayed rapid response team activation. Patients in high-frequency physiologic monitored environments were more likely to experience delay than their floor counterparts. In the no-delay group, the most common reasons for rapid response team activation were tachycardia/bradycardia at 29% (217/748), respiratory distress/low SpO2 at 28% (213/748), and altered level of consciousness at 23% (170/748) compared with respiratory distress/low SpO2 at 43% (423/977), tachycardia/bradycardia at 33% (327/977), and hypotension at 27% (261/977) in the delayed group. The group with no delay had a higher proportion of rapid response team calls between 8:00 and 16:00, whereas those with delay had a higher proportion of calls between midnight and 08:00. The delayed group had higher hospital mortality (15% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.6; p = 0.005); 30-day mortality (20% vs 13%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; p = 0.02); and hospital length of stay (7 vs 6 d; relative prolongation, 1.10; p = 0.02) compared with the no-delay group.

Conclusions

Delays in rapid response team activation occur frequently and are independently associated with worse patient mortality and morbidity outcomes.

### Self-reported management of IV fluids and fluid accumulation in children with acute respiratory failure [^8b17e4de]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Observational studies have shown that fluid overload is independently associated with increased morbidity in critically ill children, especially with respiratory pathology. It is unknown if recent evidence has influenced clinical practice. We sought to describe current IV fluid management in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Design

Multinational, cross-sectional electronic survey.

Setting

Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators Network.

Subjects

Pediatric intensivists.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

One-hundred fifty-four respondents (43% response rate) had a median 10 years of experience (Q1-Q3, 4–17.8), in ICUs with a median 24 beds (18–36), where 86% provided extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. For maintenance IV fluid, 96% used the "4-2-1" rule to determine rate, and 59% used dextrose with normal saline for content. For fluid resuscitation, 77% use normal saline in 10 milliliters per kilogram aliquots (42%) or as fluid challenges (37%). Less than 20% of respondents reported resuscitating with 20mL/kg boluses. Documented intake over output is the favored vital sign to assess (75% vs 57%) and guide fluid management (97% vs 14%) over central venous pressure. The majority of respondents chose 10% fluid overload as the threshold to act in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. The majority (77%) agreed that fluid accumulation contributes to worse outcomes in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and should be treated. Ninety-one percent reported conservative fluid management in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome is likely to be beneficial or protective.

Conclusions

Pediatric intensivists agree that acting on 10% fluid overload in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome is important. Decisions are being made largely using intake and output documentation, not central venous pressure. These findings are important for future pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome interventional trials.

### Medical pre-hospital management reduces mortality in severe blunt trauma: a prospective epidemiological study [^767d261e]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Patients

In France, two rescue systems are involved in the pre-hospital management of trauma patients. In the event of an accident, both the fire brigade and pre-hospital medical emergency dispatching centre (SAMU: Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente) can be alerted. A fire brigade is systematically dispatched to the scene. The SAMU may decide to send a pre-hospital medical emergency team (SMUR), either directly, as a result of the phone evaluation of the accident, or later, as a result of the on-scene evaluation by the fire brigade. If there is no request for SMUR support, the fire brigade will provide only basic life support and take the patient to the closest hospital. However, according to French regulations, when the vital signs of a patient transported by the fire brigade cease, the fire brigade vehicle has to stop; the staff has to call the SMUR and begin cardio-pulmonary resuscitation with chest compression and ventilation while waiting for the arrival of the SMUR. The French SAMU/SMUR system is well described in the literature. Briefly, when the SMUR is present on the scene, the EP may decide to refer the patient either to the closest hospital or to a university hospital trauma centre if a major trauma is suspected. Each SMUR unit is staffed by an EP, a nurse and a specially trained ambulance driver. Depending on the clinical assessment of the patient, the emergency physician may initiate early life-sustaining treatment. According to French guidelines, tracheal intubation is systematically performed for patients with severe brain trauma (GCS: Glasgow Coma Scale < 8), with respiratory distress syndrome and/or with haemorrhagic shock. Rapid sequence intubation is systematically used for tracheal intubation and sedative infusion is started early to prepare the patient for mechanical ventilation. Fluid infusion is performed on the basis of clinical assessment and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The haemodynamic target depends on whether patients have neurological injury (cerebral and/or medullar) (MAP: 85 to 90 mmHg) or not (MAP: 65 mmHg). In order to achieve the MAP target, the EP uses careful crystalloid infusion. If the initial MAP is very low (mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg), patients receive a bolus infusion of colloid and/or hypersaline solution. Continuous norepinephrine infusion can start quickly for patients with initial collapse, or in order to limit an excess of fluid loading. According to French guidelines, it is necessary to begin continuous norepinephrine infusion when fluid loading exceeds 2,000 mL and/or after beginning sedative infusion. Mannitol may be used if clinical intracranial hypertension exists or appears. Medical monitoring includes invasive arterial blood pressure, the use of continuous capnometry and on-board arterial blood gas measurement. The patient's response to treatment is used by the dispatching physician to determine the most appropriate facility for the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: immunotherapy for inhalant allergy [^0d78f727]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Management of anaphylaxis — emergency actions include protocol readiness, trigger removal, assessment, help activation, epinephrine, positioning, oxygen, fluids, CPR, and monitoring as follows: have a written emergency protocol and rehearse it; remove exposure to the trigger if possible; assess Airway/Breathing/Circulation, mental status, skin and body weight; and call for help. Inject epinephrine intramuscularly in the mid-anterolateral thigh at 0.01 mg/kg, with a maximum of 0.5 mg (adult) or 0.3 mg (child), and repeat every 5–15 minutes if needed; most patients respond to 1 to 2 doses. Place the patient on the back or in a position of comfort, elevate the lower extremities, and note that fatality can occur within seconds if the patient stands or sits suddenly. When indicated, give high-flow supplemental oxygen (6–8 L/minute). Establish intravenous access with wide-bore cannula (14–16 gauge) and consider giving 1–2 liters of 0.9% saline rapidly (e.g., 5–10 ml/kg in the first 5–10 minutes to an adult; 10 ml/kg to a child). If indicated at any time, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation with continuous chest compressions, and at frequent, regular intervals monitor blood pressure, cardiac rate and function, respiratory status, and oxygenation (monitor continuously, if possible).

### Reduction in hospital-wide mortality after implementation of a rapid response team: a long-term cohort study [^34fd41a7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention

The RRT was led by the medical consult resident, a senior (postgraduate year 3) medical house officer who also led the cardiopulmonary-arrest code team, was certified in advanced cardiac life support, and typically had 4 to 6 months of prior critical care training. The team, which also included an ICU nurse, respiratory therapist, and patient transporter, was activated via the hospital page operator to report immediately to the bedside to direct management of the unstable patient. On nights and weekends, a nursing administrator joined the team for further support. Although not formal team members, additional medical house officers also frequently responded to RRT activations.

Clinical judgment that prompt assistance is needed at the bedside was emphasized repeatedly as an important criterion for RRT activation. Prespecified vital-signs criteria were also reviewed during training sessions, including pulse oximetry saturation less than 90%, respiratory rate less than eight or greater than 30 breaths per minute, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, heart rate less than 40 or greater than 140 beats per minute, or change in heart rate greater than 30 beats per minute. However, staff were explicitly instructed to activate the RRT without hesitation for any appropriate degree of clinical concern without threat of repudiation or reprisal, regardless of whether the reviewed vital-signs criteria were met.

The RRT was first introduced in January 2006 to the medicine service through multidisciplinary sessions led jointly by senior physician and nurse members of the RRT development committee and attended by nurses, respiratory therapists, and medicine house staff on service. The RRT was expanded to all other adult inpatient, outpatient, testing, and administrative services between February and June 2006. Additional introductory sessions were held throughout the study period during new-staff orientations and at nursing leadership, patient safety, and quality improvement meetings. The RRT development committee reviewed monthly all out-of-ICU arrests and gave direct feedback to involved nurses and staff regarding use of the RRT. No additional staff were hired nor work hours extended to implement the new program.

Main outcomes

The a priori primary outcome was hospital-wide mortality, defined as death before discharge. Secondary outcomes defined a priori were out-of-ICU mortality and out-of-ICU cardiopulmonary-arrest codes. A cardiopulmonary-arrest code was defined as active or impending cardiopulmonary arrest resulting in activation of the hospital-wide code team. Within-ICU cardiopulmonary-arrest codes were not included because ICU teams often handled cardiopulmonary arrests without activating the code system. These arrests were not captured in any hospital database.

### Timing and interventions of emergency teams during the MERIT study [^970df2a5]. Resuscitation (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine interventions and timing of emergency team calls in hospitals with or without a medical emergency team (MET).

Methods

Interventions were recorded, categorized and classified as critical care interventions (e.g. airway intervention, ventilation and use of inotropic drugs); ward level interventions (e.g. fluids, oxygen by mask); assessment, physical examination and investigations.

Results

Only 5 of the 2376 calls were free of critical care interventions. For non-cardiac arrest-related calls, MET hospitals had a lower proportion of airway, circulation and drug-related interventions and a higher proportion of ward level interventions. The majority of calls were between 0601 and 1200 h and cardiac arrest survival was greatest in the 1200–2400 h period. Overall median time at the scene was 25 min.

Conclusions

Nearly all emergency team calls required critical care type interventions. Emergency team calls show a unique temporal pattern for both MET and control hospitals. These findings have important organizational and resource-related implications for hospitals evaluating and establishing rapid response systems.

### Prehospital intravenous access and fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis: an observational cohort study [^75f879a2]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Study exposures and confounders

We defined prehospital resuscitation in three categories: 1) no IV catheter placed and no fluid administered; 2) IV catheter placed but no fluid administered; and 3) IV catheter placed and fluid administered. We evaluated the placement of IV catheter as a separate category as prior data suggest the procedure may impact patient outcomes in the prehospital critically ill, perhaps through modifying care processes in the ED. We included the placement of any type of prehospital IV catheter, peripheral, central or intraosseous, as documented by EMS in the medical incident report form. Data were unavailable on catheter starts that were unsuccessful, or other intravenous medications co-administered. We abstracted multiple potential confounders based on clinical relevance and prior literature. These included age (years), sex, and initial vital signs as documented by first arriving EMS personnel - respiratory rate (RR, breaths/minute), heart rate (HR, beats/minute), systolic blood pressure (SBP, mmHg), pulse oximetry (SaO 2,%), and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) when available. We abstracted an index of illness severity as determined by EMS personnel: 'life-threatening', 'urgent', and 'non-urgent'. We defined prehospital location as home, nursing home or medical facility, and abstracted additional prehospital procedures, such as electrocardiogram monitoring, delivery of supplemental oxygen, bag-valve mask ventilation, or intubation. We defined primary prehospital diagnostic categories as respiratory, cardiovascular or neurologic, and calculated a validated prehospital critical illness severity score. We defined mode of transport from scene to hospital as advanced life support (ALS) or BLS, and we abstracted standard prehospital time intervals (minutes), including call receipt to unit notification, notification to unit responding, unit responding to arrival at scene, total scene time and scene to hospital arrival.

Primary outcomes

The primary endpoint was hospital mortality, defined by disposition in the hospital discharge data. We studied additional a priori secondary outcomes including ICU admission and increasing organ failures during hospitalization (for example, number of total hospital organ failures at discharge minus number of organ failures defined as present on admission). We used only organ failures as defined by the Angus sepsis implementation.

### Model for predicting short-term mortality of severe sepsis [^7b081125]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Study population

Because diagnostic coding has been found to be unreliable, we used parameters collected by our data-capture software to select patients with severe sepsis, defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) combined with an infectious episode and dysfunction of at least one organ, occurring at or within 28 days after admission to the ICU. We excluded patients with treatment-limitation decisions taken before or on the day of the diagnosis of severe sepsis. At least two of the following criteria were required for the diagnosis of SIRS: core temperature of 38°C or above or 36°C or less, heart rate of 90 beats/min or above, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min or above, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) of 32 mmHg or less or use of mechanical ventilation, and peripheral leukocyte count of 12,000/mm 3 or above or 4000/mm 3 or less. Organ dysfunction was defined as follows: cardiovascular system failure was a need for vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs, and/or systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, and/or a drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 40 mmHg from baseline; renal dysfunction was urinary output of 700 ml/day or less in a patient not previously undergoing haemodialysis for chronic renal failure; respiratory dysfunction was a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2) of less 70 mmHg or mechanical ventilation or a PaO 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) ratio of 250 or less (or 200 or less in patients with pneumonia); thrombocytopenia was a platelet count of less than 80,000/mm 3, and elevated plasma lactate was a lactate level of 3 mmol/L or above. Severe sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with at least one organ dysfunction as described above, and septic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation together with organ dysfunction. Thus, patients receiving inotropic or vasoactive agents who had organ dysfunction but who were no longer hypotensive were classified as having septic shock. Lengths of ICU and hospital stays were computed starting at ICU admission.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^be9b1008]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric respiratory distress (croup) — steroids, IV access, and airway escalation: Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg oral, IV, or IM to maximum dose of 16 mg should be administered to patients with suspected croup. IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory distress for clinical concerns of dehydration or when administering IV medications. Heliox for the treatment of croup can be considered for severe distress not responsive to more than 2 doses of epinephrine. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be administered for severe respiratory distress, and bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure. Supraglottic devices and intubation — should be utilized only if BVM ventilation fails, and the airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible.

### Restrictive fluids versus standard care in adults with sepsis in the emergency department (REFACED): a multicenter, randomized feasibility trial [^7e24dc1a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Patients were assigned to either restrictive IV fluid administration or standard care for 24 h. The assigned treatment protocol was followed in the ED as well as wards or ICUs if the patient was transferred within the 24‐h period. The intervention protocol targeted IV crystalloid fluid administration. An overview of the trial, including the restrictive fluid algorithm, is provided in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Treatment algorithms: summary of trial interventions.

In the restrictive fluid group, IV crystalloid fluids should not be given unless one of the below mentioned hypoperfusion criteria were met.

- Lactate concentration ≥ 4 mmoL/L (arterial or venous);

- Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg);

- Mottling beyond edge of kneecap (i.e. Mottling score > 2);

- Severe oliguria, that is, diuresis < 0.1 ml/kg/h, during the first 4 h of admission.

If one or more of these criteria were met, a fluid bolus of 250 mL of isotonic crystalloid (isotonic saline or Ringer's acetate/lactate) could be administered per protocol. It was not a requirement that a fluid bolus was administered.

The treating physician could at any time violate the protocol by giving additional fluid if judged necessary. The physician had to state the reason for violating the protocol.

IV fluids could be given as carrier for medications, but the volume should be reduced if possible. In case of documented overt fluid loss (e.g. vomiting, large aspirates, diarrhea, drain losses, or ascites drainage) IV fluid could be given to correct for the loss. In case the oral/enteral route for water or electrolyte solutions was contraindicated or failed as judged by the clinical team, IV fluids could be given to correct significant electrolyte deficiencies or to ensure a total fluid input of 1 L per 24 h (counting all fluids including medications and nutrition). If a patient underwent surgery during the 24‐h inclusion period, they temporarily paused the protocol, but clinicians were encouraged to continue restrictive fluid therapy, and all intraoperative fluids were registered.

In the standard care group, fluids were administered by clinicians' choice. Aside from the fluid administration, all management of the patient care was at the discretion of the treating team. In both groups, patients were allowed to drink as much as desired or allowed by the treating team. It was not possible to blind the intervention for neither the treating team, patients, nor relatives.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU: 2023 [^7f33d5ea]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Explicit Activation Criteria and Rapid Response Team (RRT)/Medical Emergency Team (MET) — recommendation and implementation considerations: We recommend hospital-wide deployment of GPSs (i.e. RRT/MET) for non-ICU patients that include explicit activation criteria for obtaining help from a designated response team (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). The literature did not identify any undesirable effects of this intervention, although the panel considered possible overutilization and reliance on the RRT/MET and deskilling among non-ICU staff, which were speculative and not reported; overall, the panel deemed the balance of effects to favor activation criteria with RRT/MET interventions. Resource requirements will vary by jurisdiction, but cost-effectiveness probably favors the intervention, it would be highly acceptable to patients, and it is probably feasible in most settings, including in smaller healthcare settings.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^5d87c683]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^95f619c5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Septic shock is the most critical stage of sepsis progression. The latest guidelines define sepsis as the presence of hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and the need to rely on vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg. The mortality rate of sepsis can reach 50% or higher. Under the new classification of shock types, septic shock is categorized as distributional shock owing to its unique mechanism of occurrence. The pathophysiology of septic shock includes loss of vascular tone regulation and increased vascular permeability, which cause abnormal vascular volume distribution and fluid leakage into the interstitial tissue.

The cornerstone of septic shock treatment is fluid resuscitation and the use of positive inotropic agents as well as vasopressors to increase cardiac preload and organ perfusion. For patients with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) expert consensus guidelines recommend rapid resuscitation with a minimum of 30 ml/kg isotonic crystalloid intravenously within the first 3 h. This recommendation is based on retrospective studies and randomized controlled trials on the hemodynamic management of sepsis. However, there is limited evidence to guide fluid management after initial fluid resuscitation in septic shock. Intravenous fluids can increase cardiac output and organ perfusion but may compromise vascular integrity leading to organ edema and dysfunction. Furthermore, fluid overload is associated with higher mortality and increased incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure abdominal hypertension, and abdominal compartment syndrome. It has even been found that during early and adequate fluid resuscitation of patients with septic shock, the incidences of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome can be as high as 82.7% and 40.3%, respectively. Therefore, there is growing concern that increasing the amount of intravenous fluid replacement may be harmful.

### Practical considerations in sepsis resuscitation [^b4da70dd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common condition managed in the emergency department, and the majority of patients respond to resuscitation measures, including antibiotics and i.v. fluids. However, a proportion of patients will fail to respond to standard treatment.

Objective

This review elucidates practical considerations for management of sepsis in patients who fail to respond to standard treatment.

Discussion

Early goal-directed therapy revolutionized sepsis management. However, there is a paucity of literature that provides a well-defined treatment algorithm for patients who fail to improve with therapy. Refractory shock can be defined as continued patient hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure, ≤ 65 mm Hg, lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L, altered mental status) after adequate fluid loading (at least 30 mL/kg i.v.), the use of two vasopressors (with one as norepinephrine), and provision of antibiotics. When a lack of improvement is evident in the early stages of resuscitation, systematically considering source control, appropriate volume resuscitation, adequate antimicrobial coverage, vasopressor selection, presence of metabolic pathology, and complications of resuscitation, such as abdominal compartment syndrome and respiratory failure, allow emergency physicians to address the entire clinical scenario.

Conclusions

The care of sepsis has experienced many changes in recent years. Care of the patient with sepsis who is not responding appropriately to initial resuscitation is troublesome for emergency physicians. This review provides practical considerations for resuscitation of the patient with septic shock. When a septic patient is refractory to standard therapy, systematically evaluating the patient and clinical course may lead to improved outcomes.

### Data omission by physician trainees on ICU rounds [^a2e2c3cd]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we performed a comprehensive audit of the completeness of physician trainee EHR data gathering and subsequent data verbalization during interprofessional ICU rounds in order to quantify the ICU team information deficit yielded by our rounding paradigm. At our institution, data omissions occurred in 100% of patient rounds and involved 38% of the overall available data. Thus, despite several hours spent prerounding and the premise that rounds provide the entire team with a shared understanding of the patient's condition, ultimately only 62% of patient data were collectively reviewed. Our results offer completeness of data appraisal as another metric in comparing the efficacy of novel rounding paradigms, and in the current EHR age, challenges the relevance of traditional academic rounding structures born from a paper-based era.

In addition to quantifying the magnitude, our study describes the composition of the rounding team's "data blind spot" and identifies data types that may warrant increased vigilance by the ICU team and more emphasis during trainee education. For example, presenters were over four times more likely to omit respiratory rate compared with blood pressure and heart rate (Supplementary Table 11, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Disregard of respiratory rate is a well-known phenomenon on medical wards that appears to extend to the ICU despite availability of more credible readings via continuous external monitoring and evidence that tachypnea predicts clinical decompensation. Sixty-seven percentage of fluid balance and 53% of glucose data were omitted despite established associations between positive fluid balance and increased mortality in critical illness and the accepted importance of glycemic control. Trainees also regularly omitted set tidal volumes and measured plateau pressures in patients on volume control ventilation despite their established importance in patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Activation of a medical emergency team using an electronic medical recording-based screening system* [^74014d9b]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of a medical emergency team activated using 24-hour monitoring by electronic medical record-based screening criteria followed by immediate intervention by a skilled team.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic tertiary care hospital with approximately 2,700 beds.

Patients

A total of 3,030 events activated by a medical emergency team from March 1, 2008, to February 28, 2010.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We collected data for all medical emergency team activations: patient characteristics, trigger type for medical emergency team (electronic medical record-based screening vs calling criteria), interventions during each event, outcomes of the medical emergency team intervention, and 28-day mortality after medical emergency team activation. We analyzed data for 2009, when the medical emergency team functioned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (period 2), compared with that for 2008, when the medical emergency team functioned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week (period 1). The commonest cause of medical emergency team activation was respiratory distress (43.6%), and the medical emergency team performed early goal-directed therapy (21.3%), respiratory care (19.9%), and difficult airway management (12.3%). For patients on general wards, 51.3% (period 1) and 38.4% (period 2) of medical emergency team activations were triggered by the electronic medical record-based screening system (electronic medical record-triggered group). In 23.4%, activation occurred because of an abnormality in laboratory screening criteria. The commonest activation criterion from electronic medical record-based screening was respiratory rate (39.4%). Over half the patients were treated in the general ward, and one third of the patients were transferred to the ICU. The electronic medical record-triggered group had lower ICU admission with an odds ratio of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22–0.55). In surgical patients, the electronic medical record-triggered group showed the lower 28-day mortality (10.5%) compared with the call-triggered group (26.7%) or the double-triggered group (33.3%) (odds ratio 0.365 with 95% CI, 0.154–0.867, p = 0.022).

Conclusions

We successful managed the medical emergency team with electronic medical record-based screening criteria and a skilled intervention team. The electronic medical record-triggered group had lower ICU admission than the call-triggered group or the double-triggered group. In surgical patients, the electronic medical record-triggered group showed better outcome than other groups.

### Development and validation of a pre-hospital "Red flag" alert for activation of intra-hospital haemorrhage control response in blunt trauma [^bb0ebfef]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The major advantage of this Red Flag alert is its simplicity of use and pragmatism as it is computed with routinely assessed variables and thus directly available criteria for the pre-hospital care team. It allows the rapid identification of patients who require mobilization of important human and material resources to control haemorrhage (advanced immediate resuscitation and/or haemostatic procedures, early and sustained transfusion, etc.). The predictive performances of the previously described "Code Red" have not yet been extensively evaluated. The other existing simple scores are not based on pre-hospital variables, or were built to predict outcome such as mortality. The Red Flag could not be compared to the TASH or ABC score. Those latter scores were validated for an intra-hospital setting and include variables such as ultrasound use or blood gas results, variables that are not systematically available in the pre-hospital environment.

The present work is the first to attempt an extensive assessment of the predictive performance of routine pre-hospital data and to include a validation. A code should be easy to remember and the criteria routinely available; both apply to the Red Flag. Indeed, any prediction tool requires evaluation and validation in the very specific setting it will be implemented in. In the case of an inappropriate activation, the complete set of the haemorrhage control infrastructure may be activated and disorganize programmed care for a while. So, any activation code requires a delicate balance between sensitivity and specificity; that is, between the risk of not activating the haemorrhage control pathway when it is needed (false negative, potentially detrimental to the patient) and over-activation (increase in false positive). On the one hand, it is crucial not to miss any haemorrhagic patients and get activated for their arrival, but, on the other, over-activation can generate waste of precious resources and induces team fatigue leading to further non-compliance. Unjustified activation may even reduce the chance of other patients to benefit from the resources inadequately put on standby. An appropriate number of activations, however, maintains team readiness and training. The clinical consequences of this alert will have to be assessed (times, process, outcomes, etc.).

### Executive summary: Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU [^ab915b38]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Clinical deterioration of patients hospitalized outside the ICU is a source of potentially reversible morbidity and mortality. To address this, some acute care facilities have implemented systems aimed at detecting and responding to such patients.

Objectives

To provide evidence-based recommendations for hospital clinicians and administrators to optimize recognition and response to clinical deterioration in non-ICU patients.

Panel Design

The 25-member panel included representatives from medicine, nursing, respiratory therapy, pharmacy, patient/family partners, and clinician-methodologists with expertise in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

We generated actionable questions using the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes format and performed a systematic review of the literature to identify and synthesize the best available evidence. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to determine certainty in the evidence and to formulate recommendations and good practice statements (GPSs).

Results

The panel issued 10 statements on recognizing and responding to non-ICU patients with critical illness. Healthcare personnel and institutions should ensure that all vital sign acquisition is timely and accurate (GPS). We make no recommendation on the use of continuous vital sign monitoring among "unselected" patients due to the absence of data regarding the benefit and the potential harms of false positive alarms, the risk of alarm fatigue, and cost. We suggest focused education for bedside clinicians in signs of clinical deterioration, and we also suggest that patient/family/care partners' concerns be included in decisions to obtain additional opinions and help (both conditional recommendations). We recommend hospital-wide deployment of a rapid response team or medical emergency team (RRT/MET) with explicit activation criteria (strong recommendation). We make no recommendation about RRT/MET professional composition or inclusion of palliative care members on the responding team but suggest that the skill set of responders should include eliciting patients' goals of care (conditional recommendation). Finally, quality improvement processes should be part of a rapid response system (GPS).

Conclusions

The panel provided guidance to inform clinicians and administrators on effective processes to improve the care of patients at-risk for developing critical illness outside the ICU.

### Managing snakebite [^03c2acd3]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk of adverse reactions with antivenom

Monitor patients for adverse reactions in the first two hours of antivenom administration (box 2). Anaphylaxis or pyrogenic reactions occur early (within minutes or hours). Mechanistic studies suggest that most events are not IgE mediated and thus cannot be accurately predicted by skin tests for immediate hypersensitivity. However, their incidence and severity can be reduced by a prophylactic subcutaneous injection of low dose adrenaline. Pyrogenic reactions result from product contamination during manufacture.

Box 2
Clinical features and frequency of adverse reactions to antivenom

Depending on the dose, speed of administration, and product quality, the risk of any early reaction varies from 3% to more than 80% in studies from Latin America and South Asia. About 5–10% of such events are associated with life threatening consequences. The incidence of fatal reactions is unclear because of confusion with symptoms of envenoming, but some have been reported.

Treat anaphylaxis at the earliest sign. Suspend antivenom administration and inject adrenaline intramuscularly, ideally into the upper lateral thigh. Additional treatment includes intravenous antihistamines and glucocorticoids and inhaled bronchodilators for bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis can recur, and glucocorticoids do not prevent recurrence. On resolution of the episode, cautiously resume antivenom in patients with a definite indication for continued treatment. Treat pyrogenic reactions with physical cooling, antipyretics, and intravenous fluids.

Late reactions may manifest a week after administration. Their incidence varies widely from 5% to 56% in observational studies and trials using differing diagnostic criteria.WHO guidelines recommend a five-day course of oral antihistamines for those with serum-sickness type late reactions, and a five-day course of prednisolone in those who fail antihistamine therapy after the first two days.

Whom to refer?

Patients with persistent bleeding despite repeated antivenom treatment or having respiratory and renal failure may require urgent supportive measures such as blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy respectively. If these are not available, arrange for transfer to a specialised centre. Patients with substantial bleeding, worsening paralysis, dropping urine output, refractory shock, anaphylaxis non-responsive to adrenaline, or compartment syndrome may also require specialist management and intensive care.

Having contact details of emergency transport and the referral centre readily available can avoid delays. Inform the receiving hospital about the patient's condition over the phone and send a referral letter with details of assessment and treatment.

### Effect of an automated notification system for deteriorating ward patients on clinical outcomes [^a2f424af]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Delayed response to clinical deterioration of ward patients is common.

Methods

We performed a prospective before-and-after study in all patients admitted to two clinical ward areas in a district general hospital in the UK. We examined the effect on clinical outcomes of deploying an electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system, which relayed abnormal vital signs to a rapid response team (RRT).

Results

We studied 2139 patients before (control) and 2263 after the intervention. During the intervention the number of RRT notifications increased from 405 to 524 (p = 0.001) with more notifications triggering fluid therapy, bronchodilators and antibiotics. Moreover, despite an increase in the number of patients with "do not attempt resuscitation" orders (from 99 to 135; p = 0.047), mortality decreased from 173 to 147 (p = 0.042) patients and cardiac arrests decreased from 14 to 2 events (p = 0.002). Finally, the severity of illness in patients admitted to the ICU was reduced (mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score: 26 (SD 9) vs. 18 (SD 8)), as was their mortality (from 45% to 24%; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Deployment of an electronic automated advisory vital signs monitoring and notification system to signal clinical deterioration in ward patients was associated with significant improvements in key patient-centered clinical outcomes.

### The effectiveness of a' code red' transfusion request policy initiated by pre-hospital physicians [^24951a21]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Major trauma is a leading cause of mortality and serious morbidity. Recent approaches to life-threatening traumatic haemorrhage have emphasized the importance of early blood product transfusion. We have implemented a pre-hospital transfusion request policy where a pre-hospital physician can request the presence of a major transfusion pack on arrival at the destination trauma centre.

Objectives

This study was performed to establish whether three simple criteria (1) suspicion or evidence of active haemorrhage (2) systolic BP < 90 mmHg (3) failure of blood pressure to respond to an intravenous fluid bolus) which were used to activate a pre-hospital 'Code Red' transfusion request accurately identified seriously injured patients who required transfusion on arrival at hospital.

Methods

Prospective evaluation of all pre-hospital 'Code Red' requests over a 30-month period (August 2008-May 2011) was performed for patients transported to a major trauma centre. Mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score, hospital mortality, and use of blood products were recorded. Patients were followed up to hospital discharge.

Results

176 'Code Red' activations were made in the study period. 129 patients were transported to the Trauma Centre. Mechanism of injury was penetrating trauma in 39 (30%) cases, road traffic collision in 58 (45%), falls in 18 (14%) and 'other' in 14 (10.8%). Complete data was available for 126 patients. Of the patients reaching hospital, 20 died in the emergency department or operating theatre, 22 died following admission and 84 survived to hospital discharge. Mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 29.1. (range 0–66). Overall, 115 (91%) of the patients declared 'Code Red' pre-hospital received blood product transfusion after arrival in hospital. Eleven patients did not receive any blood products following hospital admission. In patients declared 'Code Red' pre-hospital, mean packed red blood cell transfusion in the first 24-h was 10.4 unit (95% CI 8.4–12.3 unit).

Conclusions

The use of simple pre-hospital criteria allowed physicians to successfully identify trauma patients with severe injury and a requirement for blood product transfusion. This allowed blood products to be ready on the patient's arrival in a major trauma centre with the potential for earlier transfusion.

### Handoffs and transitions of care in the intensive care unit: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^963be481]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

On arrival, the patient should be physically moved to the ICU bed (if necessary) and transitioned to the ICU monitors. All immediate needs, such as transition to the ventilator, continuation of infusions, etc, should be addressed. Once this has occurred, the presence of all necessary team members should be confirmed. The handoff should occur in a structured fashion following an agreed-upon mnemonic or checklist. The Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Wake Wings perioperative patient safety program presents an example of a cognitive aid created for such a checklist to make notes during the verbal operating room to ICU handoff (figure 1). A printed sheet with this information can be used as a reminder to ensure all necessary information is covered. The operating room to ICU handoff should include patient demographics, patient history, anesthesia information, including available IV access, fluids and blood products administered, vasopressors, operative and postoperative information, and goals of care, including postoperative orders to review. Finally, there should be an opportunity for questions and clarification by both the delivering and receiving teams if needed. In another study, Segall et al performed a systematic review of 34 articles that specifically addressed postoperative handoff to ICU or PACU which supported this structure and they identified five interventions that were broadly supported: (1) standardized processes using checklists and protocols; (2) completion of urgent tasks before information transfer; (3) allowing only patient-specific discussion during handoff; (4) requiring all relevant team members be present for handoff; and (5) providing training in team skills and communication.

### Impact of initial central venous pressure on outcomes of conservative versus liberal fluid management in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^81c01d43]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

In acute respiratory distress syndrome, conservative fluid management increases ventilator-free days without affecting mortality. Response to fluid management may differ based on patients' initial central venous pressure. We hypothesized that initial central venous pressure would modify the effect of fluid management on outcomes.

Design

Retrospective analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial, a multicenter randomized trial comparing conservative with liberal fluid management in acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examined the relationship between initial central venous pressure, fluid strategy, and 60-day mortality in univariate and multivariable analysis.

Setting

Twenty acute care hospitals.

Patients

Nine hundred thirty-four ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with a central venous pressure available at enrollment, 609 without baseline shock (for whom fluid balance was managed by the study protocol).

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Among patients without baseline shock, those with initial central venous pressure greater than 8 mm Hg experienced similar mortality with conservative and liberal fluid management (18% vs 18%; p = 0.928), whereas those with central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or less experienced lower mortality with a conservative strategy (17% vs 36%; p = 0.005). Multivariable analysis demonstrated an interaction between initial central venous pressure and the effect of fluid strategy on mortality (p = 0.031). At higher initial central venous pressures, the difference in treatment between arms was predominantly furosemide administration, which was not associated with mortality (p = 0.122). At lower initial central venous pressures, the difference between arms was predominantly fluid administration, with additional fluid associated with increased mortality (p = 0.013).

Conclusions

Conservative fluid management decreases mortality for acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with a low initial central venous pressure. In this population, the administration of IV fluids seems to increase mortality.

Clinical symptoms of severe ATR included rash/urticaria (75%), facial swelling (20%), upper (50%) and lower (75%) respiratory symptoms, and gastrointestinal symptoms (1%). Vital signs changes noted in severe ATR were desaturation or hypoxemia, with a mean (SD) oxygen saturation drop of 3.9% (8.5%) (55% of reactions; range, 1%-59% decrease, including 25% of reactions with ≥ 5% decrease); systolic blood pressure drop of 13.4 (18.6) mm Hg (43% of reactions; range, 1–75 mm Hg, including 28% of reactions with ≥ 15% decrease); heart rate increase of 13 (17.25)/min (64% of reactions; range, 1–70/min, including 25% of reactions with ≥ 30% increase); a respiration rate increase of 3.1 (5.9)/min (50% of reactions; range, 1–40/min, including 23% of reactions with ≥ 5/min increase); and a minor increase in temperature of 0.16 (0.23) °C (range, 0–1 °C), with only 1 patient experiencing a 1 °C increase.

Treatment for severe ATRs included antihistamines (94%), steroids (69%), epinephrine (36%), oxygen (34%), albuterol (26%), norepinephrine or vasopressors (5%), ipratropium (3%), and intravenous fluids (3%); a minority (3%) of patients underwent noninvasive ventilation or intubation (3%).

### The objective medical emergency team activation criteria: a case-control study [^5c83b4b9]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the ability of pre-defined clinical criteria to identify patients who subsequently suffer cardiac arrest, unplanned intensive care unit admission or unexpected death; to determine the ability of modified criteria to identify these patients.

Design

Nested, matched case-control study.

Setting

Seven Australian public hospitals.

Patients and Participants

Four hundred and fifty cases and 520 controls matched for age, sex, hospital, and hospital ward.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Results

Highest and lowest respiratory and heart rates, lowest systolic blood pressure, presence of threatened airway, seizures or decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale score of greater than two points and incidence of the three adverse events were measured. Combining a heart rate greater than 140, respiratory rate greater than 36, a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and a greater than two point reduction in the Glasgow Coma Scale identified adverse events with a sensitivity of 49.1% (44.4–53.8%), specificity of 93.7% (91.2–95.6%), and positive predictive value of 9.8% (8.7–11.1%). Adding threatened airway, seizures, low respiratory rate and low heart rate did not substantially improve sensitivity (50.4%; 45.7–55.2%). After modifying the cut-off values for respiratory rate, heart rate and systolic blood pressure, the best achievable positive predictive value remained below 16%.

Conclusions

In combination, the respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and level of consciousness identify patients at risk of cardiac arrest, unplanned intensive care admission or unexpected death with high specificity; however the sensitivity and positive predictive value are relatively low, even after modification of the activation criteria cut-off values.

### Resuscitation fluid use in critically ill adults: an international cross-sectional study in 391 intensive care units [^a8073062]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Participants and data collection

Data were collected on a standard data collection form (see Additional file 1) and this was returned to the study co-ordinating centre for entry into the study database. Data were checked against pre-specified range limits and any queries were resolved with the study sites. For each patient, information was collected on their sex, age, ICU admission date, admission source and diagnosis (based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II diagnosis codes) and whether resuscitation fluid or blood products were prescribed. An episode of fluid resuscitation was defined as an hour during which either a bolus of crystalloid or colloid; a crystalloid infusion of 5 ml/kg/hr or greater; a continuous infusion of colloid at any dose; or any volume of whole blood, packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma or platelets was given.

For patients who received at least one episode of fluid resuscitation during the study period additional information was collected from the patient's medical record. This included the patient's weight, APACHE II score, the presence of trauma as the primary ICU admission diagnosis, and based on standard definitions, the presence of traumatic brain injury, severe sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. For each episode of fluid resuscitation the types of fluids and volumes infused, cardiovascular and respiratory components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, clinical signs (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure), most recent laboratory measures (haemoglobin, creatinine, bilirubin, lactate, and albumin concentrations), urine output and total fluid output in the previous complete hour, use of renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation were recorded. The type of fluid given for resuscitation was classified into crystalloid, colloid (with colloid sub-classification as albumin, starch, gelatin or dextran solutions), or blood products (whole blood, packed cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma) as indicated on the standard data collection form (Additional file 1). The indication for the fluid, the specialty and seniority of the fluid prescriber, and the type of fluid prescribed was recorded by the bedside nurse at the time of the resuscitation episode. For episodes where more than one indication for fluid resuscitation was provided, these were classified according to a predetermined hierarchy (see Additional File 2). Data on mortality or discharge at 28 days following ICU admission were also collected to characterise the study population.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^3f61c57b]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention

Eligible children were invited to participate if they were expected to receive maintenance IV fluids for at least 8 hours. Participants were randomized to receive either 0.9% saline in 5.0% dextrose or 0.45% saline in 5.0% dextrose. Solution bags were covered with an opaque plastic covering by the pharmacist. Participants, the treating team and the research team were blinded to the contents of the solution bags.

Randomization was stratified by admission type (medical vs. surgical) and carried out in blocks of six using a computerized random number generator. Baseline serum [Na] was drawn prior to starting study fluid. In medical patients, this was done when the IV catheter was inserted; surgical patients had their blood drawn upon completion of the surgical procedure. The rate of infusion of study fluid, use of fluid boluses or additional IV fluids, and addition of potassium to solutions were left to the discretion of the treating physicians. Treating physicians were informed that the study fluid was either 0.9% or 0.45% saline in 5% dextrose, and advised to prescribe it as they would normally prescribe maintenance fluids. Oral fluids were not restricted and were considered to be composed of free water. Serum [Na] was repeated approximately 12 hours (minimum 8; maximum 18 hours) after the beginning of the infusion, at which point the study ended. Serum [Na] was measured using indirect potentiometry using the Beckman Coulter DxC analyzer, which has a range of [Na] detection between 100–200 mmol/L and a coefficient of variation of 1%.

Monitoring

All participants received routine in-patient nursing care, with vital signs including blood pressure monitored at least every 4 hours. Nurses also monitored for possible adverse events including symptoms potentially associated with hyponatremia (vomiting, change in level of consciousness, headache) or volume overload (edema, respiratory distress). All fluid intake during the study interval, including oral, was recorded.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on recognizing and responding to clinical deterioration outside the ICU: 2023 [^74b14fbb]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Patient, family, and care partner RRT/MET activation — evidence and panel judgment — We identified five before-after studies among hospitalized adults (two studies) and children (three studies). This intervention may be associated with decreased rates of mortality (one study) and unsuccessful resuscitations (one study), with no change in the rate of non-ICU cardiac arrests (three studies; low certainty for all outcomes), and effects on unplanned transfers to ICU (two studies) and number of RRT/MET activations (four studies) were unclear. The proportion of RRT/MET calls resulting in transfer to a higher level of care was increased in staff activations compared with family activations in three studies, while the fourth study reported that all family activations led to transfer to a higher level of care. The panel judged the overall certainty in the evidence to be low and judged that the balance of effects probably favors the intervention; activations, where they exist, are uncommon and mostly occur when there is a communication breakdown between the primary team and these stakeholders. No studies were found reporting resource requirements; the panel had concerns about health inequity and noted that remedies such as provision of translation tools in other languages may somewhat alleviate these concerns, and it judged that the intervention would be highly acceptable to patients, family members, and care partners.

### Resuscitation resequenced: a rational approach to patients with trauma in shock [^7168ba3c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Trauma resuscitation is a complex and dynamic process that requires a high-performing team to optimize patient outcomes. More than 30 years ago, Advanced Trauma Life Support was developed to formalize and standardize trauma care; however, the sequential nature of the algorithm that is used can lead to ineffective prioritization. An improved understanding of shock mandates an updated approach to trauma resuscitation. This article proposes a resequenced approach that (1) addresses immediate threats to life and (2) targets strategies for the diagnosis and management of shock causes. This updated approach emphasizes evidence-based resuscitation principles that align with physiologic priorities.

### Causes of death after fluid bolus resuscitation: new insights from FEAST [^c4b4c219]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST study) was an extremely well conducted study that gave unexpected results. The investigators had reported that febrile children with impaired perfusion treated in low-income countries without access to intensive care are more likely to die if they receive bolus resuscitation with albumin or saline compared with no bolus resuscitation at all. In a secondary analysis of the trial, published in BMC Medicine, the authors found that increased mortality was evident in patients who presented with clinical features of severe shock in isolation or in conjunction with features of respiratory or neurological failure. The cause of excess deaths was primarily refractory shock and not fluid overload. These features are consistent with a potential cardiotoxic or ischemia-reperfusion injury following resuscitation with boluses of intravenous fluid. Although these effects may have been amplified by the absence of invasive monitoring, mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, the results provide compelling insights into the effects of intravenous fluid resuscitation and potential adverse effects that extend beyond the initial resuscitation period. These data add to the increasing body of literature about the safety and efficacy of intravenous resuscitation fluids, which may be applicable to management of other populations of critically ill patients.

### Acute shortness of breath after transfusion… [^d7f576d9]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old man with a three-month history of worsening anemia was admitted for a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells. The patient tolerated the first unit without difficulty. Before the second unit finished infusing, he developed shortness of breath, chills, back pain, and tachycardia. The transfusion was stopped, and he was treated with diphenhydramine, 50 mg intravenously, and furosemide, 20 mg intravenously. There was no improvement in his respiratory distress, despite significant diuresis. The patient had no previous history of blood transfusions or allergic reactions. Physical examination showed a well-developed elderly man in moderate distress. He was afebrile and normotensive. Supplemental oxygen at 10 L per minute by face mask was needed to keep his oxygen saturation above 95 percent. No stridor or other upper airway abnormalities were noted. Pulmonary examination was significant for bilateral rales, more pronounced at the bases.

Skin examination was unremarkable, with no flushing or urticarial lesions, and the patient did not complain of pruritus. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia but was otherwise unremarkable. A chest radiograph was obtained, which was interpreted as bilateral patchy alveolar filling and small pleural effusions. Question Discussion The answer is D: transfusion-related acute lung injury. This syndrome can include dyspnea, bilateral pulmonary edema, hypotension, and fever. TRALI is the third leading cause of transfusion-related mortality and has been estimated to occur in one out of every 5, 000 transfusions. 1 Despite this incidence, it is probably underreported, because it may be mistaken for other causes of pulmonary edema. Clinically, the presentation may be similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiographs classically demonstrate bilateral interstitial and alveolar infiltrates.

Although the initial lung injury with TRALI may be severe and even require mechanical ventilation, it typically improves rapidly, unlike the permanent damage that often occurs with ARDS. Still, there is an estimated 5 percent mortality rate associated with TRALI. The exact etiology of TRALI remains unclear, but there is an association with anti-granulocyte antibodies in donor plasma. These antibodies are estimated to exist in as many as 20 percent of blood donors, but most patients who receive blood products containing these antibodies do not develop TRALI. Conditions that possibly predispose to TRALI include infection, recent surgery, and transfusion of large volumes of blood products. An important distinction for TRALI is the recognition that the pulmonary edema is not cardiogenic and that the affected patient does not have circulatory overload.

Patients with circulatory overload will respond favorably to diuretics, whereas treating TRALI patients with overzealous diuresis can lead to hypotension and further complications. Anaphylactic transfusion reactions also may present with respiratory distress. With anaphylaxis, however, upper airway findings such as stridor or laryngeal edema occur often, and most patients will experience pruritus and flushing, which may be followed by urticaria. Patients who receive blood products affected by bacterial contamination often present with fever, hypotension, and vascular collapse. Respiratory distress and pulmonary edema are not seen as frequently. Pulmonary edema can worsen suddenly in patients with chronic heart failure, but a transfusion-related reaction was more likely for this patient. This patient was diagnosed as having a TRALI reaction, and no further diuresis was attempted.

The most common diagnoses that immediately led to RRT activation were seizure (120 activations, 14.0%), severe sepsis (102, 11.9%), arrhythmia (83, 9.7%), pneumonia (66, 7.7%), aspiration (43, 5.0%), and syncope/presyncope (41, 4.8%) (Table 3). The most common documented therapeutic interventions performed during RRTs were airway, respiratory, and cardiovascular support (Table 4). After RRT activation, 473 (55.3%) patients were transferred to a more highly monitored setting, including 371 (43.4%) to the ICU (Table 4). Three hundred fifty-two (41.2%) patients remained in the same room, two (0.2%) underwent emergency surgery, and one (0.1%), emergency cardiac catheterization. Twenty-four (2.8%) patients died during the RRT.

Respiratory — airway management, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) use: PEEP "improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia" by "decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to ventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation". It "does not open fully collapsed alveoli but re-expands partially collapsed ones" and "does not decrease extravascular lung water but redistributes it". "Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)". PEEP "should be increased slowly by 2–3 cmH2O from 5 cmH2O to a max of 15 cmH2O" with close monitoring. "Excessive PEEP over distends alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces lung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking pulmonary barotrauma". "Increased intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most notable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH2O. The higher the level of PEEP (over 5 cmH2O), the more likely the patient will experience a variety of adverse consequences, both ventilatory and hemodynamic".

### Simplified severe sepsis protocol: a randomized controlled trial of modified early goal-directed therapy in Zambia [^e614275f]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of a simple, goal-directed sepsis treatment protocol for reducing mortality in patients with severe sepsis in Zambia.

Design

Single-center nonblinded randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Emergency department, ICU, and medical wards of the national referral hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.

Patients

One hundred twelve patients enrolled within 24 hours of admission with severe sepsis, defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome with suspected infection and organ dysfunction

Interventions

Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol consisting of up to 4 L of IV fluids within 6 hours, guided by jugular venous pressure assessment, and dopamine and/or blood transfusion in selected patients. Control group was managed as usual care. Blood cultures were collected and early antibiotics administered for both arms.

Measurements and Main Results

Primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. One hundred nine patients were included in the final analysis and 88 patients (80.7%) were HIV positive. Pulmonary infections were the most common source of sepsis. In-hospital mortality rate was 64.2% in the intervention group and 60.7% in the control group (relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79–1.41). Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was isolated from 31 of 82 HIV-positive patients (37.8%) with available mycobacterial blood culture results. Patients in Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol received significantly more IV fluids in the first 6 hours (2.7 L vs 1.7 L, p = 0.002). The study was stopped early because of high mortality rate among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intervention arm (8/8, 100%) compared with the control arm (7/10, 70%; relative risk, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.95–2.14).

Conclusion

Factors other than tissue hypoperfusion probably account for much of the end-organ dysfunction in African patients with severe sepsis. Studies of fluid-based interventions should utilize inclusion criteria to accurately capture patients with hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion who are most likely to benefit from fluids. Exclusion of patients with severe respiratory distress should be considered when ventilatory support is not readily available.

### Advances in the support of respiratory failure: putting all the evidence together [^e961cd92]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

As noted at the beginning of this discussion, we have learned some hard won lessons (Figure 4). Among these, we know that our ARDS definition needs considerable work in order to personalize ventilatory care for patients with acute lung injury and distress). Mechanical and non-mechanical factors contribute to causation of ventilator-associated lung injury. Intervention timing is key to the efficacy and outcome, and the stage and severity may determine an intervention's value. Reducing oxygen consumption and ventilatory demands are keys to a successful strategy for respiratory support of ARDS. Results from major clinical trials can be understood against the background of the complex physiology of VILI. Unquestionably, our laboratory investigations have been informative, whereas our clinical progress in managing ARDS has been slow, sometimes painful, but nonetheless real.

### Rapid response: a quality improvement conundrum [^301b8da5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many in-hospital cardiac arrests and other adverse events are heralded by warning signs that are evident in the preceding 6 to 8 hours. By promptly intervening before further deterioration occurs, rapid response teams (RRTs) are designed to decrease unexpected intensive care unit (ICU) transfers, cardiac arrests, and inpatient mortality. While implementing RRTs is 1 of the 6 initiatives recommended by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, data supporting their effectiveness is equivocal. Before implementing an RRT in our institution, we reviewed cases of failure to rescue and found that (1) poor outcomes were often associated with attempts to manage early decompensations without a bedside evaluation, and (2) the common causes of decompensation for floor patients (early sepsis, aspiration, pulmonary embolism) were within the scope of our primary teams' practice. Therefore, we felt that prompt, mandatory bedside evaluations by the primary team would decrease untoward outcomes.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^3e94d6bf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — shock treatment and interventions include oxygen titration, perfusion and metabolic assessment, vascular access, fluid resuscitation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Oxygen is administered with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Perfusion assessment notes that an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) reading of less than 25 mmHg may be sign of poor perfusion. Metabolic thresholds include correction of blood glucose if less than 60 mg/dL and recognition that lactate greater than 2 mmol/L is abnormal. If intravenous (IV) access is not obtained within two attempts or less than 90 seconds, place an intraosseous (IO) needle. For fluids, give boluses that are pressure infused over less than 15 minutes each to achieve a MAP, calculated as (MAP = [(2x diastolic) + (systolic)/3]). Adult targets specify a physiologic MAP goal 65 mmHg and a fluid goal of up to 30 mL/kg using rapid, predetermined boluses (e.g., 500 mL) unless the MAP goal is achieved, or pulmonary edema develops; if available, packed red blood cells or whole blood may be indicated for hemorrhagic shock.

Ethics approval

The Southern Health Research and Ethics Committee exempted this study from requiring ethics approval because it fulfilled the NHMRC criteria for a quality assurance project.

Methods and participants

We have previously published the methodology for this study. In summary there were three parts to this study.

Point prevalence study of missed RRS incidence

On 17 April 2009 between 11:00 and 12:00 all adult inpatient observation charts were reviewed (excluding critical care areas such as intensive care units (ICUs), high dependency units, the emergency department and the theatre complex). Evidence of documented physiological instability as defined by the RRS activation criteria (table 1) was determined by review of the patient observation charts over the previous 24 h. If patients fulfilled these physiological criteria then the actions of the staff in response to clinical instability were recorded. If the RRS was not activated when RRS activation criteria were met, the event was termed a 'missed RRS call'.

Table 1
The rapid response system physiological criteria or triggers

Prospective study of missed RRS calls

Over an 8-week period from 26 April to 7 July 2009 all cardiac arrests and unplanned ICU admissions from the ward areas were examined to determine if the patient fulfilled the activation criteria for a RRS call (table 1) for a minimum of 4 h in the 24 h period prior to the index event. In the event that the RRS was not activated, all the clinical staff involved were interviewed (see below) and these events were also labelled 'missed RRS call'.

Interviews of staff members involved in missed RRS calls

The clinical staff involved in 'missed RRS calls' in the first two parts of the study were interviewed (online appendix 1). These staff members included the junior medical and nursing staff and members of the medical emergency or intensive care teams that were called to assist. The interview questions were derived from the cognitive theory of situation awarenessand from brief open-ended questions designed to explore the sociocultural barriers identified in health systems.

Quantitative data were recorded as frequency data as this was an exploratory study and not designed to distinguish adverse event rates among clinical areas. Interview responses were coded independently by two coders for themes and the coding system iteratively developed until agreement was achieved.

### Patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review [^3378a320]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is common in COVID‐19 patients who develop pneumonia 34, 40. Transfusion of red cells has been associated with negative clinical effects on the lung, such as transfusion‐related acute lung injury or pulmonary hypertension 41. These side‐effects might enhance the severity of ARDS in affected patients 42. Thus, it is important to carefully consider each indication for transfusion, taking into account individual factors such as age, intravascular volume status of the patient and concomitant diseases. Before transfusing allogeneic red cells, measures that increase oxygen delivery should be utilised, including improvement of oxygen saturation and cardiac output. Total erythrocyte mass is not always reflected by haemoglobin values and it is not advisable to merely focus on transfusion thresholds. Whenever possible, a single‐unit policy should be followed in order to limit volume transfused and multiple donor exposure, except in patients with active massive bleeding.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^41658ff6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical examples of reasonable divergence from empirical evidence — examples include low tidal volume ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), inhaled nitric oxide for severe ARDS, and induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest — with scenario-specific rationales. For low tidal volume ventilation for severe ARDS, elevated plateau pressures in the context of abdominal compartment syndrome can justify allowing higher plateau pressures based on pathophysiologic reasoning about transpulmonary pressures. For inhaled nitric oxide for severe ARDS, single organ failure with severe life-threatening hypoxia can lead to pathophysiologic reasoning to implement therapy without proven benefit for improving hospital survival. For induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest, a witnessed in-hospital cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity as the initial rhythm can prompt extrapolation from out-of-hospital arrest to induce hypothermia.

### Dosing fluids in early septic shock [^dd1f1cff]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Early IV fluid administration remains one of the modern pillars of sepsis treatment; however, questions regarding amount, type, rate, mechanism of action, and even the benefits of fluid remain unanswered. Administering the optimal fluid volume is important, because overzealous fluid resuscitation can precipitate multiorgan failure, prolong mechanical ventilation, and worsen patient outcomes. After the initial resuscitation, further fluid administration should be determined by individual patient factors and measures of fluid responsiveness. This review describes various static and dynamic measures that are used to assess fluid responsiveness and summarizes the evidence addressing these metrics. Subsequently, we outline a practical approach to the evaluation of fluid responsiveness in early septic shock and explore further areas crucial to ongoing research examining this topic.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine guideline — mechanical ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — states that the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O); for patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d; and for patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### Definitive care for the critically ill during a disaster: a framework for optimizing critical care surge capacity: from a task force for mass critical care summit meeting, January 26–27, 2007, Chicago, IL [^a96a2a54]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Plausible disasters may yield hundreds or thousands of critically ill victims. However, most countries, including those with widely available critical care services, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients. Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. In 2007, in response to the increasing concern over a severe influenza pandemic, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter called the Task Force) convened to suggest the essential critical care therapeutics and interventions for EMCC.

Task Force Suggestions

EMCC should include the following: (1) mechanical ventilation, (2) IV fluid resuscitation, (3) vasopressor administration, (4) medication administration for specific disease states (eg, antimicrobials and antidotes), (5) sedation and analgesia, and (6) select practices to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness and critical care delivery. Also, all hospitals with ICUs should prepare to deliver EMCC for a daily critical care census at three times their usual ICU capacity for up to 10 days.

Discussion

By using the Task Force suggestions for EMCC, communities may better prepare to deliver augmented critical care in response to disasters. In light of current mass critical care data limitations, the Task Force suggestions were developed to guide preparedness but are not intended as strict policy mandates. Additional research is required to evaluate EMCC and revise the strategy as warranted.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management [^943a3cd2]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

### Improving sepsis outcomes in the era of pay-for-performance and electronic quality measures: a joint IDSA / ACEP / PIDS / SHEA / SHM / SIDP position paper [^dc7ea4ec]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Adult Sepsis Event (ASE) metric and eCQM harmonization — CDC developed and validated the ASE as an electronic surveillance metric modeled on Sepsis-3; ASE defines suspected infection as a blood culture order and at least 4 days of new antibiotics (fewer if death or discharge occurs before 4 days) and defines organ dysfunction on initiation of vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, presence of an elevated blood lactate, or new changes in creatinine, total bilirubin, or platelet count; ASE does not include SIRS or diagnosis codes. The ASE was developed to overcome limitations of administrative data and has been applied to hundreds of hospitals; studies show that ASE is more sensitive than sepsis diagnosis codes, has similarly high specificity, and is more reliable for assessing trends in sepsis incidence and mortality, and it can distinguish hospital-onset versus present-on-admission sepsis, is strongly associated with poor outcomes, and performs similarly in US and non-US hospitals. Despite its strengths, ASE is not suitable for the eCQM: antimicrobial starts are not drawn and the elevated lactate criterion may distort temporal trends; hypotension that does not require vasopressors and non-invasive respiratory support short of invasive mechanical ventilation were not included in ASE's organ dysfunction thresholds, though with the current widespread adoption of Fast Health Interoperable Resources, including these parameters is now feasible. We encourage CMS and CDC to continue to collaborate on developing a single, harmonized measure based on the insights of both of their sepsis metric development teams, noting that harmonizing sepsis criteria across federal agencies will promote unity, increase credibility and efficiency, and facilitate shared prevention initiatives.

Sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and trauma — corticosteroid treatment recommendations are: For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2 /FIO2, < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^a8f4585f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ventilatory management — key guideline recommendations are as follows: The recommendations for the following interventions for the treatment of ARDS are strong: mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) with lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) and prone positioning for more than 12 h/d in severe ARDS, each with stated confidence in effect estimates; the recommendation against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is strong; the recommendation for higher positive end-expiratory pressure in patients with moderate or severe ARDS and for recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate or severe ARDS is conditional, with the listed confidence ratings; and additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^f98fa789]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

During septic shock, vasopressor infusion is usually started only after having corrected the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in the most severe patients. However, earlier administration of norepinephrine, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered in some cases. Duration and depth of hypotension strongly worsen outcomes in septic shock patients. However, the response of arterial pressure to volume expansion is inconstant, delayed, and transitory. In the case of profound, life-threatening hypotension, relying only on fluids to restore blood pressure may unduly prolong hypotension and organ hypoperfusion. Conversely, norepinephrine rapidly increases and better stabilizes arterial pressure. By binding venous adrenergic receptors, it transforms part of the unstressed blood volume into stressed blood volume. It increases the mean systemic filling pressure and increases the fluid-induced increase in mean systemic filling pressure, as observed in septic shock patients. This may improve end-organ perfusion, as shown by some animal studies. Two observational studies comparing early vs. later administration of norepinephrine in septic shock patients using a propensity score showed that early administration reduced the administered fluid volume and day-28 mortality. Conversely, in another propensity score-based study, norepinephrine administration within the first hour following shock diagnosis increased day-28 mortality. The only randomized controlled study that compared the early administration of norepinephrine alone to a placebo showed that the early continuous administration of norepinephrine at a fixed dose of 0.05 µg/kg/min, with norepinephrine added in open label, showed that shock control was achieved more often than in the placebo group. The choice of starting norepinephrine administration early should be adapted to the patient's condition. Logically, it should first be addressed to patients with profound hypotension, when the arterial tone is very low, as suggested by a low diastolic blood pressure (e.g. ≤ 40 mmHg), or by a high diastolic shock index (heart rate/diastolic blood pressure) (e.g. ≥ 3). Early administration of norepinephrine should also be considered in patients in whom fluid accumulation is likely to occur or in whom fluid accumulation would be particularly deleterious (in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome or intra-abdominal hypertension for example).

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^844adff4]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

### Reducing unplanned medical intensive care unit admissions by the critical care outreach team: a quality improvement report [^f13a355a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

The solutions were then scored based on their effectiveness, feasibility, cost and time required for implementation, on a scale of 1–5. The results were presented as a Prioritisation Matrix (online supplemental 4). The highest ranked solutions include compulsory documentation of EOC in ward round notes, electronic flag for identification of high-risk patients, critical care specialist review of high-risk patients stepped down to GW, and line tracking. While the team strongly advocated for timely EOC discussions, the optimal patient selection and timing remain uncertain. Mandating EOC documentation in every ward round note would significantly increase workload and likely face strong resistance from GW doctors. A practical compromise would be to identify a select group of high-risk patients who would benefit most from EOC discussions.

The implementation of an early warning score was not highly ranked in the prioritisation matrix, primarily due to its perceived low effectiveness. The second-highest-ranked solution was the electronic flagging of high-risk patients (with computer algorithms or artificial intelligence model). While this approach had strong long-term potential, it required considerable research and IT expertise, making it unfeasible at the time of project implementation in 2022. Solutions such as providing dialysis support after office hours and increasing the availability of ultrasound machines were considered too resource-intensive to be feasible for implementation in this project.

With the knowledge gained from PDSA cycle 1 and 2, we formed the CCOT. In the literature, common objectives of a critical care outreach team include averting unplanned ICU admission, facilitating timely ICU admission and sharing ICU skills with the GW interdisciplinary team.

Our outreach team aimed to support the GW team in several ways. First, the outreach team actively monitored patients considered at high risk of deterioration. These included patients stepped down from HD/ICU, patients assessed by the MET but deemed stable enough to remain in the GW, and patients escalated to the on-call ICU registrar but triaged to stay in the GW. Second, the outreach team shared ICU expertise with the GW team, including the use of POCUS and more advanced assessments of fluid balance, acid-base status and respiratory function. Third, the outreach team facilitated communication between the GW and HD/ICU. For patients who were actively deteriorating, the outreach team could liaise with the HD/ICU team to expedite transfers. Finally, the outreach team could assist the primary team in the discussion of the extent of care with patient and family members.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^09f94ee8]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid and vasopressor management in septic shock remains controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of dynamic measures (stroke volume change during passive leg raise) to guide resuscitation and improve patient outcome.

Research Question

Will resuscitation that is guided by dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock improve patient outcomes?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 13 hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom. Patients presented to EDs with sepsis that was associated hypotension and anticipated ICU admission. Intervention arm patients were assessed for fluid responsiveness before clinically driven fluid bolus or increase in vasopressors occurred. The protocol included reassessment and therapy as indicated by the passive leg raise result. The control arm received usual care. The primary clinical outcome was positive fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first.

Results

In modified intent-to-treat analysis that included 83 intervention and 41 usual care eligible patients, fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge was significantly lower (-1.37 L favoring the intervention arm; 0.65 ± 2.85 L intervention arm vs 2.02 ± 3.44 L usual care arm; P = 0.021. Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy (5.1% vs 17.5%; P = 0.04) or mechanical ventilation (17.7% vs 34.1%; P = 0.04) in the intervention arm compared with usual care. In the all-randomized intent-to-treat population (102 intervention, 48 usual care), there were no significant differences in safety signals.

Interpretation

Physiologically informed fluid and vasopressor resuscitation with the use of the passive leg raise-induced stroke volume change to guide management of septic shock is safe and demonstrated lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure. Dynamic assessments to guide fluid administration may improve outcomes for patients with septic shock compared with usual care.

### Our 15-year population-based study assessed transfusion-related acute… [^f31548af]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- **Authors**:
- Center: Abstract Background: TRALI is a leading cause of transfusion-related fatalities presenting as respiratory distress with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Purpose: To assess TRALI occurrence, severity, and potential risk factors among inpatient Medicare beneficiaries, ages 65+, transfused during 2007–2021. Methodology: This is a hypothesis-generating study that utilized large Medicare databases, with transfusions identified by recorded procedure and revenue center codes, and TRALI by diagnosis codes. Unadjusted TRALI rates per 100, 000 inpatient transfusion stays were evaluated by demographic and transfusion characteristics. Severity measures included inpatient mortality, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Fisher's exact tests compared rates and Cochran-Armitage tests ascertained trends by year, age, and units.

Results: Of 20, 601, 732 inpatient transfusion stays, 7, 479 had a TRALI diagnosis, an overall rate of 36. 3, with 2-year pre- and pandemic rates of
57. 9 and 54.
2. Annual TRALI rates ranged from
14. 3 in 2007 to 55. 3 in
2021. Rates by units increased from 18. 3 for 1 unit to
155. 8 for > 9 units. Rates by blood components, included RBCs only:

26. **2; plasma only**:
36. **1; COVID-convalescent plasma only**:

37. **4; platelets only**:
49. **0; RBCs and plasma**:

78. **0; platelets and plasma**:
97. **4; RBCs and platelets**:

140. **9; and RBCs, plasma, and platelets**:

1. TRALI rates by age declined from
45. 3 for 65–69 to 25. 5 for ≥ 85. Rates among males and females were
38. 1 and 34. 9; whites and non-whites:
37. 7 and 29. 2; and for immunocompromised vs. non-immunocompromised:

60. 0 and 31.

55. 3 without COVID-19. TRALI cases with vs. without COVID-19 were immunocompromised:

29.

8% vs.
33. **5%; and had CCI ≥ 3**:

54. 8% vs.
64. **4%, mechanical ventilation**:

54. 8% vs.
40. **8%, LOS ≥ 11 days**:

69. 0% vs.
53. **8%, and inpatient mortality**:

58. 3% vs.
31. 6%. Conclusion: Our 15-year population-based study showed increasing TRALI rates over time, except with lower TRALI rates during pandemic vs. 2-years pre-pandemic. Study found higher TRALI rates with platelet components transfused, greater numbers of units transfused, and for immunocompromised beneficiaries. Finally, our study identified an overall lower TRALI rate and greater case-severity in COVID-19 beneficiaries and requires further inferential investigations.
