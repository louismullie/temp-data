## Question

67 yo presented with right upper and lower quadrant pain. UA showed 2 plus blood, 11–12 rbc/hpf, wbc 51–100/ hpf, bun 67 and creatinine 3.3 Previously her renal fx was normal. Serum Na 125, K 4, cl 89, co2 24. Glucose 79. CBC wbc 18.92. What can be the cause of the hyponatremia. Can it be due to the acute renal failure?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the hyponatremia in a 67-year-old with new AKI and urinary findings could be due to the acute renal failure itself, and what the most likely mechanism and next diagnostic steps are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia or translocational causes. Then, I should classify the hyponatremia by volume status and integrate the AKI and urinalysis into the differential. Next, I will examine whether AKI can directly cause hyponatremia and, if so, by what mechanisms. Finally, I will outline the immediate diagnostic tests and a cautious, reference-aligned management plan, including how to avoid overcorrection in the setting of AKI [^c0e39aea] [^0632c300].

> Let me first confirm the nature of the hyponatremia. With serum sodium 125 mmol/L and normal glucose, this is true hypotonic hyponatremia unless proven otherwise, so I should measure serum osmolality to confirm hypotonicity and exclude hypertonic or pseudohyponatremia, because pseudohyponatremia from hyperproteinemia or hyperlipidemia would show normal measured osmolality and would change management entirely [^0632c300] [^68a3796b].

> Next, I should review the clinical context to infer volume status and likely etiologies. The abrupt rise in creatinine from normal to 3.3 mg/dL with BUN 67 mg/dL suggests acute kidney injury, and the urinalysis with pyuria and hematuria points toward an intrinsic renal process such as interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis, which can be associated with non-osmotic vasopressin release and impaired free water excretion, thereby producing hyponatremia; I need to check for medication exposures, infections, and systemic features that fit these entities [^c0e39aea] [^f38a4823].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I classify by volume status. I initially thought "hypervolemic hyponatremia from AKI", but wait, let me verify that assumption because AKI alone does not reliably produce hypervolemia; in fact, many AKI presentations are hypovolemic or euvolemic, and the correct branch depends on exam and urine studies, so I should confirm volume status clinically and with urine sodium and osmolality before labeling it hypervolemic [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7].

> I will now examine whether AKI can directly cause hyponatremia. Yes, AKI can contribute to hyponatremia via impaired free water excretion from reduced GFR, and via non-osmotic vasopressin release from pain, nausea, or systemic inflammation; in addition, intrinsic renal injury can mimic or cause salt-wasting phenotypes with inappropriate natriuresis, so I should double-check urine sodium and osmolality to distinguish hypovolemic from euvolemic or hypervolemic patterns and to look for a renal salt-wasting signal [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7] [^019cee26].

> Let me consider the most likely mechanism here. Given the abrupt AKI with pyuria and hematuria, a renal parenchymal process with impaired dilution and non-osmotic vasopressin release is plausible, and if urine sodium is high with inappropriately concentrated urine, that would support a renal cause of hyponatremia such as renal salt wasting or SIADH-like physiology in the setting of intrinsic renal injury; conversely, low urine sodium would suggest hypovolemia from prerenal azotemia, which would change therapy toward isotonic saline rather than fluid restriction [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7] [^019cee26].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic steps. I need a spot urine sodium and osmolality alongside repeat serum sodium, osmolality, creatinine, and BUN, and I should calculate the BUN:creatinine ratio to help distinguish prerenal from intrinsic renal failure; I also need to check thyroid and adrenal function because endocrine causes can coexist and confound the picture, and I should obtain renal ultrasound to assess for obstruction given the AKI, even though the urinalysis already suggests an intrinsic process [^c0e39aea] [^f38a4823].

> But wait, what if the hyponatremia is severe and symptomatic? I should confirm symptoms and neurologic status because if there are severe symptoms, guidelines support 3% hypertonic saline boluses with close monitoring; however, in the setting of AKI, I must be extremely cautious to avoid overcorrection, and if I inadvertently overcorrect, desmopressin with D5W can be used to safely re-lower sodium to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk, so I need a strict monitoring plan if I treat actively [^57649884] [^45ce3032] [^bcbfb0d7].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, the hyponatremia can be due to the acute renal failure, primarily via impaired free water excretion and non-osmotic vasopressin release, and possibly via renal salt wasting in the context of intrinsic renal injury; the correct classification depends on volume status and urine studies, so I should confirm hypotonicity, measure urine sodium and osmolality, and assess for prerenal versus intrinsic AKI causes to guide safe, cause-specific therapy and avoid rapid overcorrection [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7] [^0632c300].

---

The most likely cause of hyponatremia in this 67-year-old with acute kidney injury is **dilutional hyponatremia from impaired free water excretion** due to reduced GFR and non-osmotic vasopressin release from pain, infection, or AKI itself [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7]. The **urine studies are key**: if urine osmolality is > 100 mOsm/kg and urine sodium is > 30 mmol/L, this supports impaired water excretion; if urine sodium is ≤ 30 mmol/L, hypovolemia from prerenal AKI is more likely [^2791a906] [^a3af82a4]. Management should focus on treating the AKI and underlying cause, with careful fluid management and close monitoring to avoid rapid sodium correction and osmotic demyelination [^bcbfb0d7] [^9c2bc8f2].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking AKI to hyponatremia

Hyponatremia in AKI arises from **impaired renal water excretion** and non-osmotic vasopressin release, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7].

---

### Impaired free water excretion

- **Reduced GFR**: Lower GFR limits free water clearance, causing water retention and dilutional hyponatremia [^c0e39aea].
- **Non-osmotic vasopressin release**: Pain, infection, or AKI itself can trigger vasopressin, increasing water reabsorption and worsening dilution [^842a43b7].

---

### Increased sodium loss

- **Renal salt wasting**: Some intrinsic renal injuries cause sodium loss, contributing to hyponatremia.
- **Diuretic use**: Loop or thiazide diuretics can increase sodium excretion and worsen hyponatremia [^fff0a29c].

---

## Diagnostic approach to hyponatremia in AKI

A structured approach is essential to distinguish dilutional hyponatremia from other causes and guide therapy [^c0e39aea].

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Serum osmolality | Confirms hypotonic hyponatremia if < 275 mOsm/kg [^0632c300] |
| 2 | Urine osmolality | > 100 mOsm/kg suggests impaired water excretion; ≤ 100 mOsm/kg suggests excess water intake [^2791a906] |
| 3 | Urine sodium concentration | > 30 mmol/L suggests renal sodium loss or SIADH; ≤ 30 mmol/L suggests hypovolemia or hypervolemia [^a3af82a4] |
| 4 | Volume status assessment | Clinical exam and history distinguish hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic states [^842a43b7] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Hyponatremia in AKI increases morbidity and mortality; **careful management is critical** [^c0e39aea].

- **Treat the underlying AKI**: Address the cause (e.g. infection, obstruction, nephrotoxin) and support renal recovery [^f38a4823].
- **Fluid management**: Use isotonic saline for hypovolemia; avoid hypotonic fluids and restrict free water in dilutional hyponatremia [^9abf1fb5].
- **Monitor sodium correction**: Limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination; use desmopressin if overcorrection occurs [^bcbfb0d7] [^45ce3032].
- **Dialysis considerations**: In severe hyponatremia with AKI, use CRRT or low-sodium dialysate to control correction rate [^b46b07ed] [^6829dc6e].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of hyponatremia in this patient is **dilutional hyponatremia from impaired free water excretion** due to AKI and non-osmotic vasopressin release. Confirm with urine osmolality and sodium, assess volume status, and manage by treating the AKI, correcting fluids, and monitoring sodium correction to prevent complications [^c0e39aea] [^842a43b7].

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### A proposed approach to the dialysis prescription in severely hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease [^6829dc6e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with renal failure and severe hyponatremia present a therapeutic dilemma. Conventional hemodialysis is necessary to correct blood chemistries and volume overload, yet it may raise serum sodium (Na) too quickly, potentially resulting in osmotic demyelination syndrome. We present the case of a patient who presented with renal failure requiring dialysis and also with a serum Na of 112 mEq/l. Using a dialysate Na concentration of 130 mEq/l and by limiting the blood flow to 50 ml/minute, we were able to raise her serum Na by only 2 mEq/l/hour during her hemodialysis treatment and thus control both the rate and total change in the patient's serum Na.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^45ce3032]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

- a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^9c2bc8f2]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients. With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia in patients with kidney failure: role of continuous venovenous hemofiltration with low-sodium replacement fluid [^b46b07ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia and kidney failure pose a special therapeutic challenge. Hemodialysis to correct volume overload, azotemia, and abnormal electrolyte levels will result in rapid correction of serum sodium concentration and place the patient at risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome. We present a patient with acute kidney injury and severe hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 100 mEq/L) who was treated successfully with continuous venovenous hemofiltration. This teaching case illustrates the limitations of hemodialysis and demonstrates how to regulate the sodium correction rate by single-pool sodium kinetic modeling during continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Two methods to adjust the replacement fluid to achieve the desired sodium concentration are outlined.

### A suspected case of hyponatraemia induced rhabdomyolysis: a case report [^bb177977]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but significant complication of hyponatraemia with associated renal morbidity. This case illustrates the importance of recognising the association of the two conditions and should encourage physicians to consider regularly measuring CK levels in the presence of severe hyponatraemia. The challenge posed by the conflicting treatment strategies involved must be carefully considered, with novel strategies including individualised CRRT used to mitigate the risk of rapidly correcting the serum sodium level in the presence of acute renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis. Future studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism would be useful to further understand hyponatraemia-induced rhabdomyolysis, in order to guide treatment strategies.

### Cardiac tamponade causing severe reversible hyponatraemia [^2998e13e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Severe hyponatraemia in setting of cardiac tamponade is very rare and only few case reports have been reported so far. This case report highlights pericardial tamponade as a rare but easily treatable cause of severe hyponatraemia. Pertinent literature is also reviewed. A 70-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. She was tachycardic and hypotensive with cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray. Serum sodium was severely low at 109mmol/L and was identified as the likely cause for her abnormal mentation. She was also in acute renal failure with serum creatinine of 4.1mg/dL. A transthoracic echocardiogram was done that showed a large pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology. She underwent emergent pericardiocentesis with rapid improvement in clinical picture and blood pressure. Her serum sodium level rapidly improved and was normal in 48hours.

5.3 Acute Renal Dysfunction and Acute Renal Failure

Acute renal dysfunction/failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death1,2may occur upon use of human IGIV products. Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering ASCENIV. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure.2Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of ASCENIV and at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuing ASCENIV (see Patient Counseling Information [17]). In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction, because of pre-existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, hypovolemia, overweight, use of concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age of > 65 years), administer ASCENIV at the minimum infusion rate practicable (see Dosage and Administration [2]).

5.4 Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hyponatremia

Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment, including ASCENIV. It is critical to clinically distinguish true hyponatremia from a pseudohyponatremia that is associated with or causally related to hyperproteinemia with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap, because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity, and a possible predisposition to thrombotic events.3

### Management of hyponatremia [^18e583f0]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

5.3 Acute Renal Dysfunction and Acute Renal Failure

Acute renal dysfunction/failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death1,2may occur upon use of human IGIV products. Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering BIVIGAM. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure2. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of BIVIGAM and at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuing BIVIGAM (see Patient Counseling Information [17.1]). In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction, because of pre-existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure (such as diabetes mellitus, hypovolemia, overweight, use of concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age of > 65 years), administer BIVIGAM at the minimum infusion rate practicable (see Dosage and Administration [2.3]).

5.4 Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hyponatremia

Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy, including BIVIGAM.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Association of pre-ESKD hyponatremia with post-ESKD outcomes among incident ESKD patients [^bcd9bcc2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte disturbances in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, and has been shown to be associated with higher mortality risk. However, the relationship between hyponatremia during late-stage CKD and the risk of poor outcomes after ESKD transition is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 32257 US veterans transitioning to ESKD from 1 October 2007 to 30 March 2015. We evaluated adjusted associations between the 3-month averaged pre-transition to ESKD serum sodium and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular (CV) mortality, infection-related mortalities and hospitalization rate.

Results

Cohort mean ± standard deviation serum sodium was 139 ± 3 mEq/L, mean age was 67 ± 11years, 98% were male and 28% were African American. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 702days (296, 1301) there were 17162 deaths. Compared with the reference of 135 to < 144 mEq/L, the lowest serum sodium group (< 130 mEq/L) had a 54% higher all-cause mortality risk [hazard ratio 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.34–1.76)] in the fully adjusted model. Associations were similar for CV and infection-related mortality, and hospitalization outcomes.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia prior to ESKD transition is associated with higher risk of all-cause, CV and infection-related mortalities, and hospitalization rates after ESKD transition. Future studies evaluating management of pre-ESKD hyponatremia may be indicated to improve patient outcomes for those transitioning to ESKD.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^69c2c422]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

Phase 3: transition to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD)

On day 4, sodium levels decreased to 129 mmol/L, prompting cessation of vasopressin. The patient remained euvolemic with a decreasing urine output of 3.5 mL/kg/hr. Day 4 serum osmolality was 298 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 374 mOsm/kg. By day 5, sodium normalized to 138 mmol/L and urine output decreased to 2 mL/kg/hr. Serum osmolality on day 5 was 285 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 572 mOsm/kg. There is no mention of hyponatremia post-vasopressin cessation.

The fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) was 10.14%, and the fractional excretion of urea (FEurea) was 55.4%, with a serum sodium of 138 mmol/L — findings suggestive of evolving SIADH and inconsistent with cerebral salt wasting.

Fluid replacement was stopped, and fluids were restricted to half-maintenance rate. Enteral feeding continued with Jevity 1.5 at the rate of 70 cc/hr, supplemented by free water (50 mL Q4h). Day 6 urine osmolality was 793 mOsm/kg. Day 6 sodium was 138 mmol/L, urine output was 1.8 mL/kg/hr, and serum osmolality was 297 mOsm/kg. By day 7, serum osmolality was 288 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality was 693 mOsm/kg.

Resolution and outcome

Throughout the hospital course, the patient's sodium levels, and urine output remained stable within normal limits, suggesting adequate management of fluid and electrolyte status. Final laboratory values demonstrated a serum sodium of 140 mmol/L, potassium 3.5 mg/dL, carbon dioxide 30 mmol/L, creatinine 0.63 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 18 mg/dL, calcium 8.4 mg/dL, total protein 6.9 g/dL, and albumin 2.8 g/dL. Urine output stabilized at 1.1 mL/kg/hr, further supporting recovery of fluid homeostasis. The trend in these parameters indicated effective renal perfusion and resolution of acute derangements related to the initial brain injury and its management. (Table 1, Image 1, Image 2)

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

KDIGO AKI — timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) recommendations state to initiate RRT emergently when life‑threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid–base balance exist, and to consider the broader clinical context, the presence of conditions that can be modified with RRT, and trends of laboratory tests — rather than single BUN and creatinine thresholds alone — when making the decision to start RRT (Not Graded). The rationale notes that while no RCTs exist for dialysis for life‑threatening indications, it is widely accepted that patients with severe hyperkalemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications should be dialyzed emergently.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^329658e7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to urine osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to obtain and interpret urine osmolality on a spot urine sample as the initial step in the evaluation of patients with hypotonic hyponatremia.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^f38a4823]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

### Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^c46790d5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Dysnatremia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with bacterial pneumonia. There is paucity of data about the incidence and prognostic impact of abnormal sodium concentration in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Objective

This work aimed to examine the association of serum sodium during hospitalization with key clinical outcomes, including mortality, need for advanced respiratory support and acute kidney injury (AKI), and to explore the role of serum sodium as a marker of inflammatory response in COVID-19.

Methods

This retrospective longitudinal cohort study, including all adult patients who presented with COVID-19 to 2 hospitals in London over an 8-week period, evaluated the association of dysnatremia (serum sodium < 135 or > 145 mmol/L, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia, respectively) at several time points with inpatient mortality, need for advanced ventilatory support, and AKI.

Results

The study included 488 patients (median age, 68 years). At presentation, 24.6% of patients were hyponatremic, mainly due to hypovolemia, and 5.3% hypernatremic. Hypernatremia 2 days after admission and exposure to hypernatremia at any time point during hospitalization were associated with a 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.08–5.05; P = 0.0014) and 3.05-fold (95% CI, 1.69–5.49; P < .0001) increased risk of death, respectively, compared to normonatremia. Hyponatremia at admission was linked with a 2.18-fold increase in the likelihood of needing ventilatory support (95% CI, 1.34–3.45, P = 0.0011). Hyponatremia was not a risk factor for in-hospital mortality, except for the subgroup of patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. Sodium values were not associated with the risk for AKI and length of hospital stay.

Conclusion

Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalization are risk factors for poor prognosis, with hypernatremia and hyponatremia being associated with a greater risk of death and respiratory failure, respectively. Serum sodium values could be used for risk stratification in patients with COVID-19.

### Emergency department management of acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and renal replacement therapy in the critically ill [^282198d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common sequela of critical illness. Clinical manifestation of AKI varies and can include electrolyte abnormalities, anion gap, or non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment strategies require careful identification of the cause of the AKI, relying on both clinical history and laboratory data. Once the cause has been identified, treatment can then target the underlying cause and avoid further insults. Conservative management should first be attempted for patients with AKI. If conservative management fails, renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis can be used.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide (triamterene hydrochlorothiazide) [^fff0a29c]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE AND BUN INCREASES

Patients receiving triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be carefully monitored for fluid or electrolyte imbalances; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are especially important and should be frequently performed when the patient is vomiting or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require any specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hypokalemia may develop with thiazide therapy, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin B or after prolonged thiazide therapy. However, hypokalemia of this type is usually prevented by the triamterene component of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), creatinine level or both. This is probably not the result of renal toxicity but is secondary to a reversible reduction of the glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of the intravascular fluid volume. Elevations in BUN and creatinine levels may be more frequent in patients receiving divided dose diuretic therapy. Periodic BUN and creatinine determinations should be made especially in elderly patients, patients with suspected or confirmed hepatic disease or renal insufficiencies. If azotemia increases, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued.

HEPATIC COMA

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

To assure that entry criteria were met and that duration of HN was evaluable, data from patients who met a prespecified review threshold were subject to review by two members of the study Steering Committee. Discrepancies were resolved by review by the Steering Committee co-chairmen. Prespecified criteria triggering adjudication are listed in Supplementary Table S4 online. Among those who failed adjudication and were excluded were as follows: (1) individuals stated to be euvolemic but who presented with elevated blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratios and/or low urine [Na +]s whose HN responded to administration of NS alone coincident with a fall in blood urea nitrogen:creatinine ratio; (2) individuals who were stated to be euvolemic but whose admission findings included edema or anasarca; (3) individuals with only a single [Na +] < 130 mEq/l who did not receive an active treatment for HN, and (4) patients with a qualifying episode of euvolemic or hypervolemic HN who also had a separate episode of hypovolemic HN during the same hospitalization that would have interfered with computerized parsing of data.

### Admission serum sodium and potassium levels predict survival among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a cohort study [^bb1f2001]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant interaction between serum sodium and potassium on mortality was observed in our study (P interaction: 0.001 for 90-day mortality, and 0.007 for 30-day mortality). Across different sodium strata, a higher admission serum potassium level was associated with increased risk of mortality among patients with lower sodium levels, whereas the effects of hypernatremia seemed to be independent of serum potassium. Hypernatremia has been poorly assessed in AKI, probably because according to previous report, more AKI patients suffered the hyponatremia (Na + < 135 mmol/L) than hypernatremia (Na + > 145 mmol/L) (36% vs 6%) when admitted into ICU. Similarly, the number of patients with hypernatremia was only 782 (5.7%) compared with 3678 (27.0%) patients with hyponatremia in our study. The significant lower number of patients among patients with hypernatremia suggests less statistical power to find a significant association. In addition, hypernatraemia cases more often had hypokalaemia, often complicated by hypertonic environment, also leads to high mortality. The poor prognosis of with hyponatremia, especially when combined with hyperkalemia, calls for action. The interaction might be explained by the Edelman equation: [Na +] plasma = 1.03 (Na exhangeable + K exchangeable)/Total body water ‐ 23.8, which shows that changes in the mass balance of Na +, K + and H 2 O have an important impact on [Na +] plasma. We performed additional subgroup analyses and our findings suggest that the males with serum potassium ≥ 4.8 mmol/L have a higher risk of mortality than females (HRs with 95% CIs: 1.34 vs. 1.14 for male vs. female, P for interaction = 0.043), but independent of renal status. For serum sodium, patients with low SCr had a higher risk of mortality for hyponatremia. Low SCr value at admission has been suggested to be independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients. Although diseases (e.g. CVDs) are common causes of impaired sodium and potassium homeostasis and associated with poor prognosis among AKI patients, but our sensitivity analysis of excluding diseases, such as CVDs, chronic pulmonary disease, deficiency anemias, liver disease, or tumor related diseases, did not change our conclusions.

Understanding hypernatremia is at times difficult for many clinicians. However, hypernatremia can often be deciphered easily with some basic understanding of water and sodium balance. Here, the basic pathophysiological abnormalities underlying the development of sodium disorders are reviewed, and case examples are given. Hypernatremia often arises in the hospital, especially in the intensive care units due to the combination of (1) not being able to drink water; (2) inability to concentrate the urine (most often from having kidney failure); (3) osmotic diuresis from having high serum urea concentrations, and (4) large urine or stool outputs.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^61417f49]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity such as salt depletion is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values. Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels. Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^a94f3f50]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia are important risk factors for high morbidity and mortality in several clinical settings. However, reports have conflicted about the dependent and independent relationships of sodium with mortality. A relationship is plausible because both hyponatremia and hypernatremia have adverse consequences via their effects on the brain, heart, and other organs. However, dysnatremia might be only a marker of comorbidities, with deaths attributable mainly to the severity of the diseases and not to dysnatremia itself. A recent review of hyponatremia cases concluded that deaths were associated with the underlying illness, rather than with the severity of hyponatremia. Given the nature of this issue, it is unclear whether the correction of sodium can reduce the mortality risk. Most randomized controlled trials of drugs for sodium correction have not demonstrated a survival advantage. Although these results have not excluded the need for sodium correction, it is necessary to address whether sodium correction alone can reduce mortality. A well-designed observational study could be helpful because randomized controlled trials for this issue are not feasible.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is increasingly used in severe acute kidney injury (AKI), because it can easily control biochemical imbalances due to AKI. The presence of AKI or comorbidities hinders the effectiveness of conventional fluid or drug management, but CRRT can overcome these difficulties and achieve normonatremia. Here, we first addressed how sodium levels predict mortality in a prospective cohort of patients receiving CRRT, in whom the control of dysnatremia was extremely difficult with conventional treatment alone. Whether sodium correction is independently associated with reduced mortality in comorbid conditions was also addressed.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists [^c551ac20]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The first non-peptide vasopressin receptor antagonist (VRA) was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and several others are now in late stages of clinical development. Phase 3 trials indicate that these agents predictably reduce urine osmolality, increase electrolyte-free water excretion, and raise serum sodium concentration. They are likely to become a mainstay of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Although tachyphylaxis to the hydro-osmotic effect of these agents does not appear to occur, their use is accompanied by an increase in thirst, and they do not always eliminate altogether the need for water restriction during treatment of hyponatremia. Experience with use of these agents for treatment of acute, severe, life-threatening hyponatremia as well as chronic hyponatremia is limited. Further studies are needed to determine how they are best used in these situations, but the risk of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia seems low. Results of long-term trials to determine the ability of VRAs to reduce morbidity or mortality in congestive heart failure or to slow the progression of polycystic kidney disease are awaited with great interest.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^92379137]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Advances in the diagnosis of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury: a literature review [^c8afe641]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urine output monitoring

Urine output is one of the standard tools for diagnosing AKI. Oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) or anuria (< 50 mL/day) are early clinical signs of AKI. In 2012, the KDIGO guidelines proposed that a urine output of ≤ 0.5 mL/(kg·h) within 6 h can diagnose AKI. Although the reliability of oliguria as a renal function marker is debated, studies have shown it is closely associated with worse prognosis.

In AKI, changes in urine output alone may not accurately reflect the severity of kidney injury. Prerenal AKI typically presents with a significant reduction in urine output, whereas in renal AKI, particularly in cases of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), urine output may remain normal. Additionally, transient oliguria can be a physiological phenomenon and can be modulated with diuretics, but measurement errors can still occur even with a catheter. In patients with chronic underlying diseases, urine output tends to decrease more gradually, and recovery is more complex, further complicating the interpretation.

Imaging and electrolyte tests

Imaging and laboratory tests play a crucial role in identifying the cause of AKI and evaluating complications. Common imaging techniques include X-ray, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. X-ray can detect stones and calcification, while ultrasound is useful for evaluating kidney structure and urinary tract obstruction, especially in diagnosing postrenal AKI. CT provides detailed anatomical images, but contrast agents may exacerbate kidney damage, so caution is needed. MRI has no radiation and can be used in complex cases or when other imaging methods are inconclusive.

Laboratory tests focus on electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperphosphatemia. Blood electrolyte testing can guide treatment, but it should be considered in conjunction with other clinical information for a comprehensive assessment.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^223953c4]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by "inappropriate" (ie, nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were 2 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD later published by the same authors in 1967 have remained remarkably current (Table 1).

Table 1.
Criteria for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate diuresis

Over the decades since, understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia that have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the current understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing current guidelines, and to appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is more precisely referred to as low effective osmolality or tonicity. "Effective" osmolytes (eg, sodium, glucose, potassium, organic osmolytes) do not cross the cell membrane freely, so they have the capacity to create osmotic forces to influence the movement of water across cell membranes. In contrast, "ineffective" osmolytes (eg, ethanol, urea) freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not cause water shifts.

In hypotonic hyponatremia the low serum sodium concentration is primarily due to a relative excess of circulating free water, with or without a sodium deficit. Nonhypotonic hyponatremia can either be measured due to a method-dependent laboratory artifact, in which case it is termed pseudohyponatremia, or can be caused by excess of an effective osmolyte in the circulation (eg, hyperglycemia), in which case it is termed translocational hyponatremia (Fig. 1).

### Oliguria: an earlier and accurate biomarker of acute kidney injury? [^b2074254]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

In the context of the critically ill patient, the onset of consistent oliguria is an ominous sign that requires immediate attention. Without intervention, intermittent oliguria may turn into persistent oliguria or evolve to acute kidney injury (AKI), with severe associated morbidity and mortality. Whether the addition of urine output to the serum creatinine criteria permits earlier and more specific detection of AKI is controversial, but current evidence supports its importance in early diagnosis and management.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^2ae6ef8f]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^6ba5b701]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for overcorrection of sodium following tolvaptan include lower initial serum sodium, presence of cancer, lower body mass index (BMI), lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased GFR, and concurrent use of other treatments for hyponatremia (eg, hypertonic saline, diuretics, FR, demeclocycline). Lower initial sodium is an intuitive risk, especially as the onset of thirst as the serum sodium enters the normal range for those with a higher sodium starting point would be expected to be protective against overcorrection. The increased risk with cancer may arise from increased severity of paraneoplastic SIAD that could arise from higher AVP concentrations that have been correlated with tolvaptan response in one small study, or may relate to cachexia and low BMI. There are no data available to indicate whether copeptin concentrations can predict response to tolvaptan. In patients with a lower BMI, a given volume of water excreted represents a higher proportion of total body water compared to those with higher BMI, there is a higher likelihood of raising serum sodium concentration rapidly, plus the tolvaptan dose would have a lower volume of distribution in those with lower BMI, hence higher serum concentration and greater capacity to counteract AVP. A lower BUN may represent hypotonicity and may correlate with a greater degree of AVP excess. Higher GFR may contribute to overcorrection risk via improved delivery of tolvaptan to its site of action in the collecting duct, and greater renal free water clearance response, compared to those with reduced renal function.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^d84fe6e6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

Fig. 1
Standardized Therapeutic Protocol of Hyponatremia at Our Institution. Details of the protocol was explained in the methods section. All the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia and received cause-specific treatments. Bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline was administered for patients with severe symptoms, until the symptoms improved. DDAVP, desmopressin; D5W, 5% dextrose in water; ECW, extra cellular water; i.v. intravenous injection; p.o. per os; SNa, serum sodium; UK, urine potassium; and UNa, urine sodium

Subsequently, we evaluated the SNa and urine sodium (UNa), urine potassium (UK), and urine output every 2–4 h during the first 48 h. Note that our remarkable degree of monitoring was to ensure safer and uniform treatment throughout the study.

We defined the initial 4-h urine output as "early urine output." We compared the SNa to the total amount of UNa and UK (UNa + UK) to predict the possibility of a subsequent spontaneous increase in the SNa. In case the SNa was ≤ UNa + UK, hyponatremia was assumed not to be corrected spontaneously due to the absence of electrolyte-free water in the urine, and 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h or diuretics were administered if hyponatremia persisted in the subsequent 4 h. Thus, 3% hypertonic saline was administered to patients with reduced ECW, and diuretics such as loop diuretics or tolvaptan were administered to patients without reduced ECW. Administration of 3% hypertonic saline was continued at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h until the SNa improved. We used this relatively aggressive protocol to avoid under-treatment, based on evidence that even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

### Management of acute renal failure [^c06d757d]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is present in 1 to 5 percent of patients at hospital admission and affects up to 20 percent of patients in intensive care units. The condition has prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes, with prerenal conditions accounting for 60 to 70 percent of cases. The cause of acute renal failure usually can be identified through an appropriate history, a physical examination, and selected laboratory tests. The initial laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, a determination of the fractional excretion of sodium, a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, and a basic metabolic panel. Management includes correction of fluid and electrolyte levels; avoidance of nephrotoxins; and kidney replacement therapy, when appropriate. Several recent studies support the use of acetylcysteine for the prevention of acute renal failure in patients undergoing various procedures. The relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.11 in patients undergoing radiocontrast-media procedures (absolute risk reduction: 19 percent) and 0.33 in patients undergoing coronary angiography (absolute risk reduction: 8 percent). In patients pretreated with sodium bicarbonate before radiocontrast-media procedures, the relative risk of serum creatinine elevation was 0.13 and the absolute risk reduction was 11.9 percent. Dopamine and diuretics have been shown to be ineffective in ameliorating the course of acute renal failure.

### Osmotic demyelination syndrome in end-stage renal disease after recent hemodialysis: MRI of the brain [^5e342138]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in patients with end-stage renal disease, but the specific MRI findings in this patient group have not been documented in detail. Our aims were to present the brain MRI findings during an episode after hemodialysis and at follow-up, and to identify possible factors that may contribute to lesion development.

Materials and Methods

Seventeen patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome who had undergone hemodialysis at least once and had brain MRI examinations were retrospectively reviewed. Neurologic and MRI examinations were performed during a clinical episode. Serum levels of sodium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose were assessed, and serum osmolality and the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN:Cr) were calculated. Follow-up MRI was performed in nine cases. Laboratory and imaging findings were evaluated.

Results

An altered level of consciousness and convulsions were the most common neurologic symptoms. The pons was involved in 11 patients (65%) and extrapontine sites in 12 (71%). Four patients had dysequilibrium syndrome. Follow-up MRI showed complete resolution in six patients and lesion reduction in three within a short time. The most common biochemical changes at the time of MRI were hyponatremia and low BUN:Cr in the blood. Only one patient showed rapid correction of hyponatremia and a rapid change in osmolality during the acute stage.

Conclusion

In patients who develop osmotic demyelination syndrome after hemodialysis, the lesions may involve the pons or the pons and extrapontine sites. Most lesions that were followed up resolved rapidly and almost completely, favoring transient edema rather than demyelination. Blood chemistries suggested underlying changes in osmolality, particularly as a result of urea shift from the extracellular fluid.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^bcbfb0d7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^1e7cd704]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte alteration among hospitalized patients and it has been reported in 20–40% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Multiple causes of hyponatremia have been hypothesized in these patients. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) has been considered one of the main reasons leading to hyponatremia in this condition. SIAD can be secondary to cytokines release, in particular IL-6. Positive pressure ventilation can be another cause of hyponatremia due to SIAD. Other possible etiologies of hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients can be related to secondary hypocortisolism, nausea, vomiting, heart and kidney damage. Similar to many other clinical conditions, there is strong evidence that hyponatremia is associated with a worse prognosis also in patients with COVID-19 infection. In particular, hyponatremia has been identified as an independent risk of ICU transfer, need of non-invasive ventilation and death. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients is in principle acute and symptomatic and should be treated as such, according to the published guidelines. Therefore, patients should be initially treated with i.v. hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) infusion and serum [Na +] should be frequently monitored, in order to remain within a safe rate of correction. There is evidence showing that serum [Na +] correction is associated with a better outcome in different pathologies, including COVID-19 infection.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^019cee26]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

UNa concentration is a very useful discriminator of ECF volume status. This is because in hypovolemic hyponatremia the mechanisms to conserve sodium remain intact, resulting in low UNa excretion — however, in SIAD there is ongoing renal sodium loss. UNa concentrations can vary considerably, even in serial samples hour to hour, so the exact value is not as useful as whether it is above or below an approximate threshold of 30 mmol/L (according to current European guidelines, or 20–30 mmol/L according the expert panel guidelines). Because of measurement variability and other factors, it is difficult to determine a strict UNa cutoff for diagnosis. Different sources have set the UNa threshold for SIAD diagnosis at varying levels, including greater than 20 mmol/L, greater than 30 mmol/L, greater than 40 mmol/L, or even greater than 50 mmol/L. The original description of SIAD by Bartter and Schwartz referred to "continued renal excretion of sodium" without quantifying a threshold, an approach also taken by some contemporary sources, perhaps to avoid this controversy. Because UNa is a continuous variable under multifactorial influence, setting a higher threshold will increase the specificity of SIAD diagnosis but decrease sensitivity, and vice versa for a lower threshold (Fig. 9). Given this variability, and because volume status can change over time, repeated UNa measurements may be useful. Logically, the closer to the threshold, the greater the value in continued reevaluation. A low UNa may also develop with resolution of transient SIAD as the retained water begins to be excreted, so this finding does not totally rule out SIAD having been present. Clinical history and assessment of urine output are key to differentiating this scenario from hypovolemia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

Appropriate diagnostic testing for SIADH requires the assessment of the so-called Schwartz-Bartter criteria, i.e. serum and urinary osmolality and urinary sodium. In 13% of all cancer-related SIADH patients, none of these tests was obtained; the complete trio was assessed in only 46%. Diagnostic rigor was even worse in the subgroups comprising lung cancer patients and SCLC patients with all tests reported in 41 and 36%, respectively (Supplemental Table 2).

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^03756c2f]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^20e98894]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia in children is defined as plasma sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L. In pediatric patients younger than 4 years of age, hyponatremia is considered the most common serum electrolyte abnormality (SEA). However, in patients older than 4 years, hypokalemia is the most common SEA. Gastrointestinal, renal, and endocrine diseases are the predominant causes of SEAs in children. Hyponatremia is typically encountered in patients with excessive intake of free water paired with an inability of the kidney to excrete free water. The majority of cases of hyponatremia are associated with decreased osmolality. The various etiologies and differential diagnoses of hyponatremia are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Severe hyponatremia may lead to cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. Early symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and confusion. In more severe cases, altered consciousness, seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and myocardial ischemia can develop. Brain edema secondary to increased intracranial pressure may cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema which can lead to hypoxia and impairment of brain volume regulation, known as Ayus-Arieff syndrome. Children with cerebral edema are at an increased risk for developing herniation given a higher ratio of brain volume to skull size compared to adults.

Low plasma osmolality is diagnostic for hypotonic hyponatremia, therefore pseudohyponatremia and translational hyponatremia must be excluded first. The next step is to assess the current volume status. The diagnostic workup should include basic measurement of plasma and urinary sodium and creatinine to calculate FENa. Both volume status and value of FENa are used to determine the cause of hyponatremia.

Effect of urine composition ([Na] U +[K] U) and flow rate on serum sodium concentration [Na] after infusion of 1.75 L of 0.154 mol/L saline in a patient with initial body water of 26 L and [Na] of 111 mEq/L calculated from formula 9 (Table 3) if all the other influences depicted in this formula except urinary losses result in an [Na] of 116.0 mEq/L (Table 5). At [Na] U +[K] U = 116 mEq/L, urinary losses have no effect on [Na]. [Na] decreases if [Na] U +[K] U > 116 mEq/L and increases if [Na] U +[K] U < 116 mEq/L.

Modest hypotonic urine production can cause large underestimates of the increase in [Na] during treatment of hyponatremia with saline. External losses, primarily though the urine during treatment of hypovolemic hyponatremia, represent the major pitfall of formulas 2 to 7.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to serum osmolality, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to view hyponatremia as hypotonic hyponatremia in the absence of causes of non-hypotonic hyponatremia, such as:

- **Effective osmoles raising serum osmolality causing hyponatremia**: isotonic or hypertonic glucose, mannitol, glycine, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, hyperosmolar radiocontrast media, maltose

- presence of endogenous solutes causing pseudohyponatremia (laboratory artifact): triglycerides, cholesterol, protein, IVIG, monoclonal gammopathies.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^01cb98f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Suspicion

Patients who have symptoms of polyuria, nocturia, or polydipsia are candidates for further evaluation of a possible arginine vasopressin-related polyuria (AVP-D or AVP-R). However, before embarking on more complex pathways of investigation, it is important to exclude common causes of polyuria and polydipsia, including hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Certain scenarios are suggestive of a solute diuresis, for example uncontrolled hyperglycemia, high protein intake from parenteral or enteral feeding, tissue catabolism from high-dose glucocorticoids, resolving kidney injury including relief of urinary obstruction, use of diuretics and SGLT-2 inhibitors, administration of mannitol or high volumes of isotonic NaCl. The presence of nocturia without daytime polyuria suggests nocturnal polyuria (production of 20%-33% of total urine volume during sleep). In the absence of such obvious causes of symptomatic polyuria, possible AVP-related disorders should be evaluated. The first step is measurement of plasma osmolality and/or serum sodium concentration. Although these are within normal ranges in most patients with polyuria due to the ability of thirst and renal water excretion to maintain osmotic homeostasis, hypernatremia strongly suggests AVP-D or AVP-R, and hyponatremia strongly suggests PP as the most likely causes of polyuria. If the plasma osmolality and serum sodium are normal, the next step is confirming the presence of hypotonic polyuria. Because patients' estimations of both fluid intake and urine output are not always reliable, this should be assessed via measurement of a 24-hour urine. It is notable that there is no universally accepted definition of polyuria. Past studies have used an absolute urine volume (eg, ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children), and others have used a weight-based urine volume (eg, > 40 mL/kg/24 hours or > 50 mL/kg/24 hours). Consequently, clinical judgment and experience should be used to identify patients requiring further evaluation, but the least stringent criteria would be either a urine volume ≥ 3 L/24 hours in adults and ≥ 2 L/m 2 /24 hours in children, or > 40 mL/kg/24 hours. If these minimal criteria are not met, the patient should undergo urological evaluation for causes of increased urine frequency or nocturnal polyuria. Once polyuria is established, the second step is to confirm hypotonicity via measurement of osmolality in the 24 hours urine sample. A urine osmolality ≤ 300 mOsm/kg H 2 O confirms a hypotonic urine, and a urine osmolality ≥ 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O indicates a solute diuresis (due to glucose, sodium, urea, or administered diuretics such as mannitol). Urine osmolalities between 300 and 800 mOsm/kg H 2 O can be seen with partial AVP-D or AVP-R, so in such cases further evaluation is necessary. Once hypotonic polyuria is confirmed, additional testing is necessary to identify the cause (Table 1).

### Sequential drug-induced severe hyponatremia in a minimally symptomatic, 81-year-old patient [^d71a79ed]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been previous cases of medication-induced hyponatremia with various causative agents reported. Severe hyponatremia, a common medical emergency, can vary widely in its presentation, ranging from seizures and comas to no clinical manifestations.

Case Report

An 81-year-old female patient presented to the Emergency Department with history of a fall. She had a known case of hypertension and was recently started on hydrochlorothiazide. When evaluated at the hospital, her sodium level was measured as 106 mmol/L and her clinical symptoms were unremarkable. She was simultaneously diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, for which she was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. A few hours after administration, her sodium level fell even further, and she quickly developed symptoms of hyponatremia. After discontinuation of ciprofloxacin and treatment with hypertonic saline (3% NS), she improved and made a full recovery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We present an unusual case of minimally symptomatic, severe consecutive multi-medication-induced hyponatremia. As hyponatremia can present asymptomatically, routinely checking sodium levels is recommended, especially when caring for patients who recently experienced a fall or started a thiazide diuretic.

At admission, the patient had a body mass index of 23.7 kg/m², blood pressure of 140/99 mmHg, and body temperature of 36.4 °C. The initial 24 h urine volume was 205 mL. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities with no peripheral edema. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal size and shape of both kidneys, with no signs of obstructive nephropathy.

The laboratory analysis showed blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels of 137 and 4.8 mg/dL, respectively. The serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium 140, potassium 2.2, and chloride 109 mmol/L, magnesium 2.5, calcium 8.3, phosphate 5.3, and uric acid 13.7 mg/dL. Hemoglobin was 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count was 238.0 × 10 9 /L, both within the normal range. However, the white blood cell count was elevated at 18.7 × 10 9 /L, and C-reactive protein was elevated to 7.8 mg/dL despite no evidence of infection on cultures and chest and abdominal CT scans. Serum protein and albumin levels were 8.3 and 4.1 g/dL, respectively. The biomarker for AKI, neutrophil gelatinase-A lipocalin (NGAL), was elevated at 2396.6 ng/mL. The venous blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.22, anion gap of 18.8 mmol/L, pCO 2 of 16.9 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 7.4 mmol/L.
