## Question

SSRI for bipolar

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SSRIs should be used in bipolar disorder, and if so, how to weigh efficacy, switch risk, and guideline recommendations across BP-I versus BP-II and acute versus maintenance care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the illness subtype and current phase of treatment. Then, I should verify what randomized and meta-analytic data actually show for efficacy. Next, I will quantify treatment-emergent mania/hypomania risk and cycle acceleration. After that, I should reconcile major guideline positions and derive a cautious, scenario-based algorithm with agent selection, monitoring, and duration limits. Finally, I will acknowledge controversies and correct any premature conclusions along the way to ensure the synthesis is conservative and reference-aligned [^115m8nwC] [^117V3BQe] [^115kt8Ce].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scope and key distinctions. SSRIs are considered, if at all, for acute bipolar depression rather than mania, and their role differs substantially in bipolar I versus bipolar II disorder and in acute versus maintenance settings, so I need to keep those axes explicit while I reason through evidence and guidelines [^115m8nwC] [^1173MmEE] [^117V3BQe].

> I need to verify efficacy from higher-quality syntheses before assuming benefit. The Lancet Psychiatry meta-analysis of adjunctive second-generation antidepressants showed only a small but statistically significant improvement in depressive symptom scores without improvements in response or remission rates, which questions clinical meaningfulness, and the 2022 meta-analysis similarly found no significant improvement in response with only a very small symptom effect size overall, so I should be cautious about overstating efficacy claims [^115kt8Ce] [^111o1c3H].

> Hold on, I should also review older data because they influenced practice patterns. A 2004 systematic review of 12 RCTs reported that antidepressants outperformed placebo in the short term and did not increase early switch overall, but the modest effect sizes, frequent adjunctive mood stabilizer/antipsychotic use, and heterogeneity limit generalizability to real-world bipolar depression today, so I should not over-interpret those positive signals [^112pUcJn].

> Next, I will examine safety, especially treatment-emergent affective switch and cycle acceleration. Wait, let me verify comparative risks: historical pooled data showed higher switch with TCAs than SSRIs, but SSRIs still carried non-zero risk, and registry data demonstrated a roughly three-fold mania risk with antidepressant monotherapy soon after initiation, particularly relevant to BP-I; moreover, rapid cyclers in STEP-BD had more mood episodes when antidepressants were continued, reinforcing the need for extreme caution and strong preference against monotherapy in vulnerable phenotypes [^112PDUaB] [^111Vz1W6].

> For BP-I depression, I should confirm the consensus. Antidepressant monotherapy is not recommended due to switch risk and limited benefit signal; if considered at all, antidepressants are reserved as cautious adjuncts only after optimizing a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic, and even then contemporary guidelines rate the evidence as weak or insufficient for or against in acute depression or augmentation, underscoring the need for close monitoring and early discontinuation if mixed features or activation emerge [^111Vz1W6] [^117V3BQe] [^116t5KN3].

> For BP-II depression, let me think carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions. Small studies suggest low short-term switch risk with fluoxetine monotherapy and some signals with venlafaxine, and CANMAT discusses venlafaxine or fluoxetine as second-line in enriched samples, yet more recent reviews emphasize that higher-quality RCTs generally have not demonstrated robust efficacy for antidepressants even in BP-II, so while monotherapy has been proposed in limited contexts, it remains controversial and not a guideline-endorsed first-line approach [^112hZRRw] [^114xR5DW] [^113CsjcN] [^113NvebT].

> I should double-check current guideline positions before synthesizing. CANMAT/ISBD 2018 lists quetiapine, lithium, lamotrigine, and lurasidone as first-line for acute bipolar depression, and relegates SSRIs or bupropion to second-line adjunctive use with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic, with explicit cautions about switch risk, avoidance in mixed features and rapid cycling, and discontinuation if activation emerges; for BP-II "pure" depression, sertraline or venlafaxine are second-line, but long-term antidepressant use is not recommended due to instability concerns, while VA/DoD 2023 finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against antidepressant monotherapy or augmentation in acute bipolar depression, reflecting persistent uncertainty [^115m8nwC] [^111Vz1W6] [^111v14sJ] [^117V3BQe] [^116t5KN3].

> Now, agent selection; I need to ensure choices align with the limited supportive data and safety profile. If an antidepressant is used, escitalopram and sertraline are commonly cited as second-line adjuncts by expert consensus and CANMAT for selected BP-II cases with non-mixed presentations, while fluoxetine has small BP-II monotherapy data but is not preferred over first-line mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics; conversely, TCAs should be avoided due to higher switch risk, and paroxetine lacks contemporary supportive guidance in bipolar depression [^111k89Ti] [^111v14sJ] [^112PDUaB].

> Before initiating any SSRI, I should confirm a rigorous decision pathway. Diagnose BP-I versus BP-II accurately, screen for mixed features, psychosis, and rapid cycling, and optimize a first-line mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic to therapeutic effect first; only then, and only in non-mixed, non-rapid cycling presentations with informed consent about switch risk, should a cautious adjunctive SSRI trial be considered if first-line options are inadequate or not tolerated [^115m8nwC] [^111Vz1W6].

> For monitoring, hold on, I should verify intensity and stopping rules. Early follow-up should be close in the first 2–4 weeks with systematic mood ratings and explicit education of patient and caregivers on activation signs, and the SSRI should be tapered and discontinued promptly if hypomanic or manic symptoms, mixed features, or cycle acceleration appear, consistent with ISBD task force cautions and CANMAT guidance to stop antidepressants when switch phenomena emerge [^111Vz1W6].

> Regarding duration, let me reconsider maintenance use. Long-term antidepressant therapy is not recommended because efficacy for maintenance is unproven and there are concerns about mood instability; the role, if any, is limited to acute episodes with planned discontinuation after remission, and meta-analytic data do not show durable benefits to justify continuation beyond the acute phase [^112Sg7Jd] [^111o1c3H].

> But wait, what about the latest switch-risk synthesis in acute treatment windows. A 2025 network meta-analysis supports the guideline stance that antidepressants, when used at all, belong as second-line add-ons rather than monotherapy, and while acute trials up to about 10 weeks are reassuring for early switch detection, they cannot exclude longer-term destabilization, reinforcing the avoid-maintenance principle and the need for vigilant short-term monitoring only [^1113m7t9].

> I should also acknowledge real-world practice gaps. Observational audits show antidepressants are commonly used outside guideline preferences, and antidepressant use is a frequent deviation from best-practice pathways, highlighting the importance of re-aligning prescribing with conservative, guideline-concordant algorithms in bipolar depression [^113Wd1Hx].

> Final synthesis: Earlier I entertained that BP-II monotherapy with an SSRI might be reasonable based on small studies, but let me be explicit after re-checking contemporary guidance and broader evidence — monotherapy is not recommended in BP-I and remains controversial and not first-line in BP-II; if an SSRI is used at all, it should be a second-line adjunct in carefully selected, non-mixed, non-rapid cycling cases after optimizing first-line agents such as quetiapine, lithium, lamotrigine, or lurasidone for acute bipolar depression, with planned short-term use and strict monitoring for switch, while first-line choices remain atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers per guideline hierarchies and primary care summaries [^111Vz1W6] [^115m8nwC] [^1173MmEE] [^1171DHch].

SSRIs are **not first-line** for bipolar depression due to limited efficacy and risk of mood switching [^115kt8Ce] [^1113m7t9]; they should be used only as adjuncts to mood stabilizers or antipsychotics, and never as monotherapy in bipolar I [^111Vz1W6] [^117V3BQe]. The risk of antidepressant-induced mania is lower with SSRIs than with TCAs [^112pUcJn] but **remains significant**, especially in bipolar I or with a history of switches [^112PDUaB] [^1113m7t9]. If used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor closely for mood elevation or rapid cycling [^111Vz1W6]; discontinue if switching occurs [^116gW6b1]. First-line treatments for bipolar depression are quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, or lamotrigine [^115m8nwC] [^1173MmEE] [^1171DHch]; SSRIs are reserved for refractory cases with careful monitoring [^116t5KN3].

## Efficacy of SSRIs in bipolar disorder

- **Limited efficacy**: SSRIs have modest efficacy in bipolar depression, with small effect sizes [^115kt8Ce] and inconsistent benefits across studies [^111o1c3H] [^111Vz1W6].

- **Adjunctive use**: SSRIs may be considered as adjuncts to mood stabilizers or antipsychotics in refractory cases, but are not first-line [^111Vz1W6] [^115kt8Ce] [^116t5KN3].

- **Monotherapy caution**: SSRIs should not be used as monotherapy in bipolar I due to high risk of mood destabilization [^111Vz1W6] [^117V3BQe] [^1118n2W1].

---

## Risks associated with SSRI use in bipolar disorder

- **Manic switch**: SSRIs can precipitate mania or hypomania [^112pUcJn] [^1113m7t9], especially in bipolar I or with prior antidepressant-induced switches [^111Vz1W6] [^112PDUaB].

- **Rapid cycling**: SSRIs may increase rapid cycling [^112PDUaB], particularly in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or mixed features [^111Vz1W6] [^112Sg7Jd].

- **Long-term instability**: Prolonged SSRI use [^112Sg7Jd] can worsen mood instability and increase episode frequency [^112PDUaB] [^111VS1on].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding SSRIs** |
|-|-|
| CANMAT/ISBD 2018 | - Second-line adjunctive therapy with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics <br/> - Avoid monotherapy in bipolar I <br/> - Use cautiously in bipolar II [^111Vz1W6] |
| VA/DoD 2023 | - Insufficient evidence to recommend SSRIs as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for acute bipolar depression [^117V3BQe] [^116t5KN3] |
| Japanese Expert Consensus 2020 | - Not strongly recommended due to risk of manic switch and rapid cycling <br/> - Use cautiously if necessary [^112PDUaB] |

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Bipolar I disorder**: Avoid SSRI monotherapy; consider only as adjuncts with close monitoring [^111Vz1W6] [^117V3BQe].

- **Bipolar II disorder**: SSRIs may be considered cautiously as adjuncts, but monitor for hypomanic switches [^111v14sJ] [^113CsjcN].

- **Rapid cycling or mixed features**: Avoid SSRIs due to high risk of mood destabilization [^111Vz1W6] [^112PDUaB].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** for manic or hypomanic symptoms [^111Vz1W6], rapid cycling, and mood instability [^112Sg7Jd]. Educate patients and caregivers on early signs of **mood switching or cycle acceleration** [^1118n2W1]. If manic or hypomanic symptoms or rapid cycling emerge, **discontinue the SSRI** [^116gW6b1].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Alternative pharmacological options include **first-line agents** — quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, and lamotrigine — preferred for bipolar depression [^115m8nwC] [^1173MmEE] [^1171DHch]. **Combination therapy** — a mood stabilizer plus an atypical antipsychotic — may be more effective than monotherapy in severe cases [^114aDL74] [^114Wpbuj].

SSRIs are **not first-line** for bipolar depression due to limited efficacy and risk of mood switching [^115kt8Ce] [^1113m7t9]; **use only as adjuncts** with careful monitoring [^111Vz1W6]. Prefer quetiapine, lurasidone, lithium, or lamotrigine [^115m8nwC], and **avoid SSRIs in rapid cycling or mixed features** [^112PDUaB].

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^112PDUaB]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Use of antidepressants was not strongly recommended for BP-I and BP-II, consistent with several treatment guidelines. This is due to the potential risk of antidepressant-induced switching to mania and rapid-cycling. In a within-individual comparison study in 3240 patients with bipolar disorder using the Swedish national registry, antidepressant monotherapy was associated with a three-fold increased risk of mania three months after the start of antidepressant treatment.

In a study conducted in 1994 using all available clinical trial data on selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or placebo, it was demonstrated that treatment-emergent manic switch was more frequently observed in bipolar patients treated with TCAs (14 out of 125 patients, 11.2%) than with SSRIs (9 out of 242 patients, 3.7%) or placebo (2 out of 48 patients, 4.2%). In a sub-analysis of the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, a higher frequency of mood episodes was reported in rapid cyclers who continued to take antidepressants in addition to a mood stabilizer, compared to those who discontinued.

In terms of antidepressants to be used, mirtazapine and escitalopram were ranked high as second-line treatments for BP-I, and escitalopram and sertraline for BP-II. In another expert consensus guideline, the first-line choices of antidepressants included bupropion and SSRIs for bipolar depression. However, only short-term venlafaxine monotherapy and long-term…

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and international society for bipolar disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Quetiapine (level 1), lithium (level 2), lamotrigine (level 2), and lurasidone (level 2) are all recommended as first-line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy. Lurasidone (level 1) and lamotrigine (level 2) are also recommended as first-line adjunctive treatments. Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of either of these medications.

- **Recommendations**: Recommendations regarding which first-line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient-specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/non-response or clinical features.

For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non-response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient had been taking lithium and either had a breakthrough acute bipolar depressive episode…

### Antidepressants for bipolar depression: A systematic review of randomized, controlled trials [^112pUcJn]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). High credibility.

This study reviewed the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression.

- **Method**: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. They searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety, and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, incorporating results from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycLIT, PSYNDEX, and LILACS. The main outcome measures were the proportion of patients who clinically responded to treatment and the rate of switching to mania.

- **Results**: Twelve randomized trials were included, with a total of 1,088 randomly assigned patients. Five trials compared one or more antidepressants with placebo; 75% of these patients were receiving either a mood stabilizer or an atypical antipsychotic. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo and did not induce more switching to mania (the event rate for antidepressants was 3.8%, and for placebo, it was 4.7%). Six trials allowed comparison between two antidepressants. The rate of switching for tricyclic antidepressants was 10%, and for all other antidepressants combined, it was 3.2%.

- **Conclusions**: Antidepressants are effective in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. The trial data do not suggest that switching is a common early complication of treatment with antidepressants. It may be prudent to use a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor rather than a tricyclic antidepressant as first-line treatment.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option. The adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic, may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size.

This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants, as much of the historical focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new understanding, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation.

As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling. Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should NOT be used for the treatment of BDI depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (level 3) is an option to consider.

### Balanced efficacy, safety, and tolerability recommendations for the clinical management of bipolar disorder [^112sjotf]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide practical and clinically meaningful treatment recommendations that integrate clinical experience and research findings for each phase of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using electronic database search engines, such as Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews, with keywords including bipolar depression, mania, and treatment. All relevant randomized controlled trials were examined, along with review papers, meta-analyses, and book chapters known to the authors. Additionally, recommendations from accompanying papers in this supplement have been distilled and captured in the form of summary boxes. These findings, combined with the clinical experience of international researchers and clinicians experienced in treating mood disorders, formed the basis of the treatment recommendations within this paper.

- **Results**: The balance of clinical experience with evidence informed led to the development of practical clinical recommendations. These emphasize the importance of safety and tolerability alongside efficacy in the clinical management of bipolar disorder.

- **Conclusions**: This paper summarizes the treatment recommendations for each phase of bipolar disorder and provides additional evidence-based practical insights. It highlights the importance of safety and tolerability considerations, alongside efficacy information, giving these aspects equal merit.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111v14sJ]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Quetiapine is the only recommended first-line treatment for BDII depression (level 1). Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo and was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. This finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine surpassed placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. This discrepancy is likely due to the smaller sample size of BDII patients — only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials — thus providing less statistical power for BDII. Finally, open-label studies also suggest efficacy for adjunctive quetiapine (level 4).

- **Second-line treatments**: Second-line treatments include lithium, ideally at a serum level of 0.8–1.2 mEq/L (level 2), and the antidepressants sertraline (level 2) and venlafaxine (level 2), mainly for patients with pure (non-mixed) depression. Lamotrigine (level 2) is also recommended as a second-line agent despite conflicting evidence. ECT (level 3) can also be considered second-line and is a good option, particularly for treatment-refractory patients and those in need of rapid response.

### Use of asenapine in clinical practice for the management of bipolar mania [^111jHRnN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness associated with high levels of somatic morbidity, comorbidity, and mortality. Treatment guidelines for bipolar mania generally recommend initiating first-line therapy with a second-generation antipsychotic or mood stabilizer, either alone or in combination. Asenapine is a second-generation antipsychotic with a unique receptor binding profile, licensed for the treatment of manic episodes in adults with bipolar I disorder. 'Real-world' data are needed to complement evidence from clinical trials, in order to provide clinicians with pragmatic information regarding the likely risks and benefits of using a new agent in clinical practice. Evidence from real-world case reports demonstrates that, as in clinical trials, asenapine is effective in treating mania and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, whether used as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer. It has a rapid onset of antimanic effect, and an early improvement is associated with treatment outcome. Asenapine also shows promise in controlling depressive symptoms and clinically challenging mixed states. Asenapine has a favorable tolerability profile, compared with other first-line agents, having a minimal impact on weight and metabolic parameters. Asenapine should be considered a first-line treatment option for adults with bipolar I disorder.

### Receptor targets for antidepressant therapy in bipolar disorder: An overview [^111WxajN]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging issues in contemporary psychiatry. Currently, only quetiapine and the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are officially approved by the FDA for this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain relatively elusive. We performed a complete and systematic review to identify agents with definite positive or negative results concerning efficacy, followed by a second systematic review to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of these agents.

- **Efficacy predictors**: The comparison of properties suggests that the stronger predictors for antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression were norepinephrine alpha-1, dopamine D1, and histamine antagonism. This is followed by 5-HT2A, muscarinic, and dopamine D2 and D3 antagonism, and eventually by norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 5HT-1A agonism.

- **Role of serotonin reuptake**: Serotonin reuptake, which constitutes the cornerstone in unipolar depression treatment, does not seem to play a significant role in bipolar depression.

Our exhaustive review is compatible with a complex model with multiple levels of interaction between the major neurotransmitter systems, without a single target being either necessary or sufficient to elicit the antidepressant effect in bipolar depression.

### Effective agents in treating bipolar depression [^111cGB3k]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Individuals with bipolar disorder may spend about half of their time euthymic; however, recurring mood episodes are common and are predominated by depressive symptoms. Despite the prevalence of depression in bipolar disorder, evidence suggests that antidepressants are not likely to benefit most patients. Although lithium has long been the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder, it is not the most effective agent for treating bipolar depression. This review examines multiple pharmacologic options that should be considered by clinicians treating bipolar disorder.

### SSRIs as mood stabilizers for bipolar II disorder? A proof of concept study [^115oXkon]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

We have previously observed that the prescription of some antidepressant class drugs, particularly SSRIs, is associated with the attenuation of the number, duration, and severity of both high and low mood states in those with bipolar II disorder. This study examines whether SSRIs can act as mood stabilizers for bipolar II disorder.

- **Method**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study lasting 9 months with a sample of 10 patients who had not received prior treatment with any antidepressant, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer drug.

- **Results**: Treatment with SSRIs led to a significant reduction in depression severity, percentage of days depressed or high, and percentage of days impaired when compared with the placebo. There was no indication that SSRIs led to a worsening of the illness course.

- **Limitations**: Given the small sample size, and a focus on those with a rapid cycling condition, replication with a larger and more heterogeneous sample of individuals with bipolar disorder is required.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept study provides preliminary support for the potential utility of SSRIs in managing bipolar II disorder, with clear improvements in depression and impairment and some suggested benefit for hypomania.

### Safety and effectiveness of continuation antidepressant versus mood stabilizer monotherapy for relapse-prevention of bipolar II depression: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, prospective study [^114xR5DW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of continuation antidepressant versus mood stabilizer monotherapy for preventing depressive relapse in bipolar II disorder.

- **Methods**: Subjects aged ≥ 18 years with bipolar II depression (n = 129) were randomized to double-blind venlafaxine or lithium monotherapy for 12 weeks. Responders with a ≥ 50% reduction in depression score continued for an additional 6 months of relapse-prevention monotherapy. The primary outcome was depressive relapse during continuation monotherapy. Secondary outcomes included sustained response rate from initiation of treatment to study endpoint, relapse hazard, time to relapse, change in mania ratings, and frequency of treatment-emergent sub-syndromal hypomania and/or depressive episodes.

- **Results**: Venlafaxine produced a greater sustained response rate versus lithium (p < 0.0001); however, there was no difference in relapse rate for venlafaxine (7.5%) versus lithium (26.7%) (p = 0.079), relapse hazard (p = 0.073), or time to relapse (p = 0.090) between treatment conditions during continuation monotherapy. There were no group differences in mania rating scores over time and no difference in the frequency or duration of syndromal or sub-syndromal hypomanic episodes. More sub-syndromal depressive episodes occurred during lithium monotherapy (p = 0.03).

- **Limitations**: The sample size was limited by the lower sustained response rate for lithium versus venlafaxine, and the study was not specifically powered to detect differences in treatment-emergent hypomanic or depressive episodes between groups.

- **Conclusion**: Results suggest that continuation therapy with venlafaxine may offer benefits in terms of sustained response rate but does not differ significantly from lithium in terms of relapse prevention.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^111k89Ti]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

None of the choices were categorized as a first-line treatment for depressive episodes in elderly patients. Second-line treatment for depressive episodes in elderly patients included quetiapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), lithium monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.5), lamotrigine monotherapy (5.9 ± 2.6), combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.5), and combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.3).

Antidepressant use was categorized as a third-line treatment for depressive episodes in BP-I (3.8 ± 2.2) and a second-line treatment in BP-II (4.4 ± 2.3) [Table S1 Q3 and Q9]. When the respondents were asked to rate the use of adjunctive antidepressants concomitantly with an ongoing mood stabilizer for persistent depressive episodes, no specific antidepressant was categorized as a first-line treatment for both BP-I and BP-II [Table S1 Q4 and Q10]. The second-line treatment included mirtazapine (5.4 ± 2.6) and escitalopram (5.3 ± 2.7) for BP-I, and escitalopram (5.7 ± 2.7), sertraline (5.5 ± 2.6), and mirtazapine (5.5 ± 2.6) for BP-II.

### Current management of bipolar affective disorder: is it reflective of the BAP guidelines [^113Wd1Hx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

In October 2003, the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) published evidence-based guidelines on the management of bipolar disorder. The aim of this study was to assess whether these guidelines could serve as a foundation for examining clinical decisions and the extent to which practice aligns with the guidelines. Case notes of outpatients with bipolar disorder were reviewed to determine demographic details and treatment recommendations.

The management of affective episodes was evaluated and compared with the BAP guidelines. In 84 subjects, 224 affective episodes were identified. Treatment was consistent with the BAP guidelines in 72% of episodes. Mania was more likely to be managed in accordance with guidelines than depression or mixed episodes. The use of antidepressant medication was the most likely intervention to deviate from recommendations. Reasons for treatments at odds with the guidelines were identified.

Our study demonstrates that clinical practice among a range of psychiatrists broadly reflects the guidelines issued by the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP). The BAP guidelines offer a practical and auditable basis for the short- and long-term treatment of bipolar affective disorder.

### The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for treatment of bipolar disorder: A summary [^112neDEG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology has provided a review of the research evidence and clinical experience in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has produced guidelines that offer practical advice to clinicians for the day-to-day management of this challenging condition. The recommended enhancement of routine care may increase adherence to treatment, particularly if the patient is involved in the choice of medication, potentially leading to lower overall morbidity. This guidance is timely as awareness of the specific needs of bipolar patients is growing, and there is an increased choice of effective treatments for all phases of the illness.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^115Xvdsm]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 DoD/VA guidelines examine medical management for bipolar disorder, particularly concerning maintenance therapy. These guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of other first-generation antipsychotics, other second-generation antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants (including valproate) as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### Short-term fluoxetine monotherapy for bipolar type II or bipolar NOS major depression - low manic switch rate [^112hZRRw]. Bipolar Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the initial treatment of bipolar type II (BP II) major depressive episode (MDE) recommend using either a mood stabilizer alone or a combination of a mood stabilizer plus a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). This recommendation is the result of concern over antidepressant-induced manic switch episodes. However, recent evidence suggests that the manic switch rate may be low in BP II MDE during SSRI therapy.

As part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse-prevention study of fluoxetine monotherapy in BP II MDE, 37 patients received open-label fluoxetine 20 mg every day for up to 8 weeks. Outcome measures included the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D 17) rating and the Young Mania Rating (YMR) scale.

Eleven of 23 patients (48%) who completed 8 weeks of fluoxetine treatment showed a HAM-D 17 reduction of ≥ 50%, while 14 (38%) of all treated patients had ≥ 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D 17 score. Using a conservative YMR score of ≥ 8 to identify hypomanic symptoms, the frequency of patients with YMR score ≥ 8 during fluoxetine did not differ from that seen during the screen and baseline period. Only three patients (7.3%) had symptoms suggestive of hypomania, and only one patient stopped treatment because of a rapid mood swing into depression.

Fluoxetine was given at a fixed dose of 20 mg every day. Fluoxetine was prescribed in an open-label manner, and the sample size was limited.

These observations support the findings of a low manic switch rate during fluoxetine treatment in BP II MDE.

### Safety and efficacy of adjunctive second-generation antidepressant therapy with a mood stabiliser or an atypical antipsychotic in acute bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials [^115kt8Ce]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Although mania and hypomania define bipolar disorder, depressive episodes are more common and impairing, with few proven treatments. Adjunctive therapy with second-generation antidepressants is widely used to treat acute bipolar depression, but their efficacy and safety remain controversial.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 31, 2016, for randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of second-generation antidepressants adjunctive to a mood stabiliser or an antipsychotic in patients with acute bipolar depression. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was a change in clinician-rated depressive symptom score; secondary outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission, treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, and tolerability (using dropout rates as a proxy). We used pooled random-effects models, subgroup comparisons, and meta-regression for analyses. We made subgroup comparisons based on mood stabiliser or antipsychotic treatment and conducted meta-regression examining trial duration.

- **Findings**: We identified six trials representing 1,383 patients with bipolar depression. Second-generation antidepressants were associated with a small but significant improvement in clinician-rated depressive symptom score (standardised mean differences 0.165 [95% CI 0.051–0.278], p = 0.004). However, clinical response and remission rates did not significantly improve.

Monotherapy with venlafaxine (level 2) or fluoxetine (level 3) are second-line options.

- **Venlafaxine**: In a small 6-month RCT in patients with BDII who responded acutely to venlafaxine or lithium without hypomanic switch, there was a trend for lower rates of relapse into depression for patients treated with venlafaxine. Further, the rate of sustained response was significantly greater in those who continued venlafaxine compared to those who continued lithium. No hypomanic episodes occurred in either group.

- **Fluoxetine**: In a 50-week RCT, the mean time to relapse into depression was significantly longer for fluoxetine than for lithium or placebo. Patients had responded acutely to open-label fluoxetine, making the sample enriched for fluoxetine response. Hypomanic episodes occurred in a similarly low frequency in the three groups. In a separate small 6-month placebo-controlled trial, there was a statistical trend for lower relapse rates with fluoxetine compared to placebo. Finally, a post hoc analysis of a large 12-month placebo-controlled trial found that response rates to fluoxetine were similar in BDII and MDD. However, it did not report whether fluoxetine was superior to placebo in BDII.

Divalproex (level 4), carbamazepine (level 3), escitalopram (level 3), other antidepressants (level 3), and risperidone (mainly for prevention of hypomania) (level 4) may be considered as third-line options.

There are insufficient data to make a specific recommendation on other agents that require further study.

### Antidepressants in bipolar disorder: The case for caution [^111VS1on]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

The 2002 American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder recommended more conservative use of antidepressants. This change, in comparison with previous APA guidelines, has been criticized, especially from some groups in Europe. The Munich group, in particular, has published a critique of assumptions underlying the conservative recommendations of the recent APA treatment guidelines.

In this paper, we re-examine the argument put forward by the Munich group and demonstrate that, indeed, conceptually and empirically, there is a strong rationale for a cautious approach to antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, consistent with, and perhaps even stronger than, the APA guidelines. This rationale is based on support for the following four propositions:

- **Risk of mood-cycling**: The risk of antidepressant-induced mood-cycling is high.

- **Prevention of suicide and mortality**: Antidepressants have not been shown to definitively prevent completed suicides and reduce mortality, whereas lithium has.

- **Efficacy in acute treatment and relapse prevention**: Antidepressants have not been shown to be more effective than mood stabilizers in acute bipolar depression and have been shown to be less effective than mood stabilizers in preventing depressive relapse in bipolar disorder.

- **Effectiveness of mood stabilizers**: Mood stabilizers, especially lithium and lamotrigine, have been shown to be effective in acute and prophylactic treatment of bipolar depressive episodes.

We therefore draw three conclusions from this interpretation of the evidence:

- **Risks of mania and bipolar illness worsening**: There are significant risks of mania and long-term worsening of bipolar illness with antidepressants.

- **General recommendation**: Antidepressants should generally be used with caution in the management of bipolar disorder.

### Adjunctive antidepressants for the acute treatment of bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o1c3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significant functional impairment and disease burden. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression have long been a subject of debate.

- **Aims**: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness, risk of mood switching, and tolerability of adjunctive antidepressants in acute bipolar depression compared to using mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone.

- **Method**: Multiple databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, including open-label and double-blinded studies, for patients aged 18 or older with acute bipolar depression. The efficacy and adverse events in those who used adjunctive antidepressants versus those who did not were compared. Risk of bias and outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This study has PROSPERO registration CRD42016037701.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Adjunctive antidepressants showed no significant effect on improving response rate (RR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.98–1.23). Subgroup analysis revealed that adjunctive antidepressants with antipsychotics had a small but significantly better response rate compared to antipsychotics alone, a finding not observed with adjunctive antidepressants with mood stabilizers. However, this finding was limited by studies predominantly using olanzapine as the antipsychotic medication. Adjunctive antidepressants had no clinically significant impact, but a small statistically significant impact, on improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.13, 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.02). There was no association with increased mood switch (RR = 0.97).

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: Revised second edition — recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^11253K1E]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and target of treatment for bipolar disorder. The second version, like the first, is based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, like previous clinical practice guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making for practitioners. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers.

The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed but selective qualitative review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence was rated.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is not surprising that most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for clinicians regarding optimal next steps for non- or partial-responders, as well as those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this, and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we find it appropriate to begin a discussion on the quality of the data that some experts in the field might consider when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations.

We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer very different sequences. However, we believe the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, potentially sparking discussions of other options in the literature. Additionally, these suggestions may provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the wide range of quality in the data and clinical principles upon which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option would be outside the scope of this manuscript.

### Effective agents in treating mania [^1118Ag4D]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents for bipolar mania since the American Psychiatric Association last revised its guidelines for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Meta-analyses of the available data show that, of the medications that are efficacious, rates of efficacy are similar, but side effects vary. When determining which drug is best for individual patients, clinicians must consider safety and tolerability in addition to efficacy.

### Atypical antipsychotic augmentation of mood stabilizer therapy in bipolar disorder [^114Wpbuj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Although monotherapy with lithium or divalproex is the recommended initial therapy for bipolar disorder, these agents are associated with prolonged favorable outcomes in only 30% of patients. Increasingly, the medical literature demonstrates that augmentation of mood stabilizers with atypical antipsychotics is a more effective therapy. This form of combination therapy is recommended as first-line treatment for severe bipolar mania. Recent clinical studies have shown that augmentation therapy with the atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone is effective in long-term maintenance treatment. Preliminary evidence is emerging that the use of atypicals with mood stabilizers can help control the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. The atypical antipsychotics also have relatively mild side effect profiles, although augmentation therapy with some antipsychotics and mood stabilizers has been associated with excessive weight gain.

### Improving outcomes in patients with bipolar depression: A comprehensive review [^1154gQJU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Only three medications are currently approved in the US for acute bipolar depression: two atypical antipsychotics and a combination atypical antipsychotic-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Metabolic, neurologic, and hormonal adverse events are associated with all of the atypical antipsychotics approved for this indication. However, these agents differ in their propensity to cause weight gain or other side effects that significantly impact a patient's physical health and ability to function. The selection of medication, which may also include a mood stabilizer as well as other forms of treatment, will affect the outcome. It is important to design treatment based on individual needs. Evidence suggests that the collaborative care model, which incorporates individualized systematic treatment, may be more appropriate for the management of bipolar depression than the acute care model.

### Bipolar disorder maintenance treatment: Monitoring effectiveness and safety [^114gzNYy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. The goal of treatment is to shorten or prevent mood episodes without increasing cycle frequency, thereby extending the length of well periods. Treatment guidelines recommend mood stabilizers as first-line medications, and several atypical antipsychotics are also approved as monotherapy or as adjuncts to mood stabilizers for maintenance treatment. Combination therapy with two mood stabilizers, or with a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic, may be necessary to achieve or maintain remission of the patient's symptoms.

When treating patients with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics during the maintenance phase, physicians should systematically monitor for adverse effects, particularly weight gain and tolerability issues, and address those issues promptly. This approach can enhance treatment adherence and improve patient outcomes.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115AZncF]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Second-line therapies include olanzapine, which, despite being effective in preventing mood episodes, is considered a second-line treatment due to safety concerns such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone, either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, has shown efficacy in preventing mood or manic episodes but not depressive episodes. It was noted that oral risperidone adjunctive therapy over six months was superior in preventing mood episodes and mania, but not depression.

Carbamazepine has not been evaluated in large placebo-controlled trials, yet active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone was more effective than placebo in preventing mood or manic episodes but less effective than olanzapine. Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy has demonstrated efficacy in preventing mood or manic episodes, although data on its effectiveness for acute treatment remain conflicted.

Lurasidone adjunctive therapy showed a trend for superiority in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode, with significant differentiation from placebo. This suggests that lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be suitable for patients who have responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behavior, violence, and safety threat to others, as well as suicide risk, especially in those with mixed features. Clinicians should evaluate the degree of insight and the patient's ability to adhere to treatment, any comorbidity (including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to the clinical presentation), and the availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting, such as ambulatory or inpatient care.

Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition, although, even in these cases, symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis. Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms, such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use/abuse, or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD), it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring the patient.

### Antidepressant monotherapy for bipolar type II major depression [^115TjSS1]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar type II (BP II) disorder is thought to be distinct from BP I disorder on genetic and biological grounds, and it is not merely a milder form of the illness. It affects 1.5–2.5% of the US adult population and is characterized by highly recurrent depressive episodes with substantial morbidity from alcoholism and non-affective psychopathology. BP II disorder has a higher suicide rate than either BP I or unipolar depression. Treatment recommendations for BP II depression are based on concerns over drug-induced manic-switch episodes and suggest using either a mood stabilizer alone or a combination of an SSRI plus a mood stabilizer. Recent evidence, however, indicates that the rate of manic switch episodes may be modest in BP II patients. Recent studies have provided evidence that antidepressant monotherapy may be an effective initial and long-term treatment for BP II major depression with a low manic-switch rate.

- **Methods**: In this article, we review the recent literature on BP II disorder, with a focus on the treatment of BP II major depression.

- **Results**: We present a summary of data from recent studies by our group and others, indicating that antidepressant monotherapy for BP II depression may be safe and effective with a low manic-switch rate.

- **Conclusion**: Antidepressant monotherapy may be beneficial for some patients with BP II major depression.

### Treating bipolar disorder: Monotherapy versus combination therapy [^113sTUb2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Combination treatments for patients with bipolar disorder can be potentially advantageous due to therapeutic synergy. However, combining treatments can also increase the possibility of drug interactions and adverse effects. Clinicians should evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the combination for each individual patient. Physicians should exercise caution when treating patients with a combination of medications and strive to use monotherapy when feasible.

### Balancing benefits and harms of treatments for acute bipolar depression [^115ZDjwt]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is more pervasive than mania but has fewer evidence-based treatments. Using data from multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, we assessed the number needed to treat (NNT) for response and the number needed to harm (NNH) for selected side effects for older and newer acute bipolar depression treatments.

- **Results**: The two older FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) and quetiapine (QTP) monotherapy, were efficacious (response NNT = 4 for OFC, NNT = 6 for QTP) but similarly likely to yield harms (OFC weight gain NNH = 6; QTP sedation/somnolence NNH = 5). Commonly used unapproved agents, such as lamotrigine monotherapy and adjunctive antidepressants, tended to be well-tolerated (with double-digit NNHs), although this advantage was at the cost of inadequate efficacy (response NNT = 12 for lamotrigine, NNT = 29 for antidepressants). In contrast, the newly approved agent lurasidone was not only efficacious (response NNT = 5 for monotherapy, NNT = 7 as adjunctive therapy) but also had enhanced tolerability (NNH = 15 for akathisia [monotherapy], NNH = 16 for nausea [adjunctive]). Although adjunctive armodafinil appeared well tolerated, its efficacy in bipolar depression has not been consistently demonstrated in randomized controlled trials.

- **Limitations**: NNT and NNH are categorical metrics. Only selected NNHs were assessed, with limited generalizability of efficacy (versus effectiveness) studies.

In conclusion, for acute bipolar depression, older approved treatments may have utility.

- **Efficacy ratings for pharmacological agents used as maintenance therapy**: Importance of naturalistic and cohort studies. Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up time-frames while, for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

	- Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide.

	- Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Many agents recommended for management of acute manic or depressive episodes have prophylactic efficacy. Generally, medications that have been found to be effective in the acute phase should be continued during the maintenance phase. However, there are exceptions to this: the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy has not been examined systematically in large double-blind placebo-controlled trials; hence, long-term antidepressant use is not recommended, especially in light of the concerns about potential risk of manic/hypomanic switch and mood instability. However, in the subgroups of patients who have responded to combination treatment and are stable, preliminary evidence suggests that withdrawal of antidepressants may contribute to destabilization.

Clinical trials have shown that many atypical antipsychotics are effective in preventing relapse of mood episodes; with many agents, this efficacy is related to prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. However, many of these trials have been conducted in patients with an index manic episode and, given that the polarity of an index episode predicts the polarity of relapse, depressive relapse rates in placebo groups in such studies have been low, compromising the statistical power to test the efficacy of these agents in prevention of depressive relapses. Thus, the efficacy of many of these agents in preventing depressive relapses remains unknown.

### Atypical antipsychotics in bipolar depression: Potential mechanisms of action [^115GjEnb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

"Conventional" antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), bupropion, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are not recommended as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Although they are likely to provide effective symptom relief in combination with mood stabilizers, the risk of precipitating a switch to mania often complicates their use, even as combination therapy. Recently, two psychotropic medications approved for treating acute mania, olanzapine and quetiapine, have also been shown to possess antidepressant activity without destabilizing mood and, as such, are potential mood stabilizers.

This article aims to review the mechanism of action of conventional antidepressants and newer agents effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. A number of mechanisms have been postulated to play a role in the effective treatment of bipolar depression, including targets as diverse as serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and various second messenger signaling pathways. A review of the data reveals an important point of commonality among antidepressant treatments, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Antidepressant treatments, such as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, and electroconvulsive therapy, induce a reduction of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Both olanzapine and quetiapine not only are antagonists at this receptor but also induce downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. It is possible that the antidepressant efficacy of these agents is mediated by this receptor.

Patients with bipolar disorder spend more time depressed than manic, but fewer clinical trials have been conducted investigating treatments for bipolar depression compared to bipolar mania. The olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lurasidone are the only FDA-approved treatments for bipolar depression. Clinical trials of these drugs show similar efficacy but different side effect profiles. Clinicians, therefore, should consider possible adverse events and individual patient characteristics when selecting treatments.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^117ME6XM]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder have been based on solid evidence to reflect the results of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. However, these conventional treatment guidelines do not always address challenging situations in the real world because of probable discrepancies between research and clinical settings. Indeed, participants in clinical trials do not necessarily represent patients that physicians usually encounter in clinical practice; strict selection criteria limit generalizability. Furthermore, treatment guidelines often fail to provide clear treatment recommendations on clinically important issues that are nevertheless difficult to examine, and a high level of evidence is lacking, such as depressive episodes with mixed features.

A consensus guideline by experts in the field may fill this gap in the literature. The Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology (JSCNP) is the largest academic society in the field of neuropsychopharmacology in Japan. The JSCNP has a board certification system in which psychiatrists are certified as experts in the field based on their academic activities and written examination scores regarding their professional expertise. A total of 277 psychiatrists have been certified as of November 2019. The Medical Education Panel of the society has recently developed an expert consensus guideline for depression. Thus, in this article, we aimed to create an expert consensus guideline regarding the treatment of bipolar disorders I and II (BP-I and BP-II), especially with regard to…

### Rationale for using lithium in combination with other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder [^112K6B1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex illness, and no single agent has been proven in randomized, placebo-controlled trials to effectively prevent and/or control all aspects of the illness — acute mania, rapid cycling, and breakthrough depression. However, for the most important issue, prophylaxis of episodes, lithium has more evidence of efficacy than any other agent. Like lithium, typical antipsychotics, carbamazepine, divalproex, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine are effective in the treatment of mania. Carbamazepine, divalproex, and olanzapine seem effective in preventing manic episodes but, like lithium, are less effective in preventing depression.

Few trials have been conducted in the more difficult-to-treat characteristics of bipolar disorder, specifically rapid cycling and breakthrough depression. For patients with rapid cycling, carbamazepine or divalproex therapy may improve symptoms, but only lamotrigine has been shown to reduce cycling, mostly in the bipolar II group, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. For the treatment of depressive episodes, lithium and olanzapine have shown modest efficacy in controlled trials, and among the mood stabilizers, lamotrigine has the most robust effect. Because manic symptoms may respond best to one agent and depressive symptoms to another, combination therapy may be the optimal treatment for many patients with bipolar disorder. For example, lithium augmentation may improve overall response rates to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex, and the lithium-lamotrigine combination should provide effective prevention of both manic and depressive episodes.

### Pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression: an update [^1154Cds8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar affective disorder is a virulent illness characterized by high rates of recurrence, disability, social impairment, and suicide. Although manic or hypomanic episodes define the disorder, depressive episodes are more numerous and less responsive to treatment. Initial depressive episodes are often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed initiation of therapy with mood stabilizers. This delay increases the likelihood of treatment-emergent affective switches on antidepressant monotherapy.

The empirical basis for selecting treatments for bipolar depression is weak. Only the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Conventional mood stabilizers are preferred for first-line therapies, although atypical antipsychotics are increasingly used, with FDA approval of quetiapine pending. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bupropion, are indicated when mood stabilizers are ineffective and for "breakthrough" depressions.

In the context of bipolar depression, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any agents in older adults with acute bipolar depression. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest the efficacy of quetiapine (level 2) and lurasidone (level 2) monotherapy; hence, these are recommended as first-line options. However, in older adults, due to concerns about the side effects of atypical antipsychotics, clinicians may consider lithium or lamotrigine first based on their efficacy in adult populations, although the evidence of efficacy is limited in older adults (lithium, level 4; lamotrigine, level 4). Divalproex (level 4), aripiprazole (level 4), and carbamazepine (level 4) are considered third-line options. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (level 4) is an important consideration in treatment-resistant cases, for suicidal patients, or for those with inadequate food or fluid intake.

Use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder remains controversial, and there have been no studies in older-age bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, antidepressants are frequently used in this population, with over 40% of patients receiving them. Antidepressants with lower manic switch potential, such as SSRIs and bupropion, used in combination with mood stabilizers, may benefit selected patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to other agents with a stronger geriatric evidence base. Possible medication interactions with ongoing medications for non-psychiatric conditions must always be considered.

In terms of maintenance, the choice of agents should be based on what has proven effective in the acute phase. Recommended options with geriatric efficacy data include lithium (level 2).

### Monotherapy versus combined treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder [^1174gqH7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association guidelines for treating bipolar disorder recommend combination therapies to treat patients experiencing severe acute manic or mixed episodes and breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy. Combination therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute manic states include the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole in combination with lithium or divalproex; for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination; and for maintenance treatment, quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate.

When combining medications for the management of patients with bipolar disorders, physicians face a potentially complex treatment strategy. Available agents have different mechanisms of action, routes of metabolism and excretion, therapeutic effects, and side effects. Combining treatments can be advantageous owing to therapeutic synergy; however, the liability is an increased possibility of adverse effects. The decision to use a combination therapy should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication and their specific combination for individual patients.

These guidelines are organized into eight sections, including the introduction. Foundations of management (Section 2) discusses the epidemiology of BD, screening and diagnostic considerations, the importance of monitoring risk for suicide, the chronic disease management model, and patient‐centred care (including shared decision making), as well as the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment.

Additional information on presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania (Section 3) and depression (Section 4) is reviewed and includes descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. The importance of long‐term maintenance treatment and promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hierarchical rankings of treatment options, are discussed in Section 5. An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are presented in Section 6.

The management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidity, are each discussed in Section 7. Finally, the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments are provided in Section 8.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^115yUNPU]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

There are several limitations to be noted in this study. First, although highly practical, an expert consensus guideline is considered to provide less evidence than randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Second, psychosocial interventions were not evaluated in this survey since they were beyond our scope in the present study, although their relevance should be highly acknowledged in patients with bipolar disorder. Third, there may not be enough information to choose the appropriate treatment options in some questions. Heterogeneity of the patients should be acknowledged when the recommendations in this guideline are translated into clinical practice. Fourth, the generalizability of our findings may be limited, as all of the experts who participated in this study were Japanese. Moreover, some of the medications listed in the questionnaire are not available outside of Japan. Fifth, although we obtained responses from over 100 specialists, the response rate was relatively low. Finally, our distinction into three categories [i.e. 1–3 (disagree), 4–6 (neutral), and 7–9 (agree)] and methods of analyses are somewhat arbitrary.

In conclusion, the Japanese experts highly recommend lithium monotherapy and combination therapy for both bipolar disorders I and II, regardless of illness phases or episodes. The use of antidepressants remains controversial. Although antipsychotic drugs are considered to be reasonable choices in case of treatment failure or intolerable side effects, clinicians are advised to carefully monitor potentially serious side effects, particularly during long-term use.

### Evidence-based guidelines for treating bipolar disorder: Revised third edition recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115Xmr49]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and targets of treatment for bipolar disorder. The third version is explicitly based on the available evidence and presented, like previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making for practitioners. It may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and assist in audits. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the corresponding evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas, considering the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from these participants.

The best evidence from randomized controlled trials and, where available, observational studies employing quasi-experimental designs was used to evaluate treatment options. The strength of recommendations has been described using the GRADE approach. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for using medicines in the short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention, and stopping treatment. The use of medication is integrated with a coherent approach to psychoeducation and behaviour change.

### An update on antidepressant use in bipolar depression [^113NvebT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of depression in people with bipolar disorder remains a clinical challenge. The role of antidepressant medication in treating bipolar depression has been controversial. While early studies and meta-analyses supported a role for antidepressant medication, more recent, high-quality randomized controlled trials in bipolar depression have generally not demonstrated efficacy for antidepressant medications.

Although the risk of affective switch and long-term destabilization remains a concern when using antidepressant medications in bipolar disorder, the magnitude of this risk has been difficult to ascertain with confidence. Maintenance use of antidepressant medication has generally not demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Future studies should explore the patient characteristics and response patterns that predict a more favorable response profile to antidepressants among patients with bipolar disorder so that the medications can be rationally used in those who are most likely to benefit.

### Switch to mania after acute antidepressant treatment for bipolar depression: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1113m7t9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Expert consensus and clinical guidelines recommend the use of antidepressants as a second-line option in bipolar depression, specifically as add-on therapy alongside mood stabilisers or second-generation antipsychotics. Our findings support this recommendation. Although sensitivity analyses did not show differences from the main analysis, the monotherapy subgroup included fewer studies, offering less robust evidence compared to the larger and more consistent data set for add-on therapy.

Importantly, our study focuses on the acute treatment of bipolar depression, which raises further considerations. One question is whether the duration of the included RCTs is sufficient to detect switches to mania, as delayed or rare events may be underestimated in short-term trials. According to the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) nomenclature task force, a switch to mania after antidepressant treatment must occur at least two weeks after treatment initiation to be considered treatment-emergent. In line with this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the study with a shorter duration, which did not alter the main findings.

While this confirms that our data meet the minimum threshold to detect early switches, the longest studies included in our analysis lasted 10 weeks. Thus, our results provide reassurance regarding the risk of switch to mania within the acute treatment window, but the long-term risk remains uncertain. Further long-term RCTs or observational studies are needed to evaluate the safety of continued antidepressant use beyond the acute phase.

Armodafinil and modafinil act as third-line agents for bipolar I depression. They are included in the summary of evidence for this category.

Ancillary treatments, such as adjunctive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (level 2), N-acetylcysteine (level 3), and light therapy (level 3), including bright light delivered midday (level 3), are also recommended as third-line treatment options to use adjunctively with other medications. There may be additional benefits to using light therapy in combination with total sleep deprivation (level 2), although there is little clinical experience with this technique.

While there is evidence from several small studies that intravenous ketamine (level 3) is a highly effective and fast-acting antidepressant, due to its invasive nature, short duration of effect, and lack of long-term safety data, it has been relegated to a third-line treatment. It is recommended for patients with severe symptoms or significant suicidal ideation for whom other treatments have been unsuccessful. In clinical situations that prioritize rapidity of response to treatment, ketamine may be considered earlier in the treatment order. However, clinicians need to be aware that the data for efficacy are limited and the effects do not appear to last long. Furthermore, there are case reports of manic switch, but the clinical trial data have not provided any confirmatory evidence. Additionally, clinicians need to be aware of the potential for ketamine abuse, especially in domiciliary use situations.

Similarly, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first-line treatment for hypomanic episodes, depressive episodes, and the maintenance phase in BP-II, while combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was endorsed for hypomanic episodes in BP-II. These findings are generally consistent with the Korean expert consensus guideline, except for the strategy for hypomania where only mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic monotherapies were recommended. However, due to inadequate evidence, conventional treatment guidelines other than the CANMAT and ISBD guidelines did not include specific treatment recommendations for BP-II. In addition, the CANMAT and ISBD guidelines did not include specific treatment recommendations for hypomania, since the reported studies had significant weaknesses, including small sample sizes and mixed samples. This is also the case for the acute treatment of depressive episodes with mixed features, acute treatment of manic and depressive episodes in the elderly, and the maintenance treatment for rapid cycling bipolar disorder. Notably, there were no first-line treatment options for geriatric bipolar disorder in the present study, which may reflect physicians' struggle to manage this challenging condition with psychopharmacological treatment. Further investigations are clearly needed to fill this gap in the literature.

### Clinical highlights in bipolar depression: focus on atypical antipsychotics [^111p7m8B]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Despite the considerable burden of bipolar depression, the treatment of this debilitating phase of bipolar disorder is suboptimally addressed by currently available pharmacologic options. Consequently, there is a need for the development of new treatment options with enhanced efficacy and tolerability. Evidence of antidepressant efficacy for some of the atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar depression has recently emerged.

- **Study findings**: The findings of a large-scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study of olanzapine alone and in combination with fluoxetine, and a similar study of quetiapine monotherapy, suggest that some of the atypical antipsychotics may be efficacious in treating depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar I disorder.

- **Subpopulation analyses**: Subpopulation analyses suggest that quetiapine monotherapy and the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination appear to be effective in treating depression in patients with a rapid-cycling course.

- **Comparison of treatments**: The magnitude of improvement in depressive symptoms in the bipolar I population appears to be larger for quetiapine monotherapy compared with either olanzapine or olanzapine plus fluoxetine; however, the limitations of such a cross-study comparison are acknowledged.

- **Tolerance and side effects**: Both olanzapine monotherapy and combination therapy, as well as quetiapine monotherapy, were well tolerated. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent mania was low and comparable with placebo in both studies. Somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, and elevated nonfasting glucose and cholesterol levels were more commonly reported in patients treated with olanzapine.

- **Pharmacological treatment of manic episodes**: There are a range of strategies that have been investigated for use in mania, including lithium, divalproex, other anticonvulsants, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and other agents and therapies. These treatments have been evaluated using the criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability. The evidence for efficacy and the recommendations for treating acute mania are summarized in a hierarchical table of first and second-line treatments recommended for the management of acute mania.

The first and second-line agents are listed hierarchically, taking into consideration not only their efficacy for acute mania but also their efficacy in preventing mania or depression, treating acute bipolar depression, safety/tolerability, and the risk of treatment-emergent switch. The implication of this hierarchical recommendation is that those listed higher up in the table should be considered first before moving on to the next on the list, unless other factors such as a history of previous non-response or patient's preferences preclude such a strategy in a given patient.

Monotherapy and combination therapy are listed separately as first-line treatments for acute mania. This does not mean that all monotherapy agents should be tried first before considering combination therapy. It is suggested that the treating clinician decides whether to treat a given patient with monotherapy or combination therapy.

Of note, when a treatment is listed as a monotherapy, it implies that it may be used on its own or in combination with other ongoing treatments, even if there are no specific studies demonstrating the efficacy of that combination. In this situation, the assumption is that the previous ongoing treatment was partially effective, and the addition of the new agent will provide benefits in either an additive or synergistic manner. In contrast, agents specifically listed as adjunctive therapy may have no evidence for efficacy as monotherapy and/or may have safety concerns if prescribed as monotherapy (e.g. antidepressants), and are only recommended for use in combination with other evidence-based agents.

As with previous editions, these guidelines also have a "not recommended" category which includes treatments that have clearly been shown to be ineffective in double-blind RCTs. Additionally, we have included another category called "no specific recommendation/agents that require further study" to list treatments with insufficient evidence or clinical experience to make a recommendation, or where there is reason to believe that negative trials failed due to methodological problems — especially when the results are inconsistent with what is expected based on the pharmacological properties of treatment and clinical experience. Inclusion in this category means the efficacy of these agents is unknown at this time.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^111gwfcd]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop a consensus guideline by certified experts of the Japanese Society of Clinical Neuropsychopharmacology on the psychopharmacological treatment for bipolar disorders I and II (BP‐I and BP‐II), in order to fill the gap in the literature and provide more concrete guidance for challenging and controversial real‐world situations.

- **Methods**: Experts were asked to assess treatment options regarding 19 clinical situations of bipolar disorder with a nine‐point Likert scale (one = "disagree" and nine = "agree"). According to the responses from 119 experts, the options were categorized into the first‐, second‐, and third‐line treatments.

- **Results**: For the treatment of BP‐I, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first‐line treatment for manic episodes (mean ± standard deviation score, 7.0 ± 2.2), depressive episodes (7.1 ± 2.0), and the maintenance phase (7.8 ± 1.8). Combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was endorsed for manic episodes (7.7 ± 1.7), depressive episodes with (7.1 ± 2.0) and without mixed features (6.9 ± 2.2), and the maintenance phase (6.9 ± 2.1). Similarly, in BP‐II, lithium monotherapy was categorized as a first‐line treatment for hypomanic episodes (7.3 ± 2.2), depressive episodes (7.0 ± 2.2), and the maintenance phase (7.3 ± 2.3), while combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was recommended for hypomanic episodes (6.9 ± 2.4). No antipsychotic monotherapy or antidepressant treatment was categorized as a first‐line treatment for any type of episode.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^114aDL74]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

- **First-line combination therapy**: Combination therapy with the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine (level 1), aripiprazole (level 2), risperidone (level 1), or asenapine (level 2) and lithium or divalproex is recommended as a first-line treatment option, offering greater efficacy than monotherapy with lithium or divalproex alone, especially in those with higher index severity.

In general, combination therapy is preferred over mood stabilizer monotherapy because clinical trials suggest that, on average, about 20% more patients will respond to combination therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest the benefit of combination therapy compared to atypical antipsychotic monotherapy, although there are fewer trials. Specifically, lithium plus quetiapine showed superiority to quetiapine alone. While there is also level 1 evidence for olanzapine combination therapy over olanzapine monotherapy, this is downgraded to second-line due to tolerability/safety concerns with olanzapine.

The decision to treat with one or a combination of available first-line agents should be informed by prior medication use, with treatment previously shown to be successful in managing symptoms preferred. Safety and tolerability factors for each medication, and clinical features predictive of better response (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices") should also be considered. In general, combination therapy is associated with more adverse events than monotherapy. Whenever possible, options should be discussed with the patient and/or their caregiver.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^116t5KN3]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bipolar disorder, more specifically concerning the management of acute bipolar depression, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of antidepressants to augment treatment with second-generation antipsychotics or mood stabilizers for acute bipolar depression.
