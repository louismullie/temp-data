## Question

Platelet transfusion thresholds in surgical patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about platelet transfusion thresholds in surgical patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including procedure types, bleeding risk, and patient populations. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline hierarchy. Next, I will extract and reconcile thresholds by scenario, noting where evidence is strong versus weak. After that, I need to consider special populations and platelet function testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-adapted approach and highlight knowledge gaps and research directions, ensuring I double-check conflicting statements and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't overgeneralize. We are dealing with surgical patients, which spans elective and emergency procedures, neuraxial and non-neuraxial surgery, trauma, obstetrics, and cardiac surgery, and we must distinguish prophylactic thresholds from therapeutic management of active bleeding, as well as account for platelet function and antiplatelet therapy, which can shift thresholds upward despite adequate counts [^117NXQuF] [^115xKJwz].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and guideline strength to anchor decisions. The 2025 AABB/ICTMG international guideline is the most authoritative, with high-credibility recommendations for major non-neuraxial surgery and several procedure-specific scenarios, while AABB 2015 and BCSH 2017 provide foundational but lower-certainty guidance, and trauma guidelines from ESA and AAST offer population-specific thresholds that differ from elective surgery due to dilutional coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction [^116E6TTo] [^116yj3xv] [^115gryNQ].

> I will now examine the core recommendation for major non-neuraxial surgery. The 2025 AABB/ICTMG guideline strongly recommends prophylactic platelet transfusion when the platelet count is less than 50 × 10⁹/L, and this is echoed by contemporary summaries and aligns with earlier AABB suggestions, albeit with upgraded certainty in 2025. I should confirm that this applies to adults with thrombocytopenia undergoing major surgery and not to nonthrombocytopenic patients, where transfusion is not recommended absent major hemorrhage [^116yj3xv] [^112SiCiN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neuraxial anesthesia. I initially thought the 50 × 10⁹/L threshold might suffice, but wait, I need to check neuraxial-specific guidance. The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology consensus advises substantially higher thresholds for epidural or spinal procedures, typically 80–100 × 10⁹/L, given the catastrophic risk of spinal hematoma, and notes the absence of RCTs to define a single optimal threshold, so I should correct myself and keep neuraxial thresholds separate from general surgical thresholds [^116E6TTo] [^115Wijbf].

> For low-risk bedside procedures, I should confirm whether transfusion is routinely indicated. The 2025 AABB/ICTMG guideline suggests that for CVC placement at compressible sites, transfusion is reasonable below 10 × 10⁹/L, and for low-risk interventional radiology procedures, a threshold around 20 × 10⁹/L is suggested, while for high-risk IR procedures, 50 × 10⁹/L is advised. Importantly, ESICM guidance for critically ill adults suggests against routine prophylaxis for many bedside procedures in the 10–50 × 10⁹/L range, reflecting very low certainty and the need to individualize based on anatomy, ultrasound, and operator skill [^116yj3xv] [^1115ZtWX] [^112v31uf].

> Now, I need to consider active bleeding and trauma, where thresholds diverge from elective surgery. Trauma guidelines suggest maintaining platelets above 50 × 10⁹/L in ongoing bleeding and above 100 × 10⁹/L in traumatic brain injury, acknowledging that much of the evidence is observational and confounded. Moreover, dilutional thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction are common in massive transfusion, so waiting for very low counts can be unsafe, and some data suggest early platelet transfusion may be beneficial even when admission counts are not profoundly low, though causality remains uncertain [^115gryNQ] [^113qeyEM] [^111s6hRE].

> Let me think about cardiac surgery specifically. I should confirm that routine prophylactic platelets are not recommended for nonthrombocytopenic patients on bypass. The 2025 AABB/ICTMG guideline advises against platelet transfusion in nonthrombocytopenic patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery without major hemorrhage, and instead supports selective transfusion for documented thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction with bleeding, with emerging data suggesting platelet function testing can reduce unnecessary platelet use in this setting [^116yj3xv] [^111NNp3V] [^114Disyz].

> For obstetric patients, I should double-check the thresholds. In preeclampsia or HELLP, platelet transfusion is recommended to raise the count above 50 × 10⁹/L before cesarean delivery, and for neuraxial anesthesia, professional bodies often use 80–100 × 10⁹/L due to hematoma risk, even though high-quality RCT evidence is lacking, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are essential [^112dqEuF] [^116E6TTo] [^115Wijbf].

> Next, I should review platelet function and antiplatelet therapy, because count alone can mislead. The ASA advises that platelet transfusion may be indicated despite an apparently adequate count if there is known or suspected platelet dysfunction, and in neurosurgery or high-stakes bleeding, some guidelines suggest considering platelet transfusion for bleeding attributed to aspirin, ideally guided by viscoelastic testing or point-of-care platelet function assays when available, though evidence quality varies [^117NXQuF] [^115Cqj3z] [^114Disyz].

> I need to ensure I incorporate the principle of risk-adapted, context-specific decision-making. The 2024 BSH bleeding risk assessment guideline explicitly warns against using platelet count alone to predict bleeding and recommends integrating the cause of thrombocytopenia, platelet function, and procedure-related bleeding risk, which reinforces a restrictive stance when risk is low and a lower threshold when consequences of bleeding are catastrophic [^116GNRY7].

> But wait, what about the quality of evidence underlying these thresholds. I should confirm that many surgical thresholds are based on low to very low certainty evidence. The Cochrane review of prophylactic platelets before surgery found insufficient evidence to recommend routine prophylaxis, and neuraxial thresholds remain unsupported by RCTs, so while guidelines converge on pragmatic cutoffs, shared decision-making and local protocols are crucial [^111XqUbn] [^111sCaMp].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I will double-check each element against guidelines. For major non-neuraxial surgery, transfuse if platelet count is less than 50 × 10⁹/L. For neuraxial procedures, aim for 80–100 × 10⁹/L when feasible. For CVC at compressible sites, consider transfusion below 10 × 10⁹/L. For low-risk IR procedures, consider 20 × 10⁹/L, and for high-risk IR, 50 × 10⁹/L. In active bleeding or trauma, maintain above 50 × 10⁹/L and above 100 × 10⁹/L in TBI. In nonthrombocytopenic cardiac surgery, avoid routine prophylaxis. And always individualize based on platelet function, antiplatelet therapy, anatomy, and operator experience, documenting the rationale when deviating from thresholds [^116yj3xv] [^116E6TTo] [^115gryNQ].

> Finally, I should identify knowledge gaps and correct a potential misstatement. I initially implied that the 2025 AABB/ICTMG guideline directly addressed antiplatelet therapy thresholds, but wait, I should verify. The 2025 guideline does not specify antiplatelet reversal thresholds, and the uncertain role of platelet transfusion in antiplatelet-associated intracranial hemorrhage remains unresolved, with mixed observational signals and no definitive RCT, so decisions should be individualized and ideally guided by viscoelastic or platelet function testing where available [^116yj3xv] [^115Cqj3z].

Platelet transfusion thresholds in surgical patients are **procedure- and risk-specific**: 50×10⁹/L for major non-neuraxial surgery [^116yj3xv], 80–100×10⁹/L for neuraxial procedures [^116E6TTo], and 10–20×10⁹/L for low-risk procedures (e.g. CVC, LP) [^116yj3xv] [^115wm2Gc]. For active bleeding, maintain **> 50×10⁹/L** [^113DJTxu]; for traumatic brain injury or neurosurgery, aim for **> 100×10⁹/L** [^1152v2BJ]. Routine transfusion is not indicated for nonthrombocytopenic patients undergoing cardiac surgery without major hemorrhage [^116yj3xv] [^111NNp3V]. Always individualize decisions based on platelet function, antiplatelet therapy, and patient-specific risk factors [^116GNRY7] [^117NXQuF].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended platelet threshold (×10⁹/l)** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Major non-neuraxial surgery | 50 | Strong recommendation [^116yj3xv] |
| Neuraxial procedures (epidural/spinal) | 80–100 | Expert consensus [^116E6TTo] [^115Wijbf] |
| Central venous catheter insertion | 10–20 | Weak recommendation [^116yj3xv] [^115wm2Gc] |
| Lumbar puncture | 40–50 | Weak recommendation [^116yj3xv] [^115wm2Gc] |
| Active bleeding (non-neurosurgical) | > 50 | Strong recommendation [^113DJTxu] |
| Traumatic brain injury or neurosurgery | > 100 | Strong recommendation [^1152v2BJ] |
| Cardiac surgery without major hemorrhage | No routine transfusion | Strong recommendation [^116yj3xv] [^111NNp3V] |

---

These thresholds reflect a **restrictive, risk-adapted approach** [^116yj3xv] that balances bleeding risk against transfusion harms, including infection, transfusion reactions, and resource use [^116E6TTo].

### How I use platelet transfusions [^115kpcev]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet transfusions are commonly administered for the prevention or treatment of bleeding in patients with acquired thrombocytopenia across a range of clinical contexts. Recent data, including randomized trials, have highlighted uncertainties in the risk-benefit balance of this therapy, which is the subject of this review. Hemovigilance systems report that platelets are the most frequently implicated component in transfusion reactions. There is considerable variation in platelet count increment after platelet transfusion, and limited evidence of efficacy for clinical outcomes, including prevention of bleeding. Bleeding events commonly occur despite the different policies for platelet transfusion prophylaxis. The underlying mechanisms of harm reported in randomized trials may be related to the role of platelets beyond hemostasis, including mediating inflammation. Research supports the implementation of a restrictive platelet transfusion policy. Research is needed to better understand the impact of platelet donation characteristics on outcomes, and to determine the optimal thresholds for platelet transfusion before invasive procedures or major surgery (eg, laparotomy). Platelet transfusion policies should move toward a risk-adapted approach that does not focus solely on platelet count.

### Prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count [^111XqUbn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with thrombocytopenia often require a surgical procedure. A low platelet count is a relative contraindication to surgery due to the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusions are used in clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in people with thrombocytopenia. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to surgery. Alternatives to platelet transfusion are also used prior surgery.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and safety of prophylactic platelet transfusions prior to surgery for people with a low platelet count.

Search Methods

We searched the following major data bases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), PubMed (e-publications only), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the Transfusion Evidence Library and ongoing trial databases to 11 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-RCTs and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), that met Cochrane EPOC (Effective Practice and Organisation of Care) criteria, that involved the transfusion of platelets prior to surgery (any dose, at any time, single or multiple) in people with low platelet counts. We excluded studies on people with a low platelet count who were actively bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for data collection. We were only able to combine data for two outcomes and we presented the rest of the findings in a narrative form.

Main Results

We identified five RCTs, all conducted in adults; there were no eligible non-randomised studies. Three completed trials enrolled 180 adults and two ongoing trials aim to include 627 participants. The completed trials were conducted between 2005 and 2009. The two ongoing trials are scheduled to complete recruitment by October 2019. One trial compared prophylactic platelet transfusions to no transfusion in people with thrombocytopenia in an intensive care unit (ICU). Two small trials, 108 participants, compared prophylactic platelet transfusions to other alternative treatments in people with liver disease. One trial compared desmopressin to fresh frozen plasma or one unit of platelet transfusion or both prior to surgery. The second trial compared platelet transfusion prior to surgery with two types of thrombopoietin mimetics: romiplostim and eltrombopag. None of the included trials were free from methodological bias. No included trials compared different platelet count thresholds for administering a prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to surgery. None of the included trials reported on all the review outcomes and the overall quality per reported outcome was very low. None of the three completed trials reported: all-cause mortality at 90 days post surgery; mortality secondary to bleeding, thromboembolism or infection; number of red cell or platelet transfusions per participant; length of hospital stay; or quality of life. None of the trials included children or people who needed major surgery or emergency surgical procedures. Platelet transfusion versus no platelet transfusion (1 trial, 72 participants)We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery had any effect on all-cause mortality within 30 days (1 trial, 72 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.45; very-low quality evidence). We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery had any effect on the risk of major (1 trial, 64 participants; RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.29 to 8.92; very low-quality evidence), or minor bleeding (1 trial, 64 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.85; very-low quality evidence). No serious adverse events occurred in either study arm (1 trial, 72 participants, very low-quality evidence). Platelet transfusion versus alternative to platelet transfusion (2 trials, 108 participants)We were very uncertain whether giving a platelet transfusion prior to surgery compared to an alternative has any effect on the risk of major (2 trials, 108 participants; no events; very low-quality evidence), or minor bleeding (desmopressin: 1 trial, 36 participants; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.23; very-low quality evidence: thrombopoietin mimetics: 1 trial, 65 participants; no events; very-low quality evidence). We were very uncertain whether there was a difference in transfusion-related adverse effects between the platelet transfused group and the alternative treatment group (desmopressin: 1 trial, 36 participants; RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.12 to 62.17; very-low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Findings of this review were based on three small trials involving minor surgery in adults with thrombocytopenia. We found insufficient evidence to recommend the administration of preprocedure prophylactic platelet transfusions in this situation with a lack of evidence that transfusion resulted in a reduction in postoperative bleeding or all-cause mortality. The small number of trials meeting the inclusion criteria and the limitation in reported outcomes across the trials precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. Further adequately powered trials, in people of all ages, of prophylactic platelet transfusions compared with no transfusion, other alternative treatments, and considering different platelet thresholds prior to planned and emergency surgical procedures are required. Future trials should include major surgery and report on bleeding, adverse effects, mortality (as a long-term outcome) after surgery, duration of hospital stay and quality of life measures.

### Platelet transfusion threshold in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review [^1144cfKJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There exists uncertainty as to the optimal platelet values when managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. GOALS AND STUDY: A systematic review was carried out to determine the optimal approach when managing patients with thrombocytopenia in the setting of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.

Results

Eighteen of 803 potential articles were selected and reviewed, including 4 randomized controlled trials and 6 cohort studies. The only empirical clinical data available pertained to the management of hematology or oncology patients. There was no high-level evidence that determined the proper threshold of platelet transfusion specifically in GI bleeding. We were, therefore, limited to include principally consensus opinions, recommendations, and guidelines for platelet transfusion trigger as they apply to the treatment (including prophylaxis) of bleeding in general, with a paucity of data addressing major bleeding, let alone bleeding from a gastroenterologic origin. Randomized clinical trials were individually underpowered in allowing definitive conclusions, even though resulting recommendations were supported by similarly underpowered retrospective and prospective observational studies.

Conclusions

There exist a paucity of data to recommend optimal therapeutic platelet count targets in patients with active GI bleeding. Based principally on expert opinion recommendations, we propose a count of 50×10/L. Some professional associations have suggested in very specific clinical settings (postcardiopulmonary bypass surgery or central nervous system trauma) a higher value of up to 100×10/L. Properly designed randomized trials are required to more precisely address this important clinical question.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^112UkhtB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB platelet transfusion guideline — scope and target population: These guidelines provide advice for adult patients who are candidates for platelet transfusion and were designed to provide pragmatic recommendations about when platelet transfusion may be appropriate in adult patients. For several common clinical situations, they identify a platelet count threshold below which platelet transfusion may improve hemostasis and above which platelet transfusion is unlikely to benefit the patient; they are not intended to serve as standards, and clinical judgment, and not a specific platelet count threshold, is paramount in deciding whether to transfuse platelets.

### Should transfusion trigger thresholds differ for critical care versus perioperative patients? A meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115r6SHJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Evidence suggests that the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds differs for critically ill patients versus perioperative patients. In critical care patients, a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion trigger ~ 7–8 g/dL) reduces the risk of overall mortality, stroke/TIA, transfusion reactions, length of stay, and allogeneic blood exposure. In contrast, for perioperative patients, current evidence suggests a restrictive transfusion strategy may increase the risk of mortality, particularly with transfusion triggers of 7–7.5 g/dL. While the evidence base is sufficiently robust to provide definitive conclusions for critically ill patients due to large accumulated sample size, the existing evidence base for the perioperative population remains less robust due to insufficiently accumulated sample size. Consequently, further research is encouraged in perioperative patients to define safe transfusion thresholds, especially for cardiac surgical patients or high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^111kq2x7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB platelet transfusion guideline — prophylactic thresholds for adult inpatients and common procedures are as follows: The AABB recommends that platelet transfusion be given prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapyinduced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia and recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For procedures, the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence), suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence), and suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

### Platelet transfusion prophylaxis for patients with haematological malignancies: where to now? [^112rHPmu]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

National guidelines for platelet transfusion in many countries recommend that the general platelet transfusion trigger for prophylaxis is 10x10(9)/l. This annotation reviews the evidence for this threshold level and discusses other current unresolved issues relevant to platelet transfusion practice such as the optimal dose and the clinical benefit of a strategy for the prophylactic use of platelet transfusions when the platelet count falls below a given threshold.

### Ratios of plasma and platelets to red blood cells in surgical patients with acute intraoperative hemorrhage [^113hWqQH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationships between the ratios of transfused allogeneic blood products and clinical outcomes in patients with acute intraoperative hemorrhage are poorly defined.

Methods

To better define these ratios, we undertook a single-center, observational cohort study of all surgical patients (≥ 18 years) who received rapid transfusion defined by a critical administration threshold of 3 or more units of red blood cells (RBCs) intraoperatively within 1 hour between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assess relationships between ratios of plasma to RBCs and platelets to RBCs at 3, 12, and 24 hours and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, with secondary outcomes of intensive care unit and hospital-free days.

Results

The study included 2385 patients, of whom 14.9% had a plasma-to-RBC ratio of 1.0+, and 47.6% had a platelet-to-RBC ratio of 1.0+. Higher plasma-to-RBC and platelet-to-RBC ratios were observed for patients who underwent cardiac, transplant, and vascular surgery and in patients with greater derangements in hemostatic laboratory values. Ratios did not differ by patient age or severity of illness. Higher ratios were not associated with improved clinical outcomes. Mortality differed by platelet-to-RBC but not plasma-to-RBC ratio, with the highest mortality observed with a platelet-to-RBC ratio of 0.1–0.9 at 24 hours (odds ratio, 3.34 [1.62–6.88]) versus no platelets (P = 0.001). Higher plasma-to-RBC ratios were associated with decreased hospital-free days, although differences in clinical outcomes were not significant after exclusion of patients receiving only RBCs without component therapies.

Conclusions

Transfusion ratios in surgical patients with critical intraoperative hemorrhage were largely related to surgical and hemostatic features rather than baseline patient characteristics. Higher ratios were not associated with improved outcomes.

### Impact of platelet transfusion on outcomes in trauma patients [^113qeyEM]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The current European Guidelines on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma recommend maintaining a platelet count greater than 50 G/L for patients with ongoing bleeding, or greater than 100 G/L if associated with traumatic brain injury. Nevertheless, such thresholds may be insufficient after severe trauma. First, platelet count, although essentially higher than 100 G/L, is a prognostic marker following trauma. Early platelet transfusion improved survival, when 96% of early platelet transfusion were performed to patients with an admission platelet count > 100 G/L. Similarly, in the PROPRR substudy that also supports transfusion of platelets as early as possible, only 2% of patients had platelet count below 100 G/L. These data support platelet transfusion despite normal platelet count. Second, low thresholds expose to dilution: in the case of massive RBC and FFP transfusion without platelet transfusion, platelet count will decrease during the course of trauma resuscitation. In a model of major surgery, a blood loss of one blood volume replaced with RBC and colloids led to decreased platelet count by half, with a large interindividual variability. A decrease in the platelet count to 50 G/L is expected when RBC equivalent to two blood volumes has been transfused (ref). Third, the quality of evidence that supports 50 G/L as an haemostatic threshold in trauma is very low and was defined from small series of surgical patients, with isolated thrombocytopenia and not from trauma patients with complex haemostatic disorders. Fourth, these thresholds do not take into account trauma-induced platelet dysfunction. Platelet dysfunction has been identified as one of the mechanisms of trauma-induced coagulopathy and deeply impacts platelet aggregation and activation pathways. Platelet dysfunction occurs in approximately 50% of trauma patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This is an additional argument to increase platelet transfusion threshold.

### Blood product transfusion in adults: indications, adverse reactions, and modifications [^112BXiUr]. American Family Physician (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to indications for transfusion, surgery, AAFP 2020 guidelines recommend to administer platelet transfusion in most adult patients before surgery or childbirth if the platelet count is < 50×10⁹/L.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^11766KmD]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

For all recommendations, high-certainty evidence directly addressing each recommendation was either absent or insufficient. Therefore, our recommendations were primarily based upon expert opinion. This document provides recommendations for platelet transfusion thresholds in non-bleeding patients stratified by risk of bleeding and those with active bleeding. In the procedural setting, the evidence for platelets and FFP is limited but favors a first-line no transfusion approach for vascular, bedside thoracic or abdominal, and endoscopic procedures without biopsy. For LP, given the potentially catastrophic complications, a less restrictive approach is suggested. Despite the lack of high-certainty evidence, these guidelines provide a framework for managing critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Shared decision-making and the implementation of institutional guidelines to standardize transfusion practices could optimize patient care, improve equity in access to blood products and reduce costs. On a large scale, this could amount to approximately half a million less units of platelets and FFP transfused annually. These guidelines should be an opportunity for institutions to develop local policies, monitor their impact on transfusion practices, and provide a framework to longitudinally optimize platelet and FFP use.

### Guidelines for the use of platelet transfusions [^111BTBwp]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to indications for transfusion, critical illness, BCSH 2017 guidelines recommend to use the platelet count thresholds for reversible bone marrow failure as a general guide for prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients with critical illness without bleeding or planned procedures.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^113dxuP4]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These guidelines have been made using the best available contemporary evidence and pragmatic expert consensus involving multiple stakeholders. The expanding number of RCTs evaluating different transfusion thresholds for RBCs and platelets will continue to inform best practice in adults and children across a range of clinical conditions. Good transfusion practice should not solely rely on haemoglobin thresholds but also incorporate the clinical context, patient comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, rate of bleeding and patient preferences.

Major bleeding is an important cause of death in surgical patients. The 7th National Audit Project found that major haemorrhage was the leading cause of peri‐operative cardiac arrest. Healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients at risk of major peri‐operative blood loss should also be aware of the current prophylactic and therapeutic options available to them. High‐quality evidence supports the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid in preventing surgical bleeding but according to the 2023 NHS national comparative audit, around one‐third of patients who were potentially eligible to receive tranexamic acid did not receive it. Uptake of tranexamic use is particularly low in certain surgical specialities (e.g. vascular surgery). Recommendations from the Infected Blood Inquiry report include adding tranexamic acid on surgical checklists, a requirement for medical directors to report to their boards and the chief executive of their Trust on the extent of it us, and the board to report to NHS England annually as to the percentage of eligible operations which have involved its use (which should be above 80%).

Our guideline has limitations. We synthesised data qualitatively and did not perform any statistical analysis. Some recommendations were adopted from guidance produced by others. Our recommendations may also not applicable to other healthcare systems, however our aim was to generate a UK‐centric guideline.

In summary, we developed a multidisciplinary guideline aiming to improve transfusion safety and prevent major bleeding. Given the dynamic nature of the evidence‐base in peri‐operative bleeding and transfusion, future work should focus on the rapid integration of the findings of clinical trials and clinical guidelines into clinical practice and reducing unwarranted variation in practice.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^116KNTa8]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

These thresholds are not based on high‐quality data and an ongoing trial is aiming to identify the optimal platelet transfusion threshold in critically ill patients requiring low‐bleeding risk invasive procedures (NIHR131822). One recent trial in the Netherlands concluded that in patients with severe thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 10–50 × 10⁹/L) requiring CVC placement, withholding platelet transfusion was associated with a higher risk of bleeding. However, this risk was largely driven by placement of subclavian CVCs in patients with haematological conditions which is not reflective of UK practice. In addition, there was no evidence of increased risk in patients receiving ICU care even in those with severe thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 10–19 × 10⁹/L). The use of platelet transfusions preprocedure when antiplatelet agents have not been discontinued is not recommended. Specific guidance for procedures related to regional anaesthesia is available elsewhere.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^112ZgjyD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

AABB guideline — prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold and dosing in hospitalized versus outpatient care — states that the recommendation based on a platelet count threshold applies to hospitalized patients only, while a more liberal threshold may be appropriate for outpatients for practicality. For dosing, patients receiving low-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions for a morning platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less had the same bleeding risk as standard- or high-dose groups, but low-dose platelets needed to be transfused more often due to lower increment. High-dose prophylactic platelet transfusions have not been shown to provide additional benefit and are not recommended as routine therapy for inpatients; the aim is to provide low-dose platelet prophylaxis to patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, either routinely or temporarily during shortages.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115JtQkf]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are frequently administered to critically ill patients. Considering the variability in indications and thresholds guiding these transfusions, a comprehensive review of current evidence was conducted to provide guidance to critical care practitioners. This American College of Chest Physicians guideline examined the literature on platelet transfusions in critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia, with and without active bleeding, as well as data on prophylactic platelet and FFP transfusions for common procedures in the critical care setting.

Study Design and Methods

A panel of experts developed seven Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions addressing platelet and FFP transfusions in critically ill patients and performed a comprehensive evidence review. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach to assess the certainty of evidence, and to formulate and grade recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on the recommendations.

Results

The initial search identified a total of 7,172 studies, and after the initial screening, 100 articles were reviewed. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1 randomized controlled trial and 15 observational studies. Overall, the certainty of the evidence for all questions was very low. The panel formulated seven conditional recommendations.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy, a risk/benefit assessment should be made by providers prior to transfusion of platelets or FFP. Given the known risks of blood product transfusion, and the limited data regarding the benefits from platelet or FFP transfusion, most patients will benefit from avoiding transfusion of these blood products. In patients at high risk of bleeding, or where the bleeding complication may be catastrophic, transfusion should be considered.

For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50 × 10³/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100 × 10³/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The panel strongly recommends restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion strategies based on high- or moderate-certainty evidence in the 4 populations defined below. Table 2 provides the summary of findings and Table 3 summarizes all recommendations. Recommendation 1.

1: in nonbleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia actively receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. Recommendation 2. 3: in adult patients undergoing CVC placement at anatomic sites amenable to manual compression, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL.

### Transfusion strategies in non-bleeding critically ill adults: a clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^117Lw4Tb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based clinical practice recommendations regarding transfusion practices in non-bleeding, critically ill adults.

Design

A task force involving 13 international experts and three methodologists used the GRADE approach for guideline development.

Methods

The task force identified four main topics: red blood cell transfusion thresholds, red blood cell transfusion avoidance strategies, platelet transfusion, and plasma transfusion. The panel developed structured guideline questions using population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) format.

Results

The task force generated 16 clinical practice recommendations (3 strong recommendations, 13 conditional recommendations), and identified five PICOs with insufficient evidence to make any recommendation.

Conclusions

This clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations and identifies areas where further research is needed regarding transfusion practices and transfusion avoidance in non-bleeding, critically ill adults.

### Platelet transfusion practices in the ICU: data from a large transfusion registry [^112bR3e6]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet transfusions are commonly used in critically ill patients, but transfusion thresholds, count increments, and predictors of ineffectual transfusions remain unclear.

Methods

This retrospective study included consecutive adult nononcology patients who received platelet transfusions in ICUs at three Canadian academic hospitals between 2006 and 2015. Data were collected from a validated transfusion database. We determined independent predictors of ineffectual platelet transfusions, defined as transfusions that raised platelet counts by < 5 × 10⁹/L. Reasons for transfusion were adjudicated in a subgroup of patients who underwent transfusion despite normal platelet counts.

Results

We identified 7,320 ICU admissions (n = 7,073 patients) during which 15,879 platelet transfusions were administered. Most admissions (78.7%) were for cardiac surgery. Based on 5,700 analyzable transfusions, the median pretransfusion platelet count was 87 × 10⁹/L (interquartile range [IQR], 57–130). The pretransfusion platelet count was ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and ≥ 150 × 10⁹/L for 79.6% and 17.8% of transfusions, respectively. Reasons for transfusion despite a normal platelet count were active bleeding or surgery in patients receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. The median platelet count increment was 23 × 10⁹/L (IQR, 7–44), and 21.8% of transfusions were ineffectual. ABO incompatibility, sepsis, liver disease, and red cell and cryoprecipitate transfusions were associated with a poor platelet count increment.

Conclusions

Platelet transfusions were commonly used in the ICU when platelet counts were ≥ 50 × 10(9)/L. One platelet transfusion increased platelet count by 23 × 10(9)/L. One in five transfusions was ineffectual, and ABO incompatibility was identified as a modifiable risk factor. These data can help direct efforts to reduce platelet overuse and improve transfusion quality.

### Clinical practice guidelines from the AABB: red blood cell transfusion thresholds and storage [^113nUZwa]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 100 million units of blood are collected worldwide each year, yet the indication for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and the optimal length of RBC storage prior to transfusion are uncertain.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the target hemoglobin level for RBC transfusion among hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable and the length of time RBCs should be stored prior to transfusion.

Evidence Review

Reference librarians conducted a literature search for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion (1950-May 2016) and RBC storage duration (1948-May 2016) without language restrictions. The results were summarized using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. For RBC transfusion thresholds, 31 RCTs included 12 587 participants and compared restrictive thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7–8 g/dL) with liberal thresholds (transfusion not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 9–10 g/dL). The summary estimates across trials demonstrated that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds were not associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, including 30-day mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, rebleeding, pneumonia, or thromboembolism. For RBC storage duration, 13 RCTs included 5515 participants randomly allocated to receive fresher blood or standard-issue blood. These RCTs demonstrated that fresher blood did not improve clinical outcomes.

Findings

It is good practice to consider the hemoglobin level, the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and alternative therapies when making transfusion decisions regarding an individual patient. Recommendation 1: a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold in which the transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is 7 g/dL is recommended for hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients, rather than when the hemoglobin level is 10 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). A restrictive RBC transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular disease (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). The restrictive transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is likely comparable with 8 g/dL, but RCT evidence is not available for all patient categories. These recommendations do not apply to patients with acute coronary syndrome, severe thrombocytopenia (patients treated for hematological or oncological reasons who are at risk of bleeding), and chronic transfusion-dependent anemia (not recommended due to insufficient evidence). Recommendation 2: patients, including neonates, should receive RBC units selected at any point within their licensed dating period (standard issue) rather than limiting patients to transfusion of only fresh (storage length: < 10 days) RBC units (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Research in RBC transfusion medicine has significantly advanced the science in recent years and provides high-quality evidence to inform guidelines. A restrictive transfusion threshold is safe in most clinical settings and the current blood banking practices of using standard-issue blood should be continued.

Platelets

Recommendation 30

We suggest that platelets be administered to maintain a platelet count above 50 × 10⁹/L in trauma patients with ongoing bleeding and above 100 × 10⁹/L in patients with TBI (Grade 2C).

If administered, we suggest an initial dose of four to eight single platelet units or one aphaeresis pack (Grade 2B).

Rationale

While a low platelet count has been consistently associated with both morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, the threshold and timing of platelet transfusion remains controversial. Although the platelet count at admission was found to be a biomarker for trauma severity and predictive of outcome, including bleeding intensity and transfusion requirements, platelet counts are frequently within the normal range at hospital admission, but may decrease sharply in the following 1–2 h of haemostatic resuscitation and decline continuously thereafter, suggesting an important role for the treatment administered.

No randomised trials have investigated specific platelet transfusion thresholds in trauma patients. Several observational studies have investigated associations between platelet transfusion and outcome; however, these are subject to an inherent risk of bias such as immortal time bias as well as bias from residual confounding. Accordingly, there is currently weak scientific evidence to support a specific platelet transfusion threshold in the bleeding trauma patient. In a sub-study of a RCT, patients randomised to receive first-line coagulation factors or FFP were also transfused with platelets to maintain platelet counts between 50 and 100 × 10 9 /L. Platelet transfusion did not substantially improve platelet count and contributed to poor clinical outcome.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^112v31uf]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

What Others Are Saying

Prophylactic platelet transfusions have been recommended prior to vascular catheter placement for counts < 20 × 10⁹/L by the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies, ASCO, and BSH. ESICM guidelines recommended against prophylactic platelet transfusions for counts > 50–100 × 10⁹/L but no recommendation was issued for counts 10–50 × 10⁹/L. However, these preceded the RCT by van Baarle et al.ESICM and BSH recommend withholding prophylactic FFP transfusions in patients with coagulopathy. However, SIR recommends correcting INR to within range of 2–3.

Research Priorities

Research assessing bleeding risk in settings with INR > 3, mixed coagulopathies, and various degrees and etiologies of thrombocytopenia is necessary. Furthermore, alternative methods for assessing bleeding risk and coagulation abnormalities (ie, viscoelastic monitoring) should be studied.

Question 5: Should critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis receive blood products to reverse thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy?

Recommendation 5A: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis, we suggest against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Recommendation 5B: In critically ill patients with increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy undergoing a bedside thoracentesis or paracentesis, we suggest against routine prophylactic FFP transfusion (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Justification

Three studies eligible for analysis varied in population characteristics, blood product use, definitions of bleeding, and outcomes (Table 5). Each study encountered issues such as bias, noninclusion of critically ill patients, unreported transfusion indications, and the use of antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Two studies reported no major bleeding in non-transfused groups, while a third noted that 0.2% of patients received RBC transfusions despite no clinical hypovolemia. Overall, major bleeding and the need for surgical interventions were rare.

Table 5
Studies Informing Recommendation 5

Given the risks of blood product transfusions and the unclear impact of transfusions, including thresholds, dose, and timing on bleeding, the evidence favors withholding transfusions. Clinical decisions on transfusions should weigh factors such as ultrasound availability, operator experience, anticoagulant use, platelet function disorders, concomitant thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, and technical or anatomical challenges.

### Evidence review: periprocedural use of blood products [^111FgHVC]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Blood product transfusion has not been subject to rigorous clinical study, and great practice variations exist. Of particular concern to hospitalists is the use of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets prior to invasive procedures to correct anemia or perceived bleeding risk. We summarize the known risks associated with periprocedural anemia, prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), and thrombocytopenia, as well as the effects of blood product administration on clinical outcomes. Clinical trial evidence argues for a restrictive red blood cell transfusion threshold (a hemoglobin level of 7–8 g/dL or symptomatic anemia) for most perioperative patients. There are no high-quality data to guide plasma and platelet transfusions around the time of procedures. Available data do not support the use of prothrombin time/INR to guide prophylactic administration of plasma, and there are scarce data to guide platelet use around the time of an invasive procedure. Therefore, we rely on current consensus expert opinion, which recommends administration of plasma in moderate- to high-risk procedures when INR is > 1.5. We recommend platelet transfusion in low-risk procedures when platelet count is < 20,000/μL, for average-risk procedures when platelet count is < 50,000/μL, and for procedures involving the central nervous system when the platelet count is < 100,000/μL.

Specific Populations

Platelet transfusions are not beneficial and can be harmful to certain patient groups, including those with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, alloimmunization, hyperleukocytosis, and leukostasis. Additionally, certain populations are at increased risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated circulatory overload such as congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, shock, and current smoking. Clinicians might choose different transfusion thresholds for these patients.

What Others Are Saying

The recommendations for patients without high risk of bleeding align with those from the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the British Society for Haematology (BSH).,

For patients at high risk of bleeding, considering a higher platelet count threshold for transfusion is suggested. We believed that further defining this risk would offer more specific guidance to clinicians.

Research Priorities

Future research should aim to identify factors that increase bleeding risk, establish a clear definition of high risk of bleeding, and determine the optimal platelet transfusion thresholds for critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia.

Question 3: Should critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and active bleeding receive transfusion of platelets?

Recommendation: In critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and serious active bleeding, we suggest transfusing platelets if platelet counts fall below 50 × 10 9 /L (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence)

AABB platelet transfusion — patients receiving antiplatelet therapy with intracranial hemorrhage: "The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous)", with "Quality of evidence: very low; strength of recommendation: uncertain". Evidence from "Five observational studies (n = 635)" is mixed: one showed increased mortality with transfusion "relative risk, 2.4 [CI, 1.2 to 4.9]", another showed decreased mortality "relative risk, 0.21 [CI, 0.05 to 0.95]", and "Three studies showed no significant effect on mortality rates". An additional study "(n = 88)… had poorer survival than those who were not transfused with platelets". The guideline notes that decisions should be individualized and that in central nervous system surgery "platelets are conventionally transfused prophylactically for a preprocedure platelet count less than 80 × 10⁹ to 100 × 10⁹ cells/L", though only low-quality data support this threshold, and across studies "it was not possible to establish a causal relationship… and confounding by indication was possible.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114YWN9a]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, 20% of platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are transfused to critically ill patients, totaling 2.2 million units of each annually. The leading indications include mild abnormalities in platelet counts and coagulation tests in non-bleeding patients and procedural prophylaxis. The lack of solid evidence has led to variability in the indications and thresholds guiding these transfusions.,

Coagulopathy is characterized by a disruption of coagulation factors and ineffective hemostasis, leading to impaired clot formation. Although definitions of coagulopathy vary, for the purpose of this document, a pragmatic definition of a prolonged INR was used. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy have been linked to increased bleeding risk and higher mortality. Despite the importance of platelet or FFP transfusions in managing these conditions, their use can result in severe and even life-threatening adverse effects. Hence, evidence weighing both the benefits and risks would be ideal to guide clinical decisions.

Platelets and FFP are scarce resources with variable costs and access globally. Therefore, judicious use is critical, preserving them for patients when the benefits outweigh the risks. The existing inconsistencies in transfusion practices underline the importance of evidence-based recommendations to optimize patient care and resource utilization. An expert panel identified, synthesized, and weighted the evidence to provide clinical recommendations for platelet and FFP transfusions in critically ill patients.

Results

Critically ill patients have complex problems that require a thoughtful and nuanced approach to medical care. The recommendations in this document apply to critically ill patients, excluding trauma and neuro-critical care populations, and should be implemented in a hierarchal fashion to optimize treatment. Recommendations 1–3 should be applied initially to critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia, while the subsequent recommendations provide additional guidance for specific situations involving invasive procedures (Figs 1, 2). It is important to emphasize that conditional recommendations inherently require shared decision-making. Readers are encouraged to review the discussion to fully understand the nuances that informed these recommendations.

Figure 2
Platelet and FFP transfusion thresholds for various ICU bedside procedures. The proposed strategy would be exemplified by a hypothetical critically ill patient with a platelet count of 20 × 10⁹/L who is at high risk of spontaneous bleeding and has indications for placement of a central venous catheter and performance of a thoracentesis. Recommendation 2 indicates that most practitioners would consider transfusing prophylactic platelets to this patient. When contemplating the placement of the central venous catheter, recommendation 4 would indicate that further platelet transfusions are not suggested prior to the catheter placement if the platelet level was above 30 × 10⁹/L after initial transfusion. In a similar fashion, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not suggested prior to the thoracentesis, in accordance with recommendation 6. a Suspected portal hypertension related bleed. FFP = fresh frozen plasma; GI = gastrointestinal; INR = international normalized ratio; LP = lumbar puncture.

Question 1: Should critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and without high risk of bleeding receive transfusion of platelets?

Recommendation: In stable non-bleeding critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and without high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we suggest transfusing platelets if platelet counts fall below 10 × 10⁹/L (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

Question 2: Should critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia and high risk of bleeding receive transfusion of platelets?

Recommendation: In stable non-bleeding critically ill patients with thrombocytopenia who are considered at high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we suggest transfusing platelets if platelet counts fall below 30–50 × 10⁹/L (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence).

### Evidence and triggers for the transfusion of blood and blood products [^112tbmLX]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is a commonly used treatment to improve the oxygen carrying capacity of blood during the peri-operative period. Increasing arterial oxygen content by increasing haemoglobin does not necessarily increase tissue oxygen delivery or uptake. Although the evidence-base for red cell transfusion practice is incomplete, randomised studies across a range of clinical settings, including surgery, consistently support the restrictive use of red cells, with no evidence of benefit for maintaining patients at higher haemoglobin thresholds (liberal strategy). A recent meta-analysis of 7593 patients concluded that a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with a reduced risk of healthcare-associated infections (pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infection, sepsis) when compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. The degree to which the optimal haemoglobin concentration or transfusion trigger should be modified for patients with additional specific risk factors (e.g. ischaemic heart disease), remains less clear and requires further research. Although most clinical practice guidelines recommend restrictive use of red cells, and many blood transfusion services have seen marked falls in overall usage of red cells, the use of other blood components such as fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate has risen. In clinical practice, administration of fresh frozen plasma is usually guided by laboratory tests of coagulation, mainly prothrombin time, international normalised ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time, but the predictive value of these tests to predict bleeding is poor.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^115xKJwz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^112BinrW]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although platelets play a pivotal role in haemostasis after injury, the effect of platelet transfusion is controversial. Historically, platelet transfusion was based on critical thresholds of platelet counts. One small prospective study performed in massively transfused patients found a platelet count of < 100 × 10⁹/L as the threshold for diffuse bleeding, and another study indicated a platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L or fibrinogen < 0.5 g/l as the most sensitive laboratory predictors of microvascular bleeding. However, an older prospective randomised trial evaluating prophylactic platelet transfusion at a ratio to whole blood of 1:2 versus same amount of plasma in patients receiving ≥ 12 units of whole blood in 12 h concluded that platelet administration did not affect microvascular non-surgical bleeding. Recently, it was shown that a low or decreasing platelet count in trauma patients predicts greater mortality and proactive administration of platelets in patients with massive bleeding due to ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms increased survival from 30 to 45% when the platelet count was > 50 × 10⁹/L as compared to < 50 × 10⁹/L and further increased to 69% for those with platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L.

### How well do platelets prevent bleeding? [^114DaWY2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic platelet transfusions are used to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding in patients with treatment- or disease-related severe thrombocytopenia. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion threshold of < 10 × 10³/µL has been shown to be safe in stable hematology/oncology patients. A higher threshold and/or larger or more frequent platelet doses may be appropriate for patients with clinical features associated with an increased risk of bleeding such as high fevers, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, or splenomegaly. Unique factors in the outpatient setting may support the use of a higher platelet-transfusion threshold and/or dose of platelets. A prophylactic platelet-transfusion strategy has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared with no prophylaxis in adult patients receiving chemotherapy but not for autologous transplant recipients. Despite the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, a high incidence (50% to 70%) of spontaneous bleeding remains. Using a higher threshold or larger doses of platelets does not change this risk. New approaches to reduce the risk of spontaneous bleeding, including antifibrinolytic therapy, are currently under study.

Of the 3643 patients, 208 (6%) received a platelet transfusion during their ICU stay and main indications consisted of active bleeding (42%, n = 187/443), prophylaxis (33%, n = 144/443) or an upcoming procedure (12%, n = 51/443). The median platelet count before transfusion was 44×109/L (interquartile range [IQR], 20–78) with variation by indication, including a higher median of 60×109/L (IQR 31–93) during active bleeding. A threshold for transfusion was stated in 51% (n = 224/443) of the events, with a median threshold platelet count of 50×109/L (IQR, 40–100). The advised threshold was not adhered to in 16% (n = 36/224) of cases, with the majority having active bleeding as indication. Contrasts in transfusion practices were observed across different geo-economic regions. Platelet transfusions were administered to 6% (n = 156/2520) of patients in high-income countries, 5% (n = 52/1069) of patients in upper-middle-income countries and in none from lower-middle-income countries (n = 0/54). Non-adherence was higher in the high-income countries (23%, n = 34/149) than upper-middle-income countries (3%, n = 2/75).

Conclusions

Platelet transfusions were administered to a small proportion of critically ill patients, and were given to treat active bleeding or as prophylaxis in the majority of cases. Occurence rate, indication and threshold adherence for platelet transfusion widely varied between geo-economic regions.

### Concepts of blood transfusion in adults [^117BNvYE]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Recent progress has been made in the identification and implementation of best transfusion practices on the basis of evidence-based clinical trials, published clinical practice guidelines, and process improvements for blood use and clinical patient outcomes. However, substantial variability persists in transfusion outcomes for patients in some clinical settings — eg, patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. This variability could be the result of insufficient understanding of published guidelines; different recommendations of medical societies, including the specification of a haemoglobin concentration threshold to use as a transfusion trigger; the value of haemoglobin as a surrogate indicator for transfusion benefit, even though only changes in concentration and not absolute red cell mass of haemoglobin can be identified; and disagreement about the validity of the level 1 evidence for clinical practice guidelines. Nevertheless, institutional experience and national databases suggest that a restrictive blood transfusion approach is being increasingly implemented as best practice.

### Use of blood products in sepsis: an evidence-based review [^1161aj47]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for the use of blood products in sepsis that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

In the absence of extenuating circumstances and following resolution of tissue hypoperfusion, red blood cell transfusion should be targeted to maintain hemoglobin at 7.0 g/dL or greater. Erythropoietin is not recommended as a specific treatment for sepsis-associated anemia. Fresh-frozen plasma should be given for documented deficiency of coagulation factors and in the presence of active bleeding or before surgical or invasive procedures. Antithrombin administration is not recommended. Specific platelet transfusion thresholds are based on the presence or absence of bleeding, significant risk for bleeding, plans for surgery or invasive procedures, and platelet count ≤ 5,000/mm.

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: the use of blood components and their alternatives [^116E6TTo]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Platelets

Two‐thirds of all platelets are used in patients with haematological malignancies, followed by cardiac surgery (7–10%) and critical care (5–9%). Platelet transfusions are the component most implicated in transfusion reactions, as reported by SHOT. Febrile non‐haemolytic transfusion reactions and allergic reactions are thought to occur at a frequency of 1 in 14 and 1 in 50 per‐unit transfusions, respectively and sepsis from a bacterially contaminated platelet unit is the most frequent infectious complication from any blood product.

Platelet transfusion may be indicated for the treatment of active bleeding (therapeutic), although severe thrombocytopenia is an uncommon complication in cases of major bleeding. In patients with severe bleeding, the following pragmatic guidance should be applied although we recognise that this is not based on high‐quality evidence:
Maintain platelet count > 50 × 10⁹/L
Maintain platelet count > 100 × 10⁹/L in patients with multiple traumatic injuries, traumatic brain injury, or spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage

Platelet transfusions are prescribed more commonly to treat thrombocytopaenia and thereby prevent bleeding (prophylaxis). Recent trials in neonates who were critically ill and adults with intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy have questioned the roles of platelet transfusions for either of these purposes. As a guide, in the absence of active bleeding, the following platelet count thresholds should be applied:
Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion: 20 × 10⁹/L
Lumbar puncture: 40 × 10⁹/L
Insertion or removal of epidural catheter: 80 × 10⁹/L
Percutaneous tracheostomy: 50 × 10⁹/L
Major surgery: 50 × 10⁹/L
Neurosurgery or posterior segment ophthalmic surgery: 100 × 10⁹/L
Percutaneous liver biopsy: 50 × 10⁹/L (consider transjugular biopsy if platelet count is below this level)
Routine prophylaxis: 10 × 10⁹/L (consider 10–20 × 10⁹/L in the presence of risk factors e.g. sepsis)

Evidence summary

A single RCT of patients undergoing vascular surgery evaluated a restrictive (8 g/dL) vs. liberal (9.7 g/dL) transfusion strategy in patients with bleeding. Due to the small number of events in the study, the results were very imprecise for most outcomes, including mortality (RR 2, 95% CI 0.19–20.86; RD 3.4, 95% CI − 2.8 to 68.5, low certainty) and myocardial infarction (RR 1, 95% CI 0.15–6.63; MD 0, 95% CI − 5.9–38.8, low certainty). A restrictive transfusion threshold appeared to result in lower number of transfusions (MD 2 units, 95% CI 3.22–0.78, high certainty) and proportion of patients receiving transfusions (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51–0.86, high certainty), without a significant reduction in the risk of transfusion reactions (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01–7.86, very low certainty).

Justification

The existing evidence does not demonstrate important clinical benefits or harms with restrictive vs liberal transfusions in vascular surgery patients, beyond reductions in red cell transfusion, with all estimates having low certainty because of the very small number of events, resulting in very serious imprecision. The absence of evidence for a treatment effect on clinically important outcomes, reduces the likelihood that patient values and preferences will have a role on decision-making. However, it is still expected that most patients would choose not to have a transfusion if it does not improve symptoms or other outcomes.

Implementation issues

The restrictive threshold suggested by the TF includes a slightly higher range than that recommended for most populations in part 1 of the guideline, including the recommendation for a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7.5–8 g/dL recommended for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a population of similar age and with similar vascular comorbidities. This difference reflects the thresholds studied in the available clinical trials, but also reflects the significant cardiovascular comorbidities in this patient population, and clinical uncertainty given the limited direct evidence available to guide practice. As a result, there may remain some variability in how clinicians implement this restrictive strategy, based upon the volume of bleeding, ease of definitive hemorrhage management, presence of active cardiac disease, and patient symptoms.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 207: thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^112dqEuF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Preeclampsia or HELLP-associated thrombocytopenia — delivery timing, transfusion thresholds, and postpartum course: The primary treatment of maternal thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100 × 10⁹/L) associated with severe features of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome is delivery, and delivery is recommended when gestational hypertension or preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed at or beyond 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, after maternal stabilization or with labor or rupture of membranes; delivery should not be delayed for the administration of corticosteroids in the late preterm period and the mode of delivery should be determined by routine obstetric considerations. Platelet transfusions are best reserved for patients with thrombocytopenia with active bleeding, with an exception for cesarean delivery in which consensus guidelines recommend platelet transfusion to increase the maternal platelet count to more than 50 × 10⁹/L before major surgery; transfusions may be needed if platelet count is less than 50 × 10⁹/L or with suspected disseminated intravascular coagulation. After birth, platelet counts often decrease for 24–48 hours followed by rapid recovery, and most patients will achieve a platelet count greater than 100 × 10⁹/L within 2–6 days; although corticosteroids or uterine curettage may improve thrombocytopenia, no differences have been noted in maternal mortality or morbidity with these treatments.

Transfusion management and antifibrinolytic use — risk factors for intraoperative transfusion include anterior spinal instrumentation and fusion with a 25% to 29% transfusion rate and multilevel (> 3 levels) surgery, among others. Benefits of balanced transfusion ratios (1:1 plasma-reduced red cell:fresh frozen plasma and 1:4 plasma-reduced red cell:platelets) and restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (10 g/dL) targeted transfusion strategies are described as unclear. Recommendations include: preparation and allocation of resources for transfusion should be considered for high-risk groups including age over 50 years (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR); hemoglobin and hematocrit values should be monitored frequently, every 1 to 2 h or more often on a case-by-case basis (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO); anesthesiologists should consider blood loss, physiologic profiles, perfusion pressure, and end-organ function in informing perioperative transfusion decisions (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO); no specific recommendation can be made for transfusion thresholds or ratios (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B-NR); preoperative blood donation may be considered for selected patients (Class IIb, Level of Evidence B-NR); and cell salvage may be considered to help to reduce red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients at risk for blood loss (Class III [No benefit], Level of Evidence A).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to indications for transfusion, hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to administer prophylactic platelet transfusion in patients receiving therapy for hematologic malignancies with a platelet count < 10×10⁹/L. Consider using higher thresholds for transfusion in patients with signs of hemorrhage, high fever, hyperleukocytosis, rapid fall of platelet count, or coagulation abnormalities (such as acute promyelocytic leukemia) and in patients undergoing invasive procedures or in circumstances in which platelet transfusions may not be readily available in case of emergencies (such as outpatients living at a distance from the treatment center).

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^116a8FAS]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This Clinical Practice Guideline addresses blood product transfusion among hospitalized acutely burned adults. The Investigator Panel, consisting of the authors of this paper, developed clinically relevant questions in PICO format (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome). These questions informed a systematic literature search which returned 1947 titles, of which 10 articles met the criteria for inclusion and critical review. We strongly recommend the use of a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level ≥ 7 g/dL), to reduce the number of blood transfusions administered to adults with burns ≥ 20% total burn surface area (TBSA). We also recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion threshold because the outcomes of infection, length of stay, and mortality are no worse than with liberal RBC transfusion thresholds (hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL), while transfusing less blood. We make a weak recommendation to not use recombinant human erythropoietin to reduce the number of RBC transfusions. We make a weak conditional recommendation to consider the use of intraoperative intravenous tranexamic acid during major burn wound excision, to reduce the number of perioperative blood transfusions, preferably in conjunction with performing dynamic viscoelastic testing in this setting. We recommend that in the perioperative period during major burn debridement, thromboelastography and rotation thromboelastometry be used to guide blood product transfusion, to reduce the overall amount of blood product transfusion. No recommendation could be made on the use of a 1:1:1 RBC to fresh frozen plasma to platelet transfusion strategy to decrease the number of RBC transfusions or mortality in adult burn patients undergoing surgical burn wound excision.

### Platelet transfusion for patients with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111xTyNy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide evidence-based guidance on the use of platelet transfusion in people with cancer. This guideline updates and replaces the previous ASCO platelet transfusion guideline published initially in 2001. Methods ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the medical literature published from September 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016. This review builds on two 2015 systematic reviews that were conducted by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines. For clinical questions that were not addressed by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (the use of leukoreduction and platelet transfusion in solid tumors or chronic, stable severe thrombocytopenia) or that were addressed partially (invasive procedures), the ASCO search extended back to January 2000. Results The updated ASCO review included 24 more recent publications: three clinical practice guidelines, eight systematic reviews, and 13 observational studies. Recommendations The most substantial change to a previous recommendation involved platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on data from randomized controlled trials, adult patients who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation at experienced centers may receive a platelet transfusion at the first sign of bleeding, rather than prophylactically. Prophylactic platelet transfusion at defined platelet count thresholds is still recommended for pediatric patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation and for adult and pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Other recommendations address platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors or in those who undergo invasive procedures. Guidance is also provided regarding the production of platelet products, prevention of Rh alloimmunization, and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion (www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki).

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^111L3HRz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic platelet transfusion thresholds and dosing in therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia — 4 RCTs (n = 658) comparing morning platelet count thresholds less than 10 × 10⁹ versus 20 × 10⁹ cells/L or 30 × 10⁹ cells/L found that a greater threshold was not associated with a significantly lower incidence of grade 2 or greater bleeding (OR, 0.74 [CI, 0.41 to 1.35]) or bleeding-related mortality (OR, 0.37 [CI, 0.02 to 9.22]); the total number of days with bleeding was greater in the 10 × 10⁹-cells/L threshold group, while the 10 × 10⁹-cells/L threshold was associated with lower platelet usage and fewer transfusion reactions. Four RCTs (n = 1132) testing low-dose platelets (defined as approximately one half of the standard dose of 3 to 4 × 10¹¹ platelets) showed no difference in hemostasis (OR, 0.91 [CI, 0.70 to 1.19]), and in 2 RCTs high-dose platelets (approximately double the standard dose) did not reduce bleeding versus standard-dose (OR, 1.05 [CI, 0.79 to 1.40]).

### Different platelet count thresholds to guide use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with hematological disorders after myelosuppressive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation [^1162pbmq]. JAMA Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the optimal platelet count threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions to minimize bleeding, platelet use, and adverse clinical outcomes in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignant neoplasms?

Bottom Line

Maintaining a higher platelet count threshold (≤ 20×10⁹/L or ≤ 30×10⁹/L) was not associated with less bleeding than the current standard (≤ 10×109/L), but required more platelet transfusions (low-quality evidence).

### Multiple electrode aggregometry after cardiopulmonary bypass to assess platelet (dys)-function and transfusion threshold: a concordance study [^114Disyz]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cardiac surgery patients have a high risk of postoperative bleeding. Historically, the platelet count has been one of the main parameters used to establish the need for platelet transfusions, and the recent introduction of point-of-care tests for platelet function has allowed clinicians to rationalize platelet transfusion needs by assessing the platelet (dys-)function of the patient. For the present study, the authors evaluated how the introduction of one of these systems-the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) test, performed using a Multiplate electrode analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland)-into their clinical practice had modified their platelet transfusion practice. The relationship between the platelet count and the functional evaluation of platelet aggregation (via the ADP test) also was examined.

Design

This was a retrospective, single-center, observational study.

Setting

Cardiac surgery department of a tertiary care center in North-east Italy.

Participants

Cardiac surgery patients requiring cardiac bypass in 2017 and 2019.

Interventions

The primary outcome was to compare platelet transfusion practice before and after the implementation of a platelet function test (the ADP test) into the institution's transfusion algorithm, which replaced the platelet count as the trigger. Secondary outcomes were assessing whether the incorporation of the ADP test into their transfusion algorithm brought about a reduction in the frequency of platelet transfusions compared with previous rates (when only platelets counts were used); assessing patient blood loss in the first 12 postoperative hours; and ascertaining the percentage of patients requiring surgical reexplorations.

Measurements and Main Results

The study comprised 110 patients undergoing cardiac surgery from the platelet count period (2017) and 110 patients from the ADP test period (2019). Agreement between platelet counts versus ADP tests in determining the need for platelet transfusion was moderate (κ = 0.483; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.239–0.728), and the general linear regression relationship between platelet counts and the ADP test (Akaike information criterion = 2536; p < 0.001) was determined. Since the introduction of ADP testing, a highly significant reduction in platelet transfusions has occurred: 41.82% (platelet count period) versus 13.64% (ADP test period) (p < 0.001); average blood loss in the 12 hours postsurgery also was less in the ADP test period (p < 0.001) at 300 mL (95% CI 150–730) compared with 440 mL in the platelet count period (95% CI 135–900). Furthermore, a decreasing trend was observed in the number of patients requiring reexploration to optimize hemostasis in the first 12 hours postsurgery (6.36% v 2.73%); however, this trend did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.195).

Conclusion

The application of new Multiplate analyzer technologies, like the ADP test, have the potential to reduce platelet transfusion rates in cardiac surgery patients compared with the use of platelet counts alone; this point-of-care test may constitute an important strategy to help spare the use of allogeneic blood products. Additional studies are needed to confirm this trend and establish the best cutoff values to apply.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^115ypWsB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^112FzPSn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical setting 2 — adult patients having minor invasive procedures — features two weak AABB suggestions: Recommendation 2 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: low; strength: weak), and Recommendation 3 states the AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L (quality of evidence: very low; strength: weak). The rationale notes that serious bleeding complications after CVC placement are rare and often unrelated to the platelet count, that this recommendation is intended to be broadly applicable to adult patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, and that the LP threshold is intended for simple diagnostic or therapeutic LPs only.

Peri-operative anaemia, blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion are associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. A multidisciplinary, multimodal, individualised strategy, collectively termed 'patient blood management', may reduce or eliminate allogeneic blood transfusion and improve outcomes. This approach has three objectives: the detection and treatment of peri-operative anaemia; the reduction of peri-operative bleeding and coagulopathy; and harnessing and optimising the physiological tolerance of anaemia. This review focuses on the pre-operative evaluation of erythropoiesis, coagulation status and platelet function. Where possible, evidence is graded systematically and recommended therapies follow recently published consensus guidance.

The included studies varied significantly in patient characteristics, transfusion indications, and thresholds, preventing the differentiation between prophylactic and therapeutic transfusions (Table 2). An observational study reported no difference in ICU mortality between transfused and non-transfused patients (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.64–1.47). Similarly, the pooled comparison revealed no significant differences in 30-day mortality (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.79–1.44), or ICU length of stay (LOS) (mean difference, +0.65 days; 95% CI, –0.25 to +1.56). The low incidence of adverse events and confounding by indication limited the assessment of the association between platelet transfusions and adverse outcomes in this setting.,

Table 2
Studies Informing Recommendations 1 and 2

Patients Without High Risk of Bleeding

Prophylactic transfusions at platelet counts < 10 × 10 9 /L in hematologic patients without acute myeloid leukemia reduced overall bleeding risk, defined as World Health Organization (WHO) grades 2–4 (Table 3). However, this reduction was mainly due to grade 2 bleeding, with grade 3 or 4 bleeding rates below 1%-2%. Despite the lack of direct evidence for critically ill patients, hematologic data were considered adequate for extrapolation to critically ill patients to prevent spontaneous bleeding.

Table 3
WHO Bleeding Scale

Patients With High Risk of Bleeding

Given the absence of prospective studies and the heterogeneity of the critical care population, establishing a universal transfusion threshold to prevent spontaneous bleeding in critically ill patients at high risk of bleeding was challenging. Patients may be at high risk of bleeding due to factors that increase the likelihood of bleeding or because of critical anatomical sites where even minor bleeding could be catastrophic. Experts and guidelines recommend maintaining platelet counts > 100 × 10⁹/L for patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures or those with intracranial hemorrhage to prevent catastrophic outcomes from intracranial bleeding. Similarly, platelet counts > 50 × 10⁹/L are advised for patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at high risk of bleeding, and for those with thrombocytopenia experiencing acute venous thromboembolic disease before starting full-dose anticoagulation. Higher thresholds might also be considered for patients with tumors in critical areas (airway) or those on antiangiogenic medications that exacerbate bleeding risks. Consequently, given the heterogeneity of critically ill patients at high risk of bleeding, the panel recommended a platelet transfusion threshold of > 30–50 × 10⁹/L for patients with thrombocytopenia at high risk of bleeding.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^112nDQw1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active area of research. Blood is a limited resource, and there are concerns about risks, including transmitted infections. If a liberal transfusion strategy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach should be recognised as the standard of care.

Objectives

The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration to direct transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). Increasingly, investigators are considering other strategies including physiological triggers (i.e. central venous oxygen saturation), alone or in combination with such thresholds, to determine when a transfusion is indicated, so it is important to assess this growing body of evidence in tandem.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index, trial registries and PubMed on 14 October 2024. We checked reference lists of published reviews and papers for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children. We excluded studies that focused on preterm neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups based on different transfusion strategies or thresholds, usually defined by a haemoglobin concentration below which a RBC transfusion would be administered. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios across trials using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

Adult threshold comparison We included 61 trials (27,639 participants), across a range of clinical contexts: orthopaedic, cardiac or vascular surgery; critical care; neurocritical care; gastrointestinal bleeding; trauma; acute myocardial infarction; haematological malignancies and postpartum haemorrhage. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. The main outcomes were exposure to blood transfusion, 30-day mortality, neurologic function, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular accident, infection and thromboembolism. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 42% when combining all clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.65; high-certainty evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%), reflecting diversity in the strength of estimates, not the efficacy of the policy. When combining all clinical contexts, restrictive transfusion strategies did not modify the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 44 studies, 22,575 participants; high-certainty evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed including myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism or infection (moderate to high-certainty evidence). There were two exceptions in clinical populations. In gastrointestinal bleeding, 30-day mortality was lower with a restrictive transfusion strategy (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95; 4 studies, 1574 participants). In critically ill patients with brain injury, unfavourable neurological outcome at 6 to 12 months was lower with a liberal transfusion strategy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22; 4 studies, 2297 participants) (moderate-certainty evidence). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon, but occurred more frequently with the liberal strategy (Peto odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62; 18 studies, 11,505 participants). Paediatric threshold comparison We included eight trials (2764 participants), across a limited range of clinical contexts (critical care, cardiac surgery, haematological malignancies and severe malarial anaemia). The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive group in critical care and haematological malignancies trials was between 6.5 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL, and between 7.0 g/dL and 9 g/dL in cardiac surgery trials, depending on the cardiac abnormality and stage of repair. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. There was no clear difference in 30-day mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies, although confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.08; 7 studies, 2571 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no clear difference between threshold strategies for infection; very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for thrombosis and very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for the outcomes multiple organ dysfunction and cerebrovascular accident. Physiological triggers Nine trials in adults (3818 participants) and one trial in children (100 participants) were identified. These tested different interventions and measures of physiological parameters in diverse clinical populations. The risk of bias was variable. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity.

Authors' Conclusions

A restrictive transfusion strategy significantly decreased the proportion of adults and children exposed to RBC transfusion. In most clinical contexts, there was no evidence of harm from a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Neurocritically ill patients, however, have better neurological outcomes at 6 to 12 months with a liberal transfusion strategy. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes beyond mortality, and to what degree the optimal strategies for transfusion should be modified in some patient populations, including different types of acute bleeding, cancers and subgroups of patients with myocardial infarction and other neurological injuries. New studies need to recognise the clinical context and the limitations of the adoption of a single threshold of haemoglobin, and to consider evaluating the use of physiological parameters to modify transfusion.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than in others because of inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognised as the standard of care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials through updated searches: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searching that was in the process of being published (in February 2021), and we were able to include it before this review was finalised.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children, or both. We excluded studies that focused on neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups on the basis of different transfusion schedules or thresholds or 'triggers'. These thresholds would be defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) concentration below which an RBC transfusion would be administered; the haemoglobin concentration remains the most commonly applied marker of the need for RBC transfusion in clinical practice. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. As in previous versions of this review, we did not exclude unregistered trials published after 2010 (as per the policy of the Cochrane Injuries Group, 2015), however, we did conduct analyses to consider the differential impact of results of trials for which prospective registration could not be confirmed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified trials for inclusion and extracted data using Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group.

Main Results

A total of 48 trials, involving data from 21,433 participants (at baseline), across a range of clinical contexts (e.g. orthopaedic, cardiac, or vascular surgery; critical care; acute blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding); acute coronary syndrome; cancer; leukaemia; haematological malignancies), met the eligibility criteria. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials (36) was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Most trials included only adults; three trials focused on children. The included studies were generally at low risk of bias for key domains including allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.66; 42 studies, 20,057 participants; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 96%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; 31 studies, 16,729 participants; I² = 30%; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (all high-quality evidence)). High-quality evidence shows that the liberal transfusion threshold did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound infection, or bacteraemia). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon and were inconsistently reported within trials. We noted less certainty in the strength of evidence to support the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds for the following predefined clinical subgroups: myocardial infarction, vascular surgery, haematological malignancies, and chronic bone-marrow disorders.

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusion at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration decreased the proportion of people exposed to RBC transfusion by 41% across a broad range of clinical contexts. Across all trials, no evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacted 30-day mortality, mortality at other time points, or morbidity (i.e. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Despite including 17 more randomised trials (and 8846 participants), data remain insufficient to inform the safety of transfusion policies in important and selected clinical contexts, such as myocardial infarction, chronic cardiovascular disease, neurological injury or traumatic brain injury, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and cancer or haematological malignancies, including chronic bone marrow failure. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes other than mortality. Most trials compared only two separate thresholds for haemoglobin concentration, which may not identify the actual optimal threshold for transfusion in a particular patient. Haemoglobin concentration may not be the most informative marker of the need for transfusion in individual patients with different degrees of physiological adaptation to anaemia. Notwithstanding these issues, overall findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds between the range of 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. Some patient subgroups might benefit from RBCs to maintain higher haemoglobin concentrations; research efforts should focus on these clinical contexts.

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary? [^116uQZMW]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several conditions can affect the number of platelets (PLT) in the blood, including hematological malignancies and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. PLTs are important for primary hemostasis, and a reduced PLT count could result in prolonged bleeding time at the site of injury. Thrombocytopenia is commonly defined as a PLT count of < 150 × 10⁹ /L. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guiding Document "Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)" recommends four grades of severity for thrombocytopenia.

Few studies have been published on the management of dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia. Varying guidelines and recommendations have been proposed internationally. Many state that prophylactic PLT transfusions should be administered before dentoalveolar surgery if patients have a PLT count of < 50 × 10⁹ /L. This threshold has been used in dental procedures; it is an extrapolation from surgical guidelines and lacks solid scientific support.

Because PLT transfusions are expensive and not without risk, it is important to evaluate whether they are needed and should be used before dentoalveolar surgery. Units of PLT are in high demand in hospital settings and their use should not be unnecessarily squandered.

Earlier studies and reviews in dentoalveolar surgery have observed no significant difference in the incidence of POB between patients who have received prophylactic PLT transfusions and those who have not. The PLT count threshold for inclusion in previous studies has generally been < 100 × 10⁹ /L, and medications that could affect hemostasis have not always been excluded.

Thus, this study retrospectively evaluated POB complications in patients with a PLT count of ≤ 75 × 10⁹ /L prior to dentoalveolar surgery and had received no other anticoagulant medication that would affect hemostasis, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The primary aim was to evaluate differences in POB frequency among patients who had received prophylactic PLT transfusion and those who had not. The secondary aim was to evaluate differences and independent risks between the POB group and the non-postoperative bleeding (NPOB) group regarding hematological diagnosis, dental diagnosis, CTCAE grade, type of dentoalveolar surgery, and use of local hemostatic treatment.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^111s6hRE]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Although platelets play a pivotal role in haemostasis after injury, the threshold and timing of platelet transfusion in trauma patients is controversial. In initial acute blood loss, the bone marrow and spleen variably release platelets into the circulation, and therefore their decrease in the peripheral blood is delayed. As a result, platelet counts are typically within the normal range (150 × 10 9 /L to 400 × 10 9 /L) during early traumatic coagulopathy. Upon admission, platelet count < 150 × 10 9 /L has been reported in only 4% of trauma patients with an ISS of 5 and in 18% of patients with ISS > 5. Platelet counts decreased markedly in the 2 h following hospital admission and 1 × 10 9 /L/h over the next 22 h, suggesting an important role for the treatment administered. A platelet count of 50 × 10 9 /L may be anticipated when approximately two blood volumes have been replaced by fluid or red cell components.

However, platelet count on admission may be predictive of outcome, as documented in some cohorts of massively transfused trauma patients, in which platelet count was inversely correlated with injury severity, morbidity and mortality. A low or decreasing platelet count also predicts greater mortality in trauma patients and a lower than normal platelet count predicts progression of ICH, need for neurosurgical intervention and mortality after TBI.

Although the platelet count may have a predictive value for outcome, platelet transfusion to increase the number of platelets has contradictory effects. Proactive administration of platelets in patients with massive bleeding due to ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysms increased survival from 30 to 45% when the platelet count was > 50 × 10 9 /L as compared with < 50 × 10 9 /L and further increased to 69% for those with platelet count > 100 × 10 9 /L. In contrast, platelet transfusion did not restore the platelet count in trauma patients in one study and did not influence the outcome in patients with TBI and moderate thrombocytopenia (50–107 × 10 9 /L). Accordingly, at this time, there is weak scientific evidence to support a particular platelet count threshold for platelet transfusion in the severe bleeding trauma patient.

### Postoperative bleeding after dentoalveolar surgery in patients with thrombocytopenia-are prophylactic platelet transfusions necessary? [^112Ymab5]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Karasneh et al. found no evidence in their systematic review to support the long-standing PLT count threshold of < 50 × 10⁹ /L for administration of prophylactic PLT transfusion prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The 2018 clinical practice guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended a threshold of 40–50 × 10⁹ /L for prophylactic PLT transfusion before major invasive surgery on patients with no other associated coagulation abnormalities. For bone marrow aspirations, bone marrow biopsies, and the removal of central venous catheters, ASCO recommendations state that patients with a PLT count of < 20 × 10⁹ /L do not require prophylactic PLT transfusions.

One unit of PLT costs approximately USD 528 in Sweden and up to USD 4,436 in the US. Over the course of our study (12 years), our cohort had received 86 units of PLT, at a cost of roughly USD 43,000 in Sweden and USD 382,000 in the US. Our data demonstrated no significant reduction in the incidence of POB when prophylactic platelet transfusions were administered prior to dentoalveolar surgery. The lack of benefit in this setting, in combination with the shortage of blood components and the high costs associated with transfusion, argue for a more restrictive PLT transfusion strategy compared with current recommendations in several international guidelines.

The clinical outcome of PLT transfusion is also unpredictable. The recent Karlström et al. study on 40 patients with severe thrombocytopenia reported the effect of PLT transfusion by measuring PLT count at three time points: before transfusion, 1 h after transfusion, and 18–24 h after transfusion. One hour after transfusion, the mean PLT count increment was 14.6 × 10⁹ /L and after 18–24 h, 7.1 × 10⁹ /L. Interestingly, this study showed that the increment in PLT count was less than 7.5 × 10⁹ /L in over one-third (35%) of the patients. In our study, only 18.8% of the transfused patients had a post-transfusion PLT count taken so the effect on PLT count cannot be robustly evaluated.

### Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113n3z7r]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation

Decisions about platelet or FFP transfusions in critically ill patients should consider factors such as worsening alloimmunization in highly alloimmunized patients. Patients at high risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, hematologic malignancy, or antiplatelet medications may require different thresholds. Conditions such as massive splenomegaly, von Willebrand disease, or presence of antiplatelet antibodies can affect the accuracy of circulating platelet levels as indicators of bleeding risk. For patients who decline transfusions based on personal or religious beliefs, clinicians should align the medical plan with patient values after thorough discussion.

Initiatives to unify institutional practices and reduce unnecessary platelet transfusions have shown success. These initiatives resulted in a 25% reduction in units transfused, decreasing platelet wastage, and significantly reducing costs, demonstrating the potential for sustainable, impactful changes.

### Use of platelet transfusions prior to lumbar punctures or epidural anaesthesia for the prevention of complications in people with thrombocytopenia [^111sCaMp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require lumbar punctures or an epidural anaesthetic. Lumbar punctures can be diagnostic (haematological malignancies, epidural haematoma, meningitis) or therapeutic (spinal anaesthetic, administration of chemotherapy). Epidural catheters are placed for administration of epidural anaesthetic. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to lumbar punctures and epidural anaesthesia, in order to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended prior to these procedures varies significantly from country to country. This indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians of the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding appears to be low but if bleeding occurs it can be very serious (spinal haematoma). Therefore, people may be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthesia in people with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 3 March 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in people of any age with thrombocytopenia requiring insertion of a lumbar puncture needle or epidural catheter. We only included RCTs published in English.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified no completed or ongoing RCTs in English. We did not exclude any completed or ongoing RCTs because they were published in another language.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from RCTs to determine what is the correct platelet transfusion threshold prior to insertion of a lumbar puncture needle or epidural catheter. There are no ongoing registered RCTs assessing the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a lumbar puncture or epidural anaesthesia in people with thrombocytopenia. Any future RCT would need to be very large to detect a difference in the risk of bleeding. We would need to design a study with at least 47,030 participants to be able to detect an increase in the number of people who had major procedure-related bleeding from 1 in 1000 to 2 in 1000.

2. Platelets

Evidence summary

We identified only one retrospective cohort study examining platelet transfusion in thrombocytopenic patients who had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and had a platelet transfusion. The study had two cohorts (1) participants with ICH with reduced platelet activity based on the aspirin response test who received platelets (2) participants with ICH who received platelets. Each cohort was compared to aspirin responders and participants with ICH who did not receive platelets; outcomes examined included hematoma volume and expansion. There was no effect in hematoma size (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34–1.47) or expansion (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.92–2.24, very low certainty).

Justification

The evidence is of very low certainty due to the absence of studies evaluating platelet transfusion thresholds in bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia. The clinical effects and resource implications of higher vs lower platelet transfusion thresholds in bleeding patients are unclear. As a result, the TF did not make a specific recommendation of transfusion thresholds for patients with non-massive bleeding.

Implementation issues

We make no recommendation for the use of a restrictive or a liberal platelet transfusion threshold in bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia, and as such either strategy could be considered based on individual patient characteristics. However, recommendations made in Part 1 of the guidelines set lower limits after which prophylactic platelet transfusion should be considered, irrespective of bleeding.

### Preoperative platelet and international normalized ratio thresholds and risk of complications after primary hip fracture surgery [^1134sG9t]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A paucity of data exists on safe platelet and international normalized ratio (INR) thresholds for hip fracture surgery. Recent work has called into question the safety of preoperative INRs < 1.5 for total knee arthroplasty, and optimal platelet thresholds are unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the risk of 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with thrombocytopenia or elevated INRs undergoing hip fracture surgery.

Methods

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients undergoing surgical treatment of a native hip fracture from 2012 to 2017 (N = 86,850). Patient demographic, laboratory, and complication data were collected. Patients with preoperative platelet counts or INRs within one day of surgery were included for analysis. Preoperative platelet counts and INRs were divided into four groups (< 50 k/μL, ≥ 50 k to 100 k/μL, ≥ 100 k to 150 k/μL, ≥ 150 k/μL, and ≤ 1.0, > 1.0 to 1.5, > 1.5 to 2.0, and > 2.0, respectively). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the independent association between platelet count and INR on bleeding complications requiring transfusion, wound complications, reoperations, readmissions, and deaths.

Results

A total of 72,306 and 56,027 patients were included for analysis of preoperative platelet and INR levels, respectively. In reference to platelet levels ≥ 150 k/μL, a notably increased risk of bleeding events was observed for patients with platelet counts ≥ 100 k to 150 k/μL (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.27), ≥ 50 to 100 k/μL (OR 1.85, 1.69 to 2.03), and < 50 k/μL (OR 1.60, 1.25 to 2.04). Decreasing platelet counts were associated with a stepwise increased risk of mortality from OR 1.12 (1.02 to 1.22) for platelet counts ≥ 100 k to 150 k/μL to OR 1.63 (1.41 to 1.90) and OR 1.59 (1.06 to 2.39) for platelet counts ≥ 50 k to 100 k/μL and < 50 k/μL, respectively. Elevated INR was associated with an increased risk of reoperations, readmissions, and death (P < 0.001 for all), with largest effect sizes observed starting at INRs > 1.5.

Discussion

The results of this study suggest that preoperative platelet thresholds of < 100,000/μL and INR thresholds of 1.5 serve as an important risk factor for complications after hip fracture surgery. Future work is warranted to determine whether preoperative platelet transfusions and/or INR reversal will improve outcomes for these patients.

Level Of Evidence

Prognostic Level III.

### Comparison of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of central lines in patients with thrombocytopenia [^116ppfmV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) often require the insertion of central lines (central venous catheters (CVCs)). CVCs have a number of uses; these include: administration of chemotherapy; intensive monitoring and treatment of critically-ill patients; administration of total parenteral nutrition; and long-term intermittent intravenous access for patients requiring repeated treatments. Current practice in many countries is to correct thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions prior to CVC insertion, in order to mitigate the risk of serious procedure-related bleeding. However, the platelet count threshold recommended prior to CVC insertion varies significantly from country to country. This indicates significant uncertainty among clinicians of the correct management of these patients. The risk of bleeding after a central line insertion appears to be low if an ultrasound-guided technique is used. Patients may therefore be exposed to the risks of a platelet transfusion without any obvious clinical benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to the insertion of a central line in patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1950) and ongoing trial databases to 23 February 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in patients of any age with thrombocytopenia requiring insertion of a CVC.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

One RCT was identified that compared different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of a CVC in people with chronic liver disease. This study is still recruiting participants (expected recruitment: up to 165 participants) and is due to be completed in December 2017. There were no completed studies. There were no studies that compared no platelet transfusions to a platelet transfusion threshold.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from RCTs to determine whether platelet transfusions are required prior to central line insertion in patients with thrombocytopenia, and, if a platelet transfusion is required, what is the correct platelet transfusion threshold. Further randomised trials with robust methodology are required to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for such patients. The one ongoing RCT involving people with cirrhosis will not be able to answer this review's questions, because it is a small study that assesses one patient group and does not address all of the comparisons included in this review. To detect an increase in the proportion of participants who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100 would require a study containing at least 4634 participants (80% power, 5% significance).

### Clinical trials evaluating red blood cell transfusion thresholds: an updated systematic review and with additional focus on patients with cardiovascular disease [^111NJXYT]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several new trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with cardiovascular disease have recently been published, increasing the number of enrolled patients by over 30%. The objective was to evaluate transfusion thresholds in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Methods

We conducted an updated systematic review of randomized trials that compared patients assigned to maintain a lower (restrictive transfusion strategy) or higher (liberal transfusion strategy) hemoglobin concentration. We focused on new trial data in patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Specific subgroups were patients undergoing cardiac surgery and with acute myocardial infarction.

Results

A total of 37 trials that enrolled 19,049 patients were appraised. In cardiac surgery, mortality at 30days was comparable between groups (risk ratio 0.99; 95% confidence interval 0.74–1.33). In 2 small trials (n = 154) in patients with myocardial infarction, the point estimate for the mortality risk ratio was 3.88 (95% CI, 0.83–18.13) favoring the liberal strategy. Overall, from 26 trials enrolling 15,681 patients, 30-day mortality was not different between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies (risk ratio 1.0, 95% CI, 0.86–1.16). Overall and in the cardiovascular disease subgroup, there were no significant differences observed across a range of secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

New trials in patients undergoing cardiac surgery establish that a restrictive transfusion strategy of 7 to 8g/dL is safe and decreased red cell use by 24%. Further research is needed to define the optimal transfusion threshold in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

### Platelet transfusion: a clinical practice guideline from the AABB [^115wm2Gc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The AABB (formerly, the American Association of Blood Banks) developed this guideline on appropriate use of platelet transfusion in adult patients.

Methods

These guidelines are based on a systematic review of randomized, clinical trials and observational studies (1900 to September 2014) that reported clinical outcomes on patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic platelet transfusions. An expert panel reviewed the data and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Recommendation 1

The AABB recommends that platelets should be transfused prophylactically to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding in hospitalized adult patients with therapy-induced hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. The AABB recommends transfusing hospitalized adult patients with a platelet count of 10 × 10⁹ cells/L or less to reduce the risk for spontaneous bleeding. The AABB recommends transfusing up to a single apheresis unit or equivalent. Greater doses are not more effective, and lower doses equal to one half of a standard apheresis unit are equally effective. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective central venous catheter placement with a platelet count less than 20 × 10⁹ cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having elective diagnostic lumbar puncture with a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹ cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

The AABB suggests prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients having major elective nonneuraxial surgery with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 cells/L. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 5

The AABB recommends against routine prophylactic platelet transfusion for patients who are nonthrombocytopenic and have cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The AABB suggests platelet transfusion for patients having bypass who exhibit perioperative bleeding with thrombocytopenia and/or evidence of platelet dysfunction. (Grade: weak recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

Recommendation 6

The AABB cannot recommend for or against platelet transfusion for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who have intracranial hemorrhage (traumatic or spontaneous). (Grade: uncertain recommendation; very-low-quality evidence).

### Transfusion practice in the non-bleeding critically ill: an international online survey-the TRACE survey [^113Pfi8N]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the last decade, multiple large randomized controlled trials have studied alternative transfusion strategies in critically ill patients, demonstrating the safety of restrictive transfusion strategies. Due to the lack of international guidelines specific for the intensive care unit (ICU), we hypothesized that a large heterogeneity in transfusion practice in this patient population exists. The aims of this study were to describe the current transfusion practices and identify the knowledge gaps.

Methods

An online, anonymous, worldwide survey among ICU physicians was performed evaluating red blood cell, platelet and plasma transfusion practices. Furthermore, the presence of a hospital- or ICU-specific transfusion guideline was asked. Only completed surveys were analysed.

Results

Nine hundred forty-seven respondents filled in the survey of which 725 could be analysed. Hospital transfusion protocol available in their ICU was reported by 53% of the respondents. Only 29% of respondents used an ICU-specific transfusion guideline. The reported haemoglobin (Hb) threshold for the general ICU population was 7 g/dL (7–7). The highest reported variation in transfusion threshold was in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with brain injury (8 g/dL (7.0–9.0)). Platelets were transfused at a median count of 20 × 10 9 cells/L IQR (10–25) in asymptomatic patients, but at a higher count prior to invasive procedures (p < 0.001). In patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) > 3, 43% and 57% of the respondents would consider plasma transfusion without any upcoming procedures or prior to a planned invasive procedure, respectively. Finally, doctors with base specialty in anaesthesiology transfused critically ill patients more liberally compared to internal medicine physicians.

Conclusion

Red blood cell transfusion practice for the general ICU population is restrictive, while for different subpopulations, higher Hb thresholds are applied. Furthermore, practice in plasma and platelet transfusion is heterogeneous, and local transfusion guidelines are lacking in the majority of the ICUs.

### Management of severe peri-operative bleeding: guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care: second update 2022 [^115Cqj3z]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for platelet transfusion, more specifically with respect to indications for transfusion, antiplatelet therapy, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering platelet transfusion (0.7×10¹¹ per 10 kg body weight in adults) for intraoperative or postoperative bleeding (such as in neurosurgery) supposedly related to aspirin.
