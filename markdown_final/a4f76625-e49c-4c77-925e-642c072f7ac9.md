## Question

Peginterferon-alpha for ulcerative colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether peginterferon-alpha (peginterferon alfa-2a) should be used for ulcerative colitis and what role it has in treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether interferon is even indicated for UC. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale in UC. Next, I will need to examine randomized and observational clinical evidence for efficacy and safety. After that, I should compare these findings to contemporary guideline-recommended therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and note any special circumstances, such as viral hepatitis co-treatment scenarios, that might influence decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the basic indication and context. Peginterferon alfa-2a is FDA-approved for hepatitis B and C, not for ulcerative colitis, so any use in UC would be off-label; I need to ensure I am not overlooking a label change or new guidance, and no such update appears in the provided FDA materials or modern UC guidelines, which instead emphasize targeted biologics and small molecules for moderate-to-severe disease [^1148HZ9V] [^113BxFur] [^114qHe3L] [^115FP6i9]. Wait, let me verify guideline scope: neither AGA nor ECCO nor ACG documents list interferon-alpha among recommended options for UC induction or maintenance, which supports that interferon is not part of standard care pathways [^113BxFur] [^114qHe3L] [^115FP6i9].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic rationale because theoretical plausibility sometimes prompts trials despite absent labeling. Type I interferons are immunoregulatory and were hypothesized to rebalance Th1/Th2 skewing in UC, but this remains speculative and low-certainty; I need to check whether robust mechanistic UC data exist, and the available synthesis frames this as a hypothesis rather than established pathobiology in UC [^1126Ug2a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: there was also an interferon beta-1a signal in a very small dose-escalation study suggesting remission in some patients, but that trial was underpowered and not definitive, so I should be cautious about generalizing to interferon-alpha or to broader UC populations [^111ZDCXF] [^1126Ug2a].

> I will now examine clinical efficacy. The pivotal randomized, placebo-controlled trial in active UC (Gut 2003) compared weekly pegylated interferon alpha at 0.5 or 1.0 mcg/kg versus placebo for 12 weeks; clinical remission at week 12 was 47% (low dose), 33% (high dose), and 35% (placebo), with no statistically significant difference, indicating lack of efficacy for induction of remission at those doses and duration [^113njyVb]. Wait, let me double-check for corroborating trials: an earlier small open-label study comparing systemic IFN-α2a to prednisolone enemas suggested symptomatic improvement but no superiority and important methodological limitations, reinforcing that high-quality evidence for benefit is lacking [^111gVxAo] [^1126Ug2a]. Hold on, I should verify whether any modern RCTs exist; based on the provided evidence set and a Cochrane protocol noting sparse trials, there are no contemporary, adequately powered RCTs confirming benefit of type I interferons in UC [^1126Ug2a].

> Safety needs careful scrutiny because interferons carry class risks that may intersect poorly with immune-mediated diseases. The FDA label for peginterferon alfa-2a includes boxed warnings for serious neuropsychiatric adverse events, serious infections, and warnings about exacerbation or induction of autoimmune disorders and cerebrovascular events; I need to ensure these risks are weighed in UC, where immune dysregulation is intrinsic to disease biology [^1148HZ9V]. Let me verify trial-specific safety signals: in the UC RCT, serious adverse events occurred only in the peginterferon arms, including hospitalizations for UC flares, a thrombosis, and a generalized seizure, which is concerning despite the authors' statement about safety at the doses used; that statement appears inconsistent with the imbalance in serious events, so I should highlight that discrepancy explicitly [^113njyVb]. But wait, what if interferon can unmask or trigger IBD activity de novo? Case reports describe onset of IBD during interferon-based therapy for hepatitis C, supporting biological plausibility for disease exacerbation in susceptible hosts [^116enZMN] [^1148HZ9V].

> Next, I should review how this compares to current standard of care recommended by guidelines. Modern management of moderate-to-severe UC prioritizes agents with demonstrated superiority over placebo in multiple large RCTs, including anti-TNF agents, anti-IL-12/23 and anti-IL-23 agents, anti-integrin therapy, and JAK inhibitors; interferon-alpha is notably absent from these pathways, reinforcing it is not recommended [^113BxFur] [^114qHe3L] [^115FP6i9]. Let me consider concrete options and dosing to anchor alternatives: for example, upadacitinib induction at 45 mg daily for 8 weeks with 15–30 mg daily maintenance, tofacitinib XR induction at 22 mg daily then 11 mg daily maintenance, and ustekinumab or mirikizumab per their labeled induction-maintenance regimens, each with established efficacy-safety profiles in UC RCTs and labels [^115nfiV7] [^116GNUcL] [^1178zFp3] [^113tKDJ5]. Hold on, I should verify the anti-integrin context as well: vedolizumab is guideline-endorsed and mechanistically targeted to gut-homing, with supportive translational data, further emphasizing the availability of safer, disease-specific options over broad interferon immunomodulation [^113BxFur] [^115qWP6b].

> Synthesizing these points, I should confirm the overall recommendation. Peginterferon-alpha is not recommended for UC given lack of efficacy in the only placebo-controlled RCT, signal for serious adverse events including disease flares, and boxed label risks that intersect with autoimmune pathophysiology; guidelines do not include interferon among UC therapies, and multiple targeted options with reproducible efficacy and manageable safety exist [^113njyVb] [^1148HZ9V] [^113BxFur] [^114qHe3L]. Hmm, wait a minute — could niche scenarios justify it? Even in coexisting viral hepatitis, coordination with hepatology generally favors direct-acting antivirals for HCV and antiviral prophylaxis for HBV when immunosuppression is used, rather than selecting interferon to treat UC, so the UC component should still be managed with guideline-supported agents [^114g8yur] [^114qHe3L].

> I should also confirm practical next steps consistent with treat-to-target UC care. Treat toward endoscopic improvement with steroid-free remission, and if escalation is needed, select among guideline-endorsed classes based on prior exposure, comorbidities, speed of onset, infection risks, pregnancy plans, and patient preference; use biomarkers and, when appropriate, endoscopy to guide and verify response rather than pivoting to interferon [^115FP6i9] [^111m14gd] [^113BxFur]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring guidance: fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and CRP are appropriate adjuncts to assess inflammation and response, reducing unnecessary empiric changes without objective activity, which aligns with modern algorithms [^111m14gd] [^1171mW5q].

> Final recommendation, after double-checking the evidence and guidelines: Do not initiate peginterferon-alpha for ulcerative colitis outside of a rigorously designed clinical trial; instead, optimize evidence-based therapies such as anti-TNF, anti-IL-23/IL-12/23, anti-integrin, or JAK inhibitors with appropriate monitoring and safety precautions, and coordinate care if viral hepatitis coexists to avoid exacerbating UC or exposing patients to interferon-related harms without proven UC benefit [^113njyVb] [^1148HZ9V] [^113BxFur] [^114g8yur].

Peginterferon-alpha is **not effective** for induction [^1126Ug2a] or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, with randomized trials showing no significant benefit over placebo [^113njyVb]. It is **not recommended** by current AGA or ECCO guidelines [^1113q8tQ], and is associated with substantial adverse effects including flu-like symptoms, cytopenias, neuropsychiatric events [^1148HZ9V], and autoimmune exacerbations. Modern therapies such as anti-TNFs [^1113q8tQ], vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors [^113BxFur] are preferred for moderate-to-severe UC [^114qHe3L].

---

## Mechanism of action

Peginterferon-alpha binds the type I interferon receptor, **activating JAK/STAT signaling** and exerting broad immunomodulatory effects [^11676Tvm]. In UC, it was hypothesized to shift Th2-predominant inflammation toward Th1; however, clinical trials did not show meaningful benefit [^1126Ug2a].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy

### Induction of remission

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 60) found **no significant difference** in clinical remission at 12 weeks between peginterferon-alpha and placebo (33–47% vs 35%; p = NS) [^113njyVb]. A Cochrane review concluded that type I interferons, including peginterferon-alpha, are ineffective for induction of remission in UC [^1126Ug2a].

---

### Maintenance of remission

There is **no evidence** supporting peginterferon-alpha for maintenance of remission in UC.

---

## Safety and tolerability

Peginterferon-alpha has a significant adverse effect profile, with **common adverse effects** including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, cytopenias, neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety), and autoimmune exacerbations [^116z5e9d]. Serious adverse events such as **seizures, thrombosis, and severe infections** have also been reported [^113njyVb] [^1148HZ9V].

## Comparison with other biologic therapies

| **Therapy** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Peginterferon-alpha | Ineffective [^113njyVb] | Poor tolerability [^1148HZ9V] | Not recommended [^114qHe3L] |
| Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) | Effective for induction and maintenance [^1113q8tQ] | Moderate safety profile | Recommended |
| Vedolizumab | Effective for induction and maintenance | Favorable safety profile | Recommended |
| Ustekinumab | Effective for induction and maintenance | Favorable safety profile [^1178zFp3] | Recommended |
| JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) | - Effective [^116GNUcL] <br/> - Especially post-TNF failure [^113BxFur] | Moderate safety profile | Recommended |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

AGA 2024 guidelines recommend anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and JAK inhibitors [^113BxFur] for moderate-to-severe UC [^1113q8tQ]; peginterferon-alpha is **neither mentioned nor recommended**. ECCO 2022 guidelines recommend anti-TNFs for maintenance of remission; peginterferon-alpha is **not recommended** [^114qHe3L].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

There are **no specific patient populations** or clinical scenarios where peginterferon-alpha is recommended for UC [^1113q8tQ].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and future research

There are **no ongoing clinical trials** or significant future research efforts focused on peginterferon-alpha for UC.

---

Peginterferon-alpha is **not effective** [^1126Ug2a] for UC and is not recommended by current guidelines [^1113q8tQ] due to its adverse effect profile and lack of efficacy. Modern biologics and JAK inhibitors are preferred for moderate-to-severe UC [^114qHe3L].

### Type I interferons for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^1126Ug2a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines which possess immunoregulatory properties and have been used to successfully treat a number of chronic inflammatory disorders. It has been postulated that Type I IFNs may be able to re-establish the Th1/Th2 balance in Th2 predominant diseases like ulcerative colitis.

- **Objectives**: To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of type I IFN therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialised register, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to August 8, 2014. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings, were manually searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of type I IFNs for induction of remission in UC were included. The study population included patients of any age with active ulcerative colitis. There were no exclusions based on type, dose, or duration of IFN treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two independent authors reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was induction of remission of ulcerative colitis. Secondary outcomes included time to remission, mean change in disease activity index score, clinical, histological or endoscopic improvement, improvement in quality of life, and adverse events.

We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding statistics.

### A randomised placebo controlled trial of pegylated interferon alpha in active ulcerative colitis [^113njyVb]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Pilot studies of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) suggest a high remission rate in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the safety of pegylated interferon alpha (PegIFN) and its role in induction of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis, in a multicentre placebo controlled trial.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with a clinical activity score (CAI) of greater than six were randomised to receive placebo (n = 20), PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg (n = 19), or PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg body weight (n = 21) once weekly (PegIntron; Schering-Plough, USA) over 12 weeks. Patients receiving 5-aminosalicylates, steroids, and/or azathioprine in stable dosages were included.

- **Results**: Serious adverse events were seen in none of the placebo patients, in 3/19 patients in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group (hospitalisation due to disease flare-up, n = 3), and in 3/21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (hospitalisation due to disease flare-up, n = 1; thrombosis, n = 1; grand mal seizure, n = 1). Otherwise, we observed only minor IFN-alpha side effects. Clinical remission rates at week 12 (CAI ≤ 4) were 7/20 (35%) in the placebo group, 9/19 (47%) in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and 7/21 (33%) in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group (NS). Early withdrawal from the study was observed in 11/20 placebo patients, in 6/19 in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and in 10/21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group, mainly due to lack of efficacy. The higher PegIFN dose was associated with a significant decrease in levels of C reactive protein (p = 0.003, day 0 vs 85).

- **Conclusions**: PegIFN is safe but not effective at the dosages used.

### The impact of biological interventions for ulcerative colitis on health-related quality of life [^116pRtmD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon with a relapsing-remitting course. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is significantly lower in patients with UC compared to the general population, due to the negative effects of the disease on physical, psychological, and social well-being. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating medical interventions for UC have traditionally used clinical disease activity indices focused on symptoms to define primary outcomes, such as clinical remission or improvement. However, this approach does not evaluate benefits highly relevant to patients, such as HRQL.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to assess the impact of biologic therapy on the HRQL of UC patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from inception to September 2015. Conference abstracts and reference lists were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs that compared biologics to placebo in UC patients and reported on HRQL using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), or the SF-36 or EQ-5D to measure HRQL, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was improvement in HRQL. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was assessed using GRADE.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111m14gd]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ulcerative colitis, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend considering the assessment of fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, or CRP to rule in active inflammation. This approach helps inform treatment adjustments and avoids relying solely on endoscopic assessments to establish the presence of active disease in patients with ulcerative colitis experiencing moderate-to-severe symptoms suggestive of a flare.

### Certolizumab pegol for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^113kxbx6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In this article, we provide a contemporary overview of available clinical data on certolizumab pegol, a pegylated anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha agent that comprises a uniquely small protein, and its emerging role as a therapy for Crohn's disease (CD). The results from a comprehensive clinical trial program suggest that certolizumab pegol offers rapid and sustained remission of moderate to severe CD. Certolizumab pegol is an effective and well-tolerated therapy both in patients who have already received biologics and in patients who are anti-TNF naïve. Benefits of therapy include a stable dosing regimen, which allows for rapid induction of a clinical response followed by long-term maintenance of response and remission under one fixed dose. Treatment with certolizumab pegol has been shown to improve function and quality of life in patients with CD, and insights into the potential mechanisms by which certolizumab pegol effects a response in CD suggest that this agent may have the potential to slow or even modify disease progression. Early therapy is particularly effective and could help control CD progression and lessen the burden of disease on patients.

### Inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis: role of high-dose, extended-release mesalamine [^112yKQpH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

In mild-to-moderate inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) remains a cornerstone of therapy. Sulfasalazine, originally synthesized in 1940 as an arthritis treatment for Sweden's King Gustaf V, is an azo-linked compound between 5-ASA and sulfapyridine. This medication was soon discovered to be effective in treating ulcerative colitis. However, dose-related side effects of the sulfapyridine moiety led to considerable effort in developing medications to deliver 5-ASA to the desired parts of the intestine. The newest generation of 5-ASA medications allows high-dose medication delivery with decreased pill burden, thereby improving patient compliance.

This review will describe the pharmacokinetics of various 5-ASA preparations, particularly focusing on high-dose formulations and their role in therapy; will examine scientific literature; and will review clinical outcomes and safety profiles.

### Efficacy of vedolizumab during intravenous induction therapy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: Post hoc analysis of patient-reported outcomes from the VISIBLE 1 and 2 studies [^112oU2Wr]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Patient-reported outcomes from the VISIBLE 1 and 2 studies shed light on the efficacy of vedolizumab during intravenous induction therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).

- **Patient-reported UC symptoms**: During vedolizumab intravenous induction, there were weekly mean changes from baseline. Stool frequency (SF) subscores were analyzed for (a) the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients, as well as (b) the overall population and patients with moderate or severe disease at baseline. Rectal bleeding (RB) subscores were reviewed for (c) the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients, and (d) the overall population and patients with moderate or severe disease at baseline. Error bars indicate positive or negative standard deviations (SDs) of the mean values.

- **UC symptom improvement**: SF improvement in patients with UC was evaluated for (a) the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients, and (b) the overall population and patients with moderate or severe disease at baseline. RB improvements were identified in (c) the overall population, anti-TNFα-naive patients, and anti-TNFα-experienced patients, and (d) the overall population and patients with moderate or severe disease at baseline. SF improvement was defined as a Mayo SF subscore of 0, while RB improvement was defined as a reduction of ≥ 1 on the 4-point RB subscore from the Mayo score (0 for no blood; 1 for visible blood with stool < 50% of the time; 2 for visible blood with stool ≥ 50% of the time).

### Integrating anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: Current and future perspectives [^1143JLKj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two idiopathic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The manifestations of these diseases can be severe, often necessitating long-term therapy involving a variety of medications and/or surgery. Standard medical therapy typically consists of agents that either address suppurative complications or modulate the inflammatory cascade in a nonspecific manner.

Many specific chemokine and cytokine effectors that promote intestinal inflammation have been identified. This research has led to experimental clinical trials involving various cytokine antagonists. Among these, compounds directed against a particular cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), have demonstrated the greatest clinical efficacy at the time of writing. This aligns with scientific observations suggesting a central role for TNF in the inflammatory cascade.

Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF that has proven effective for treating Crohn's disease. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this use. Several other TNF antagonists are in various phases of investigation, including the monoclonal antibody CDP 571, the fusion peptide etanercept, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor oxpentifylline, and thalidomide. This paper reviews the clinical efficacy of these agents and the role of TNF in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Humira [^115JgH1z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial (Study PUC-I, NCT02065557) involving 93 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 with endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points, confirmed by centrally read endoscopy), who had an inadequate response or intolerance to therapy with corticosteroids and/or an immunomodulator (i.e. azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Fifteen out of 93 patients (16%) in the study had prior experience with a TNF blocker. Patients who received corticosteroids at enrollment were allowed to taper their corticosteroid therapy after Week 4.

Seventy-seven patients were initially randomized 3:2 to receive double-blind treatment with one of two dosages of Humira. Patients in both dosage groups received 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 0, 1.2 mg/kg (maximum of 80 mg) at Week 2, and 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 40 mg) at Weeks 4 and 6. The higher dosage group also received an additional dosage of 2.4 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) at Week 1. Following an amendment to the study design, 16 additional patients were enrolled and received open-label treatment with Humira at the higher dosage.

### Role of the tumor necrosis factor antagonists in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: an update [^117Lpn5P]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis represent the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent research highlights the role of uncontrolled intestinal inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBD. Therefore, there is a growing interest in developing novel biologic therapies targeting specific molecules of the inflammatory cascade. Among these, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents — such as infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol — have proven effective, especially for patients with refractory IBD. These biological therapies have altered, at least partially, the clinical course and medical management of IBD. However, the administration of anti-TNF drugs has also been associated with serious side-effects, raising concerns about their application in clinical practice. The goal of this review is to provide an update and analyze the pros and cons of using anti-TNF therapies in the treatment of IBD.

### Critical roles of RGS16 in the mucosal inflammation of ulcerative colitis [^114UCCWx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disorder. The regulator of the G-protein signaling (RGS) is involved in the pathogenesis of several immune system disorders. RGS16, a member of the RGS protein superfamily, has been shown to play critical roles in several immune system-related diseases. However, the roles of RGS16 in ulcerative colitis remain to be elucidated.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the expression of RGS16 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We performed Spearman's correlation to analyze the correlation between RGS16 expression and the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS), Mayo index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-17A levels. Further, PBMCs were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines in vitro.

- **Results**: RGS16 expression significantly increased in the colonic mucosa and PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis and significantly correlated with the Mayo index, UCEIS, ESR, and serum TNF-α and IL-17A levels. TNF-α upregulated RGS16 expression in PBMCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner via the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB) signaling pathway. Moreover, anti-TNF treatment with infliximab significantly decreased RGS16 expression in PBMCs and intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Conclusion**: Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which RGS16 expression in ulcerative colitis is positively correlated with disease severity and inflammatory markers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^113PEjen]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

In the 1990s, tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor therapy ushered in the biologic therapy era for inflammatory bowel disease, leading to marked improvements in treatment options and patient outcomes. There are currently four tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors approved as treatments for ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol. Despite the clear benefits of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors, a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease either do not respond, experience a loss of response after initial clinical improvement, or report intolerance to anti-tumour necrosis factor-α therapy.

Optimizing outcomes of these agents may be achieved through earlier intervention, the use of therapeutic drug monitoring, and thoughtful switching within class. To complement these approaches, evolving predictive biomarkers may help inform and optimize clinical decision making by identifying patients who might potentially benefit from an alternative treatment strategy. This review will focus on the use of tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease and the application of personalized medicine to improve future outcomes for all patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^114wPvom]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ulcerative colitis, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than implementing empiric treatment adjustment. This is particularly advised for patients with UC who exhibit mild symptoms and have normal stool or serum markers of inflammation, such as fecal calprotectin levels below 150 mcg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and normal CRP levels.

### Biological therapies in inflammatory bowel disease: Predictive factors of nonresponse [^115fz2B2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment modalities for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been rapidly expanding over the past years. Biological therapies are the leading choice of therapy in moderate and severe IBD, aiming to help patients achieve meaningful clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory responses. However, some patients are primary nonresponders, failing to show any response, while others relapse after an initial response, known as secondary nonresponders.

In this article, we review the mechanism of action of the currently available biological therapies for IBD. We examine the assessment of treatment response, the nonresponse rates to each therapy, clinical and laboratory factors affecting the efficacy of therapies, and suggested targeted drug levels.

### The role of early biologic therapy in inflammatory bowel disease [^111pTLTr]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The goals for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are changing from the elimination of symptoms toward complete disease control — a process that demands both clinical and endoscopic remission. This new IBD treatment paradigm has been shifting from a conventional "step-up" approach toward a more "top-down" early intervention treatment strategy. Recent studies suggest that the use of biologic agents, specifically those targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha, earlier in the treatment course improves patient outcomes and can prevent progression to irreversible bowel damage. Although the strategy of early intervention has accumulating evidence in Crohn's disease, there is less evidence supporting its impact in ulcerative colitis.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically concerning induction of remission in moderate-to-severe disease, the AGA 2024 guidelines discuss advanced therapy. They note that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of non-TNF antagonist biologics in combination with an immunomodulator over using a non-TNF biologic alone for the induction of remission in adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC.

### Anti-TNF alpha-induced paradoxical psoriasis treated with topical roflumilast 0.3 [^113c7yiS]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF alpha treatments have revolutionized the management of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory colitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis vulgaris. However, these treatments have been associated with several adverse effects, most notably paradoxical psoriasis, which is of particular importance to dermatologists. Some patients, such as those carrying the IL 23-R SNIP gene, are more at risk. The onset delay for paradoxical psoriasis varies, ranging from 1 to 30 months after the introduction of anti-TNF alpha injections.

Treatment options for paradoxical psoriasis remain limited, prompting either the addition of topical agents to minimize cutaneous inflammation or the eventual discontinuation of anti-TNF alpha injections. Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a highly selective and potent topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor approved in 2022 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis, including intertriginous areas. We report a case of a 61-year-old male with new-onset paradoxical palmoplantar psoriasis after adalimumab initiation that was successfully treated with roflumilast 0.3% once daily cream.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^115YzUgj]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically concerning the maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe disease with advanced therapy, the AGA 2024 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend withdrawing immunomodulators or continuing combination therapy. This applies to patients with ulcerative colitis in corticosteroid-free clinical remission for at least six months on a combination therapy of TNF antagonists and an immunomodulator.

### Golimumab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [^113PfsBk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Golimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in 2013 and was the third antitumor-necrosis-factor therapy after adalimumab and infliximab licensed for this indication. However, given it is the most recent of these drugs to become available, evidence regarding its optimal use and its positioning in relation to other biological therapies is only now emerging. In this article, we review the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of golimumab both in the setting of clinical trials and in 'real world' observational studies. We also explore the limited data available regarding the possible role of therapeutic-drug monitoring and dose flexibility.

### The impact of biological interventions on health-related quality of life in adults with Crohn's disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117XupbA]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

The evidence suggests infliximab and upadacitinib result in clinically meaningful improvement (CMI) in quality of life (QoL) assessed by the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) score change, with evidence ranging from very low to high certainty. No CMIs were observed for adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, ustekinumab, and natalizumab treatment, with certainty levels ranging from low to high. Considerable heterogeneity prevented us from pooling data in meta-analyses on vedolizumab and risankizumab treatment.

In all included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a statistically significant difference is achieved for at least one health-related quality of life (HRQoL) result, but a clinically meaningful significance is not achieved in many included analyses. Reaching statistical significance is only a precondition for achieving a clinically meaningful difference. From the patient perspective, a CMI in the HRQoL is a crucial point and treatment goal that should be achieved. Clinicians should be careful when interpreting results in terms of statistical significance. Improvement in QoL in Crohn's disease (CD) patients encompasses achieving clinical remission of disease, but van der Have and colleagues found that disease activity contributed to only 37% of HRQoL.

According to this observation, and considering that all included RCTs have not been powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in HRQoL outcomes, the fact that a CMI was not achieved in most of our analyses should not be simply interpreted as indicating there is no significant effect of biologicals on HRQoL. A few possible explanations could address our findings, including shortcomings in study design considering HRQoL outcomes as secondary, a heterogeneous participant population, and differences in inclusion criteria. For instance, the lack of…

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^112KNL91]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically in the context of induction of remission in cases of moderate-to-severe disease, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of adalimumab or golimumab in combination with an immunomodulator. This combination is preferred over monotherapy with adalimumab, golimumab, or an immunomodulator for the induction of remission in adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: A systematic review and clinician surveys [^113k51HX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Clinician response to treatment failure:

UK clinicians estimated that in patients with first-line treatment failure who showed signs of a reduced response, they would add another nonbiologic treatment, such as corticosteroids, in around 25% of cases. They would increase the dose of the existing biologic therapy in 21–24% of cases, increase the administration frequency in 17–25% of cases, and offer surgery as a treatment option in 20–22% of cases. When treatment alternatives in patients failing first-line biologic therapy were restricted to surgery or a switch to a second-line biologic, UK clinicians estimated that among UC patients failing IFX as a first-line anti-TNFα agent, around 50% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent and the other 50% would pursue surgery as a treatment option. Similarly, among ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent and 50% would pursue surgery. Among CD patients failing IFX, clinicians estimated that around 70% would switch to ADA as a second-line anti-TNFα agent, and the other 30% would pursue surgery as a treatment option. For ADA failures, around 50% would switch to IFX as a second-line anti-TNFα agent and 50% would pursue surgery.

French clinicians estimated that among patients with first-line treatment failure or a reduced response, around 18–39% would receive an additional nonbiologic treatment, such as corticosteroids. Around 12–33% would be administered an increased dose of the existing anti-TNFα agent, and the administration frequency would be increased in around 9–27% of patients.

### Tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) activity in the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^116TVEPJ]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies are effective in Crohn's disease and perhaps ulcerative colitis, but issues such as antigenicity and high cost have raised interest in alternative strategies to block TNF-alpha. One such strategy involves the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), which releases soluble TNF-alpha from transmembrane pro-TNF-alpha.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether TACE activity is present in human colonic mucosa.

- **Materials and methods**: Detergent extracts of cell membranes from colonic biopsies were obtained from 12 controls and 28 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Enzyme activity was measured by hydrolysis assays using pro-TNF-alpha or oligopeptide substrates spanning the known pro-TNF-alpha cleavage site at Ala(76)-Val(77). Cleavage products were identified by western blotting, high-pressure liquid chromatography, or mass spectrometry. TACE protein was localized by immunohistochemistry and identified by western blotting of detergent extracts from purified lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNC) or epithelial cells.

- **Results**: Detergent extracts released TNF-alpha from pro-TNF-alpha and cleaved a model oligopeptide as predicted. Substrate hydrolysis was sensitive to known TACE/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors but not to trocade, which has low activity against TACE. The median TACE level was increased in active ulcerative colitis (147 arbitrary units (AU)/mg; p < 0.01) but not in Crohn's disease (81 AU/mg) compared with controls (79 AU/mg). Both the full-length proform and the active form of TACE protein were expressed in LPMNC cells and epithelial cells.

### New insights into the mechanisms of action of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease [^1121MryF]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been widely accepted as a therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol, have revolutionized therapy for these chronic inflammatory disorders. These agents are potent inhibitors of TNF-α, but significant evidence suggests that their actions extend beyond simple neutralization of the cytokine.

Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs have uncovered previously unrecognized actions relevant to mediating their anti-inflammatory effects. Many of these actions are mediated by the binding of the antibodies to transmembrane TNF-α (tmTNF-α) and involve complex interactions with other molecular factors and cells. In this review, we have highlighted new information from in vitro and in vivo studies on the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs.

Despite obvious benefits in many patients, the clinical use of these antibodies is hampered by some patients not responding to them, and among those who do respond, many will redevelop the disease despite continued dosing. While pharmacokinetic factors explain some observed cases of partial or complete resistance to the effects of anti-TNF-α mAbs, other non-responder patients may be resistant to these agents' mechanism of action. A more thorough understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-TNF-α mAbs may allow the development of strategies to individualize treatment.

### Mucosal gene signatures to predict response to infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis [^113AqqUT]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

Infliximab is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis, with over 60% of patients responding to treatment and up to 30% reaching remission. The mechanism of resistance to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) is unknown. This study used colonic mucosal gene expression to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment in ulcerative colitis.

- **Methods**: Two cohorts of patients who received their first treatment with infliximab for refractory ulcerative colitis were studied. Response to infliximab was defined as endoscopic and histological healing. Total RNA from pre-treatment colonic mucosal biopsies was analyzed with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm microarray data.

- **Results**: For predicting response to infliximab treatment, pre-treatment colonic mucosal expression profiles were compared for responders and non-responders. Comparative analysis identified 179 differentially expressed probe sets in cohort A and 361 in cohort B, with an overlap of 74 probe sets, representing 53 known genes, between both analyses. Comparative analysis of both cohorts combined yielded 212 differentially expressed probe sets. The top five differentially expressed genes in a combined analysis of both cohorts were osteoprotegerin, stanniocalcin-1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2, and interleukin 11. All proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the adaptive immune response. These markers separated responders from non-responders with 95% sensitivity.

### Advances in the development of new biologics in inflammatory bowel disease [^112rMUAB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Infliximab and adalimumab are considered the mainstay of biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) over the last decade. These agents have been shown to induce both clinical and endoscopic remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Furthermore, they have been instrumental in diminishing exacerbations and reducing surgery rates.

Certolizumab is a pegylated monoclonal IgG antibody that targets TNF-α. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it in 2008 for both induction and maintenance of remission in moderately-to-severely active CD, including in patients who previously lost response to infliximab. It has been indicated that lower drug levels and the presence of anti-drug antibodies correlate with a loss of clinical and endoscopic response.

### Characterizing unmet medical need and the potential role of new biologic treatment options in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and clinician surveys [^115DHr7T]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Rate and timing of therapy failure**: When asked to estimate treatment failure based on their own experience, UK clinicians estimated that 18–26% of patients fail and discontinue therapy with a first-line anti-TNFα agent during the induction phase (primary failure) and that 22–26% lose response and discontinue that anti-TNFα agent over time, indicating a secondary failure of the first-line anti-TNFα agent. Estimates of treatment failure were even higher for second-line treatment with an anti-TNFα agent: 28–37% of patients fail and discontinue treatment during the induction phase, and 31–41% lose response and discontinue their second-line anti-TNFα agent treatment over time. Among patients who lost response, it was estimated that 68–77% discontinued treatment by the end of the first year, and 82–90% discontinued treatment by the end of the second year of treatment due to loss of response.

Treatment failure during anti-TNFα therapy was estimated by UK clinicians. Estimates of treatment failure are consistently lower for first-line biologic therapy compared with second-line biologic therapy in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), based on the experience of UK gastroenterologists.

### An open-labeled, randomized study comparing systemic interferon-alpha-2A and prednisolone enemas in the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis [^111gVxAo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the treatment efficacies of subcutaneous interferon-alpha-2A (IFN-alpha-2A) injections versus prednisolone enemas in active left-sided ulcerative colitis in an open-labeled, randomized study.

Sixteen ulcerative colitis patients received IFN-alpha-2A subcutaneously with the following dosage schedule: first week, 9 MIU three times weekly [t.i.w.]; second week, 6 MIU t.i.w.; weeks 3–12, 3 MIU t.i.w. Additionally, 16 patients received prednisolone enemas for 30 days at a concentration of 100 mL once daily (0.25 mg of prednisolone/ml). The Powell-Tuck Index, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score, and rectal histological activities were assessed before and after treatment. Thirteen patients in the IFN-alpha-2A group and all 16 in the prednisolone enema group completed the treatment.

IFN-alpha-2A treatment showed significant improvements in the Powell-Tuck Index (p = 0.0002), IBDQ score (p = 0.002), and rectal histological activity scores (p = 0.02). In the enema group, significant improvements were found in the Powell-Tuck Index (p = 0.0009), whereas no significant improvements were detected in the IBDQ scores (p = 0.055) or rectal histological scores (p = 0.052). There were no differences between scores of the two groups either before or after treatment. Only moderate side effects from the IFN-alpha-2A treatment were seen during the first 2–4 weeks of treatment.

IFN-alpha-2A treatment resulted in significant depression of the disease activity as reflected by the Powell-Tuck Index, IBDQ score, and histological disease activity scoring.

### New therapies for inflammatory bowel disease: From the bench to the bedside [^112nvFDv]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the chronic intestinal inflammation, a hallmark of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are complex. Components of the pathological response include the adaptive and innate immune systems, as well as the intestinal epithelium and endothelium. Advances in the understanding of the roles of each of these components have resulted in the development of multiple biological agents, representing alternatives for patients with refractory Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

This study systematically reviews the mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of new and emerging therapies currently in clinical trials and discusses future directions in the treatment of IBD.

### Pegasys [^11676Tvm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

The biological activity of Pegasys is derived from its recombinant human interferon α-2a moiety. Peginterferon α-2a binds to the human type 1 interferon receptor, leading to receptor dimerization. Receptor dimerization activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways, initially mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway. Given the diversity of cell types that respond to interferon α-2a and the multiplicity of potential intracellular responses to interferon receptor activation, peginterferon α-2a is expected to have pleiotropic biological effects in the body.

- **Activity against HCV**: In the stable HCV cell culture model system (HCV replicon), peginterferon α-2a inhibited HCV RNA replication with an EC50 value of 0.1–3 ng/mL. The combination of peginterferon α-2a and ribavirin was more effective at inhibiting HCV RNA replication than either agent alone.

- **Resistance**: Different HCV genotypes display considerable clinical variability in their response to peginterferon-α and ribavirin therapy. Viral genetic determinants associated with the variable response have not been definitively identified.

- **Cross-resistance**: Cross-resistance between interferon-α and ribavirin has not been observed.

- **Host factors affecting response**: Polymorphisms in the IL28B gene have been shown to impact the response to peginterferon α-2a. Determining the IL28B genotype should be considered.

### Current therapeutic recommendations: Infliximab for ulcerative colitis [^1157vaLV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Randomized, controlled studies have shown that infliximab, the chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody, is effective for the treatment of active and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Because infliximab is beneficial in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom other therapies have failed, it has been postulated that infliximab may also be helpful in patients with ulcerative colitis. Many investigators have studied the effectiveness of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, mainly in patients who are refractory to corticosteroids. Unfortunately, these studies have not yielded a conclusive answer to the efficacy of infliximab in inducing remission in patients with severe ulcerative colitis. However, some have reported excellent results and others less effective, with the overall data being inconclusive. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature on the use of infliximab in ulcerative colitis, as well as to provide insight into the possible mechanisms of why it may or may not work in these difficult-to-treat patients.

### Certolizumab pegol for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^113ZBvyd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, and immune response modulation is the main treatment strategy to induce remission in active CD. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-α) inhibitor which regulates impaired immune response.

- **Objectives**: The primary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CZP for the induction of remission in CD.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, the Cochrane IBD group specialized register, trial registers, and other sources from inception to 28 January 2019. Moreover, we contacted the pharmaceutical company that manufactures CZP.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing CZP with placebo or no treatment in active CD patients.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The main outcomes selected for GRADE analysis were clinical remission at week 8 (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] ≤ 150), clinical response at week 8 (CDAI reduction ≥ 100 or clinical remission), and serious adverse events. The Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method was applied for the statistical analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

- **Main results**: Four studies involving 1485 participants with moderate to severe CD met the inclusion criteria and were used in the meta-analyses. All studies included active CD patients with CDAI ranging from 220 to 450. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age.

### Viral hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease [^114g8yur]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis is common worldwide and in the United States. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) who have active disease, indicated by elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and viral replication, should receive HBV treatment. Reactivation of HBV is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing immunosuppression. IBD patients may require long-term immunosuppression; therefore, they should be considered candidates for vaccination against new HBV infection and prophylaxis against HBV reactivation before starting immunosuppressive therapy.

- **Compatibility of treatments**: Tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonists and immunomodulators appear compatible with use in IBD patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), although prednisone may increase viral replication. HCV treatment with peg-interferon and ribavirin may worsen gastrointestinal symptoms; thus, the decision to treat HCV should be individualized.

The management of IBD patients with viral hepatitis is thoroughly addressed in this review.

### Interferon beta-1a in ulcerative colitis: a placebo controlled, randomised, dose escalating study [^111ZDCXF]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Administration of interferon (IFN)-beta may represent a rational approach to the treatment of ulcerative colitis through its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of IFN-beta-1a.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 18) with moderately active ulcerative colitis were randomised to receive IFN-beta-1a or placebo. IFN-beta-1a was started at a dose of 22 μg three times a week subcutaneously, and the dose was increased at two-week intervals to 44 μg and then to 88 μg if no response was observed. The maximum duration of treatment was eight weeks. End points were clinical treatment response, defined as a decrease of at least 3 points from baseline in the ulcerative colitis scoring system (UCSS) symptoms score, and induction of endoscopically confirmed remission.

- **Results**: Baseline characteristics and disease severity were similar in both groups. Data from 17 patients are included in this report (10 patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and seven patients in the placebo group). Clinical response was achieved in five patients (50%) in the IFN-beta-1a group and in one (14%) in the placebo group (P = 0.14). Remission was achieved in three patients in the IFN-beta-1a group and in none in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Most adverse reactions associated with IFN-beta-1a were influenza-like symptoms or injection site reactions, and were mild or moderate in severity.

- **Conclusions**: IFN-beta-1a may represent a promising novel treatment approach in ulcerative colitis.

### Update on the role of upadacitinib in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [^115zh2Sm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The JAK-signal transduction and activation of transcription pathway and its role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were first described in 1992. This pathway has enhanced our understanding of intracellular signaling and its importance in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis, immunity, inflammation, growth, neural development, and metabolism.

The JAK-STAT pathway involves the transmission of signals from outside the cell to inside the cell, beginning with the engagement of transmembrane receptors and culminating in signal transduction and transcription at the nuclear level. Cytokines utilizing the JAK-STAT pathway can be classified based on the receptors they bind to. Type I and II cytokine receptors are dimeric structures composed of two or more different subunits dependent on Janus kinases (JAKs). These cytokines include, among others, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, interferons, and IL-10-related cytokines.

- **JAK family members**: There are four JAKs: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. These are tyrosine kinases that work in pairs and have the potential to phosphorylate cytokine receptors, other JAKs, or themselves, as well as cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. There are several combinations of JAKs associated with different cytokine receptors, which, in turn, modulate a variety of physiological processes.

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^115QMtFs]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The broad aim of the present study was to understand health outcomes in patients initiating advanced therapies, such as immunosuppressants and biologic therapies. Specifically, the objective was to assess the real-world effectiveness of these advanced therapies by evaluating several factors: the proportion of patients who remained steroid-free, the proportion of patients who were hospitalized, the number of hospitalizations, the total hospitalization length of stay, and the total UC-related costs in the 12 months following initiation.

### Single-cell and spatial multi-omics highlight effects of anti-integrin therapy across cellular compartments in ulcerative colitis [^115qWP6b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is driven by immune and stromal subsets, culminating in epithelial injury. Vedolizumab (VDZ) is an anti-integrin antibody that is effective for treating UC. VDZ is known to inhibit lymphocyte trafficking to the intestine, but its broader effects on other cell subsets are less defined. To identify the inflammatory cells that contribute to colitis and are affected by VDZ, we perform single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of peripheral blood and colonic biopsies in healthy controls and patients with UC on VDZ or other therapies. Here we show that VDZ treatment is associated with alterations in circulating and tissue mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) subsets, along with modest shifts in lymphocytes. Spatial multi-omics of formalin-fixed biopsies demonstrates trends towards increased abundance and proximity of MNP and fibroblast subsets in active colitis. Spatial transcriptomics of archived specimens pre-treatment identifies epithelial-, MNP-, and fibroblast-enriched genes related to VDZ responsiveness, highlighting important roles for these subsets in UC.

### Update on the role of upadacitinib in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [^1116ZP9L]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Evidence suggests that considering an extended induction up to 16 weeks, when needed, expands the proportion of patients who may benefit from UPA. Healthcare providers need to individualize the need and rationale of extended induction therapy based on the label and the patient in front of them. UPA 30 mg daily as maintenance therapy appears to be more effective than 15 mg OD across most endpoints, with a delta of anywhere between 8% and 13%. Over 52 weeks of maintenance, there appears to be no difference in toxicity between the doses. The 30 mg dose in maintenance should be particularly considered in patients with pancolitis, previous biologic failure, and EIMs. New evidence has shown the efficacy of UPA in Crohn's disease phase III trials, with no new safety signals, opening the door for further and more practical use of this highly effective drug.

### Mesalamine [^113mGAjT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two similar, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies were conducted in a total of 562 adult patients in remission from ulcerative colitis. The study populations had a mean age of 46 years (11% age 65 years or older), were 53% female, and were primarily white (92%).

Ulcerative colitis disease activity was assessed using a modified Sutherland Disease Activity Index (DAI), which is a sum of four subscores based on stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance on endoscopy, and physician's rating of disease activity. Each subscore can range from 0 to 3, for a total possible DAI score of 12.

At baseline, approximately 80% of patients had a total DAI score of 0 or 1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either mesalamine 1.5 g or a placebo once daily in the morning for six months. Patients were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the clinic, with endoscopy performed at baseline, at the end of the study, or if clinical symptoms developed. Relapse was defined as a rectal bleeding subscale score of 1 or more, and a mucosal appearance subscale score of 2 or more using the DAI. The analysis of the intent-to-treat population was a comparison of the proportions of patients who remained relapse-free at the end of six months of treatment. All patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason were counted as relapses.

In both studies, the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at six months was greater for mesalamine than for the placebo.

### Stelara [^1178zFp3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety of STELARA® was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (UC-1 [intravenous induction] and UC-2 [subcutaneous maintenance]) in 960 adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The overall safety profile of STELARA® in subjects with ulcerative colitis was consistent with the safety profile seen across all approved indications. Adverse reactions reported in at least 3% of STELARA®-treated subjects and at a higher rate than placebo were:

- **Induction (UC-1)**: nasopharyngitis (7% vs. 4%).

- **Maintenance (UC-2)**: nasopharyngitis (24% vs. 20%), headache (10% vs. 4%), abdominal pain (7% vs. 3%), influenza (6% vs. 5%), fever (5% vs. 4%), diarrhea (4% vs. 1%), sinusitis (4% vs. 1%), fatigue (4% vs. 2%), and nausea (3% vs. 2%).

- **Infections**: In subjects with ulcerative colitis, serious or other clinically significant infections included gastroenteritis and pneumonia. In addition, listeriosis and ophthalmic herpes zoster were reported in one subject each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Malignancies**: With up to one year of treatment in the ulcerative colitis clinical trials, 0.4% of STELARA®-treated subjects (0.48 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.0% of placebo-treated subjects (0.00 events per hundred patient-years) developed non-melanoma skin cancer. Malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 0.5% of STELARA®-treated subjects (0.64 events per hundred patient-years) and 0.2% of placebo-treated subjects (0.40 events per hundred patient-years).

### Biologic therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^116vBXTd]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Advancing knowledge regarding the biology of chronic inflammation has led to the development of specific biologic therapies that mechanistically target individual inflammatory pathways. Many biologic therapies are being evaluated for the treatment of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biologic compounds proven to be effective for Crohn's disease include monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (infliximab and CDP571) and to the leukocyte adhesion molecule alpha4 integrin (natalizumab).

- **Biologic compounds with insufficient evidence for efficacy**: These include p55 tumor necrosis factor binding protein (onercept), interferon alpha, interferon beta-1a, anti-interferon gamma antibody, anti-interleukin 12 antibody, p65 anti-sense oligonucleotide (blocks NF-kappaB), granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody, epidermal growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor 2 (repifermin), human growth hormone, anti-CD4 antibody, and anti-alpha4beta7 antibody.

- **Biologic therapies proven ineffective**: These include interleukin 10, interleukin 11, anti-sense intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and the tumor necrosis factor receptor fusion protein etanercept.

Based on the early successes of infliximab, CDP571, and natalizumab, it seems certain that biologic therapy will play an important role in the future treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Omvoh [^113tKDJ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Omvoh were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies: one induction study [UC-1 (NCT03518086)] and one maintenance study [UC-2 (NCT03524092)]. These studies included adult subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response, loss of response, or who failed to tolerate any of the following: corticosteroids, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, biologic therapy (TNF blocker, vedolizumab), or tofacitinib. The 12-week intravenous induction study (UC-1) was followed by the 40-week subcutaneous randomized withdrawal maintenance study (UC-2).

### Pegasys [^111U7VvS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

There is no information regarding the presence of peginterferon alfa-2a in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for adverse reactions from the drugs in nursing infants, a decision must be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue Pegasys. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Pegasys and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Pegasys or from the underlying maternal condition.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential transmission of HIV; therefore, CHC- and CHB-infected mothers coinfected with HIV should not breastfeed their infants.

- **Females and males of reproductive potential**:
	- **Pregnancy testing**: Females of reproductive potential must undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Pegasys, either alone or in combination with ribavirin or other HCV drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)]. During treatment and for at least 6 months post-therapy, females receiving Pegasys with ribavirin must have a routine pregnancy test performed monthly. Female partners of male patients undergoing Pegasys treatment with ribavirin must also follow the same routine pregnancy testing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), ribavirin prescribing information].

### Real-world effectiveness of advanced therapies among patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in the United States [^111v7yJ5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with UC frequently continue using steroids during the first year after initiating advanced therapies, and those initiating biologic therapies often require combination therapy with an immunosuppressant. A subset of patients also experience extended UC-related hospitalization stays. These results suggest that optimization of therapies and/or therapies with alternative mechanisms of action are needed to achieve steroid-free goals of treatment.

### Novel orally administered recombinant anti-TNF alpha fusion protein for the treatment of ulcerative colitis: Results from a phase 2a clinical trial [^116vE7ne]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

To determine the potential effects of orally administrated OPRX-106 on cytokine levels, serum levels of TNFα, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (p70) were assessed using highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, following the manufacturer's instructions. TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (p70) were quantified using Quantikine kits from R&D Systems with catalogue numbers HSTA00E, HS600B, and HS120, respectively. IFN-γ was quantified using a kit from eBioscience, catalog number BMS228HS. The analysis was conducted at American Medical Laboratories (AML) in Herzliya Pituach, Israel.

- **Efficacy and safety assessments**: Study endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploratory efficacy parameters. Clinical response at baseline versus week 8 was defined by a decrease in the Mayo score of at least 3 points, a decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding by at least 1 point, and achieving a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Clinical remission at week 8 was defined as clinically symptom-free, with a Mayo Score of ≤ 2 and no individual subscore exceeding 1 point after treatment. Other assessments involved histopathological improvement in Geboes histologic grading, improvement in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, and fecal calprotectin levels from baseline to week 8, along with changes in systemic immune modulation parameters. Mayo responsiveness and remission were affirmed by decreases in the total Mayo score and reductions in Geboes grading, CRP, and calprotectin levels.

### Tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking agents for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis [^111rtBzs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF-alpha agents have been shown to be effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease. The role of TNF-alpha blocking agents in ulcerative colitis is, however, unclear, and recent studies have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of TNF-alpha antibody for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis, and to determine adverse events associated with TNF-alpha antibody treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1984 to 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2004), and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register. We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication.

- **Selection criteria**: Only randomized controlled trials in which patients with active ulcerative colitis (defined by a combination of clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and histologic criteria) were randomly allocated to receive a TNF-alpha blocking agent in the treatment arm, and to receive placebo or another treatment in the comparison arm were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of each study were independently performed by two reviewers. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of remission as defined by the primary studies. Other endpoints were clinical, histological, or endoscopic improvement as defined by the primary studies; improvement in quality of life as measured by a validated quality of life tool, and the occurrence of adverse events.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^116cCHZN]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ulcerative colitis, specifically in the induction of remission for moderate-to-severe disease, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of higher efficacy medications, such as tofacitinib, upadacitinib, or ustekinumab. Alternatively, intermediate efficacy medications like filgotinib, mirikizumab, risankizumab, or guselkumab may be considered instead of lower efficacy options like adalimumab, vedolizumab, ozanimod, or etrasimod. This recommendation is for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe UC who have previously been exposed to at least one advanced therapy, particularly TNF antagonists.

### Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: the story continues [^113bXyxS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

The role of TNF in IBD: TNF is a 17 kDa soluble cytokine predominantly secreted by monocytes, exerting potent proinflammatory effects on various cell types. It plays an essential role in intestinal homeostasis and is involved in multiple physiological processes including the regulation of epithelial cell shedding during the renewal of the intestinal epithelium, maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, wound healing, and mucosal repair. Conversely, TNF is pivotal in developing and perpetuating IBD, as evidenced by the clinical benefits associated with TNF inhibition.

The role of TNF in the pathogenesis of IBD has been reviewed previously in detail. Briefly, both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, along with other proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18, are produced by various stromal and immune cells within the inflamed mucosa. Non-immune cells also produce proinflammatory cytokines. For example, members of the IL-1 cytokine family, including IL-18, are produced by intestinal epithelial cells, while TNF and IL-6 are produced by stromal fibroblasts. Through its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, TNF exerts pleiotropic proinflammatory effects including angiogenesis, induction of Paneth cell death, production of matrix metalloproteases, and activation of macrophages and effector T cells. Experiments in mice have demonstrated that membrane-bound, rather than soluble, TNF may play a significant role in intestinal inflammation.

### Critical roles of RGS16 in the mucosal inflammation of ulcerative colitis [^116Qc3et]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF treatment downregulates RGS16 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TNF-α is crucial for the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and anti-TNF treatment can ameliorate intestinal mucosal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis. Hence, we hypothesized that anti-TNF participates in the TNF-α-induced increase in RGS16 expression in ulcerative colitis patients. IFX, an anti-TNF agent, is often used to treat ulcerative colitis. Freshly inflamed colonic tissue from ulcerative colitis patients was obtained and treated with IFX for 24 h. The levels of RGS16 significantly reduced after IFX treatment compared to the control treatment. The same result was also observed in ulcerative colitis patient-isolated PBMCs treated with IFX for 24 h. Collectively, anti-TNF treatment downregulated RGS16 expression in inflamed intestinal tissues and PBMCs from patients with ulcerative colitis.

- **Anti-TNF treatment downregulated RGS16 expression**:
	- **A**: Freshly obtained inflamed colonic tissue from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 12) were treated with IFX (50 μg/mL) or control for 24 h, and RGS16 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR.
	- **B**: PBMCs isolated from UC patients (n = 16) were stimulated with IFX (50 ng/ml) for 24 h, and RGS16 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR. ✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01.

IFX refers to infliximab; PBMCs are peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RGS stands for regulator of the G-protein signaling.

### British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^1136RQf7]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

- **Choice of anti-TNF agent in Crohn's disease**: There is little to choose between adalimumab and infliximab in efficacy in luminal Crohn's disease, and practical considerations regarding the mode and frequency of administration are the main factors, as well as consideration of the relative need for combination therapy with an immunomodulator (see Section 5.2.4.1: Choice of anti-TNF agent). Certolizumab is not licensed for treatment of IBD in the UK and will not be discussed here.
